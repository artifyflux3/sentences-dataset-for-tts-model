Let G be a group and n a positive integer . A connected topological space X is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} , if it has n -th homotopy group π π n ( X ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(X)} isomorphic to G and all other homotopy groups trivial . Assuming that G is abelian in the case that n > 1 {\displaystyle n>1} , Eilenberg–MacLane spaces of type K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} always exist, and are all weak homotopy equivalent. Thus, one may consider K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} as referring to a weak homotopy equivalence class of spaces. It is common to refer to any representative as "a K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} " or as "a model of K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} ". Moreover, it is common to assume that this space is a CW-complex (which is always possible via CW approximation ).

The name is derived from Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane , who introduced such spaces in the late 1940s.

As such, an Eilenberg–MacLane space is a special kind of topological space that in homotopy theory can be regarded as a building block for CW-complexes via fibrations in a Postnikov system . These spaces are important in many contexts in algebraic topology , including computations of homotopy groups of spheres , definition of cohomology operations , and for having a strong connection to singular cohomology .

A generalised Eilenberg–MacLane space is a space which has the homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces ∏ ∏ m K ( G m , m ) {\displaystyle \prod _{m}K(G_{m},m)} .

Examples [ edit ] The unit circle S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} is a K ( Z , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,1)} .

The infinite-dimensional complex projective space C P ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{\infty }} is a model of K ( Z , 2 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)} .

The infinite-dimensional real projective space R P ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {RP} ^{\infty }} is a K ( Z / 2 , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} /2,1)} .

The wedge sum of k unit circles ⋁ ⋁ i = 1 k S 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle \bigvee _{i=1}^{k}S^{1}} is a K ( F k , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(F_{k},1)} , where F k {\displaystyle F_{k}} is the free group on k generators.

The complement to any connected knot or graph in a 3-dimensional sphere S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} is of type K ( G , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,1)} ; this is called the " asphericity of knots", and is a 1957 theorem of Christos Papakyriakopoulos .

[ 1 ] Any compact , connected, non-positively curved manifold M is a K ( Γ Γ , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\Gamma ,1)} , where Γ Γ = π π 1 ( M ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =\pi _{1}(M)} is the fundamental group of M . This is a consequence of the Cartan–Hadamard theorem .

An infinite lens space L ( ∞ ∞ , q ) {\displaystyle L(\infty ,q)} given by the quotient of S ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle S^{\infty }} by the free action ( z ↦ ↦ e 2 π π i m / q z ) {\displaystyle (z\mapsto e^{2\pi im/q}z)} for m ∈ ∈ Z / q {\displaystyle m\in \mathbb {Z} /q} is a K ( Z / q , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} /q,1)} . This can be shown using covering space theory and the fact that the infinite-dimensional sphere is contractible .

[ 2 ] Note this includes R P ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {RP} ^{\infty }} as a K ( Z / 2 , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} /2,1)} .

The configuration space of n {\displaystyle n} points in the plane is a K ( P n , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(P_{n},1)} , where P n {\displaystyle P_{n}} is the pure braid group on n {\displaystyle n} strands.

Correspondingly, the n th unordered configuration space of R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} is a K ( B n , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(B_{n},1)} , where B n {\displaystyle B_{n}} denotes the n -strand braid group .

[ 3 ] The infinite symmetric product S P ( S n ) {\displaystyle SP(S^{n})} of a n -sphere is a K ( Z , n ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,n)} . More generally S P ( M ( G , n ) ) {\displaystyle SP(M(G,n))} is a K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} for all Moore spaces M ( G , n ) {\displaystyle M(G,n)} .

Some further elementary examples can be constructed from these by using the fact that the product K ( G , n ) × × K ( H , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)\times K(H,n)} is K ( G × × H , n ) {\displaystyle K(G\times H,n)} . For instance the n -dimensional Torus T n {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} ^{n}} is a K ( Z n , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ^{n},1)} .

Constructing Eilenberg–MacLane spaces [ edit ] For n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} and G {\displaystyle G} an arbitrary group the construction of K ( G , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,1)} is identical to that of the classifying space of the group G {\displaystyle G} . Note that if G has a torsion element, then every CW-complex of type K(G,1) has to be infinite-dimensional.

There are multiple techniques for constructing higher Eilenberg–MacLane spaces. One of which is to construct a Moore space M ( A , n ) {\displaystyle M(A,n)} for an abelian group A {\displaystyle A} : Take the wedge of n - spheres , one for each generator of the group A and realise the relations between these generators by attaching (n+1) -cells via corresponding maps in π π n ( ⋁ ⋁ S n ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(\bigvee S^{n})} of said wedge sum. Note that the lower homotopy groups π π i < n ( M ( A , n ) ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i<n}(M(A,n))} are already trivial by construction. Now iteratively kill all higher homotopy groups π π i > n ( M ( A , n ) ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i>n}(M(A,n))} by successively attaching cells of dimension greater than n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} , and define K ( A , n ) {\displaystyle K(A,n)} as direct limit under inclusion of this iteration.

Another useful technique is to use the geometric realization of simplicial abelian groups .

[ 4 ] This gives an explicit presentation of simplicial abelian groups which represent Eilenberg–MacLane spaces.

Another simplicial construction, in terms of classifying spaces and universal bundles , is given in J. Peter May 's book.

[ 5 ] Since taking the loop space lowers the homotopy groups by one slot, we have a canonical homotopy equivalence K ( G , n ) ≃ ≃ Ω Ω K ( G , n + 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)\simeq \Omega K(G,n+1)} , hence there is a fibration sequence K ( G , n ) → → ∗ ∗ → → K ( G , n + 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)\to *\to K(G,n+1)} .

Note that this is not a cofibration sequence ― the space K ( G , n + 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,n+1)} is not the homotopy cofiber of K ( G , n ) → → ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle K(G,n)\to *} .

This fibration sequence can be used to study the cohomology of K ( G , n + 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,n+1)} from K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} using the Leray spectral sequence . This was exploited by Jean-Pierre Serre while he studied the homotopy groups of spheres using the Postnikov system and spectral sequences.

Properties of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces [ edit ] Bijection between homotopy classes of maps and cohomology [ edit ] An important property of K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} 's is that for any abelian group G , and any based CW-complex X , the set [ X , K ( G , n ) ] {\displaystyle [X,K(G,n)]} of based homotopy classes of based maps from X to K ( G , n ) {\displaystyle K(G,n)} is in natural bijection with the n -th singular cohomology group H n ( X , G ) {\displaystyle H^{n}(X,G)} of the space X . Thus one says that the K ( G , n ) s {\displaystyle K(G,n)s} are representing spaces for singular cohomology with coefficients in G . Since H n ( K ( G , n ) , G ) = Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( H n ( K ( G , n ) ; Z ) , G ) = Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( π π n ( K ( G , n ) ) , G ) = Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , G ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}H^{n}(K(G,n),G)&=&\operatorname {Hom} (H_{n}(K(G,n);\mathbb {Z} ),G)\\&=&\operatorname {Hom} (\pi _{n}(K(G,n)),G)\\&=&\operatorname {Hom} (G,G),\end{array}}} there is a distinguished element u ∈ ∈ H n ( K ( G , n ) , G ) {\displaystyle u\in H^{n}(K(G,n),G)} corresponding to the identity. The above bijection is given by the pullback of that element f ↦ ↦ f ∗ ∗ u {\displaystyle f\mapsto f^{*}u} . This is similar to the Yoneda lemma of category theory .

A constructive proof of this theorem can be found here, [ 6 ] another making use of the relation between omega-spectra and generalized reduced cohomology theories can be found here, [ 7 ] and the main idea is sketched later as well.

Loop spaces and Omega spectra [ edit ] The loop space of an Eilenberg–MacLane space is again an Eilenberg–MacLane space: Ω Ω K ( G , n ) ≅ ≅ K ( G , n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \Omega K(G,n)\cong K(G,n-1)} . Further there is an adjoint relation between the loop-space and the reduced suspension: [ Σ Σ X , Y ] = [ X , Ω Ω Y ] {\displaystyle [\Sigma X,Y]=[X,\Omega Y]} , which gives [ X , K ( G , n ) ] ≅ ≅ [ X , Ω Ω 2 K ( G , n + 2 ) ] {\displaystyle [X,K(G,n)]\cong [X,\Omega ^{2}K(G,n+2)]} the structure of an abelian group, where the operation is the concatenation of loops. This makes the bijection [ X , K ( G , n ) ] → → H n ( X , G ) {\displaystyle [X,K(G,n)]\to H^{n}(X,G)} mentioned above a group isomorphism.

Also this property implies that Eilenberg–MacLane spaces with various n form an omega-spectrum , called an "Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum". This spectrum defines via X ↦ ↦ h n ( X ) := [ X , K ( G , n ) ] {\displaystyle X\mapsto h^{n}(X):=[X,K(G,n)]} a reduced cohomology theory on based CW-complexes and for any reduced cohomology theory h ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle h^{*}} on CW-complexes with h n ( S 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle h^{n}(S^{0})=0} for n ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle n\neq 0} there is a natural isomorphism h n ( X ) ≅ ≅ H ~ ~ n ( X , h 0 ( S 0 ) ) {\displaystyle h^{n}(X)\cong {\tilde {H}}^{n}(X,h^{0}(S^{0}))} , where H ∗ ∗ ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {H^{*}}}} denotes reduced singular cohomology. Therefore these two cohomology theories coincide.

In a more general context, Brown representability says that every reduced cohomology theory on based CW-complexes comes from an omega-spectrum .

Relation with homology [ edit ] For a fixed abelian group G {\displaystyle G} there are maps on the stable homotopy groups π π q + n s ( X ∧ ∧ K ( G , n ) ) ≅ ≅ π π q + n + 1 s ( X ∧ ∧ Σ Σ K ( G , n ) ) → → π π q + n + 1 s ( X ∧ ∧ K ( G , n + 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \pi _{q+n}^{s}(X\wedge K(G,n))\cong \pi _{q+n+1}^{s}(X\wedge \Sigma K(G,n))\to \pi _{q+n+1}^{s}(X\wedge K(G,n+1))} induced by the map Σ Σ K ( G , n ) → → K ( G , n + 1 ) {\displaystyle \Sigma K(G,n)\to K(G,n+1)} . Taking the direct limit over these maps, one can verify that this defines a reduced homology theory h q ( X ) = lim → → n ⁡ ⁡ π π q + n s ( X ∧ ∧ K ( G , n ) ) {\displaystyle h_{q}(X)=\varinjlim _{n}\pi _{q+n}^{s}(X\wedge K(G,n))} on CW complexes. Since h q ( S 0 ) = lim → → ⁡ ⁡ π π q + n s ( K ( G , n ) ) {\displaystyle h_{q}(S^{0})=\varinjlim \pi _{q+n}^{s}(K(G,n))} vanishes for q ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle q\neq 0} , h ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle h_{*}} agrees with reduced singular homology H ~ ~ ∗ ∗ ( ⋅ ⋅ , G ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {H}}_{*}(\cdot ,G)} with coefficients in G on CW-complexes.

Functoriality [ edit ] It follows from the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology that the Eilenberg MacLane space is a quasi-functor of the group; that is, for each positive integer n {\displaystyle n} if a : : G → → G ′ {\displaystyle a\colon G\to G'} is any homomorphism of abelian groups, then there is a non-empty set K ( a , n ) = { [ f ] : f : : K ( G , n ) → → K ( G ′ , n ) , H n ( f ) = a } , {\displaystyle K(a,n)=\{[f]:f\colon K(G,n)\to K(G',n),H_{n}(f)=a\},} satisfying K ( a ∘ ∘ b , n ) ⊃ ⊃ K ( a , n ) ∘ ∘ K ( b , n ) and 1 ∈ ∈ K ( 1 , n ) , {\displaystyle K(a\circ b,n)\supset K(a,n)\circ K(b,n){\text{ and }}1\in K(1,n),} where [ f ] {\displaystyle [f]} denotes the homotopy class of a continuous map f {\displaystyle f} and S ∘ ∘ T := { s ∘ ∘ t : s ∈ ∈ S , t ∈ ∈ T } .

{\displaystyle S\circ T:=\{s\circ t:s\in S,t\in T\}.} Relation with Postnikov/Whitehead towers [ edit ] Every connected CW-complex X {\displaystyle X} possesses a Postnikov tower , that is an inverse system of spaces: ⋯ ⋯ → → X 3 → p 3 X 2 → p 2 X 1 ≃ ≃ K ( π π 1 ( X ) , 1 ) {\displaystyle \cdots \to X_{3}\xrightarrow {p_{3}} X_{2}\xrightarrow {p_{2}} X_{1}\simeq K(\pi _{1}(X),1)} such that for every n {\displaystyle n} : there are commuting maps X → → X n {\displaystyle X\to X_{n}} , which induce isomorphism on π π i {\displaystyle \pi _{i}} for i ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle i\leq n} , π π i ( X n ) = 0 {\displaystyle \pi _{i}(X_{n})=0} for i > n {\displaystyle i>n} , the maps X n → p n X n − − 1 {\displaystyle X_{n}\xrightarrow {p_{n}} X_{n-1}} are fibrations with fiber K ( π π n ( X ) , n ) {\displaystyle K(\pi _{n}(X),n)} .

Dually there exists a Whitehead tower , which is a sequence of CW-complexes: ⋯ ⋯ → → X 3 → → X 2 → → X 1 → → X {\displaystyle \cdots \to X_{3}\to X_{2}\to X_{1}\to X} such that for every n {\displaystyle n} : the maps X n → → X {\displaystyle X_{n}\to X} induce isomorphism on π π i {\displaystyle \pi _{i}} for i > n {\displaystyle i>n} , X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} is n-connected , the maps X n → → X n − − 1 {\displaystyle X_{n}\to X_{n-1}} are fibrations with fiber K ( π π n ( X ) , n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\pi _{n}(X),n-1)} .

With help of Serre spectral sequences computations of higher homotopy groups of spheres can be made. For instance π π 4 ( S 3 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{4}(S^{3})} and π π 5 ( S 3 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{5}(S^{3})} using a Whitehead tower of S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} can be found here, [ 8 ] more generally those of π π n + i ( S n ) i ≤ ≤ 3 {\displaystyle \pi _{n+i}(S^{n})\ i\leq 3} using a Postnikov systems can be found here.

[ 9 ] Cohomology operations [ edit ] For fixed natural numbers m,n and abelian groups G,H exists a bijection between the set of all cohomology operations Θ Θ : H m ( ⋅ ⋅ , G ) → → H n ( ⋅ ⋅ , H ) {\displaystyle \Theta :H^{m}(\cdot ,G)\to H^{n}(\cdot ,H)} and H n ( K ( G , m ) , H ) {\displaystyle H^{n}(K(G,m),H)} defined by Θ Θ ↦ ↦ Θ Θ ( α α ) {\displaystyle \Theta \mapsto \Theta (\alpha )} , where α α ∈ ∈ H m ( K ( G , m ) , G ) {\displaystyle \alpha \in H^{m}(K(G,m),G)} is a fundamental class .

As a result, cohomology operations cannot decrease the degree of the cohomology groups and degree preserving cohomology operations are corresponding
to coefficient homomorphism Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , H ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (G,H)} . This follows from the Universal coefficient theorem for cohomology and the (m-1)-connectedness of K ( G , m ) {\displaystyle K(G,m)} .

Some interesting examples for cohomology operations are Steenrod Squares and Powers , when G = H {\displaystyle G=H} are finite cyclic groups . When studying those the importance of the cohomology of K ( Z / p , n ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} /p,n)} with coefficients in Z / p {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /p} becomes apparent quickly; [ 10 ] some extensive tabeles of those groups can be found here.

[ 11 ] Group (co)homology [ edit ] One can define the group (co)homology of G with coefficients in the group A as the singular (co)homology of the Eilenberg–MacLane space K ( G , 1 ) {\displaystyle K(G,1)} with coefficients in A.

Further applications [ edit ] The loop space construction described above is used in string theory to obtain, for example, the string group , the fivebrane group and so on, as the Whitehead tower arising from the short exact sequence 0 → → K ( Z , 2 ) → → String ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) → → Spin ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) → → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)\to \operatorname {String} (n)\to \operatorname {Spin} (n)\to 0} with String ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {String} (n)} the string group , and Spin ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spin} (n)} the spin group . The relevance of K ( Z , 2 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)} lies in the fact that there are the homotopy equivalences K ( Z , 1 ) ≃ ≃ U ( 1 ) ≃ ≃ B Z {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,1)\simeq U(1)\simeq B\mathbb {Z} } for the classifying space B Z {\displaystyle B\mathbb {Z} } , and the fact K ( Z , 2 ) ≃ ≃ B U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)\simeq BU(1)} . Notice that because the complex spin group is a group extension 0 → → K ( Z , 1 ) → → Spin C ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) → → Spin ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) → → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to K(\mathbb {Z} ,1)\to \operatorname {Spin} ^{\mathbb {C} }(n)\to \operatorname {Spin} (n)\to 0} , the String group can be thought of as a "higher" complex spin group extension, in the sense of higher group theory since the space K ( Z , 2 ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,2)} is an example of a higher group. It can be thought of the topological realization of the groupoid B U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} U(1)} whose object is a single point and whose morphisms are the group U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle U(1)} . Because of these homotopical properties, the construction generalizes: any given space K ( Z , n ) {\displaystyle K(\mathbb {Z} ,n)} can be used to start a short exact sequence that kills the homotopy group π π n + 1 {\displaystyle \pi _{n+1}} in a topological group .

(See e.g.

MR 0013312 ) In this context it is therefore conventional to write the name without a space.
