[ 1 ] The school blended elements of Pythagorean , Platonic , Cynic , and Stoic philosophy together [ 2 ] with a belief in an elusive incorporeal power pervades the body in order to emphasize asceticism, honesty, and moral training through nightly examinations of conscience as a means of achieving eudaimonia .

[ 3 ] The primary sources of information on the school are Seneca the Younger , who was taught by one of its members named Sotion , and the 5th century writer Claudianus Mamertus .

[ 3 ] Other members of the school included Papirius Fabianus , Crassicius Pasicles , Celsus .

[ 3 ] While Seneca the Younger often conflates the school with Stoicism, the Sextians were not as inclined to rigorous logical exercises or any abstruse abstract thinking, and unlike the Stoics , advocated avoidance of politics , engaging in the correspondence between words and life, and vegetarianism.
