"[C]ountries will act only if they know others are willing to do the same. With acid rain , they did act collectively.... We did something similar to restore Earth's protective ozone layer .... [T]he cost of technology really matters.... In the past decade the price of solar energy has fallen by more than 90 percent and that of wind energy by more than 70 percent.

Battery costs have tumbled by 98 percent since 1990, bringing the price of electric cars down with them....[T]he stance of elected officials matters more than their party affiliation.... Change can happen – but not on its own. We need to drive it." (p. 76.) References [ edit ] ^ Fox, Kilian (2 January 2024).
