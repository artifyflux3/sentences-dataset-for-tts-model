In fact, in a vacuum, spacetime will always be locally flat (or de Sitter or anti-de Sitter depending upon the cosmological constant ). This makes (2+1)-dimensional topological gravity (2+1D topological gravity) a topological theory with no gravitational local degrees of freedom.

Physicists became interested in the relation between Chern–Simons theory and gravity during the 1980s.

[ 1 ] During this period, Edward Witten [ 2 ] argued that 2+1D topological gravity is equivalent to a Chern–Simons theory with the gauge group S O ( 2 , 2 ) {\displaystyle SO(2,2)} for a negative cosmological constant, and S O ( 3 , 1 ) {\displaystyle SO(3,1)} for a positive one. This theory can be exactly solved , making it a toy model for quantum gravity . The Killing form involves the Hodge dual .

Witten later changed his mind, [ 3 ] and argued that nonperturbatively 2+1D topological gravity differs from Chern–Simons because the functional measure is only over nonsingular vielbeins . He suggested the CFT dual is a monster conformal field theory , and computed the entropy of BTZ black holes .
