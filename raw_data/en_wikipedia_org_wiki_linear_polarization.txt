( May 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Diagram of the electric field of a light wave (blue), linear-polarized along a plane (purple line), and consisting of two orthogonal, in-phase components (red and green waves) In electrodynamics , linear polarization or plane polarization of electromagnetic radiation is a confinement of the electric field vector or magnetic field vector to a given plane along the direction of propagation. The term linear polarization (French: polarisation rectiligne ) was coined by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1822.

[ 1 ] See polarization and plane of polarization for more information.

The orientation of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is defined by the direction of the electric field vector.

[ 2 ] For example, if the electric field vector is vertical (alternately up and down as the wave travels) the radiation is said to be vertically polarized.

Mathematical description [ edit ] The classical sinusoidal plane wave solution of the electromagnetic wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields is (cgs units) E ( r , t ) = | E | R e { | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ exp ⁡ ⁡ [ i ( k z − − ω ω t ) ] } {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=|\mathbf {E} |\mathrm {Re} \left\{|\psi \rangle \exp \left[i\left(kz-\omega t\right)\right]\right\}} B ( r , t ) = z ^ ^ × × E ( r , t ) / c {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,t)={\hat {\mathbf {z} }}\times \mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} ,t)/c} for the magnetic field, where k is the wavenumber , ω ω = c k {\displaystyle \omega _{}^{}=ck} is the angular frequency of the wave, and c {\displaystyle c} is the speed of light .

Here ∣ ∣ E ∣ ∣ {\displaystyle \mid \mathbf {E} \mid } is the amplitude of the field and | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = d e f ( ψ ψ x ψ ψ y ) = ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i α α x ) sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i α α y ) ) {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ {\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{x}\\\psi _{y}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta \exp \left(i\alpha _{x}\right)\\\sin \theta \exp \left(i\alpha _{y}\right)\end{pmatrix}}} is the Jones vector in the x-y plane.

The wave is linearly polarized when the phase angles α α x , α α y {\displaystyle \alpha _{x}^{},\alpha _{y}} are equal, α α x = α α y = d e f α α {\displaystyle \alpha _{x}=\alpha _{y}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ \alpha } .

This represents a wave polarized at an angle θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } with respect to the x axis. In that case, the Jones vector can be written | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i α α ) {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta \\\sin \theta \end{pmatrix}}\exp \left(i\alpha \right)} .

The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.

If unit vectors are defined such that | x ⟩ ⟩ = d e f ( 1 0 ) {\displaystyle |x\rangle \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}}} and | y ⟩ ⟩ = d e f ( 0 1 ) {\displaystyle |y\rangle \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ {\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}}} then the polarization state can be written in the "x-y basis" as | ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i α α ) | x ⟩ ⟩ + sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( i α α ) | y ⟩ ⟩ = ψ ψ x | x ⟩ ⟩ + ψ ψ y | y ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =\cos \theta \exp \left(i\alpha \right)|x\rangle +\sin \theta \exp \left(i\alpha \right)|y\rangle =\psi _{x}|x\rangle +\psi _{y}|y\rangle } .
