614340895 Links Journal homepage Online access Online archive Nature Communications is a peer-reviewed , open access , scientific journal published by Nature Portfolio since 2010. It is a multidisciplinary journal that covers the natural sciences , including physics , chemistry , earth sciences , medicine , and biology . The journal has editorial offices in London, Berlin, New York City, and Shanghai.

The founding editor-in-chief was Lesley Anson, [ 1 ] followed by Joerg Heber , [ 2 ] Magdalena Skipper , and Elisa De Ranieri .

[ 3 ] As of 2022, [update] the editors are Nathalie Le Bot for health and clinical sciences, Stephane Larochelle for biological sciences, Enda Bergin for chemistry and biotechnology, and Prabhjot Saini for physics and earth sciences.

[ 4 ] Starting October 2014, the journal only accepted submissions from authors willing to pay an article processing charge . Until the end of 2015, part of the published submissions were only available to subscribers. In January 2016, all content became freely accessible.

[ 5 ] Starting from 2017, the journal offers a deposition service to authors for preprints of articles "under consideration" as part of the submission process.

[ 6 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in: Science Citation Index Expanded [ 7 ] Current Contents /Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences [ 7 ] Current Contents/Life Sciences [ 7 ] Current Contents/Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences [ 7 ] The Zoological Record [ 7 ] BIOSIS Previews [ 7 ] Chemical Abstracts Service [ 8 ] Index Medicus / MEDLINE / PubMed [ 9 ] Scopus [ 10 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2024 impact factor of 15.7.

[ 11 ] Subjournals [ edit ] In 2017, the creation of three "subjournals" under the Communications brand was announced: Communications Biology , [ 12 ] Communications Chemistry , [ 13 ] and Communications Physics .

[ 14 ] In the following years several additional Communications journals were established: Communications Materials in 2020, [ 15 ] Communications Earth & Environment in 2020, [ 16 ] Communications Medicine in 2021, [ 17 ] , Communications Engineering in 2022 [ 18 ] and Communications Psychology in 2022.

[ 19 ] These open-access journals offer a lower publication fee than Nature Communications , reflecting their more specialist remits.

[ 20 ] Manuscripts rejected by Nature Publishing Group journals can choose to transfer the manuscript together with reviewers' reports to the Communications -branded journals via an automated transfer service.

[ 21 ] Alternatively, authors may choose to request a fresh review.
