It generalizes the notion of "speed" or "absolute velocity" to spaces which have a notion of distance (i.e. metric spaces) but not direction (such as vector spaces ).

Definition [ edit ] Let ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} be a metric space. Let E ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle E\subseteq \mathbb {R} } have a limit point at t ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} } . Let γ γ : E → → M {\displaystyle \gamma :E\to M} be a path. Then the metric derivative of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } at t {\displaystyle t} , denoted | γ γ ′ | ( t ) {\displaystyle |\gamma '|(t)} , is defined by | γ γ ′ | ( t ) := lim s → → 0 d ( γ γ ( t + s ) , γ γ ( t ) ) | s | , {\displaystyle |\gamma '|(t):=\lim _{s\to 0}{\frac {d(\gamma (t+s),\gamma (t))}{|s|}},} if this limit exists.

Properties [ edit ] Recall that AC p ( I ; X ) is the space of curves γ : I → X such that d ( γ γ ( s ) , γ γ ( t ) ) ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ s t m ( τ τ ) d τ τ for all [ s , t ] ⊆ ⊆ I {\displaystyle d\left(\gamma (s),\gamma (t)\right)\leq \int _{s}^{t}m(\tau )\,\mathrm {d} \tau {\mbox{ for all }}[s,t]\subseteq I} for some m in the L p space L p ( I ; R ). For γ ∈ AC p ( I ; X ), the metric derivative of γ exists for Lebesgue - almost all times in I , and the metric derivative is the smallest m ∈ L p ( I ; R ) such that the above inequality holds.

If Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is equipped with its usual Euclidean norm ‖ ‖ − − ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|-\|} , and γ γ ˙ ˙ : E → → V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}:E\to V^{*}} is the usual Fréchet derivative with respect to time, then | γ γ ′ | ( t ) = ‖ ‖ γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ‖ ‖ , {\displaystyle |\gamma '|(t)=\|{\dot {\gamma }}(t)\|,} where d ( x , y ) := ‖ ‖ x − − y ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle d(x,y):=\|x-y\|} is the Euclidean metric.
