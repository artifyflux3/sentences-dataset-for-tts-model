The trademark symbol ™ is a symbol to indicate that the preceding mark is a trademark , specifically an unregistered trademark . It complements the registered trademark symbol ® which is reserved for trademarks registered with an appropriate government agency.

[ 1 ] In Canada, an equivalent marque de commerce symbol, ( U+1F16A 🅪 RAISED MC SIGN ) is used in French.

[ 2 ] Canada also has an official mark symbol, ⟨Ⓜ⟩ , to indicate that a name or design used by Canadian public authorities is protected.

[ 3 ] Some German publications, especially dictionaries, also use a Warenzeichen grapheme, ( U+1F12E 🄮 CIRCLED WZ ), which is informative and independent of the actual protection status of the name.

[ 4 ] Use [ edit ] Use of the trademark symbol indicates an assertion that a word, image, or other sign is a trademark; it does not indicate registration or impart enhanced protections. Registered trademarks are indicated using the registered trademark symbol , ® , and in many jurisdictions it is unlawful or illegal to use the registered trademark symbol with a mark that has not been registered.

[ 5 ] The service mark symbol , ℠ , is used to indicate the assertion of a service mark (a trademark for the provision of services). The service mark symbol is less commonly used than the trademark sign, especially outside the United States.

On social media , the trademark symbol has seen use in an ironic fashion, highlighting a concept as if it were important enough to warrant its own trademark, for example, "Official Bisexual Haircut™".

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] This is a non-standard usage of the symbol, which confers no special legal rights.

Non-standard substitutions [ edit ] The letters ⟨T⟩ and ⟨M⟩ are sometimes seen paired in an attempt to emulate the trademark symbol. Methods include (TM) , the letters in normal form, enclosed in parentheses TM , the letters written in small caps , on the baseline TM , the letters written as superscripts , as in mathematical exponentiation ᵀᴹ , using symbols from the Phonetic Extensions block in Unicode See also [ edit ] Look up ™ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
