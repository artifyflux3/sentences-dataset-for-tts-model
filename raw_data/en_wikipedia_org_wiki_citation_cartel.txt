In many cases the cited works have no strong relevance to the works they are cited in.

Alleged citation cartels have been found in numerous academic fields, [ 1 ] including mathematics, [ 2 ] medicine and dentistry.

[ 3 ] Possible citation cartels can be detected by network analysis of the citation graph .
