It was developed and promulgated jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It serves as a style guide for using physical quantities and units of measurement , formulas involving them, and their corresponding units, in scientific and educational documents for worldwide use. The ISO/IEC 80000 family of standards was completed with the publication of the first edition of Part 1 in November 2009.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] By 2021, ISO/IEC 80000 comprised 13 parts, two of which (parts 6 and 13) were developed by IEC and the remaining 11 were developed by ISO, with a further three parts (15, 16 and, 17) under development. Part 14 was withdrawn.

International System of Quantities [ edit ] Main article: International System of Quantities Part 1 of ISO 80000 introduces the International System of Quantities and describes its relationship with the International System of Units (SI). Specifically, its introduction states "The system of quantities, including the relations among the quantities used as the basis of the units of the SI, is named the International System of Quantities , denoted 'ISQ', in all languages." It further clarifies that "ISQ is simply a convenient notation to assign to the essentially infinite and continually evolving and expanding system of quantities and equations on which all of modern science and technology rests. ISQ is a shorthand notation for the 'system of quantities on which the SI is based'." Units of the ISO and IEC 80000 series [ edit ] The standard includes all SI units but is not limited to only SI units. Units that form part of the standard but not the SI include the units of information storage ( bit and byte ), units of entropy ( shannon , natural unit of information and hartley ), and the erlang (a unit of traffic intensity).
