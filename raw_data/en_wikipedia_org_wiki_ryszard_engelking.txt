He was working mainly on general topology [ 1 ] and dimension theory . He is the author of several influential monographs in this field. The 1989 edition of his General Topology is nowadays a standard reference for topology .

[ 2 ] Engelking died on 16 November 2023, his 88th birthday.

[ 3 ] Scientific work [ edit ] Apart from his books, Ryszard Engelking is known, among other things, for a generalization to an arbitrary topological space of the "Alexandroff double circle", [ 4 ] [ 5 ] for works on completely metrizable spaces , suborderable spaces and generalized ordered spaces .

[ 6 ] The Engelking–Karlowicz theorem , proved together with Monica Karlowicz, is a statement about the existence of a family of functions from 2 μ μ {\displaystyle 2^{\mu }} to μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } with topological [ 7 ] and set-theoretical [ 8 ] applications.
