Toy for teething babies to chew on Sophie the Giraffe , a popular teether A teether , teething toy , or chew toy is a device given to teething infants. It has the effect of reducing the pain of irritable wisdom teeth .

[ 1 ] Most modern teethers are silicone, but can also be made of wood or rubber. Some teethers are filled with a fluid or gel that can be frozen or refrigerated . They differ from pacifiers in that they are intended to be chewed, rather than sucked on.

[ 2 ] They come in a variety of different shapes. Teethers may help relieve teething pain and help new teeth penetrate the gum, as well as provide a form of entertainment.

[ 3 ] Studies found that chewing a teether may make teething children calmer and happier, less stressed, and less cranky.

[ 4 ] Teething necklaces and teething bracelets may pose a choking hazard to infants and toddlers depending on the teething parts, and have prompted recalls.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Teethers filled with liquid have also been recalled because of bacterial contamination.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Early teethers were often teething rings .
