[ citation needed ] Appearances in media [ edit ] Hough received widespread media coverage in 2004 when he placed a bet , against the odds , of detecting gravitational waves before 2010. The original odds were set at 500/1 , but following huge interest, the betting company were forced to cut their odds to 6/1 .

[ 23 ] In April 2007, during the run-up to the Scottish Parliamentary elections, Hough signed an open letter , along with sixty-one other top Scottish scientists, backing the retention of the Union between Scotland and England.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] They were concerned that Scottish independence would have "detrimental consequences for the health of the Scottish science base and for the long term viability of the Scottish economy and society." References [ edit ] ^ Rowan, Sheila (1995).
