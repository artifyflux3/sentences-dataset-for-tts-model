[ 1 ] Properties of the trivial measure [ edit ] Let μ denote the trivial measure on some measurable space ( X , Σ).

A measure ν is the trivial measure μ if and only if ν ( X ) = 0.

μ is an invariant measure (and hence a quasi-invariant measure ) for any measurable function f : X → X .

Suppose that X is a topological space and that Σ is the Borel σ -algebra on X .

μ trivially satisfies the condition to be a regular measure .

μ is never a strictly positive measure , regardless of ( X , Σ), since every measurable set has zero measure.

Since μ ( X ) = 0, μ is always a finite measure, and hence a locally finite measure .

If X is a Hausdorff topological space with its Borel σ -algebra, then μ trivially satisfies the condition to be a tight measure . Hence, μ is also a Radon measure . In fact, it is the vertex of the pointed cone of all non-negative Radon measures on X .

If X is an infinite - dimensional Banach space with its Borel σ -algebra, then μ is the only measure on ( X , Σ) that is locally finite and invariant under all translations of X . See the article There is no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure .

If X is n -dimensional Euclidean space R n with its usual σ -algebra and n -dimensional Lebesgue measure λ n , μ is a singular measure with respect to λ n : simply decompose R n as A = R n \ {0} and B = {0} and observe that μ ( A ) = λ n ( B ) = 0.
