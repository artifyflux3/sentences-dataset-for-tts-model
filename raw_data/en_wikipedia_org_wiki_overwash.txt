'Overwash' may refer only to the landward flux of water due to overtopping of a dune system while 'washover' may refer to the sediment deposited by overwash.

[ 1 ] A common process on barrier islands , Overwash redistributes sediment and facilitates the migration of barrier islands in response to sea level rise .

[ 2 ] Overwash can occur as a result of runup (the maximum height of the swash ), or inundation .

[ 3 ] Deposition from overwash (washover) can be deposited onto the beach berm, the dune , or as far as the back barrier bay , marsh , estuary , or lagoon . Sediment deposits created during overwash exhibit consistent scaling — for example, the distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is proportional to the area that the overwash deposit covers.

[ 4 ] The distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is also correlated with the volume of sand deposited.

[ 5 ] The amount of overwash and washover sedimentation also depends on the characteristics of the storm and the setting — coastal development tends to reduce the amount of sand deposited on a barrier island during overwash, with consequences for barrier island evolution.

[ 5 ] The stratigraphic layers of sediment in an overwash deposit can be used to estimate the duration of the storm that caused the deposition.

[ 6 ] In paleotempestology , overwash deposits are frequently used to reconstruct prehistoric tropical cyclones .

[ 7 ] Sediment deposited via overwash can also impact the rate of growth of salt marsh plants — a small amount of sand deposited can increase salt marsh plant growth, but too much deposited sand will kill vegetation.

[ 8 ] During large storms, overwash deposits can self-organize into a periodic, rhythmic pattern, where overwash deposits occur at a regular spacing along the shoreline.
