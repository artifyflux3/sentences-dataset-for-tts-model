"Combinatorial geometry" redirects here. The term combinatorial geometry is also used in the theory of [matroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid "Matroid") to refer to a [simple matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_matroid "Simple matroid"), especially in older texts.

A collection of [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") and the corresponding [unit disk graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disk_graph "Unit disk graph")

**Discrete geometry** and **combinatorial geometry** are branches of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") that study [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") properties and constructive methods of [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics") geometric objects. Most questions in discrete geometry involve [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") or [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_space "Discrete space")[sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of basic geometric objects, such as [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"), [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), and so forth. The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.

Discrete geometry has a large overlap with [convex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_geometry "Convex geometry") and [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry"), and is closely related to subjects such as [finite geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry"), [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization "Combinatorial optimization"), [digital geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_geometry "Digital geometry"), [discrete differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_differential_geometry "Discrete differential geometry"), [geometric graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_graph_theory "Geometric graph theory"), [toric geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_geometry "Toric geometry"), and [combinatorial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_topology "Combinatorial topology").

[Polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedra "Polyhedra") and [tessellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") had been studied for many years by people such as [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") and [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy "Augustin-Louis Cauchy"), modern discrete geometry has its origins in the late 19th century. Early topics studied were: the density of [circle packings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing "Circle packing") by [Thue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Thue "Axel Thue"), [projective configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_configuration "Projective configuration") by Reye and [Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Steinitz "Ernst Steinitz"), the [geometry of numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_numbers "Geometry of numbers") by Minkowski, and [map colourings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_colour_theorem "Four colour theorem") by Tait, Heawood, and [Hadwiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger "Hadwiger").

[László Fejes Tóth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Fejes_T%C3%B3th "László Fejes Tóth"), [H.S.M. Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter "Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter"), and [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s "Paul Erdős") laid the foundations of _discrete geometry_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-Intuitive-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-DiscreteGeom1-3)

### Polyhedra and polytopes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Polyhedra and polytopes")]

A **polytope** is a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") is a polytope in two dimensions, a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") in three dimensions, and so on in higher dimensions (such as a [4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-polytope "4-polytope") in four dimensions). Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded polytopes ([apeirotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeirotope "Apeirotope") and [tessellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation")), and [abstract polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope "Abstract polytope").

The following are some of the aspects of polytopes studied in discrete geometry:

*   [Polyhedral combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_combinatorics "Polyhedral combinatorics")
*   [Lattice polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_lattice_polytope "Convex lattice polytope")
*   [Ehrhart polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrhart_polynomial "Ehrhart polynomial")
*   [Pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem "Pick's theorem")
*   [Hirsch conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_conjecture "Hirsch conjecture")
*   [Opaque set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_set "Opaque set")

### Packings, coverings and tilings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Packings, coverings and tilings")]

Packings, coverings, and tilings are all ways of arranging uniform objects (typically circles, spheres, or tiles) in a regular way on a surface or [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold").

A **sphere packing** is an arrangement of non-overlapping [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). However, sphere [packing problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_problem "Packing problem") can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, _n_-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes [circle packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing "Circle packing") in two dimensions, or [hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere") packing in higher dimensions) or to [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") spaces such as [hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space").

A **tessellation** of a flat surface is the tiling of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.

Specific topics in this area include:

*   [Circle packings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing "Circle packing")
*   [Sphere packings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing "Sphere packing")
*   [Kepler conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture "Kepler conjecture")
*   [Quasicrystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal "Quasicrystal")
*   [Aperiodic tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling "Aperiodic tiling")
*   [Periodic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_graph_(geometry) "Periodic graph (geometry)")
*   [Finite subdivision rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_subdivision_rule "Finite subdivision rule")

### Structural rigidity and flexibility

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Structural rigidity and flexibility")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Structural_rigidity_basic_examples.svg/150px-Structural_rigidity_basic_examples.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Structural_rigidity_basic_examples.svg)

Graphs are drawn as rods connected by rotating hinges. The [cycle graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph "Cycle graph") C 4 drawn as a square can be tilted over by the blue force into a parallelogram, so it is a flexible graph. K 3, drawn as a triangle, cannot be altered by any force that is applied to it, so it is a rigid graph.

**Structural rigidity** is a [combinatorial theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") for predicting the flexibility of ensembles formed by [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") connected by flexible [linkages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical) "Linkage (mechanical)") or [hinges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge "Hinge").

Topics in this area include:

*   [Cauchy's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_theorem_(geometry) "Cauchy's theorem (geometry)")
*   [Flexible polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_polyhedron "Flexible polyhedron")

### Incidence structures

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Incidence structures")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Fano_plane_with_nimber_labels.svg/250px-Fano_plane_with_nimber_labels.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano_plane_with_nimber_labels.svg)

Seven points are elements of seven lines in the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane"), an example of an incidence structure.

Incidence structures generalize planes (such as [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)"), [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), and [Möbius planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_plane "Möbius plane")) as can be seen from their axiomatic definitions. Incidence structures also generalize the higher-dimensional analogs and the finite structures are sometimes called [finite geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry").

Formally, an **incidence structure** is a triple

![Image 4: {\displaystyle C=(P,L,I).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c0dd5948fff4de6f4db2392535dcc884c06bf54c)
where _P_ is a set of "points", _L_ is a set of "lines" and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle I\subseteq P\times L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6e89d5216cce504b9f50f4b5d0b9e6f27eb9ec3) is the [incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry) "Incidence (geometry)") relation. The elements of ![Image 6: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) are called **flags.** If

![Image 7: {\displaystyle (p,l)\in I,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c45ff87b682989baeaf9b604e3f31fa093e2f54)
we say that point _p_ "lies on" line ![Image 8: {\displaystyle l}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/829091f745070b9eb97a80244129025440a1cfac).

*   [Line arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_lines "Arrangement of lines")
*   [Hyperplane arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_hyperplanes "Arrangement of hyperplanes")
*   [Buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_(mathematics) "Building (mathematics)")

An **oriented matroid** is a [mathematical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure") that abstracts the properties of [directed graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") and of arrangements of vectors in a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") (particularly for [partially ordered vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_vector_space "Ordered vector space")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-4) In comparison, an ordinary (i.e., non-oriented) [matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid "Matroid") abstracts the [dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence "Linear independence") properties that are common both to [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)"), which are not necessarily _directed_, and to arrangements of vectors over [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), which are not necessarily _ordered_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-6)

### Geometric graph theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Geometric graph theory")]

A **geometric graph** is a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") in which the [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") or [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory) "Edge (graph theory)") are associated with [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") objects. Examples include Euclidean graphs, the 1-[skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(topology) "Skeleton (topology)") of a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") or [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope"), [unit disk graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disk_graph "Unit disk graph"), and [visibility graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility_graphs "Visibility graphs").

Topics in this area include:

*   [Graph drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing "Graph drawing")
*   [Polyhedral graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_graph "Polyhedral graph")
*   [Random geometric graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_geometric_graph "Random geometric graph")
*   [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram "Voronoi diagram") and [Delaunay triangulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation "Delaunay triangulation")

### Simplicial complexes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Simplicial complexes")]

A **simplicial complex** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of a certain kind, constructed by "gluing together" [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"), [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle"), and their [_n_-dimensional counterparts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex") (see illustration). Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a [simplicial set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set "Simplicial set") appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory. The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an [abstract simplicial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex "Abstract simplicial complex"). See also [random geometric complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex "Vietoris–Rips complex").

### Topological combinatorics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Topological combinatorics")]

The discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology").

In 1978, the situation was reversed – methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") – when [László Lovász](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Lov%C3%A1sz "László Lovász") proved the [Kneser conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneser_graph "Kneser graph"), thus beginning the new study of **topological combinatorics**. Lovász's proof used the [Borsuk-Ulam theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsuk-Ulam_theorem "Borsuk-Ulam theorem") and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of [fair division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_division "Fair division") problems.

Topics in this area include:

*   [Sperner's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperner%27s_lemma "Sperner's lemma")
*   [Regular maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_map_(graph_theory) "Regular map (graph theory)")

### Lattices and discrete groups

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Lattices and discrete groups")]

A **discrete group** is a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)")_G_ equipped with the [discrete topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_topology "Discrete topology"). With this topology, _G_ becomes a [topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group "Topological group"). A **discrete subgroup** of a topological group _G_ is a [subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup")_H_ whose [relative topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_topology "Relative topology") is the discrete one. For example, the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"), **Z**, form a discrete subgroup of the [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers"), **R** (with the standard [metric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space")), but the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), **Q**, do not.

A **lattice** in a [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact")[topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group "Topological group") is a [discrete subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_subgroup "Discrete subgroup") with the property that the [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)") has finite [invariant measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_measure "Invariant measure"). In the special case of subgroups of **R**_n_, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group) "Lattice (group)"), and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the totality of all lattices are relatively well understood. Deep results of [Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Borel "Armand Borel"), [Harish-Chandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harish-Chandra "Harish-Chandra"), [Mostow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mostow "George Mostow"), [Tamagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuneo_Tamagawa "Tsuneo Tamagawa"), [M. S. Raghunathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._S._Raghunathan "M. S. Raghunathan"), [Margulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Margulis "Grigory Margulis"), [Zimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zimmer_(mathematician) "Robert Zimmer (mathematician)") obtained from the 1950s through the 1970s provided examples and generalized much of the theory to the setting of [nilpotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent_group "Nilpotent group")[Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and [semisimple algebraic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisimple_algebraic_group "Semisimple algebraic group") over a [local field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field "Local field"). In the 1990s, [Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Bass "Hyman Bass") and [Lubotzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lubotzky "Alexander Lubotzky") initiated the study of _tree lattices_, which remains an active research area.

Topics in this area include:

*   [Reflection groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_group "Reflection group")
*   [Triangle groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_group "Triangle group")

**Digital geometry** deals with [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_space "Discrete space") sets (usually discrete [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") sets) considered to be [digitized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitizing "Digitizing")[models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model") or [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image "Image") of objects of the 2D or 3D [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

Simply put, **digitizing** is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the [raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics "Raster graphics") display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data "Digital data") images.

Its main application areas are [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") and [image analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis "Image analysis").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry#cite_note-7)

### Discrete differential geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discrete_geometry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Discrete differential geometry")]

**Discrete differential geometry** is the study of discrete counterparts of notions in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). Instead of smooth curves and surfaces, there are [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), [meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh "Mesh"), and [simplicial complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complexes "Simplicial complexes"). It is used in the study of [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") and [topological combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_combinatorics "Topological combinatorics").
