Find sources: "Hataki" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A hataki ( 叩き ) is a type of household cleaning tool that originated in Japan . Consisting of durable cloth strips attached to a stick or pole, it is used for moving dust from surfaces onto the floor where it can be swept up or vacuumed. Similar to a feather duster , it is not to be confused with an ōnusa .

[ 1 ] This duster, made of a bamboo pole and cloth strips, is a fixture in every Japanese home.

The hataki does not trap dust but, with its familiar sound, pushes it onto the floor where it can be swept up.
