Appleton & Company Title page from the New American Cyclopædia (1858) The New American Cyclopædia was an encyclopedia created and published by D. Appleton & Company of New York in 16 volumes, which initially appeared between 1858 and 1863. Its primary editors were George Ripley and Charles Anderson Dana .

The New American Cyclopædia was revised and republished as the American Cyclopædia in 1873.

[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] The New American Cyclopædia was a general encyclopedia with a special focus on subjects related to the United States. As it was created over the years spanning the American Civil War , the focus and tone of articles could change drastically; for example, Jefferson Davis , the future president of the Confederate States of America , was treated at length as a United States Army soldier and US government politician in pre-war editions.

[ 2 ] As was traditional, the entire set was re-issued with the publication in 1863 of the 16th volume. The whole Cyclopædia was again re-issued in 1864.

Contributors [ edit ] A notable contributor was Karl Marx , then a European correspondent for the New York Tribune , who, appeared as the writer, while most of those articles were written by Friedrich Engels , especially the articles on military affairs, [ 3 ] which belonged in Engels' domain in the division of labor between the two friends. Because of his deep knowledge of all things military, Engels had earned the nickname "General".

[ 3 ] Marx wrote a highly unsympathetic biographical article on Simon Bolivar .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Other prominent contributors to the first edition included [ 5 ] Charles Allen Samuel G. Arnold Alexander Dallas Bache William Bross George Bancroft Benjamin Fordyce Barker John R.

[ 6 ] Publication history [ edit ] The cyclopaedia was revived under the title American Cyclopædia in 1873–6. A final edition was issued in 1883–4, which added supplements to each volume of the 1873 edition. Two analytical indexes were published separately in 1878 and 1884.
