The Cambridge, Massachusetts City Hall is the city hall for Cambridge, Massachusetts , located at 795 Massachusetts Avenue, and built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style.

History [ edit ] The hall was built between 1888 and 1889, and was largely funded through a donation from Frederick Hastings Rindge .

[ 2 ] The architects were Longfellow, Alden & Harlow ( Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr.

, 1854–1934; Frank E. Alden, 1859–1908; and Alfred B. Harlow, 1857–1927). The building is three stories tall, with a bell tower that rises to 158 feet. Load-bearing stone walls are of Milford granite trimmed with Longmeadow brownstone.
