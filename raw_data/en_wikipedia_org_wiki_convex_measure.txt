There are multiple ways in which the comparison between the probabilities of A and B and the intermediate set can be made, leading to multiple definitions of convexity, such as log-concavity , harmonic convexity , and so on.  The mathematician Christer Borell was a pioneer of the detailed study of convex measures on locally convex spaces in the 1970s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] General definition and special cases [ edit ] Let X be a locally convex Hausdorff vector space , and consider a probability measure μ on the Borel σ -algebra of X .  Fix −∞ ≤ s ≤ 0, and define, for u , v ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, M s , λ λ ( u , v ) = { ( λ λ u s + ( 1 − − λ λ ) v s ) 1 / s if − − ∞ ∞ < s < 0 , min ( u , v ) if s = − − ∞ ∞ , u λ λ v 1 − − λ λ if s = 0.

{\displaystyle M_{s,\lambda }(u,v)={\begin{cases}(\lambda u^{s}+(1-\lambda )v^{s})^{1/s}&{\text{if }}-\infty <s<0,\\\min(u,v)&{\text{if }}s=-\infty ,\\u^{\lambda }v^{1-\lambda }&{\text{if }}s=0.\end{cases}}} For subsets A and B of X , we write λ λ A + ( 1 − − λ λ ) B = { λ λ x + ( 1 − − λ λ ) y ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ A , y ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle \lambda A+(1-\lambda )B=\{\lambda x+(1-\lambda )y\mid x\in A,y\in B\}} for their Minkowski sum .  With this notation, the measure μ is said to be s -convex [ 1 ] if, for all Borel-measurable subsets A and B of X and all 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, μ μ ( λ λ A + ( 1 − − λ λ ) B ) ≥ ≥ M s , λ λ ( μ μ ( A ) , μ μ ( B ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (\lambda A+(1-\lambda )B)\geq M_{s,\lambda }(\mu (A),\mu (B)).} The special case s = 0 is the inequality μ μ ( λ λ A + ( 1 − − λ λ ) B ) ≥ ≥ μ μ ( A ) λ λ μ μ ( B ) 1 − − λ λ , {\displaystyle \mu (\lambda A+(1-\lambda )B)\geq \mu (A)^{\lambda }\mu (B)^{1-\lambda },} i.e.

log ⁡ ⁡ μ μ ( λ λ A + ( 1 − − λ λ ) B ) ≥ ≥ λ λ log ⁡ ⁡ μ μ ( A ) + ( 1 − − λ λ ) log ⁡ ⁡ μ μ ( B ) .

{\displaystyle \log \mu (\lambda A+(1-\lambda )B)\geq \lambda \log \mu (A)+(1-\lambda )\log \mu (B).} Thus, a measure being 0-convex is the same thing as it being a logarithmically concave measure .

Properties [ edit ] The classes of s -convex measures form a nested increasing family as s decreases to −∞" s ≤ ≤ t and μ μ is t -convex ⟹ ⟹ μ μ is s -convex {\displaystyle s\leq t{\text{ and }}\mu {\text{ is }}t{\text{-convex}}\implies \mu {\text{ is }}s{\text{-convex}}} or, equivalently s ≤ ≤ t ⟹ ⟹ { s -convex measures } ⊇ ⊇ { t -convex measures } .

{\displaystyle s\leq t\implies \{s{\text{-convex measures}}\}\supseteq \{t{\text{-convex measures}}\}.} Thus, the collection of −∞-convex measures is the largest such class, whereas the 0-convex measures (the logarithmically concave measures) are the smallest class.

The convexity of a measure μ on n -dimensional Euclidean space R n in the sense above is closely related to the convexity of its probability density function .

[ 2 ] Indeed, μ is s -convex if and only if there is an absolutely continuous measure ν with probability density function ρ on some R k so that μ is the push-forward on ν under a linear or affine map and e s , k ∘ ∘ ρ ρ : : R k → → R {\displaystyle e_{s,k}\circ \rho \colon \mathbb {R} ^{k}\to \mathbb {R} } is a convex function , where e s , k ( t ) = { t s / ( 1 − − s k ) if − − ∞ ∞ < s < 0 t − − 1 / k if s = − − ∞ ∞ , − − log ⁡ ⁡ t if s = 0.

{\displaystyle e_{s,k}(t)={\begin{cases}t^{s/(1-sk)}&{\text{if }}-\infty <s<0\\t^{-1/k}&{\text{if }}s=-\infty ,\\-\log t&{\text{if }}s=0.\end{cases}}} Convex measures also satisfy a zero-one law :  if G is a measurable additive subgroup of the vector space X (i.e. a measurable linear subspace), then the inner measure of G under μ , μ μ ∗ ∗ ( G ) = sup { μ μ ( K ) ∣ ∣ K ⊆ ⊆ G and K is compact } , {\displaystyle \mu _{\ast }(G)=\sup\{\mu (K)\mid K\subseteq G{\text{ and }}K{\text{ is compact}}\},} must be 0 or 1.   (In the case that μ is a Radon measure , and hence inner regular , the measure μ and its inner measure coincide, so the μ -measure of G is then 0 or 1.)
