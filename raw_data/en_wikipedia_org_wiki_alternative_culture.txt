These subcultures may have little or nothing in common besides their relative obscurity, but cultural studies uses this common basis of obscurity to classify them as alternative cultures , or, taken as a whole, the alternative culture .  Compare with the more politically charged term, counterculture .

History [ edit ] Alternative societies have probably always existed, but their peak was during World War II. 
In 1960 they experienced a boom, some of which have survived to this day.
Currently, alternative societies are being created for various reasons, for example loneliness.
