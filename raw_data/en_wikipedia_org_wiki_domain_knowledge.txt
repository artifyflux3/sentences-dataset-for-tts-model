[ 1 ] The term is often used in reference to a more general discipline—for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry.

[ citation needed ] People with domain knowledge are often regarded as specialists or experts in their field.

[ 2 ] Knowledge capture [ edit ] In software engineering , domain knowledge is knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates, for example, software agents . Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application. Expert domain knowledge (frequently informal and ill-structured) is transformed in computer programs and active data, for example in a set of rules in knowledge bases, by knowledge engineers .

Communicating between end-users and software developers is often difficult. They  must find a common language to communicate in. Developing enough shared vocabulary to communicate can often take a while.

The same knowledge can be included in different domain knowledge. Knowledge which may be applicable across a number of domains is called domain-independent knowledge, for example logic and mathematics. Operations on domain knowledge are performed by metaknowledge .
