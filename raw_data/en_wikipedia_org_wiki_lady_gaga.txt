Life and career 1986–2004: Early life Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born to an upper-middle-class Catholic family on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Lenox Hill, New York located in the Manhattan, New York borough of New York City.

[ 1 ] Both of her parents have Italian ancestry.

[ 2 ] Her parents are Cynthia Louise ( née Bissett ), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, [ 3 ] and she has a younger sister named Natali.

[ 4 ] Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart , a private all-girls Roman Catholic school.

[ 7 ] Gaga has described her high-school self as "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" but also "a bit insecure". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for "being either too provocative or too eccentric".

[ 8 ] Gaga began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which Gaga preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp.

[ 9 ] As a teenager, she played at open mic nights.

[ 10 ] Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in the play Guys and Dolls and Philia in the play A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Regis High School .

[ 11 ] She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years.

[ 12 ] Her screen debut was a background appearance in the 2000 music video for AC/DC 's song " Stiff Upper Lip ".

[ 13 ] Gaga auditioned unsuccessfully for New York shows, though did appear in a small background role as a high-school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled " The Telltale Moozadell ".

[ 14 ] Fan interest in that episode increased when a clip of Gaga's scene surfaced online in 2010.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] She later said of her inclination towards music: I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at.

[ 17 ] In 2003, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21 , a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts , and lived in an NYU dorm . She studied music there and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 2005, Gaga withdrew from school during the second semester of her second year to focus on her music career.

[ 20 ] That year, she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV 's Boiling Points , a prank reality television show.

[ 21 ] In a 2014 interview, Gaga discussed being raped at age 19 by her producer, and later undergoing mental and physical therapy for this.

[ 22 ] She has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attributes it to the incident, stating that the trauma had changed her as a person, and would never leave her.

[ 23 ] She has credited support from doctors, family, and friends with helping her.

[ 24 ] Gaga later gave additional details about the rape, including that "the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner at my parents' house because I was vomiting and sick. Because I'd been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months." [ 25 ] 2005–2007: Career beginnings In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with rapper Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park .

[ 26 ] She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU.

[ 11 ] [ 27 ] They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene.

[ 11 ] After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at the Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari .

[ 28 ] Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material.

[ 29 ] The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her "Lady Gaga", which was derived from Queen 's song " Radio Ga Ga ".

[ 30 ] According to his account, the name was coined when on one occasion he attempted to call her "Radio Ga Ga" via text message, but the spell checker autocorrected "Radio" to "Lady".

[ 31 ] Their relationship lasted until January 2007.

Reid , Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006.

[ 33 ] She was dropped from the label three months later [ 34 ] and returned to her family home for Christmas. Gaga began performing at neo-burlesque shows, and said these represented freedom to her.

[ 35 ] During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight , who helped mold her onstage persona.

[ 36 ] The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge , the Bitter End , and the Rockwood Music Hall . Their live performance art piece, known as "Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue" and billed as "The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] They performed at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival.

[ 37 ] Having initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music , Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock style of David Bowie and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and record executive Vincent Herbert .

[ 39 ] In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records , established that month.

[ 43 ] Akon convinced Jimmy Iovine , chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M Records (a brother company for Def Jam), to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label KonLive Distribution , making her his "franchise player".

[ 42 ] Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too "racy", "dance-oriented", and "underground" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: "My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next."

[ 336 ] Gaga has said that synesthesia , characterized by her seeing colors while making music, has played a key role in her creative process, explaining: "As I'm writing, it assembles in my brain, then through the recording it becomes a full piece of colour.

[ 344 ] [ 345 ] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power."

[ 347 ] Gaga has said that she believes "all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit".

[ 348 ] Simon Reynolds wrote in 2010: "Everything about Gaga came from electroclash , except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&B -ish beats." [ 349 ] Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors.

The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop , [ 350 ] whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on "Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco , and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q ".

[ 213 ] Billboard commented that its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as "timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener." [ 358 ] On Chromatica , Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots, and discussed her struggles with mental health.

[ 359 ] Love for Sale and Harlequin expand on her venture into jazz music. The former consists of a tribute to Cole Porter , while the latter was inspired by her role in Joker: Folie à Deux .

[ 360 ] [ 361 ] With Mayhem , Gaga aimed to revisit "the pop music my earliest fans loved."

[ 380 ] In an October 2018 article for Billboard , Rebecca Schiller traced back Gaga's videography from "Just Dance" to the release of A Star Is Born . Schiller noted that following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne , taking the example of the music video of lead single "Perfect Illusion" where she eschewed "the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.

[ 381 ] Reviewing The Chromatica Ball in 2022, Chris Willman of Variety wrote that Gaga "could have further played the authenticity card for all it's worth" after the release of Joanne and A Star Is Born , but instead "has determined to keep herself weird — or just weird enough to provide necessarily ballast to her more earnest inclinations".

[ 383 ] Public reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. She is noted for her outlandish fashion sense, which has served as an important aspect of her character.

[ 388 ] Time placed Gaga on their All- Time 100 Fashion Icons list, stating: "Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits", mentioning outfits "made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat".
