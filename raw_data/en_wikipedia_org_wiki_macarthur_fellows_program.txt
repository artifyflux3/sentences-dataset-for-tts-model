MacArthur Foundation For the award in the fields of ecology, see Robert H. MacArthur Award .

Award MacArthur Fellows Program Sponsored by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Date 1981 ; 44 years ago ( 1981 ) Website Official website The MacArthur Fellows Program , also known as the MacArthur Fellowship and colloquially called the " Genius Grant ", [ a ] is a prize awarded annually by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to typically between 20 and 30 individuals working in any field who have shown "extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction" and are citizens or residents of the United States .

[ 5 ] According to the foundation's website, "the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishments but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential", but it also says such potential is "based on a track record of significant accomplishments". The current prize is $800,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments. Previously, it was $625,000. This figure was increased from $500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review [ 6 ] of the MacArthur Fellows Program.  The award has been called "one of the most significant awards that is truly 'no strings attached ' ".

[ 7 ] The program does not accept applications. Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people. The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the president and board of directors . Most new fellows first learn of their nomination and award upon receiving a congratulatory phone call. MacArthur Fellow Jim Collins described this experience in an editorial column of The New York Times .

[ 3 ] Marlies Carruth is the program's current director.

[ 8 ] Recipients [ edit ] As of 2023, since 1981, 1131 people have been named MacArthur Fellows, [ 9 ] ranging in age from 18 to 82.

[ 10 ] In the five broad categories defined by the foundation, the breakdown for recipient focus is as follows: Arts 336; Humanities 170; Public Issues 257; STEM 335; and Social Sciences 120.

[ 9 ] Of the 965 terminal degrees earned by 928 fellows during the period 1981 through 2018, 540 (56%) are doctorates, with the Ph.D. accounting for 514 (53.3%). Ivy league schools awarded 306 (31.7%) degrees to 300 (32.3%) fellows.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The award is made to individuals of varying educational background but among the 1131 fellowship awards through the class of 2023, the following ten institutions have the most alumni fellows (a comparatively smaller school, California Institute of Technology had the most per capita, whereas the large Harvard University had the most overall.)
