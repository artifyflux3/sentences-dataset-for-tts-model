[ 10 ] History [ edit ] UNC Press building in 2014.

UNC Press began its publishing history in 1925 with Southern Pioneers in Social Interpretation , edited by sociologist Howard W. Odum , one of the press’s founders. The volume featured essays on both Black and white Southern figures, including Booker T. Washington and Woodrow Wilson , and aimed to present the South as a region with cultural and intellectual contributions. The collection received national attention and was described by The New Republic as signaling a "quickening breeze from the South." This publication helped establish UNC Press’s long-term mission to highlight diverse voices and subjects related to the Southern experience.

[ 11 ] In 2006, UNC Press started the distribution company Longleaf Services as an affiliate.
