Each player is modeled as having a privately known "type" that determines their preferences and beliefs, which in turn guide their strategic decisions. This approach builds upon John Harsanyi ’s foundational work on games with incomplete information .

In this framework, a player's first-order beliefs are probability distributions over other players’ types. Second-order beliefs are beliefs about others’ first-order beliefs, and this recursive structure continues indefinitely, forming a hierarchy of beliefs.

Jean-François Mertens and Shmuel Zamir ’s key contribution in 1985 was the construction of a universal type space —a mathematical structure encompassing all possible hierarchies of beliefs consistent with the model.

[ 1 ] This universal space enables a rigorous treatment of beliefs at all levels and provides a foundation for practical approximations using finite type spaces.

The concept has become central in Bayesian game theory , with applications in economics , computer science , AI , and philosophy . It is particularly useful in analyzing strategic interactions under asymmetric information and uncertainty , and in exploring notions like common knowledge , as formalized by Robert Aumann , and induction puzzles involving recursive reasoning.
