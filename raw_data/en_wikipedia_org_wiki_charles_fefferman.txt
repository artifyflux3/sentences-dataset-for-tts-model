Seco Charles Louis Fefferman (born April 18, 1949) is an American mathematician at Princeton University , where he is currently the Herbert E. Jones, Jr. '43 University Professor of Mathematics. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978 for his contributions to mathematical analysis .

Early life and education [ edit ] Fefferman was born to a Jewish family, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in Washington, DC. He was a child prodigy , entered the University of Maryland at age 14, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] and had written his first scientific paper by the age of 15.

[ 3 ] He graduated with degrees in math and physics at 17, [ 8 ] and earned his PhD in mathematics three years later from Princeton University , under Elias Stein . His doctoral dissertation was titled "Inequalities for strongly singular convolution operators".

[ 9 ] Fefferman achieved a full professorship at the University of Chicago at the age of 22, making him the youngest full professor ever appointed in the United States.

[ 6 ] Career [ edit ] At the age of 25, he returned to Princeton as a full professor, becoming the youngest person to be promoted to the title.

[ 10 ] He won the Alan T. Waterman Award in 1976 [ 4 ] (the first person to get the award) and the Fields Medal in 1978 for his work in mathematical analysis , specifically convergence and divergence.

[ 3 ] He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979.

[ 11 ] He was appointed the Herbert Jones Professor at Princeton in 1984.

In addition to the above, his honors include the Salem Prize in 1971, the Bergman Prize in 1992, [ 12 ] the Bôcher Memorial Prize in 2008, [ 13 ] and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics for 2017, [ 14 ] as well as election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 2021 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.

[ 17 ] Fefferman contributed several innovations that revised the study of multidimensional complex analysis by finding fruitful generalisations of classical low-dimensional results. Fefferman's work on partial differential equations , Fourier analysis , in particular convergence, multipliers, divergence, singular integrals and Hardy spaces earned him a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Helsinki in 1978.

[ 18 ] He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1974 in Vancouver.

[ 19 ] His early work included a study of the asymptotics of the Bergman kernel off the boundaries of pseudoconvex domains in C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} .

[ 20 ] He has studied mathematical physics, harmonic analysis , fluid dynamics , neural networks , geometry , mathematical finance and spectral analysis , amongst others.

Family [ edit ] Charles Fefferman and his wife Julie have two daughters, Nina and Lainie. Lainie Fefferman is a composer, taught math at Saint Ann's School and holds a degree in music from Yale University as well as a Ph.D. in music composition from Princeton.

[ 21 ] She has an interest in Middle Eastern music .

[ 22 ] Nina Fefferman is a computational biologist residing at the University of Tennessee whose research is concerned with the application of mathematical models to complex biological systems.

[ 23 ] Charles Fefferman's brother, Robert Fefferman , is also a mathematician and former Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at the University of Chicago .
