339 –265 BC [ 1 ] ) of Elis , was a philosopher of Megarian school and a disciple of Eubulides . From his argumentative nature he was facetiously named the wrangler ( Greek : Ἐλεγξῖνος ),  From Elis he went to Olympia , hoping to found a sect which was to be called the Olympian, but his disciples soon became disgusted with the unhealthiness of the place and their scanty means of subsistence, and left him with a single attendant.

None of his doctrines have been preserved, but from the brief mention made of him by Cicero , [ 2 ] he seems to have dealt in logical puzzles.

Athenaeus [ 3 ] mentions a paean which he wrote in honour of Craterus , the Macedonian, and which was sung at Delphi to the sound of the lyre . Alexinus also wrote against Zeno , and against Ephorus the historian.

Diogenes Laërtius has preserved some lines on his death which was caused by his being pierced with a reed while swimming in the Alpheus .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 267–6, Alexinus debated rhetorical questions with Hermarchus the Epicurean .

[ 1 ] Philodemus in his On Rhetoric quotes a rebuttal by Hermarchus in which he cites Alexinus.

[ 6 ] Alexinus criticizes the rhetorical sophists for wasting their time on investigation of useless subjects, such as diction, memory, and the interpretation of obscure passages in the poets.
