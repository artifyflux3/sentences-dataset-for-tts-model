In algebraic number theory , a Gauss sum or Gaussian sum is a particular kind of finite sum of roots of unity , typically G ( χ χ ) := G ( χ χ , ψ ψ ) = ∑ ∑ χ χ ( r ) ⋅ ⋅ ψ ψ ( r ) {\displaystyle G(\chi ):=G(\chi ,\psi )=\sum \chi (r)\cdot \psi (r)} where the sum is over elements r of some finite commutative ring R , ψ is a group homomorphism of the additive group R + into the unit circle , and χ is a group homomorphism of the unit group R × into the unit circle, extended to non-unit r , where it takes the value 0. Gauss sums are the analogues for finite fields of the Gamma function .

[ 1 ] Such sums are ubiquitous in number theory . They occur, for example, in the functional equations of Dirichlet L -functions , where for a Dirichlet character χ the equation relating L ( s , χ ) and L (1 − s , χ ) (where χ is the complex conjugate of χ ) involves a factor [ clarification needed ] G ( χ χ ) | G ( χ χ ) | .

{\displaystyle {\frac {G(\chi )}{|G(\chi )|}}.} History [ edit ] The case originally considered by Carl Friedrich Gauss was the quadratic Gauss sum , for R the field of residues modulo a prime number p , and χ the Legendre symbol . In this case Gauss proved that G ( χ ) = p 1 ⁄ 2 or ip 1 ⁄ 2 for p congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4 respectively (the quadratic Gauss sum can also be evaluated by Fourier analysis as well as by contour integration ).

An alternate form for this Gauss sum is ∑ ∑ e 2 π π i r 2 / p {\displaystyle \sum e^{2\pi ir^{2}/p}} .

Quadratic Gauss sums are closely connected with the theory of theta functions .

The general theory of Gauss sums was developed in the early 19th century, with the use of Jacobi sums and their prime decomposition in cyclotomic fields . Gauss sums over a residue ring of integers mod N are linear combinations of closely related sums called Gaussian periods .

The absolute value of Gauss sums is usually found as an application of Plancherel's theorem on finite groups. In the case where R is a field of p elements and χ is nontrivial, the absolute value is p 1 ⁄ 2 . The determination of the exact value of general Gauss sums, following the result of Gauss on the quadratic case, is a long-standing issue. For some cases see Kummer sum .

Properties of Gauss sums of Dirichlet characters [ edit ] The Gauss sum of a Dirichlet character modulo N is G ( χ χ ) = ∑ ∑ a = 1 N χ χ ( a ) e 2 π π i a / N .

{\displaystyle G(\chi )=\sum _{a=1}^{N}\chi (a)e^{2\pi ia/N}.} If χ is also primitive , then | G ( χ χ ) | = N , {\displaystyle |G(\chi )|={\sqrt {N}},} in particular, it is nonzero. More generally, if N 0 is the conductor of χ and χ 0 is the primitive Dirichlet character modulo N 0 that induces χ , then the Gauss sum of χ is related to that of χ 0 by G ( χ χ ) = μ μ ( N N 0 ) χ χ 0 ( N N 0 ) G ( χ χ 0 ) {\displaystyle G(\chi )=\mu \left({\frac {N}{N_{0}}}\right)\chi _{0}\left({\frac {N}{N_{0}}}\right)G\left(\chi _{0}\right)} where μ is the Möbius function . Consequently, G ( χ ) is non-zero precisely when ⁠ N / N 0 ⁠ is squarefree and relatively prime to N 0 .

[ 2 ] Other relations between G ( χ ) and Gauss sums of other characters include G ( χ χ ¯ ¯ ) = χ χ ( − − 1 ) G ( χ χ ) ¯ ¯ , {\displaystyle G({\overline {\chi }})=\chi (-1){\overline {G(\chi )}},} where χ is the complex conjugate Dirichlet character, and if χ ′ is a Dirichlet character modulo N ′ such that N and N ′ are relatively prime, then G ( χ χ χ χ ′ ′ ) = χ χ ( N ′ ′ ) χ χ ′ ′ ( N ) G ( χ χ ) G ( χ χ ′ ′ ) .

{\displaystyle G\left(\chi \chi ^{\prime }\right)=\chi \left(N^{\prime }\right)\chi ^{\prime }(N)G(\chi )G\left(\chi ^{\prime }\right).} The relation among G ( χχ ′) , G ( χ ) , and G ( χ ′) when χ and χ ′ are of the same modulus (and χχ ′ is primitive) is measured by the Jacobi sum J ( χ , χ ′) . Specifically, G ( χ χ χ χ ′ ′ ) = G ( χ χ ) G ( χ χ ′ ′ ) J ( χ χ , χ χ ′ ′ ) .

{\displaystyle G\left(\chi \chi ^{\prime }\right)={\frac {G(\chi )G\left(\chi ^{\prime }\right)}{J\left(\chi ,\chi ^{\prime }\right)}}.} Further properties [ edit ] Gauss sums can be used to prove quadratic reciprocity , cubic reciprocity , and quartic reciprocity .

Gauss sums can be used to calculate the number of solutions of polynomial equations over finite fields, and thus can be used to calculate certain zeta functions.
