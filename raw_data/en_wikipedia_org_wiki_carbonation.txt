For carbonated beverages, see Carbonated drink and Carbonated water .

Carbonation is the chemical reaction of carbon dioxide to give carbonates , bicarbonates , and carbonic acid .

[ 1 ] In chemistry , the term is sometimes used in place of carboxylation , which refers to the formation of carboxylic acids .

In inorganic chemistry and geology , carbonation is common.

Metal hydroxides (MOH) and metal oxides (M'O) react with CO 2 to give bicarbonates and carbonates : MOH  +  CO 2 →   M(HCO 3 ) M'O  +  CO 2 →   M'CO 3 Selected carbonations [ edit ] Carbonic anhydrase [ edit ] In mammalian physiology, transport of carbon dioxide to the lungs involves a carbonation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase .  In the absence of such catalysts, carbon dioxide cannot be expelled sufficient rate to support metabolic needs. The enzyme harbors a zinc aquo complex , which captures carbon dioxide to give a zinc bicarbonate: [ 2 ] [(imidazole) 3 ZnOH] + +  CO 2 ⇌   [(imidazole) 3 ZnOCO 2 H] + Behavior of concrete [ edit ] In reinforced concrete , the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide in the air and calcium hydroxide and hydrated calcium silicate in the concrete is known as neutralisation . The similar reaction in which calcium hydroxide from cement reacts with carbon dioxide and forms insoluble calcium carbonate is carbonatation .

Urea production [ edit ] Carbonation of ammonia is one step in the industrial production of urea . In 2020, worldwide production capacity was approximately 180 million tonnes.

[ 3 ] As a fertilizer, it is a source of nitrogen for plants.
Urea production plants are almost always located adjacent to the site where the ammonia is manufactured.

[ 4 ] 2 NH 3 + CO 2 ⇌ [NH 4 ] + [NH 2 COO] − In the subsequent urea conversion: the ammonium carbamate is decomposed into urea, releasing water: [NH 4 ] + [NH 2 COO] − ⇌ CO(NH 2 ) 2 + H 2 O Solubility [ edit ] Henry's law states that P CO 2 =K B x CO 2 where P CO 2 is the partial pressure of CO 2 gas above the solution. K B is Henry's law constant. K B increases as temperature increases. x CO 2 is the mole fraction of CO 2 gas in the solution. According to Henry's law carbonation increases in a solution as temperature decreases.

[ 5 ] Since carbonation is the process of giving compounds like carbonic acid (liq) from CO 2 (gas) {i.e. making liquid from gasses} thus the partial pressure of CO 2 has to decrease or the mole fraction of CO 2 in solution has to increase {P CO 2 /x CO 2 = K B } and both these two conditions support increase in carbonation.
