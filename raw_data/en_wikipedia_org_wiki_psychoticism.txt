Psychoticism includes the traits of "aggression, coldness, egocentrism, impulsivity, lack of empathy, tough-mindedness, and being antisocial." [ 3 ] Nature [ edit ] Psychoticism is conceptually similar to the constraint factor in Tellegen's three-factor model of personality.

[ 4 ] Psychoticism may be divided into narrower traits such as impulsivity and sensation-seeking . These may in turn be further subdivided into even more specific traits. For example, impulsivity may be divided into narrow impulsivity (unthinking responsivity), risk taking, non-planning, and liveliness.

[ 4 ] Sensation seeking has also been analysed into a number of separate facets.

Eysenck argued that there might be a correlation between psychoticism and creativity .

[ 5 ] Critics [ edit ] Critics of the trait have suggested that the trait is too heterogeneous to be taken as a single trait. Costa and McCrae believe that agreeableness and conscientiousness (both of which represent low levels of psychoticism) need to be distinguished in personality models.

[ 6 ] It has also been suggested that "psychoticism" may be a misnomer and that " psychopathy " or "Impulsive Unsocialized Sensation Seeking" would be better labels.

[ 4 ] Biological bases [ edit ] Psychoticism is believed to be associated with levels of dopamine .

[ 7 ] Other biological correlates of psychoticism include low conditionability and low levels of monoamine oxidase ; beta-hydroxylase , cortisol , norepinephrine in cerebrospinal fluid also appear relevant to psychoticism level.

Eysenck's theoretical basis for the model was the theory of Einheitspsychosen (unitary psychosis) of the nineteenth-century German psychiatrist Heinrich Neumann .
