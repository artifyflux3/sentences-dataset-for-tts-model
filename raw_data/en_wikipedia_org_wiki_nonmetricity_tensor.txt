[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is therefore a tensor field of order three. It vanishes for the case of Riemannian geometry and can be
used to study non-Riemannian spacetimes.

[ 3 ] Definition [ edit ] By components, it is defined as follows.

[ 1 ] Q μ μ α α β β = ∇ ∇ μ μ g α α β β {\displaystyle Q_{\mu \alpha \beta }=\nabla _{\mu }g_{\alpha \beta }} It measures the rate of change of the components of the metric tensor along the flow of a given vector field, since ∇ ∇ μ μ ≡ ≡ ∇ ∇ ∂ ∂ μ μ {\displaystyle \nabla _{\mu }\equiv \nabla _{\partial _{\mu }}} where { ∂ ∂ μ μ } μ μ = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 {\displaystyle \{\partial _{\mu }\}_{\mu =0,1,2,3}} is the coordinate basis of vector fields of the tangent bundle, in the case of having a 4-dimensional manifold .

Relation to connection [ edit ] We say that a connection Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is compatible with the metric when its associated covariant derivative of the metric tensor (call it ∇ ∇ Γ Γ {\displaystyle \nabla ^{\Gamma }} , for example) is zero, i.e.

∇ ∇ μ μ Γ Γ g α α β β = 0.

{\displaystyle \nabla _{\mu }^{\Gamma }g_{\alpha \beta }=0.} If the connection is also torsion-free (i.e. totally symmetric) then it is known as the Levi-Civita connection , which is the only one without torsion and compatible with the metric tensor. If we see it from a geometrical point of view, a non-vanishing nonmetricity tensor for a metric tensor g {\displaystyle g} implies that the modulus of a vector defined on the tangent bundle to a certain point p {\displaystyle p} of the manifold, changes when it is evaluated along the direction (flow) of another arbitrary vector.
