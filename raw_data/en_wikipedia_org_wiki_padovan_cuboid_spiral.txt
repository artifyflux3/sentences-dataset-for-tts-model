The cuboids are added sequentially so that the resulting cuboid has dimensions that are successive Padovan numbers .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The first cuboid is 1x1x1. The second is formed by adding to this a 1x1x1 cuboid to form a 1x1x2 cuboid. To this is added a 1x1x2 cuboid to form a 1x2x2 cuboid.
This pattern continues, forming in succession a 2x2x3 cuboid, a 2x3x4 cuboid etc.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Joining the diagonals of the exposed end of each new added cuboid creates a spiral (seen as the black line in the figure). The points on this spiral all lie in the same plane.

[ 1 ] The cuboids are added in a sequence that adds to the face in the positive y direction, then the positive x direction, then the positive z direction.  This is followed by cuboids added in the negative y, negative x and negative z directions.  Each new cuboid added has a length and width that matches the length and width of the face being added to. The height of the n th added cuboid is the n th Padovan number.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Connecting alternate points where the spiral bends creates a series of triangles, where each triangle has two sides that are successive Padovan numbers and that has an obtuse angle of 120 degrees between these two sides.
