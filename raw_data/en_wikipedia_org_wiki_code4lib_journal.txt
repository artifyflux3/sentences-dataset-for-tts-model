[ 1 ] It was founded by the Code4Lib community in 2007. Code4Lib publishes under a US CC-BY licence.

Code4Lib Journal is also open peer-reviewed.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The "hacker librarian" culture of the early 2000s led to an active community of library technologists: Code4Lib.

[ 3 ] In December 2007, the first issue of Code4Lib Journal was published as an experiment to supplement this Code4Lib community.

[ 4 ] The journal's audience is "generally those working as technologists in libraries. Articles are often of a practical nature, describing coding behind projects and often providing samples of code or project architecture." [ 5 ] The Code4lib Journal was mostly published quarterly until 2020. Due to the pandemic and other social factors [ 6 ] it has been published three times each in 2020 and 2021.

Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts .
