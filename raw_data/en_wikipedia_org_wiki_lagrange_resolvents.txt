( November 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In Galois theory , a discipline within the field of abstract algebra , a resolvent for a permutation group G is a polynomial whose coefficients depend polynomially on the coefficients of a given polynomial p and has, roughly speaking, a rational root if and only if the Galois group of p is included in G . More exactly, if the Galois group is included in G , then the resolvent has a rational root, and the converse is true if the rational root is a simple root .
Resolvents were introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange and systematically used by Évariste Galois . Nowadays they are still a fundamental tool to compute Galois groups . The simplest examples of resolvents are X 2 − − Δ Δ {\displaystyle X^{2}-\Delta } where Δ Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } is the discriminant , which is a resolvent for the alternating group . In the case of a cubic equation , this resolvent is sometimes called the quadratic resolvent ; its roots appear explicitly in the formulas for the roots of a cubic equation.

The cubic resolvent of a quartic equation , which is a resolvent for the dihedral group of 8 elements.

The Cayley resolvent is a resolvent for the maximal solvable Galois group in degree five. It is a polynomial of degree 6.

These three resolvents have the property of being always separable , which means that, if they have a multiple root , then the polynomial p is not irreducible . It is not known if there is an always separable resolvent for every group of permutations.

For every equation the roots may be expressed in terms of radicals and of a root of a resolvent for a solvable group, because the Galois group of the equation over the field generated by this root is solvable.

Definition [ edit ] Let n be a positive integer , which will be the degree of the equation that we will consider, and ( X 1 , ..., X n ) an ordered list of indeterminates . 
According to Vieta's formulas this defines the generic monic polynomial of degree n F ( X ) = X n + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( − − 1 ) i E i X n − − i = ∏ ∏ i = 1 n ( X − − X i ) , {\displaystyle F(X)=X^{n}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{i}E_{i}X^{n-i}=\prod _{i=1}^{n}(X-X_{i}),} where E i is the i th elementary symmetric polynomial .

The symmetric group S n acts on the X i by permuting them, and this induces an action on the polynomials in the X i . The stabilizer of a given polynomial under this action is generally trivial, but some polynomials have a bigger stabilizer. For example, the stabilizer of an elementary symmetric polynomial is the whole group S n . If the stabilizer is non-trivial, the polynomial is fixed by some non-trivial subgroup G ; it is said to be an invariant of G . Conversely, given a subgroup G of S n , an invariant of G is a resolvent invariant for G if it is not an invariant of any bigger subgroup of S n .

[ 1 ] Finding invariants for a given subgroup G of S n is relatively easy; one can sum the orbit of a monomial under the action of S n . However, it may occur that the resulting polynomial is an invariant for a larger group. For example, consider the case of the subgroup G of S 4 of order 4, consisting of (12)(34) , (13)(24) , (14)(23) and the identity (for the notation, see Permutation group ). The monomial X 1 X 2 gives the invariant 2( X 1 X 2 + X 3 X 4 ) . It is not a resolvent invariant for G , because being invariant by (12) , it is in fact a resolvent invariant for the larger dihedral subgroup D 4 : ⟨(12), (1324)⟩ , and is used to define the resolvent cubic of the quartic equation .

If P is a resolvent invariant for a group G of index m inside S n , then its orbit under S n has order m . Let P 1 , ..., P m be the elements of this orbit. Then the polynomial R G = ∏ ∏ i = 1 m ( Y − − P i ) {\displaystyle R_{G}=\prod _{i=1}^{m}(Y-P_{i})} is invariant under S n . Thus, when expanded, its coefficients are polynomials in the X i that are invariant under the action of the symmetry group and thus may be expressed as polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials. In other words, R G is an irreducible polynomial in Y whose coefficients are polynomial in the coefficients of F . Having the resolvent invariant as a root, it is called a resolvent (sometimes resolvent equation ).

Consider now an irreducible polynomial f ( X ) = X n + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n a i X n − − i = ∏ ∏ i = 1 n ( X − − x i ) , {\displaystyle f(X)=X^{n}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}X^{n-i}=\prod _{i=1}^{n}(X-x_{i}),} with coefficients in a given field K (typically the field of rationals ) and roots x i in an algebraically closed field extension . Substituting the X i by the x i and the coefficients of F by those of f in the above, we get a polynomial R G ( f ) ( Y ) {\displaystyle R_{G}^{(f)}(Y)} , also called resolvent or specialized resolvent in case of ambiguity). If the Galois group of f is contained in G , the specialization of the resolvent invariant is invariant by G and is thus a root of R G ( f ) ( Y ) {\displaystyle R_{G}^{(f)}(Y)} that belongs to K (is rational on K ). Conversely, if R G ( f ) ( Y ) {\displaystyle R_{G}^{(f)}(Y)} has a rational root, which is not a multiple root, the Galois group of f is contained in G .

Terminology [ edit ] There are some variants in the terminology.

Depending on the authors or on the context, resolvent may refer to resolvent invariant instead of to resolvent equation .

A Galois resolvent is a resolvent such that the resolvent invariant is linear in the roots.

The Lagrange resolvent may refer to the linear polynomial ∑ ∑ i = 0 n − − 1 X i ω ω i {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{n-1}X_{i}\omega ^{i}} where ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is a primitive n th root of unity . It is the resolvent invariant of a Galois resolvent for the identity group.

A relative resolvent is defined similarly as a resolvent, but considering only the action of the elements of a given subgroup H of S n , having the property that, if a relative resolvent for a subgroup G of H has a rational simple root and the Galois group of f is contained in H , then the Galois group of f is contained in G . In this context, a usual resolvent is called an absolute resolvent .

Resolvent method [ edit ] The Galois group of a polynomial of degree n {\displaystyle n} is S n {\displaystyle S_{n}} or a proper subgroup of it. If a polynomial is separable and irreducible, then the corresponding Galois group is a transitive subgroup.

Transitive subgroups of S n {\displaystyle S_{n}} form a directed graph: one group can be a subgroup of several groups. One resolvent can tell if the Galois group of a polynomial is a (not necessarily proper) subgroup of given group. The resolvent method is just a systematic way to check groups one by one until only one group is possible. This does not mean that every group must be checked: every resolvent can cancel out many possible groups. For example, for degree five polynomials there is never need for a resolvent of D 5 {\displaystyle D_{5}} : resolvents for A 5 {\displaystyle A_{5}} and M 20 {\displaystyle M_{20}} give desired information.

One way is to begin from maximal (transitive) subgroups until the right one is found and then continue with maximal subgroups of that.
