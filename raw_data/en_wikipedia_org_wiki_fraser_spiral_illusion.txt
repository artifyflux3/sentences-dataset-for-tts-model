[ 1 ] The illusion is also known as the false spiral , or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion . The overlapping black arc segments appear to form a spiral; however, the arcs are a series of concentric circles.

The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands).

[ 2 ] Zöllner's illusion and the café wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations.

The illusion is augmented by the spiral components in the checkered background.  It is a unique illusion, where the observer can verify the concentric strands manually.

[ 3 ] When the strands are highlighted in a different colour, it becomes obvious to the observer that no spiral is present.
