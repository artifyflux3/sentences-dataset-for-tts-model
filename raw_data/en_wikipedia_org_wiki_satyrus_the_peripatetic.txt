He came from Callatis Pontica , as was learned from a Herculaneum papyrus .

[ 1 ] He lived earlier than the reign of Ptolemy VI Philometor (181–146 BC) when his Lives were epitomized by Heraclides Lembus , probably during the 3rd century BC.

[ 2 ] Athenaeus frequently refers to him as a Peripatetic, [ 3 ] but his connection to the Peripatetic school is otherwise unknown. His biographies dealt with many eminent people including kings ( Dionysius the Younger , Philip ), statesmen ( Alcibiades ), orators ( Demosthenes ), poets ( Aeschylus , Sophocles , Euripides ), and philosophers ( Bias of Priene , Chilon of Sparta , Pythagoras , Empedocles , Zeno of Elea , Anaxagoras , Socrates , Diogenes , Anaxarchus , Stilpo ). He also wrote on the population of Alexandria , and a work On Characters ( Περὶ χαρακτήρων ). Fragments of his biography of the Athenian dramatist Euripides were found at the end of a papyrus scroll discovered at Oxyrhynchus in the early twentieth century.
