The original baby jumper consists of a hoop suspended by an elastic strap. More elaborate baby jumpers have a base made of hard plastic sitting in a frame and a suspended fabric seat with two leg holes, often with trays holding toys . The door jumpers lack the tray. There are also mobile play centers ( baby walkers ), which look very similar to baby jumpers, but which have wheels.

History [ edit ] The Jolly Jumper brand refers to a Native American origin, where mothers used cradleboards to keep their infants in when travelling or working. When working outside, the mother could attach the cradleboard to a tree limb using its straps. By pulling the limb, thus causing a bouncing motion, the baby would be soothed.

[ 1 ] Jolly Jumper claims to have invented the baby jumper in 1910, using an axe handle for the spreader; however the baby jumper existed long before that. In the 1880s, various patents were granted for a “new and improved” baby jumpers, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] while in the 1930s, Goodyear foresaw the use of latex for baby jumpers.

[ 5 ] Risks [ edit ] Some professionals [ who?

] warn against potential safety issues when using a jumper for prolonged periods of time, claiming that it could cause muscle imbalance if the baby is placed in a sitting position before they would be able to on their own.

[ 6 ] Another concern is the clamp causing damage to drywall and/or ripping door-casing trim off, due to changes in home construction standards, causing both the jumper and baby to fall to the floor, injuring the baby.

Choice , an Australian consumer organization, warns against the use of door jumpers because of the risk of the door clamps breaking.

[ 7 ] The Government of Canada also warns about the head injuries linked to the use of suspended baby jumpers.
