Further information: List of countries and territories by the United Nations geoscheme 22 geographical subregions as defined by the UNSD.

Antarctica is not shown.

The United Nations geoscheme is a system that divides 248 countries and territories in the world into six continental regions, 22 geographical subregions , and two intermediary regions .

[ 1 ] It was devised by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) based on the M49 coding classification .

[ 2 ] The creators note that "the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".

[ 2 ] The UNSD geoscheme was created for statistical analysis and consists of macro-geographical regions arranged to the extent possible according to continents .

[ 2 ] Within each region, smaller geographical subregions and sometimes intermediary regions contain countries and territories. Countries and territories are also grouped non-geographically into selected economic and other sets, such as the landlocked developing countries , the least developed countries , and the Small Island Developing States .

Antarctica does not comprise any geographical subregions or country-level areas.

The UNSD geoscheme does not set a standard for the entire United Nations System , and it often differs from geographical definitions used by the autonomous United Nations specialized agencies for their own organizational convenience. For instance, the UNSD includes Cyprus and Georgia in Western Asia, yet the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and UNESCO include them in Europe.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] This statistical definition also differs from United Nations Regional Groups .

Alternative groupings include the World Bank regional classification, [ 5 ] CIA World Factbook regions and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers Geographic Regions.

The Unicode CLDR 's "Territory Containment (UN M.49)" includes Taiwan in its presentation of the UN M.49.

[ 9 ] The public domain map data set Natural Earth has metadata in the fields named "region_un" and "subregion" for Taiwan.

The regional split recommended by Lloyd's of London for Eastern Asia (UN statistical divisions of Eastern Asia) contains Taiwan.

[ 10 ] Based on the United Nations statistical divisions, the APRICOT (conference) includes Taiwan in East Asia.

[ 11 ] Studying Website Usability in Asia, Ather Nawaz and Torkil Clemmensen select Asian countries on the basis of United Nations statistical divisions, and Taiwan is also included.

[ 12 ] Taiwan is also included in the UN Geoscheme of Eastern Asia in one systematic review on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

[ 13 ] Note on Northern Asia [ edit ] Main article: North Asia Further information: Siberia and Russian Far East See also: Far North (Russia) and Russian conquest of Siberia This unofficial subregion covers the entire geographical region of Siberia . Since this region as a whole falls under the transcontinental country of Russia , for statistical convenience, Russia is assigned under Eastern Europe by the UNSD, including both European Russia and Asian Russia under a single subregion. Hence, there is no geopolitical entity that is currently grouped under Northern Asia.
