[ 2 ] It was founded in 1925 by the Scottish wood engraver Iain Macnab in his house at 33 Warwick Square in Pimlico , London.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] : 31 From 1925 to 1930 Claude Flight ran it with him, and also taught linocutting there; among his students were Sybil Andrews , Cyril Power , Lill Tschudi and William Greengrass.

[ 4 ] : 400 The school [ edit ] The school had no formal curriculum and students studied what and when they wished. There were day and evening courses: life classes , classes in composition and design, and classes on the history of Modern Art .

Frank Rutter taught a course entitled "From Cézanne to Picasso".

[ 3 ] : 31 Macnab's wife, the dancer Helen Wingrave, gave a dance course.

[ 5 ] : 9 Though there was no formal curriculum, all students attended Claude Flight's linocut classes.

[ 6 ] The Grosvenor School closed in 1940, merging with the Heatherley School of Fine Art .

[ 7 ] Legacy [ edit ] The school did much to revive interest in printmaking in general, and particularly in the linocut, in the years between the Wars.

[ 8 ] Artists associated with it have come to be known as the "Grosvenor School", and their work commands high prices.

[ 9 ] In June–September 2019, the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London hosted the first major exhibition presenting solely the output of the Grosvenor School alumni in a public museum; it was also the first major exhibition outside Australia to have considerable examples of the works by the Australian alumni Ethel Spowers , Dorrit Black and others.
