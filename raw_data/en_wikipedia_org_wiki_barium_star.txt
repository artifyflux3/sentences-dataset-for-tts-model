Barium stars also show enhanced spectral features of carbon , the bands of the molecules CH, CN and C 2 .  The class was originally recognized and defined by William P. Bidelman and Philip Keenan .

[ 1 ] Initially, after their discovery, they were thought to be red giants, but the same chemical signature has been observed in main-sequence stars [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well.

Observational studies of their radial velocity suggested that all barium stars are binary stars .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Observations in the ultraviolet using International Ultraviolet Explorer detected white dwarfs in some barium star systems.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Barium stars are believed to be the result of mass transfer in a binary star system.  The mass transfer occurred when the now-observed giant star was on the main sequence .  Its companion, the donor star, was a carbon star on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and had produced carbon and s-process elements in its interior.  These nuclear fusion products were mixed by convection to its surface.  Some of that matter "polluted" the surface layers of the main-sequence star as the donor star lost mass at the end of its AGB evolution, and it subsequently evolved to become a white dwarf.  These systems are being observed at an indeterminate amount of time after the mass transfer event, when the donor star has long been a white dwarf.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Depending on the initial properties of the binary system, the polluted star can be found at different evolutionary stages.

[ 13 ] During its evolution, the barium star will at times be larger and cooler than the limits of the spectral types G or K.  When this happens, ordinarily such a star is spectral type M , but its s-process excesses may cause it to show its altered composition as another spectral peculiarity.  While the star's surface temperature is in the M-type regime, the star may show molecular features of the s-process element zirconium , zirconium oxide (ZrO) bands.  When this happens, the star will appear as an "extrinsic" S star .

Historically, barium stars posed a puzzle, because in standard stellar evolution theory G and K giants are not far enough along in their evolution to have synthesized carbon and s-process elements and mix them to their surfaces.  The discovery of the stars' binary nature resolved the puzzle, putting the source of their spectral peculiarities into a companion star which should have produced such material.  The mass transfer episode is believed to be quite brief on an astronomical timescale.

Prototypical barium stars include Zeta Capricorni , HR 774 , and HR 4474 .

The CH stars are Population II stars with similar evolutionary state, spectral peculiarities, and orbital statistics, and are believed to be the older, metal-poor analogs of the barium stars.
