The Government of India honored him, in 2012, with Padma Bhushan , the third highest civilian award, for his services to the sciences.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Illustration of the dynamo mechanism that creates the Earth's magnetic field: convection currents of magma in the Earth's outer core, driven by heat flow from the inner core, organized into rolls by the Coriolis force, creates circulating electric currents, which generate the magnetic field.
