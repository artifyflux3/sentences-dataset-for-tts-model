_**The Atlantic**_ is an American magazine and multi-platform publisher based in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") It features articles on politics, foreign affairs, business and the economy, culture and the arts, technology, and science.

It was founded in 1857 in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston") as _**The Atlantic Monthly**_, a literary and cultural magazine that published leading writers' commentary on education, the [abolition of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antislavery_Movement_In_America "Antislavery Movement In America"), and other major political issues of that time. Its founders included [Francis H. Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_H._Underwood "Francis H. Underwood")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-4) and prominent writers [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson"), [Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Sr. "Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr."), [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"), [Harriet Beecher Stowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe "Harriet Beecher Stowe"), and [John Greenleaf Whittier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenleaf_Whittier "John Greenleaf Whittier").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-6)[James Russell Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_Lowell "James Russell Lowell") was its first editor.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-7) During the 19th and 20th centuries, the magazine also published the annual _The Atlantic Monthly [Almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac "Almanac")_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-8) The magazine was purchased in 1999 by businessman [David G. Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_G._Bradley "David G. Bradley"), who fashioned it into a general editorial magazine primarily aimed at serious national readers and "[thought leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_leader "Thought leader")"; in 2017, he sold a majority interest in the publication to [Laurene Powell Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurene_Powell_Jobs "Laurene Powell Jobs")'s [Emerson Collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Collective "Emerson Collective").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-White_2017-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-11)

The magazine was published monthly until 2001, when 11 issues were produced; since 2003, it has published 10 per year. It dropped "Monthly" from the cover with the January/February 2004 issue, and officially changed the name in 2007.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-12) In 2024, it announced that it will resume publishing monthly issues in 2025.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-cnn-20241011-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-14)

In 2016, the periodical was named Magazine of the Year by the [American Society of Magazine Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Magazine_Editors "American Society of Magazine Editors").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-15) In 2022, its writers won [Pulitzer Prizes for feature writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Feature_Writing "Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing") and, in 2022, 2023, and 2024 _The Atlantic_ won the award for general excellence by the American Society of Magazine Editors. In 2024, it was reported that the magazine had crossed one million subscribers[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-cnn-20241011-13) and become profitable, three years after losing $20 million in a single year and laying off 17% of its staff.

As of 2024, the website's executive editor is [Adrienne LaFrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_LaFrance "Adrienne LaFrance"), the editor-in-chief is [Jeffrey Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldberg "Jeffrey Goldberg"), and the CEO is [Nicholas Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Thompson_(editor) "Nicholas Thompson (editor)").

[James Russell Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_Lowell "James Russell Lowell"), the first editor of _The Atlantic_

In the autumn of 1857, [Moses Dresser Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Dresser_Phillips "Moses Dresser Phillips"), a publisher from [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"), created _The Atlantic Monthly_. The plan for the magazine was launched at a dinner party, which was described in a letter by Phillips:

> I must tell you about a little dinner-party I gave about two weeks ago. It would be proper, perhaps, to state the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project, the particulars of which I shall reserve till you come. But to the Party: My invitations included only [R. W. Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson"), [H. W. Longfellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"), [J. R. Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_Lowell "James Russell Lowell"), [Mr. Motley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lothrop_Motley "John Lothrop Motley") (the 'Dutch Republic' man), [O. W. Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Sr. "Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr."), [Mr. Cabot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elliot_Cabot "James Elliot Cabot"), and [Mr. Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_H._Underwood "Francis H. Underwood"), our literary man. Imagine your uncle as the head of such a table, with such guests. The above named were the only ones invited, and they were all present. We sat down at three P.M., and rose at eight. The time occupied was longer by about four hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation, but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had. Leaving myself and 'literary man' out of the group, I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides... Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic, and is read beyond the limits of the English language.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Hale_1898-16)

At that dinner he announced his idea for the magazine:

> Mr. Cabot is much wiser than I am. Dr. Holmes can write funnier verses than I can. Mr. Motley can write history better than I. Mr. Emerson is a philosopher and I am not. Mr. Lowell knows more of the old poets than I. But none of you knows the American people as well as I do.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Hale_1898-16)

_The Atlantic_'s first issue was published in November 1857, and quickly gained notability as one of the finest magazines in the English-speaking world.

In 1878, the magazine absorbed _[The Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Galaxy\_(magazine) "The Galaxy (magazine)")_, a competitor monthly magazine founded a dozen years previously by [William Conant Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Conant_Church "William Conant Church") and his brother [Francis P. Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_P._Church "Francis P. Church"); it had published works by [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "Mark Twain"), [Walt Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman "Walt Whitman"), [Ion Hanford Perdicaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Hanford_Perdicaris "Ion Hanford Perdicaris") and [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-17)

In 1879, _The Atlantic_ had offices in [Winthrop Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop_Square_(Boston) "Winthrop Square (Boston)") in Boston and at 21 [Astor Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Place "Astor Place") in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-18)

In February 1862, _The Atlantic_ was first to publish the "[Battle Hymn of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic "Battle Hymn of the Republic")".

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/1873_AtlanticMonthly_TremontSt_Boston.png/250px-1873_AtlanticMonthly_TremontSt_Boston.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1873_AtlanticMonthly_TremontSt_Boston.png)

The magazine's office Ticknor & Fields at 124 Tremont Street in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"), c. 1868[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-19)

A leading literary magazine, _The Atlantic_ has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists [Julia Ward Howe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe "Julia Ward Howe") ("[Battle Hymn of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic "Battle Hymn of the Republic")" on February 1, 1862), and [William Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist) "William Parker (abolitionist)"), whose [slave narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_narrative "Slave narrative"), "The Freedman's Story" was published in February and March 1866. It also published [Charles W. Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_W._Eliot "Charles W. Eliot")'s "The New Education", a call for practical reform that led to his appointment to the presidency of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") in 1869, works by [Charles Chesnutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Chesnutt "Charles Chesnutt") before he collected them in _[The Conjure Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Conjure\_Woman "The Conjure Woman")_ (1899), and poetry and short stories, and helped launch many national literary careers.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-20)

Editors have recognized major cultural changes and movements. For example, of the emerging writers of the 1920s, [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Ernest Hemingway") had his short story "[Fifty Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Grand "Fifty Grand")" published in the July 1927 edition. Harking back to its abolitionist roots, in its August 1963 edition, at the height of the [civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement"), the magazine published [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.")'s defense of [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience "Civil disobedience"), "[Letter from Birmingham Jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail "Letter from Birmingham Jail")",[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-21) under the headline "The Negro Is Your Brother".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-22)

The magazine has published speculative articles that inspired the development of new technologies. The classic example is [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush "Vannevar Bush")'s essay "[As We May Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think "As We May Think")" (July 1945), which inspired [Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart "Douglas Engelbart") and later [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson "Ted Nelson") to develop the modern [workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation "Workstation") and [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext "Hypertext") technology.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-24)

_The Atlantic Monthly_ founded the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1917; for many years, it was operated in partnership with [Little, Brown and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little,_Brown_and_Company "Little, Brown and Company"). Its published books included _[Drums Along the Mohawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums\_Along\_the\_Mohawk\_(novel) "Drums Along the Mohawk (novel)")_ (1936) and _[Blue Highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue\_Highways "Blue Highways")_ (1982). The press was sold in 1986; today it is an imprint of [Grove Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Atlantic "Grove Atlantic").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-25)

In addition to publishing notable fiction and poetry, _The Atlantic_ has emerged in the 21st century as an influential platform for [longform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-form_journalism "Long-form journalism") storytelling and newsmaker interviews. Influential cover stories have included [Anne Marie Slaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Marie_Slaughter "Anne Marie Slaughter")'s "Why Women Still Can't Have It All" (2012) and [Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta-Nehisi_Coates "Ta-Nehisi Coates")'s "A Case for Reparations" (2014).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-26) In 2015, [Jeffrey Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldberg "Jeffrey Goldberg")'s "Obama Doctrine" was widely discussed by American media and prompted response by many world leaders.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-27)

As of 2022, writers and frequent contributors to the print magazine included [James Fallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows "James Fallows"), Jeffrey Goldberg, Ta-Nehisi Coates, [Caitlin Flanagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Flanagan "Caitlin Flanagan"), [Jonathan Rauch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rauch "Jonathan Rauch"), [McKay Coppins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKay_Coppins "McKay Coppins"), Gillian White, [Adrienne LaFrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_LaFrance "Adrienne LaFrance"), [Vann R. Newkirk II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vann_R._Newkirk_II "Vann R. Newkirk II"), [Derek Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Thompson_(journalist) "Derek Thompson (journalist)"), [David Frum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum "David Frum"), Jennifer Senior, [George Packer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Packer "George Packer"), [Ed Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Yong "Ed Yong"), and James Parker.

On August 2, 2023, it was announced that Jeffrey Goldberg, who had served as editor-in-chief of _The Atlantic_ since 2016, had been named as the tenth moderator of the [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS") news program, _[Washington Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington\_Week "Washington Week")_, and that the politics and culture publication would also enter into an editorial partnership with the television program – which was retitled accordingly as _Washington Week with The Atlantic_ – similar to the earlier collaboration with the [_National Journal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Journal "National Journal").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-PBS_2023-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-30) The first episode under the longer title, and with Goldberg as moderator, was the one broadcast on August 11, 2023.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-31)

Political viewpoint
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Political viewpoint")]

[![Image 6: [icon]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)This section **needs expansion** with: Political views between 1860 and 1960. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic&action=edit&section=). _(May 2025)_

In 1860, three years into publication, _The Atlantic_'s then-editor [James Russell Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_Lowell "James Russell Lowell") endorsed [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)")[Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln") for his first run for president and also endorsed the [abolition of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery "Abolition of slavery").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-32)

In 1964, Edward Weeks wrote on behalf of the editorial board in endorsing [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") President [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "Lyndon B. Johnson") and rebuking Republican [Barry Goldwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater "Barry Goldwater")'s candidacy.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-33)

In 2016, during the [2016 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election "2016 United States presidential election"), the editorial board endorsed a candidate for the third time in the magazine's history, urging readers to support Democratic nominee [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton") in a rebuke of Republican [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")'s candidacy.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-34)

After Trump prevailed in the November 2016 election, the magazine became a strong critic of him. In March 2019, a cover article by editor [Yoni Appelbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoni_Appelbaum "Yoni Appelbaum") called for the [impeachment of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Donald_Trump "Efforts to impeach Donald Trump"): "It's time for Congress to judge the president's fitness to serve."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Appelbaum_2019-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-37)

In September 2020, it published a story, citing several anonymous sources, reporting that Trump referred to dead American soldiers as "losers".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-38) Trump called it a "fake story", and suggested the magazine would soon be out of business.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-40)

In 2020, _The Atlantic_ endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") in the [2020 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election"), and urged its readers to oppose Trump's re-election bid.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-41) In early 2024, _The Atlantic_ published a special 24-article issue titled "If Trump Wins," warning about a potential second term for Trump being worse than his first.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-43) In October, the publication endorsed Democratic nominee [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") in her presidential bid against Trump in the [2024 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election "2024 United States presidential election").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-44)

### _Aspen Ideas Festival_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Aspen Ideas Festival")]

In 2005, _The Atlantic_ and the [Aspen Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Institute "Aspen Institute") launched the [Aspen Ideas Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Ideas_Festival "Aspen Ideas Festival"), a ten-day event in and around the city of [Aspen, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado "Aspen, Colorado").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-45) The annual conference features 350 presenters, 200 sessions, and 3,000 attendees. The event has been called a "political [who's who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Who "Who's Who")" as it often features policymakers, journalists, lobbyists, and [think tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank "Think tank") leaders.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-46)

On January 22, 2008, TheAtlantic.com dropped its [subscriber wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall "Paywall") and allowed users to freely browse its site, including all past archives.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-47) By 2011 _The Atlantic_'s web properties included TheAtlanticWire.com, a news- and opinion-tracking site launched in 2009,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-48) and TheAtlanticCities.com, a stand-alone website started in 2011 that was devoted to global cities and trends.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Welton_2011-49) According to a _[Mashable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashable "Mashable")_ profile in December 2011, "traffic to the three web properties recently surpassed 11 million uniques per month, up a staggering 2500% since _The Atlantic_ brought down its paywall in early 2008."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-50)

In 2009, the magazine launched _The Atlantic Wire_ as a stand-alone [news aggregator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator "News aggregator") site. It was intended as a curated selection of news and opinions from online, print, radio, and television outlets.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Carr_2009-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Garber_2009-53) At its launch, it published [op-eds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed "Op-ed") from across the media spectrum and summarized significant positions in each debate.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Garber_2009-53) It later expanded to feature news and original reporting.

Regular features in the magazine included "What I Read", describing the [media diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_diet "Media diet") of people from entertainment, journalism, and politics; and "Trimming the Times", the feature editor's summary of the best content in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Garber_2011-54)_The Atlantic Wire_ rebranded itself as _The Wire_ in November 2013,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Bazilian_2013-55) and was folded back into _The Atlantic_ the following year.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-56)

In August 2011, it created its video channel.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-57) Initially created as an aggregator, _The Atlantic_'s video component, Atlantic Studios, has since evolved in an in-house production studio that creates custom video series and original documentaries.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-58)

In September 2011, _The Atlantic_ launched _CityLab_, a separate website. Its co-founders included [Richard Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Florida "Richard Florida"), urban theorist and professor. The stand-alone site has been described as exploring and explaining "the most innovative ideas and pressing issues facing today's global cities and neighborhoods."[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-59) In 2014, it was rebranded as _CityLab.com_, and covers transportation, environment, equity, life, and design. Among its offerings are Navigator, "a guide to urban life"; and Solutions, which covers solutions to problems in a dozen topics.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-60)

In December 2011, a new Health Channel launched on TheAtlantic.com, incorporating coverage of food, as well as topics related to the mind, body, sex, family, and public health. Its launch was overseen by Nicholas Jackson, who had previously been overseeing the Life channel and initially joined the website to cover technology.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-61) TheAtlantic.com has also expanded to [visual storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_storytelling "Visual storytelling"), with the addition of the "In Focus" photo blog, curated by Alan Taylor.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-62)

In 2015, TheAtlantic.com launched a dedicated Science section[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-63) and in January 2016 it redesigned and expanded its politics section in conjunction with the 2016 U.S. presidential race.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-64)

In 2015, _CityLab_ and [Univision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision "Univision") launched _CityLab Latino_, which features original journalism in Spanish as well as translated reporting from the English language edition of _CityLab.com_.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-65) The site has not been updated since 2018.

In early December 2019, Atlantic Media sold _CityLab_ to [Bloomberg Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P. "Bloomberg L.P."),[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-66)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-67) which promptly laid off half the staff.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-68) The site was relaunched on June 18, 2020, with few major changes other than new branding and linking the site with other Bloomberg verticals and its data terminal.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-69)

In September 2019, TheAtlantic.com introduced a digital subscription model, restricting unsubscribed readers' access to five free articles per month.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-71)

In June 2020, _The Atlantic_ released its first full-length documentary, _[White Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_Noise\_(2020\_film) "White Noise (2020 film)")_, a film about three [alt-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right "Alt-right") activists.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-72)

Praise, retractions, legal issues, and controversies
----------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Praise, retractions, legal issues, and controversies")]

In June 2006, the _[Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago\_Tribune "Chicago Tribune")_ named _The Atlantic_ one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as the "150-year-old granddaddy of periodicals" because "it keeps us smart and in the know" with cover stories on the then-forthcoming fight over _[Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe\_v.\_Wade "Roe v. Wade")_. It also lauded regular features such as "Word Fugitives" and "Primary Sources" as "cultural barometers".[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-73)

On January 14, 2013, _The Atlantic_'s website published "[sponsor content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising "Native advertising")" promoting [David Miscavige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miscavige "David Miscavige"), the leader of the [Church of Scientology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology "Church of Scientology"). While the magazine had previously published advertising looking like articles, this was widely criticized. The page comments were moderated by the marketing team, not by editorial staff, and comments [critical of the church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Scientology "Criticism of Scientology") were being removed. Later that day, _The Atlantic_ removed the piece from its website and issued an apology.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Raabe-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Wemple_2013-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Stelter-76)

In 2019, the magazine published an expose on the allegations against movie director [Bryan Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer "Bryan Singer") that "sent Singer's career into a tailspin". It was originally contracted to _[Esquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire\_(magazine) "Esquire (magazine)")_ magazine, but the writers moved it there due to what _New York Times_ reporter [Ben Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist) "Ben Smith (journalist)") described as [Hearst magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_Communications "Hearst Communications")' "timid" nature. "There's not a lot of nuance here", [Jeffrey Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldberg "Jeffrey Goldberg") said. "They [spiked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(journalism) "Spike (journalism)") a story that should have been published in the [public interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest "Public interest") for reasons unknown."[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-77)

In June 2020, _The Atlantic_ faced legal action in Japan that claimed defamation and invasion of privacy in the article "When the Presses Stop" by [Molly Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ball "Molly Ball"), published in the January/February 2018 edition, which led to numerous removals, corrections and clarifications after a settlement was reached in January 2024. The lawsuit highlighted [fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking "Fact-checking") and ethical concerns, bringing attention to the magazine's editorial practices.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-78)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Wemple_2024-80)

On November 1, 2020, _The Atlantic_ retracted an article, "The Mad, Mad World of Niche Sports Among [Ivy League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League "Ivy League")–Obsessed Parents", after an inquiry by _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Washington\_Post "The Washington Post")_. An 800-word editor's note said, "We cannot attest to the trustworthiness and credibility of the author, and therefore we cannot attest to the veracity of the article." The article's author, freelancer [Ruth Shalit Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Shalit_Barrett "Ruth Shalit Barrett"), had left the staff of _[The New Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Republic "The New Republic")_ in 1999 amid allegations of [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism "Plagiarism").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Levenson_2020-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Wemple_2020-82) On January 7, 2022, Barrett sued the magazine for defamation. The lawsuit claimed _The Atlantic_ misrepresented Barrett's background and destroyed her journalistic career through what it publicly said about her.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-83)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-84) In legal filings, Barrett argued that _The Atlantic_'s handling of allegations and errors in another article written by [Molly Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ball "Molly Ball") demonstrated inconsistency in the magazine's editorial standards and accountability measures. Barrett asserted that the factual inaccuracies and ethical violations in Ball's piece, as highlighted by a separate defamation lawsuit that resulted in a settlement and numerous retractions and corrections to Ball's story, were “transgressions far more numerous and incomparably worse” than any mistakes attributed to her own work.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-85)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Wemple_2024-80)

On February 5, 2024, _The Atlantic_ cut ties with contributor [Yascha Mounk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yascha_Mounk "Yascha Mounk") after he was accused of rape. He called the allegation "categorically untrue."[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-86)

In 2025, national-security leaders in the Donald Trump administration [accidentally included _The Atlantic_ editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a group chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_group_chat_leak "United States government group chat leak") where they organized and strategized upcoming military strikes on the [Houthis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis "Houthis").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-87)

Ownership and editors
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Atlantic&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Ownership and editors")]

By its third year, it was published by [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston") publishing house [Ticknor and Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticknor_and_Fields "Ticknor and Fields"), which later became part of [Houghton Mifflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houghton_Mifflin "Houghton Mifflin"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] based in the city known for literary culture. The magazine was purchased in 1908 by editor at the time, [Ellery Sedgwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Sedgwick "Ellery Sedgwick"), and remained in Boston.

In 1980, the magazine was acquired by [Mortimer Zuckerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Zuckerman "Mortimer Zuckerman"), property magnate and founder of [Boston Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Properties "Boston Properties"), who became its chairman. On September 27, 1999, Zuckerman transferred ownership of the magazine to [David G. Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_G._Bradley "David G. Bradley"), owner of the [National Journal Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Journal_Group "National Journal Group"), which focused on [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") and [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") news. Bradley had promised that the magazine would stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, as it did for the next five-and-a-half years.

In April 2005, however, the publishers announced that the editorial offices would be moved from their longtime home at 77 North Washington Street in Boston to join the company's advertising and circulation divisions in Washington, D.C.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Feeney_2005-88) Later in August, Bradley told _[The New York Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Observer "The New York Observer")_ that the move was not made to save money—near-term savings would be $200,000–$300,000, a relatively small amount that would be swallowed by severance-related spending—but instead would serve to create a hub in Washington, D.C., where the top minds from all of Bradley's publications could collaborate under the [Atlantic Media Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Media_Company "Atlantic Media Company") umbrella. Few of the Boston staff agreed to move, and Bradley then commenced an open search for a new editorial staff.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-89)

In 2006, Bradley hired [James Bennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bennet_(journalist) "James Bennet (journalist)"), the [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") bureau chief for _The New York Times_, as editor-in-chief. Bradley also hired Jeffrey Goldberg and [Andrew Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sullivan "Andrew Sullivan") as writers for the magazine.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-Kurtz_2007-90)

In 2008, Jay Lauf joined the organization as publisher and vice-president; as of 2017, he was publisher and president of _[Quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz\_(publication) "Quartz (publication)")_.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-91)

In early 2014, Bennet and Bob Cohn became co-presidents of _The Atlantic_, and Cohn became the publication's sole president in March 2016 when Bennet was tapped to lead _The New York Times_'s editorial page.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-92)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-93) Jeffrey Goldberg was named editor-in-chief in October 2016.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-94)

On July 28, 2017, _The Atlantic_ announced that [Laurene Powell Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurene_Powell_Jobs "Laurene Powell Jobs") (the widow of former [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") chairman and CEO [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs")) had acquired majority ownership through her [Emerson Collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Collective "Emerson Collective") organization, with a staff member of Emerson Collective, Peter Lattman, being immediately named as vice chairman of _The Atlantic_. David G. Bradley and Atlantic Media retained a minority share position in this sale.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-95)

In May 2019, technology journalist Adrienne LaFrance became executive editor.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-96)

In December 2020, former _[Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired\_(magazine) "Wired (magazine)")_ editor-in-chief [Nicholas Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Thompson_(editor) "Nicholas Thompson (editor)") was named CEO of _The Atlantic_.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic#cite_note-97)

In 2022, _The Atlantic_ moved its offices to [The Wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wharf_(Washington,_D.C.) "The Wharf (Washington, D.C.)") in Washington, D.C.'s [Southwest Waterfront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Waterfront "Southwest Waterfront") neighborhood.
