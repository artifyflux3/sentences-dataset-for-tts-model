[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was an important figure in the study of quaternions .

[ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Joly was born at St Catherine's Rectory, Hop Hill, Tullamore , County Offaly , the eldest of six children of Rev. John Swift Joly (1818-1887) and Elizabeth Slator (1835-1904). He was a second cousin to John Joly . He was educated at Galway Grammar School. In 1882, he was enrolled at Trinity College Dublin on a mathematical scholarship and graduated with first place in mathematics in 1886. Winning a studentship and following his great interest in experimental physics, he moved to Berlin to work in Helmholtz ’s laboratory.

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] In 1897, Joly was appointed Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin . Although there was some dispute as to his suitability, his mathematical skill was recognised, particularly his work on the mathematics of William Rowan Hamilton .

Over the next five years, he wrote numerous mathematical papers, particularly on the applicability of the theory of quaternions to several areas of mathematics: theory of strain, spherical harmonics , hydrodynamics and electromagnetism .

In 1900, he went on the RIA/RDS eclipse expedition to Spain and later took part in the British Association visit to South Africa in 1905.

In 1902, he became Secretary of the Royal Irish Academy .

Personal life [ edit ] On 20 March 1897, Joly married Jessie Sophie Meade. They had three daughters.

A keen member of the Alpine Club , he spent his holidays in the Alps , scaling the most difficult peaks. He was especially fond of rock climbing.

Awards and honours [ edit ] 1895: Elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy .

1898: Elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society .

1904: Elected a fellow of the Royal Society .

Death [ edit ] Shortly after his return from South Africa, he and his daughter contracted typhoid . He died on 4 January 1906. His daughter survived.

[ 4 ] He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.
