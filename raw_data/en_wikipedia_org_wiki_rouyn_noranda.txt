rouyn-noranda.qc.ca Rouyn-Noranda ( French pronunciation: [ʁwɛ̃ nɔʁɑ̃da] ; 2021 population 42,313) is a city on Osisko Lake in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec , Canada.

The city of Rouyn-Noranda is  coextensive with a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec of the same name. Their geographical code is 86.

History [ edit ] City Hall The city of Rouyn (named for Jean-Baptiste Rouyn , a captain in the Régiment Royal Roussillon of Louis-Joseph de Montcalm ) [ 6 ] appeared after copper was discovered in 1917. Noranda (a contraction of " Nor th C an a da ") was created later around the Horne mine and foundry . Both were officially constituted as cities in 1926, then merged in 1986.

[ citation needed ] Rouyn Noranda seen from space Since 1966, Rouyn and Noranda constitute the capital of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. It is also the seat of Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT) since 1983.

[ citation needed ] The population tends to increase or decrease dramatically depending on the economic situation. The city's population dropped by 5 per cent between the 1996 and 2001 census, before increasing slightly by 0.8 per cent for the 2006 census . This more closely parallels the demographic patterns of Northern Ontario than those of Quebec during this period. Rouyn-Noranda also has other cultural affiliations with Northern Ontario, being the only municipality in Quebec that holds a membership in the Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario .

[ citation needed ] The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rouyn-Noranda was established on February 9, 1974, by Pope Paul VI, with Mgr. Jean-Guy Hamelin as its first bishop.  It is part of the Metropolitan Province of Gatineau . Mgr. Dorylas Moreau was appointed as bishop on November 30, 2001, replacing Mgr. Hamelin. On September 15, 2003, a decree moved the cathedral from Saint-Michel-Archange Church to Saint-Joseph Church.

These were: 
Arntfield, [ 7 ] Bellecombe, Beaudry, Cadillac, Cléricy, Cloutier, D'Alembert, Destor, Évain, Lac-Montanier, Lac-Surimau, McWatters, Mont-Brun, Montbeillard, Rapides-des-Cèdres, Rollet, and the former Rouyn-Noranda.
