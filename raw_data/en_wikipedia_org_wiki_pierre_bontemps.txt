Pierre Bontemps (c. 1505–1568) was a French sculptor known for his funeral monuments ; [ 1 ] he was, with Germain Pilon , one of the  pre-eminent sculptors of the French Renaissance .

He executed most of the bas-reliefs on the tomb of King Francis I of France , representing the French victories at the battle of Marignano and the battle of Ceresole .

[ 2 ] His also are the statues of the king, Queen Claude , the Dauphin, and Louis XII and Anne of Brittany on Louis' tomb in the Basilica of Saint-Denis . The figures from the tomb of Charles de Maigny (c. 1556) now reside in the Musée du Louvre .

[ 3 ] In 1936, a sale of contents from the chateau of Monchy-Humières included a full-length marble tomb which had been used as a garden ornament. Originally thought to be of Louis, duc d'Humières (1628–1694), it was in fact Jean III d'Humières (died 1553), executed by Bontemps. This is also in the Louvre.
