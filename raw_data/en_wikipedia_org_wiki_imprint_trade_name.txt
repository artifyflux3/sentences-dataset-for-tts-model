A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, often using the different names as brands to market works to various demographic consumer segments .

[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] An imprint of a publisher is a trade name —a name that a business uses for trading commercial products or services—under which a work is published . Imprints typically have a defining character or mission . In some cases, the diversity results from the takeover of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company.

In the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels.

Electronic Arts ' (EA) 2008 CEO, John Riccitiello , stated that, with the establishing of Rockstar, Take-Two Interactive effectively invented the "label" corporate structure, which EA followed into in 2008.

[ 2 ] This model has influenced rivals including Activision Blizzard , ZeniMax , Electronic Arts from 2008 to 2018, Warner Bros. Interactive , Embracer Group , and Koei Tecmo . Take-Two have had such models in place since 1997–1998. Take-Two is seen as "a game holding company with autonomous game publishing and development subsidiaries".

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Independently-owned game publishers like Devolver Digital also use the word "label" to describe themselves.

[ citation needed ] Use [ edit ] A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, with the different imprints often used by the publisher to market works to different demographic consumer segments . For example, the objective of Viking —an imprint of the Penguin Group —is "[t]o publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest".
