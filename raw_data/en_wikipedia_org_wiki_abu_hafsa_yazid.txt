684–685 ).

Background and career [ edit ] Yazid's full name is not known; Abu Hafsa means "father of Hafsa" (an Arabic kunya ). Abu Hafsa Yazid's origins are unclear; he may have been either Persian or Jewish .

[ 1 ] He may have been taken prisoner as a youth in the capture of Istakhr in ca 650 CE, and later sold to the Caliph . Marwan freed him on the day of the assassination of Uthman ibn Affan (17 June 656). Sources vary as to whether Abu Hafsa Yazid converted to Islam .

[ 2 ] Marwan assigned Yazid to posts including taxation in Medina . He married the daughter of the amir of al-Yamama , and among their descendants were several prominent poets of the early Islamic period, including Marwan ibn Abi Hafsa and Marwan ibn Abi al-Janub .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Abu Hafsa Yazid is sometimes described as court physician to the Caliph Umar I around the year 643 CE, [ 4 ] however this may be an error based on writings by later Arab historians , as he is not called a physician in the earliest texts.
