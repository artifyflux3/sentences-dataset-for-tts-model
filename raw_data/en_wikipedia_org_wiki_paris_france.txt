Etymology See Wiktionary for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.

The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum (' Lutetia of the Parisii ') and is later attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from * luto- ('marsh, swamp').

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 17 ] The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii , a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period .

[ 20 ] The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre , it may derive from the Celtic root pario- ('cauldron').

[ 20 ] Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as * kwar-is-io -.

[ 21 ] Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier * kwar-sā .

[ 17 ] In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology .

Residents of the city are known in English as Parisians and in French as Parisiens ( [paʁizjɛ̃] ⓘ ). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ( [paʁiɡo] ⓘ ).

[ note 1 ] [ 22 ] History Main article: History of Paris For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Paris .

Origins Main article: Lutetia The Parisii people inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the Île de la Cité , which gradually became an important trading centre.

[ 25 ] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.

[ 26 ] Gold coins minted by the Parisii , 1st century BC Julius Caesar conquered the Paris Basin for the Roman Republic in 52 BC and began the Roman settlement on Paris's Left Bank .

[ 27 ] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum , "Lutetia of the Parisii", modern French Lutèce ). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre .

[ 28 ] By the end of the Western Roman Empire , the town was known as Parisius , a Latin name that would later become Paris in French.

[ 29 ] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis , the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin "Hill of Martyrs"), later " Montmartre ", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis , and many French kings are buried there.

[ 30 ] The Wall of Philippe Auguste , oldest city wall in Paris Clovis the Frank , the first king of the Merovingian dynasty , made the city his capital from 508.

[ 31 ] As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845 , but Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886) , for which the then Count of Paris ( comte de Paris ), Odo of France , was elected king of West Francia .

[ 32 ] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet , Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks ( duc des Francs ), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.

[ 30 ] High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV See also: Paris in the Middle Ages , Paris in the 16th century , and Paris in the 17th century The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle , viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410) By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.

[ 33 ] The Palais de la Cité , the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII , Maurice de Sully , bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.

After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century, [ 34 ] Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles ) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville) .

[ 35 ] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.

In the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.

[ 36 ] In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.

[ 37 ] [ 33 ] With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.

[ 38 ] By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by merde , the French word for "shit".

[ 39 ] The Hôtel de Sens ( c.

15th–16th), former residence of the Archbishop of Sens During the Hundred Years' War , Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; [ 40 ] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, [ 41 ] it would remain under English occupation until 1436.

In the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion , Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League , the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV , after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf , built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace , and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges . In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.

[ 44 ] During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu , chief minister of Louis XIII , was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne , and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal . After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal .

[ 45 ] Lutetia Parisiorum vulgo Paris, Plan de Paris en 1657, Jan Janssonius Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles , in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française , the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences . To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards .

[ 46 ] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations , the Place Vendôme , the Place des Victoires , and Les Invalides .

[ 47 ] 18th and 19th centuries See also: Paris in the 18th century , Paris during the Second Empire , and Haussmann's renovation of Paris Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.

[ 48 ] A new boulevard named the Champs-Élysées extended the city west to Étoile , [ 49 ] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.

[ 50 ] The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution . On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides , acquiring thousands of guns, with which it stormed the Bastille , a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune , or city council, met in the Hôtel de Ville and elected a Mayor , the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly , on 15 July.

[ 51 ] Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by guillotine in the Reign of Terror , along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.

[ 52 ] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised , and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.

[ 53 ] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 ( coup d'état du 18 brumaire ), when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.

[ 54 ] The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.

[ 55 ] Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe , and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq , Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts .

[ 55 ] The Eiffel Tower , under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians—and the world—with its modernity.

During the Restoration , the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille ) brought to power a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I . The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.

[ 55 ] In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris. His successor, Napoleon III , alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann , launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes .

[ 56 ] In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.

[ 56 ] During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army . Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28 March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the " Bloody Week " at the end of May 1871.

[ 57 ] In the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition , which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III , the Grand Palais , the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.

[ 58 ] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism ( Émile Zola ) and Symbolism ( Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine ), and of Impressionism in art ( Courbet , Manet , Monet , Renoir ).

[ 59 ] 20th and 21st centuries See also: Paris in the Belle Époque , Paris during the First World War , Paris between the Wars (1919–1939) , Paris in World War II , and History of Paris (1946–2000) By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.

[ 60 ] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso , Modigliani , and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism , Cubism and abstract art , [ 61 ] [ 62 ] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.

[ 63 ] During the First World War , Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne . The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns .

[ 64 ] In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles , Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway , Igor Stravinsky , James Joyce , Josephine Baker , Eva Kotchever , Henry Miller , Anaïs Nin , Sidney Bechet [ 65 ] and Salvador Dalí .

[ 66 ] In the years after the peace conference , the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh , Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor .

[ 67 ] General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944 On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an " open city ".

[ 68 ] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv , from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz . None of the children came back.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army . General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville .

[ 71 ] In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter . Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.

[ 74 ] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.

[ 75 ] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse , the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 m (689 ft) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.

[ 76 ] The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.

[ 77 ] A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.

[ 78 ] Most of the postwar presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand had the Opéra Bastille built (1985–1989), the new site of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989) in La Défense , as well as the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly .

[ 79 ] In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008.

[ 80 ] In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib' , a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine , which he inaugurated in June 2013.

[ 81 ] Demonstrators at the Place de la République , Paris, 11 January 2015, during the Republican marches after the Charlie Hebdo shooting In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris , with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.

[ 82 ] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express , totalling 205 km (127 mi) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.

[ 83 ] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.

[ 84 ] In January 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed attacks across the Paris region.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.

[ 87 ] In November of the same year, terrorist attacks , claimed by ISIL, [ 88 ] killed 130 people and injured more than 350.

[ 89 ] On 22 April 2016, the Paris Agreement was signed by 196 nations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in an aim to limit the effects of climate change below 2 °C.

[ 90 ] In 2017, billionaire François Pinault received a 50‑year lease to convert the historic Bourse de Commerce into a contemporary art museum , overseen by Japanese architect Tadao Ando .

[ 91 ] Construction was delayed by COVID, and it finally opened in May 2021.

[ 92 ] On 15 April 2019, the historic Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire beginning in the eaves of it's roof.

[ 93 ] The Notre-Dame Fire engulfed the spire and most of the roof. Firefighters were able to control the blaze, saving the main structure including the bell towers and rose windows , and there were no injuries.

[ 93 ] The Notre-Dame Cathedral reopened in 7 December 2024 following over 2,000 days of work involving over 2,000 workers and millions of Euros in donations pledged by wealthy citizens used for the project.

[ 94 ] In terms of international connectedness, as of 2024, Paris was one of eight cities worldwide that was classified as an "Alpha+" city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network .

[ 95 ] Geography Location Main article: Geography of Paris A 2022 satellite image of Paris, by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine , whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité , which form the oldest part of Paris. The river's mouth on the English Channel ( La Manche ) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from Paris. Paris is spread widely on both banks of the river.

[ 96 ] Overall, Paris is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level . Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).

[ 97 ] Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes , Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km 2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique .

[ 98 ] Paris's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 gave it its modern form, and created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km 2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km 2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km 2 (41 sq mi).

[ 99 ] The metropolitan area is 2,300 km 2 (890 sq mi).

[ 96 ] Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral , Paris by road is 450 km (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 km (178 mi) south of Calais , 305 km (190 mi) southwest of Brussels , 774 km (481 mi) north of Marseille , 385 km (239 mi) northeast of Nantes , and 135 km (84 mi) southeast of Rouen .

[ 100 ] Climate Main article: Climate of Paris Autumn in Paris Paris has an oceanic climate within the Köppen climate classification , typical of western Europe. This climate type features cool winters, with frequent rain and overcast skies, and mild to warm summers. Very hot and very cold temperatures and weather extremes are rare in this type of climate.

[ 101 ] [ failed verification ] Summer days are usually mild and pleasant, with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.

[ 102 ] Each year there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days, and rarely cooled down at night.

[ 103 ] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights, but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.

[ 104 ] In winter, sunshine is scarce. Days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing, with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).

[ 105 ] Light night frosts are quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). Paris sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.

[ 106 ] Paris has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. Paris is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F), on 25 July 2019.

[ 107 ] The lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F), on 10 December 1879.

In 1974, Paris was granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly.

[ 112 ] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac , elected March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo , a socialist , first elected in April 2014 , [ 113 ] and re-elected in June 2020 .

[ 114 ] The Hôtel de Ville , or city hall The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters. The voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), which elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement is allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements, to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system .

[ 115 ] Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote, using the highest averages method .

[ 115 ] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.

[ 116 ] Prior to the 2020 Paris municipal election , each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council ( conseil d'arrondissement ), which elects an arrondissement mayor.

[ 117 ] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris, and members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.

[ 112 ] The creation of Paris Centre , a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election. The other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.

[ 118 ] Métropole du Grand Paris A map of the Greater Paris Metropolis and its governing territories In January 2016, the Métropole du Grand Paris , or simply Grand Paris , came into existence.

[ 119 ] It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs, Hauts-de-Seine , Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne , plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne , which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 km 2 (314 sq mi). In 2015, it had a population of 6.945 million people.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.

[ 119 ] [ 121 ] In January 2016, Patrick Ollier was elected the first president of the metropolitan council. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.

[ 122 ] Regional government The Region of Île de France , including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council , composed of 209 members representing its different communes. In December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse , narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.

[ 123 ] National government The Élysée Palace , official residence of the President of France As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government . For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace .

[ 124 ] The Prime Minister 's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon .

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.

[ 127 ] Both houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate , meets in the Palais du Luxembourg . The more important lower house, the National Assembly , meets in the Palais Bourbon . The President of the Senate , the second-highest public official in France, with the President of the Republic being the sole superior, resides in the Petit Luxembourg , a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.

[ 128 ] The Palais-Royal, residence of the Conseil d'État France's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation , the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité .

[ 129 ] The Conseil d'État , which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement .

[ 130 ] The Constitutional Council , an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.

[ 131 ] Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations, including UNESCO , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , the International Chamber of Commerce , the Paris Club , the European Space Agency , the International Energy Agency , the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie , the European Union Institute for Security Studies , the International Bureau of Weights and Measures , the International Exhibition Bureau , and the International Federation for Human Rights .

Police force Gendarmerie motorcyclists The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris , a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior . It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade . Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité .

[ 132 ] There are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.

[ 132 ] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of Paris when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie , a branch of the French Armed Forces . Their police operations are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.

[ 133 ] Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

The Seine river flows from the north-east to the south-west, right to left Urbanism and architecture See also: Architecture of Paris , Haussmann's renovation of Paris , Religious buildings in Paris , and List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region The Rue de Rivoli The Place des Vosges , the oldest planned square in Paris Paris is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. As a result, even its earliest history is visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty plays a large part in giving Paris the reputation it has today.

[ 135 ] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, Paris  was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine . Of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité . A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes .

Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann . Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre , created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey " Paris stone ". They built the major parks around central Paris.

[ 136 ] The high residential population of the city centre makes Paris much different from most other major western cities.

[ 137 ] Paris's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, [ 138 ] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned.

[ 138 ] The 210 m (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973, [ 139 ] Since 2011, this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie .

Housing Front de Seine development along the river Seine In 2018, the most expensive residential street in Paris by average price per square metre, was Avenue Montaigne , at 22,372 euros per square metre.

[ 140 ] In 2011, the number of residences in the City of Paris was 1,356,074. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty.

[ 141 ] Sixty-two percent of buildings date from 1949 and before, with 20 percent built between 1949 and 1974. 18 percent of Paris buildings were built after 1974.

[ 142 ] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, which is less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation, against 47 percent for the wider Île-de-France region. Most of Paris's population rent their residence.

[ 142 ] In 2017, social or public housing was 19.9 percent of Paris's residences. Its distribution varies widely throughout Paris, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.

[ 143 ] 19th Arrondissement Residential Area In February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.

[ 144 ] Suburbs Western Paris in 2016, photographed by a SkySat satellite West of Paris seen from Tour Montparnasse , 2019 Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent "District de la région parisienne" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed " Île-de-France " in 1977, but this abbreviated "Paris region" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.

[ 145 ] Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began in January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.

[ 119 ] Paris's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth.

Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs mésentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961.

[ 146 ] Two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban "villes nouvelles" ("new cities") [ 147 ] and the RER commuter train network.

[ 148 ] Many other suburban residential districts ( grands ensembles ) were built between the 1960s and 1970s, to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population.

[ 149 ] These districts were socially mixed at first, [ 150 ] but few residents actually owned their homes. The growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s.

[ 151 ] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere, and their repopulation by those with more limited resources.

[ 151 ] These areas, quartiers sensibles ("sensitive quarters"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of Paris, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department , and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department . Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes ( Essonne ), in Mureaux , Mantes-la-Jolie ( Yvelines ), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 "ville nouvelle" political initiative.

[ 152 ] The Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class, dotted with wealthy islands in areas of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.

[ 153 ] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Paris City of Paris population pyramid in 2022 2019 Census Paris Region ( Île-de-France ) [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Country/territory of birth Population Metropolitan France 9,215,134 Algeria 330,935 Morocco 253,518 Portugal 234,399 Tunisia 127,827 Guadeloupe 81,269 Martinique 75,959 China 71,500 Turkey 67,982 Mali 66,085 Côte d'Ivoire 63,810 Senegal 60,124 Italy 58,141 Romania 53,848 Democratic Republic of Congo 52,449 Spain 45,828 Sri Lanka 45,786 Cameroon 45,370 Other countries/territories Republic of the Congo 38,651 Haiti 36,685 Poland 35,871 Vietnam 35,251 Cambodia 30,321 Réunion 30,077 India 29,623 Serbia 25,632 Lebanon 21,066 Madagascar 21,002 Germany 20,523 Pakistan 20,178 Russia 19,019 Mauritius 18,840 Guinea 18,709 Brazil 17,887 United Kingdom 17,789 United States 17,583 Other countries and territories 857,720 The population of the City of Paris was 2,102,650 in January 2023, down from 2,165,423 in January 2022, according to the INSEE , the French statistical agency. Between 2013 and 2023, the population fell by 122,919, or about five percent. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo , declared that this illustrated the "de-densification" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.

[ 158 ] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in Paris, due to short-term rentals for tourism.

[ 159 ] Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, after Berlin , Madrid and Rome .

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls "urban audit core cities".

[ 160 ] The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.

[ 161 ] The principal reasons are a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation , high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. Paris's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century. The population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.

[ 162 ] [ 163 ] Paris is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne , and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area ), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017 made it the largest urban area in the European Union .

[ 164 ] [ 165 ] City-influenced commuter activity reaches further, in a statistical aire d'attraction de Paris , "functional area", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area , [ 166 ] ), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017, [ 167 ] 19.6% of the population of France, [ 168 ] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone .

[ 165 ] In 2012, according to Eurostat , the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union. There were 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits, the NUTS-3 statistical area, ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. In the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine , Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne , had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.

[ 169 ] [ verification needed ] Migration Under French law, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth are defined as immigrants. In the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe , 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb , 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt , 5,059 from Turkey , 91,297 from Asia outside Turkey, 38,858 from the Americas , and 1,365 from the South Pacific .

[ 170 ] In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia outside Turkey, 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.

[ 171 ] In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris), and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region ( Île-de-France ).

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] In 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%). These figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.

Cemeteries The Paris Catacombs hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.

During the Roman era, Paris's main cemetery was located on the outskirts of the left bank settlement. This changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth, many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery , were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines , today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.

[ 317 ] [ 318 ] After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution, in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.

[ 319 ] Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise , Montmartre , Montparnasse , and later Passy . New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen , the Cimetière parisien de Pantin , also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin - Bobigny , the Cimetière parisien d' Ivry , and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux .

In 1970, it was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities , following the student demonstrations in 1968 . Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.

[ 324 ] The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements . Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris. The École Normale Supérieure , PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement .
