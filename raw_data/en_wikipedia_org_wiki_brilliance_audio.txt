History Main article: History of Amazon 1994–2009 Jeff Bezos's home in Bellevue, Washington , where the company was founded in 1994 Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos after he relocated from New York City to Bellevue, Washington , near Seattle , to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington , as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon . Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon , and Boulder, Colorado .

[ 23 ] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos's house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994.

[ 24 ] The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.

[ 23 ] [ 25 ] Bezos retained the URL www.relentless.com, which he purchased when considering a name for the company; it redirects to the Amazon homepage.

[ 26 ] Amazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.

[ 31 ] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006, [ 32 ] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008, [ 33 ] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called "third-party sellers") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.

[ 34 ] 2010–present Amazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.

[ 35 ] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.

[ 36 ] Amazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic , hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada .

[ 37 ] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to "run normal shifts" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies, [ 40 ] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.

[ 41 ] On February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.

[ 44 ] On November 8, 2023, a plan was adopted for Jeff Bezos to sell approximately 50 million shares of the company over the next year (the deadline for the entire sales plan is January 31, 2025). The first step was the sale of 12 million shares for about $2 billion.

[ 45 ] On February 26, 2024, Amazon became a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .

[ 46 ] On December 19, 2024, Amazon workers, led by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union, went on strike against Amazon in at least four US states, with workers in other facilities in the United States being welcomed to join the strike as well.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] On April 2, 2025, it was reported by various media outlets that Amazon had made a bid to buy the social media platform TikTok in order to save the platform from facing a US ban set to take effect on Saturday, April 5, 2025. The cost of the bid has yet to be announced.

In 2004, Toys "R" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys "R" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys "R" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys "R" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website.

[ 73 ] In November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Greater Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas , Houston , New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.

[ 74 ] In June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.

[ 84 ] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.

[ 85 ] Third-party sellers Amazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.

[ 86 ] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.

[ 87 ] Affiliate program Publishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has "over 900,000 members" in its affiliate programs.

[ 88 ] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads .

In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.

[ 91 ] Product reviews See also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews Amazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers, Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: "...

the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used ." The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough "helpful" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.

[ 92 ] When publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was "taking a different approach...we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly...to let truth loose".

[ 93 ] There have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients [ 94 ] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.

Amazon sales rank The Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a "best sellers list" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.

[ 95 ] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.

[ 95 ] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of "movers and shakers"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.

[ 96 ] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the BookScan service to verified authors.

[ 97 ] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR, [ 98 ] though Amazon states: Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources — Amazon.com Help [ 99 ] Physical stores Amazon Fresh store in Sevenoaks , United Kingdom In November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle . The store was 5,500 square feet and prices for all products matched those on its website.

[ 100 ] All of its locations were closed in 2022 along with other retail locations under the "Amazon 4-Star" brand.

[ 102 ] In July 2016, the company announced that it was opening a 1,100,000 ft (335,280.0 m) square foot facility in Palmer Township in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania . As of 2024, Amazon is Lehigh Valley region's third-largest employer.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] In August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco , as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.

[ 105 ] In 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the US and the United Kingdom .

[ 106 ] Hardware and services Amazon Fire tablet Amazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa , Amazon Music , and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of electronic paper e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets.

[ 107 ] In January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows U.S.

Junglee started as a virtual database that was used to extract information from the Internet and deliver it to enterprise applications. As it progressed, Junglee started to use its database technology to create a single window marketplace on the Internet by making every item from every supplier available for purchase. Web shoppers could locate, compare and transact millions of products from across the Internet shopping mall through one window.

[ 141 ] Amazon acquired Junglee in 1998, and the website Junglee.com was launched in India in February 2012 [ 142 ] as a comparison-shopping website. It curated and enabled searching for a diverse variety of products such as clothing, electronics, toys, jewelry, and video games, among others, across thousands of online and offline sellers.

Amazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed "Amazon Hub Locker+" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.

[ 156 ] Rakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the United States Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS .

[ 157 ] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States ).

[ 158 ] Supply chain Amazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware . Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.

[ 159 ] [ 160 ] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics .

[ 161 ] In September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.

[ 186 ] These annual letters gave an "invaluable window" into the famously "secretive" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, "customer obsession") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers. He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.

[ 188 ] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for "all teams" to "expose their data and functionality" through service interfaces "designed from the ground up to be externalizable". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.

An article published by Time in the wake of social media website Parler 's termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet.

[ 209 ] In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.

[ 210 ] Companies like Groupon , eBay and Taap have countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.

[ 211 ] [ 212 ] The company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone , "that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle." [ 59 ] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.

[ 213 ] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.

[ 214 ] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.

Jim Jordan (acting on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee ) subpoenaed emails between the company and the Biden Administration.

[ 218 ] An Amazon Prime truck blocking a bike lane in Washington, D.C.

Amazon Prime has been criticized for its vehicles systemically double parking , blocking bike lanes , and otherwise violating traffic laws while dropping off packages, contributing to traffic congestion and endangering other road users.

[ 219 ] [ 220 ] [ 221 ] [ 222 ] Jane Friedman [ 223 ] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads . Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author's complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled "I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires)." [ 224 ] [ 225 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] In 2024, following years of criticism for providing law enforcement footage in the custody of Ring (a home security company owned by Amazon) without a warrant, Ring has halted this practice.

[ 228 ] It received cautious praise from privacy-focused organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation for this change.

[ 228 ] In February 2025, Sky accused Amazon of not doing enough to prevent the piracy of its sports rights via "jailbroken" Fire Sticks.

[ 229 ] Project Nimbus is a contract by which Amazon and Google provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud-computing services.

[ 230 ] [ 231 ] The contract has been criticized by shareholders and employees concerned that the project may lead to abuses of Palestinian human rights in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict .

[ 232 ] On July 22, 2025, Amazon announced their plan to acquire San Francisco based startup Bee AI . Bee produces a wristband, similar to most modern smartwatches , equipped with AI and microphones. The wristband is capable of providing summaries of conversations and reminders of tasks, effectively serving as a 24/7 note taker. News outlets criticize the fact that the devices saves transcripts, potentially utilizing it to train generative AI models which require vast quantities of data.
