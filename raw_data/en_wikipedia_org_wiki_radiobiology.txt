**Radiobiology** (also known as **radiation biology**, and uncommonly as **actinobiology**) is a field of clinical and basic [medical sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sciences "Medical sciences") that involves the study of the effects of radiation on living tissue [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-1) (including [ionizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation "Ionizing radiation") and [non-ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation "Non-ionizing radiation")),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-3) in particular **health effects of radiation**.

Ionizing radiation is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") for the treatment of cancer and [thyrotoxicosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyrotoxicosis "Thyrotoxicosis"). Its most common impact is the [induction of cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer "Radiation-induced cancer") with a [latent period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period "Incubation period") of years or decades after exposure. High doses can cause visually dramatic [radiation burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_burns "Radiation burns"), and/or rapid fatality through [acute radiation syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome "Acute radiation syndrome"). Controlled doses are used for [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging") and [radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotherapy "Radiotherapy").

In general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but can have health benefits in [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") for the treatment of cancer and [thyrotoxicosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyrotoxicosis "Thyrotoxicosis").

Most adverse health effects of radiation exposure may be grouped in two general categories:

*   deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to the killing or malfunction of cells following high doses; and
*   stochastic effects, i.e., cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICRP200749paragraph_55-4)

Some effects of ionizing radiation on human health are [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic"), meaning that their probability of occurrence increases with dose, while the severity is independent of dose.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-Christensen2014-5)[Radiation-induced cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer "Radiation-induced cancer"), [teratogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratogenesis "Teratogenesis"), [cognitive decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_induced_cognitive_decline "Radiation induced cognitive decline"), and [heart disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease "Heart disease") are all stochastic effects induced by ionizing radiation.

Its most common impact is the stochastic [induction of cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer "Radiation-induced cancer") with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial. The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with [effective radiation dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_radiation_dose "Effective radiation dose") at a rate of 5.5% per [sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert "Sievert").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICRP200755Paragraph_83-6) If this [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model "Linear no-threshold model") is correct, then natural [background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation "Background radiation") is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second.

Quantitative data on the effects of ionizing radiation on human health is relatively limited compared to other medical conditions because of the low number of cases to date, and because of the stochastic nature of some of the effects. Stochastic effects can only be measured through large epidemiological studies where enough data has been collected to remove confounding factors such as smoking habits and other lifestyle factors. The richest source of high-quality data comes from the study of Japanese [atomic bomb survivors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb_survivors "Atomic bomb survivors"). In vitro and animal experiments are informative, but [radioresistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance "Radioresistance") varies greatly across species.

The added lifetime risk of developing cancer by a single [abdominal CT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_CT "Abdominal CT") of 8[mSv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert "Sievert") is estimated to be 0.05%, or 1 in 2,000.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-7)

[Deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic "Deterministic") effects are those that reliably occur above a [threshold dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_dose "Threshold dose"), and their severity increases with dose.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-Christensen2014-5)

High radiation dose gives rise to deterministic effects which reliably occur above a threshold, and their severity increases with dose. Deterministic effects are not necessarily more or less serious than stochastic effects; either can ultimately lead to a temporary nuisance or a fatality. Examples of deterministic effects are:

*   [Acute radiation syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome "Acute radiation syndrome"), by acute whole-body radiation
*   [Radiation burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_burn "Radiation burn"), from radiation to a particular body surface
*   [Radiation-induced thyroiditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_thyroiditis "Radiation-induced thyroiditis"), a potential side effect from radiation treatment against [hyperthyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism "Hyperthyroidism")
*   [Chronic radiation syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_radiation_syndrome "Chronic radiation syndrome"), from long-term radiation.
*   [Radiation-induced lung injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_lung_injury "Radiation-induced lung injury"), from for example [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") to the lungs
*   [Cataracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract "Cataract") and infertility.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-Christensen2014-5)

The US National Academy of Sciences Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee "has concluded that there is no compelling evidence to indicate a dose threshold below which the risk of tumor induction is zero".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-8)

### By type of radiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radiobiology&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: By type of radiation")]

When alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest. This is due to the high [relative biological effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_biological_effectiveness "Relative biological effectiveness") of alpha radiation to cause biological damage after alpha-emitting radioisotopes enter living cells. Ingested alpha emitter radioisotopes such as [transuranics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transuranium_element "Transuranium element") or [actinides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinides "Actinides") are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes. If the radiation type is not known, it can be determined by differential measurements in the presence of electrical fields, magnetic fields, or with varying amounts of shielding.

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Dose_quantities_and_units.png/500px-Dose_quantities_and_units.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dose_quantities_and_units.png)

External dose quantities used in radiation protection. See article on [sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert "Sievert") on how these are calculated and used.

The risk for developing radiation-induced cancer at some point in life is greater when exposing a fetus than an adult, both because the cells are more vulnerable when they are growing, and because there is much longer lifespan after the dose to develop cancer. If there is too much radiation exposure there could be harmful effects on the unborn child or reproductive organs.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-10) Research shows that scanning more than once in nine months can harm the unborn child.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-11)

Possible deterministic effects include of radiation exposure in pregnancy include [miscarriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage "Miscarriage"), structural [birth defects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect "Birth defect"), [growth restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction "Intrauterine growth restriction") and [intellectual disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability "Intellectual disability").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) The deterministic effects have been studied at for example survivors of the [atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") and cases where [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") has been necessary during pregnancy:

| [Gestational age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age_(obstetrics) "Gestational age (obstetrics)") | [Embryonic age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_age "Embryonic age") | Effects | Estimated threshold dose ([mGy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit) "Gray (unit)")) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 to 4 weeks | 0 to 2 weeks | [Miscarriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage "Miscarriage") or none (all or nothing) | 50 - 100[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) |
| 4 to 10 weeks | 2 to 8 weeks | Structural [birth defects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect "Birth defect") | 200[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) |
| [Growth restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction "Intrauterine growth restriction") | 200 - 250[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) |
| 10 to 17 weeks | 8 to 15 weeks | Severe [intellectual disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability "Intellectual disability") | 60 - 310[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) |
| 18 to 27 weeks | 16 to 25 weeks | Severe [intellectual disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability "Intellectual disability") (lower risk) | 250 - 280[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12) |

The intellectual deficit has been estimated to be about 25 [IQ points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient "Intelligence quotient") per 1,000 mGy at 10 to 17 weeks of gestational age.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-acog-12)

These effects are sometimes relevant when deciding about [medical imaging in pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging_in_pregnancy "Medical imaging in pregnancy"), since [projectional radiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectional_radiography "Projectional radiography") and [CT scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan") exposes the fetus to radiation.

Also, the risk for the mother of later acquiring [radiation-induced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer "Radiation-induced cancer")[breast cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer "Breast cancer") seems to be particularly high for radiation doses during pregnancy.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-RonckersErdmann2004-13)

The human body cannot sense ionizing radiation except in very high doses, but the effects of ionization can be used to characterize the radiation. Parameters of interest include disintegration rate, particle flux, particle type, beam energy, kerma, dose rate, and radiation dose.

The monitoring and calculation of doses to safeguard human health is called [dosimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry "Dosimetry") and is undertaken within the science of [health physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_physics "Health physics"). Key measurement tools are the use of [dosimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter "Dosimeter") to give the external [effective dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(radiation) "Effective dose (radiation)") uptake and the use of bio-assay for ingested dose. The article on the [sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert "Sievert") summarises the recommendations of the ICRU and ICRP on the use of dose quantities and includes a guide to the effects of ionizing radiation as measured in sieverts, and gives examples of approximate figures of dose uptake in certain situations.

The [committed dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committed_dose "Committed dose") is a measure of the stochastic health risk due to an intake of radioactive material into the human body. The ICRP states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities. The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICRP200773paragraph_144-14)

### Absorbed, equivalent and effective dose

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radiobiology&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Absorbed, equivalent and effective dose")]

The [absorbed dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose "Absorbed dose") is a physical dose quantity _D_ representing the mean energy imparted to [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") per unit mass by [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation "Ionizing radiation"). In the SI system of units, the unit of measure is joules per kilogram, and its special name is [gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit) "Gray (unit)") (Gy).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICRP200724glossary-15) The non-SI [CGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units "Centimetre–gram–second system of units") unit [rad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad_(unit) "Rad (unit)") is sometimes also used, predominantly in the USA.

To represent stochastic risk the [equivalent dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_dose "Equivalent dose")_H_ T and [effective dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(radiation) "Effective dose (radiation)")_E_ are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients are used to calculate these from the absorbed dose.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEICRP200761%E2%80%9362paragraphs_104_and_105-16) Equivalent and effective dose quantities are expressed in units of the [sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert "Sievert") or [rem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rem_(unit) "Rem (unit)") which implies that biological effects have been taken into account. These are usually in accordance with the recommendations of the [International Committee on Radiation Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICRP "ICRP") (ICRP) and [International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Radiation_Units_and_Measurements "International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements") (ICRU). The coherent system of radiological protection quantities developed by them is shown in the accompanying diagram.

The [International Commission on Radiological Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Radiological_Protection "International Commission on Radiological Protection") (ICRP) manages the International System of Radiological Protection, which sets recommended limits for dose uptake. Dose values may represent absorbed, equivalent, effective, or committed dose.

A schematic diagram showing a rectangle being irradiated by radioactive contamination (shown in red) which is present on an external surface such as the skin; this emits radiation (shown in yellow), which can enter the animal's body

External exposure is exposure which occurs when the radioactive source (or other radiation source) is outside (and remains outside) the organism which is exposed. Examples of external exposure include:

*   A person who places a sealed [radioactive source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_source "Radioactive source") in his pocket
*   A space traveller who is irradiated by [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray")
*   A person who is treated for [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer "Cancer") by either [teletherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletherapy "Teletherapy") or [brachytherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy "Brachytherapy"). While in brachytherapy the source is inside the person it is still considered external exposure because it does not result in a [committed dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committed_dose "Committed dose").
*   A nuclear worker whose hands have been dirtied with radioactive dust. Assuming that his hands are cleaned before any radioactive material can be absorbed, inhaled or ingested, skin contamination is considered to be external exposure.

External exposure is relatively _easy_ to estimate, and the irradiated organism does not become radioactive, except for a case where the radiation is an intense [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") beam which causes [activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation "Neutron activation").

Internal exposure occurs when the radioactive material enters the organism, and the radioactive atoms become incorporated into the organism. This can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Below are a series of examples of internal exposure.

*   The exposure caused by [potassium-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40 "Potassium-40") present within a _normal_ person.
*   The exposure to the ingestion of a soluble radioactive substance, such as [89 Sr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium-89 "Strontium-89") in [cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow "Cow")' [milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk "Milk").
*   A person who is being treated for cancer by means of a [radiopharmaceutical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiopharmaceutical "Radiopharmaceutical") where a radioisotope is used as a drug (usually a liquid or pill). A review of this topic was published in 1999.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-20) Because the radioactive material becomes intimately mixed with the affected object it is often difficult to decontaminate the object or person in a case where internal exposure is occurring. While some very insoluble materials such as [fission products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product "Fission product") within a [uranium dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_dioxide "Uranium dioxide") matrix might never be able to truly become part of an organism, it is normal to consider such particles in the lungs and digestive tract as a form of internal contamination which results in internal exposure.
*   [Boron neutron capture therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_neutron_capture_therapy "Boron neutron capture therapy") (BNCT) involves injecting a [boron-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron-10 "Boron-10") tagged chemical that preferentially binds to tumor cells. Neutrons from a [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") are shaped by a [neutron moderator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator "Neutron moderator") to the neutron energy spectrum suitable for BNCT treatment. The tumor is selectively bombarded with these neutrons. The neutrons quickly slow down in the body to become low energy _thermal neutrons_. These _thermal neutrons_ are captured by the injected boron-10, forming excited (boron-11) which breaks down into [lithium-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-7 "Lithium-7") and a [helium-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4 "Helium-4")[alpha particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") both of these produce closely spaced ionizing radiation. This concept is described as a binary system using two separate components for the therapy of cancer. Each component in itself is relatively harmless to the cells, but when combined for treatment they produce a highly cytocidal ([cytotoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic "Cytotoxic")) effect which is lethal (within a limited range of 5-9 micrometers or approximately one cell diameter). Clinical trials, with promising results, are currently carried out in Finland and Japan.

When radioactive compounds enter the human body, the effects are different from those resulting from exposure to an external radiation source. Especially in the case of alpha radiation, which normally does not penetrate the skin, the exposure can be much more damaging after ingestion or inhalation. The radiation exposure is normally expressed as a [committed dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committed_dose "Committed dose").

Although radiation was discovered in late 19th century, the dangers of radioactivity and of radiation were not immediately recognized. Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") when German physicist [Wilhelm Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen "Wilhelm Röntgen") intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he misattributed them to ozone, a [free radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_radical "Free radical") produced in air by X-rays. Other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. His injuries healed later.

As a field of medical sciences, radiobiology originated from [Leopold Freund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Freund "Leopold Freund")'s 1896 demonstration of the therapeutic treatment of a hairy [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocytic_nevus "Melanocytic nevus") using the newly discovered form of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") called X-rays. After irradiating frogs and insects with X-rays in early 1896, [Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Romanovich_Tarkhanov "Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov") concluded that these newly discovered rays not only photograph, but also "affect the living function".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-21) At the same time, Pierre and [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie "Marie Curie") discovered the radioactive polonium and radium later used to treat [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer "Cancer").

The genetic effects of radiation, including the effects on cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927 [Hermann Joseph Muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Joseph_Muller "Hermann Joseph Muller") published research showing genetic effects, and in 1946 was awarded the [Nobel prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_prize "Nobel prize") for his findings.

More generally, the 1930s saw attempts to develop a general model for radiobiology. Notable here was [Douglas Lea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Lea "Douglas Lea"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-23) whose presentation also included an exhaustive review of some 400 supporting publications.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-24)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_][[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-25)

Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as [patent medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_medicine "Patent medicine") and [radioactive quackery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_quackery "Radioactive quackery"). Examples were radium [enema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema "Enema") treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie "Marie Curie") spoke out against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died of [aplastic anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia "Aplastic anemia") caused by radiation poisoning. [Eben Byers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Byers "Eben Byers"), a famous American socialite, died of multiple cancers (but not acute radiation syndrome) in 1932 after consuming large quantities of [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") over several years; his death drew public attention to dangers of radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts, radium-containing medical products had nearly vanished from the market.

In the United States, the experience of the so-called [Radium Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls "Radium Girls"), where thousands of radium-dial painters contracted oral cancers[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-NYT_1998-10-06-26)— but no cases of acute radiation syndrome[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-27)— popularized the warnings of occupational health associated with radiation hazards. [Robley D. Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robley_D._Evans_(physicist) "Robley D. Evans (physicist)"), at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT"), developed the first standard for permissible body burden of [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium"), a key step in the establishment of [nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine") as a field of study. With the development of [nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") and [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") in the 1940s, heightened scientific attention was given to the study of all manner of radiation effects.

The [atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") resulted in a large number of incidents of radiation poisoning, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital surgeon Dr. Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the Syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima bombings. Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-28) Actress [Midori Naka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_Naka "Midori Naka"), who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on August 24, 1945, was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of radiation poisoning (or "atomic bomb disease").

The [Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Bomb_Casualty_Commission "Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission") and the [Radiation Effects Research Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Effects_Research_Foundation "Radiation Effects Research Foundation") have been monitoring the health status of the survivors and their descendants since 1946. They have found that radiation exposure increases cancer risk, but also that the average lifespan of survivors was reduced by only a few months compared to those not exposed to radiation. No health effects of any sort have thus far been detected in children of the survivors.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#cite_note-29)

Radiation sources for experimental radiobiology
-----------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radiobiology&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Radiation sources for experimental radiobiology")]

Radiobiology experiments typically make use of a radiation source which could be:
