Find sources: "Eugene Hecht" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Eugene Hecht (born 2 December 1938 in New York City ) is an American physicist and author of a standard textbook in optics .

Hecht studied at New York University (B.S. in E.P. 1960), Rutgers University (M. Sc. 1963), Adelphi University (Ph.D. 1967). During his graduate study he worked at Radio Corporation of America . His pedagogical work began in 1970 with a publication on a mathematical description of polarization .

[ 1 ] Adelphi University hired Hecht to teach and he became professor in 1978, from where he retired in 2021.

Hecht challenged the notion of potential energy in 2003.

[ 2 ] The elusive nature of a universal definition of energy was argued by Hecht in a letter to the editor of The Physics Teacher in 2004.

[ 3 ] In 2006 he wrote "there is no really good definition of mass." [ 4 ] He has continued writing on the topic, with publications in 2011 and 2016.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Eugene Hecht has also written on American ceramic artist George E. Ohr and is a founding member of the American Ceramic Arts Society.

Books [ edit ] His first textbook Optics was authored in 1974 alongside Alfred Zajac, a colleague at Adelphi.

[ 7 ] In 1975, Hecht wrote Theory and Problems of Optics for Schaum's Outlines . Hecht is the sole author of his 1998 third edition of Optics .
