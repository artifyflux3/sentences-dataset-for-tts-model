During International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation CSSim 2009 John Charles Butcher ONZM (born 31 March 1933) is a New Zealand mathematician who specialises in numerical methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations .

[ 1 ] Butcher works on multistage methods for initial value problems , such as Runge-Kutta and general linear methods . The Butcher group and the Butcher tableau are named after him.
More recently, he is investigating a new type of method with stability identical to that of a Runge-Kutta method .
