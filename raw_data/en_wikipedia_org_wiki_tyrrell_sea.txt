It existed during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet .

Roughly 8,000 years BP , the Laurentide Ice Sheet thinned and split into two lobes, one centred over Quebec - Labrador , the other over Keewatin . This drained Glacial Lake Ojibway , a massive proglacial lake south of the ice sheet, leading to the formation of the early Tyrrell Sea.

[ 1 ] The weight of the ice had isostatically depressed the surface as much as 270-280 m below its current level, making the Tyrrell Sea much larger than modern Hudson Bay.

[ 1 ] Indeed, in some places the shoreline was 100 to 250 km further inland than at present.

[ 2 ] It was at its largest roughly 7,000 years BP.

[ 3 ] Isostatic uplift proceeded rapidly after the retreat of the ice, as much as .09 m per year, causing the margins of the sea to regress quickly towards its present margins.

[ 1 ] The rate of uplift decreased with time however, and in any event was nearly matched by sea level rise from the melting ice sheets.

[ 2 ] When the Tyrrell Sea "became" Hudson Bay is difficult to define, as Hudson Bay is still shrinking from isostatic rebound.
