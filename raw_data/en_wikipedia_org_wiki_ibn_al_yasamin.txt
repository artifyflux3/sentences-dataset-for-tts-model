 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

**Abu Muhammad 'Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Hajjaj ibn al-Yasmin al-Adrini al-Fessi**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-Sardon-1) ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): ابن الياسمين) (died 1204),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-selin-2) more commonly known as **ibn al-Yasmin**, was a [Moroccan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccans "Moroccans") mathematician during the Middle Ages. He was born in Fez and received his education in Fez and Sevilla, maybe that’s why some historians refer to him as “al-Ishbili”. Little is known of his personal life except that he was born into a Berber family.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-Sardon-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-selin-2) He is well known for his crucial contribution in developing [Ghūbari numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals") (West “Arabic” numerals), which are currently used in most parts of the world.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-selin-2) Besides mathematics, he also became famous in literature, law, and particularly in Andalusian poetry.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Yasamin#cite_note-selin-2)
