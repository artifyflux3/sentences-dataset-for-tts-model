He was born in Fez and received his education in Fez and Sevilla, maybe that’s why some historians refer to him as “al-Ishbili”. Little is known of his personal life except that he was born into a Berber family.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is well known for his crucial contribution in developing Ghūbari numerals (West “Arabic” numerals), which are currently used in most parts of the world.

[ 2 ] Besides mathematics, he also became famous in literature, law, and particularly in Andalusian poetry.
