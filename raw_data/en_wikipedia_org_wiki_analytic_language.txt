This is opposed to synthetic languages , which synthesize many concepts into a single word, using affixes regularly.

Syntactic roles are assigned to words primarily by word order . For example, by changing the individual words in the Latin phrase " fēl-is pisc-em cēpit " ("the cat caught the fish") to " fēl-em pisc-is cēpit " ("the fish caught the cat"), the fish becomes the subject, while the cat becomes the object. This transformation is not possible in an analytic language without altering the word order. Typically, analytic languages have a low morpheme -per- word ratio, especially with respect to inflectional morphemes .

No natural language, however, is purely analytic or purely synthetic.

Background [ edit ] The term analytic is commonly used in a relative rather than an absolute sense . The most prominent and widely used Indo-European analytic language is Modern English , which has lost much of the inflectional morphology that it inherited from Proto-Indo-European , Proto-Germanic and Old English over the centuries and has not gained any new inflectional morphemes in the meantime, which makes it more analytic than most other Indo-European languages.

For example, Proto-Indo-European had much more complex grammatical conjugation , grammatical genders , dual number and inflections for eight or nine cases in its nouns , pronouns , adjectives , numerals , participles , postpositions and determiners . Standard English has lost nearly all of them (except for three modified cases for pronouns ) along with genders and dual number and simplified its conjugation.

Latin , German , Greek , and Russian and a majority of the Slavic languages , characterized by free word order , are synthetic languages .

Nouns in Russian inflect for at least six cases, most of which descended from Proto-Indo-European cases, whose functions English translates by instead using other strategies like prepositions , verbal voice , word order, and possessive 's .

Modern Hebrew is more analytic than Classical Hebrew mostly with nouns.

[ 1 ] Classical Hebrew relies heavily on inflectional morphology to convey grammatical relationships, while in Modern Hebrew, there has been a significant reduction of the use of inflectional morphology.

Isolating language [ edit ] A related concept is that of isolating languages , which are those with a low morpheme-per-word ratio (taking into account derivational morphemes as well). Purely isolating languages are by definition analytic and lack inflectional morphemes. However, the reverse is not necessarily true, and a language can have derivational morphemes but lack inflectional morphemes. For example, Mandarin Chinese has many compound words , [ 2 ] which gives it a moderately high ratio of morphemes per word, but since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships, it is a very analytic language.

English is not totally analytic in its nouns since it uses inflections for number (e.g., "one day, three days; one boy, four boys") and possession ("The boy's ball" vis-à-vis "The boy has a ball"). Mandarin Chinese, by contrast, has no inflections on its nouns: compare 一天 yī tiān 'one day', 三天 sān tiān 'three days' (literally 'three day'); 一個男孩 yī ge nánhái 'one boy' (lit. 'one [entity of] male child'), 四個男孩 sì ge nánhái 'four boys' (lit. 'four [entity of] male child'). However, English is considered to be weakly inflected and comparatively more analytic than most other Indo-European languages .

Persian is a synthetic language not an analytical one. Persian has some features of agglutination, making use of prefixes and suffixes attached to the stems of verbs and nouns, thus making it a synthetic language rather than an analytic one. Persian is an SOV language, thus having a head-final phrase structure.

[ 3 ] Example in Persian: Kuchiktarinhayeshunra barnemigardundam meaning ' I wouldn’t return the smallest ones of them ' ( literally 'Small+diminutive+comparative+superlative+plural+possessive+object_marker re+not+ing+turn+to+did+I') List of analytic languages [ edit ] This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.
