SI derived units 10 −4 tesla [ a ] Gaussian base units 1 cm −1/2 ⋅ g 1/2 ⋅ s −1 esu-cgs 1/ c cgs esu [ b ] Carl Friedrich Gauß in 1828, aged 50 years old The gauss (symbol: G , sometimes Gs ) is a unit of measurement of magnetic induction, also known as magnetic flux density . The unit is part of the Gaussian system of units, which inherited it from the older centimetre–gram–second electromagnetic units (CGS-EMU) system. It was named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1936. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimetre .

As the centimetre–gram–second system of units (cgs system) has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI), the use of the gauss has been deprecated by the standards bodies, but is still regularly used in various subfields of science. The SI unit for magnetic flux density is the tesla (symbol T), [ 1 ] which corresponds to 10,000 gauss .

Name, symbol, and metric prefixes [ edit ] Although not a component of the International System of Units, the usage of the gauss generally follows the rules for SI units. Since the name is derived from a person's name, its symbol is the uppercase letter "G". When the unit is spelled out, it is written in lowercase ("gauss"), unless it begins a sentence.

[ 2 ] : 147–148 The gauss may be combined with metric prefixes , [ 3 ] : 128 such as in milligauss, mG (or mGs), or kilogauss, kG (or kGs).

Unit conversions [ edit ] 1 G = M x ⋅ ⋅ c m − − 2 = g B i ⋅ ⋅ s 2 ≘ 10 − − 4 T = 10 − − 4 k g A ⋅ ⋅ s 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1\,{\rm {G}}&={\rm {Mx}}{\cdot }{\rm {cm}}^{-2}={\frac {\rm {g}}{{\rm {Bi}}{\cdot }{\rm {s}}^{2}}}\\&{\text{ ≘ }}10^{-4}\,{\rm {T}}=10^{-4}{\frac {\rm {kg}}{{\rm {A}}{\cdot }{\rm {s^{2}}}}}\end{aligned}}} The gauss is the unit of magnetic flux density B in the system of Gaussian units and is equal to Mx /cm 2 or g / Bi /s 2 , while the oersted is the unit of H -field . One tesla (T) corresponds to 10 4 gauss, and one ampere (A) per metre corresponds to 4π × 10 −3 oersted .

The units for magnetic flux Φ, which is the integral of magnetic B -field over an area , are the weber (Wb) in the SI and the maxwell (Mx) in the CGS-Gaussian system. The conversion factor is 10 8 maxwell per weber , since flux is the integral of field over an area, area having the units of the square of distance, thus 10 4 G/T (magnetic field conversion factor) times the square of 10 2 cm/m (linear distance conversion factor). 10 8 Mx/Wb = 10 4 G/T × (10 2 cm/m) 2 .

Typical values [ edit ] Main article: Orders of magnitude (magnetic field) 10 −9 –10 −8 G – the magnetic field of the human brain 10 −6 –10 −3 G – the magnetic field of Galactic molecular clouds . Typical magnetic field strengths within the interstellar medium of the Milky Way are ~5 μG.

0.25–0.60 G – the Earth's magnetic field at its surface 4 G – near Jupiter 's equator 25 G – the Earth's magnetic field in its core [ 4 ] 50 G – a typical refrigerator magnet 100 G – an iron magnet 1500 G – within a sun spot [ 5 ] 10000 to 13000 G – remanence of a neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) magnet [ 6 ] 16000 to 22000 G – saturation of high permeability iron alloys used in transformers [ 7 ] 3000–70000 G – a medical magnetic resonance imaging machine 10 12 –10 13 G – the surface of a neutron star [ 8 ] 4 × 10 13 G – the Schwinger limit 10 14 G – the magnetic field of SGR J1745-2900 , orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A* in the center of the Milky Way.

10 15 G – the magnetic field of some newly created magnetars [ 9 ] 10 17 G – the upper limit to neutron star magnetism [ 9 ] See also [ edit ] Tesla (unit) Centimetre–gram–second system of units Gaussian units Notes [ edit ] ^ The electromagnetic Gaussian and SI quantities correspond (symbol '≘') rather than being equal (symbol '=').
