Etymology [ edit ] The word crore derives from the Prakrit word kroḍi , which in turn comes from the Sanskrit koṭi ( कोटि ), [ 2 ] denoting ten million in the Indian number system , which has separate terms for most powers of ten from 10 0 up to 10 19 . The crore is known by various regional names.
