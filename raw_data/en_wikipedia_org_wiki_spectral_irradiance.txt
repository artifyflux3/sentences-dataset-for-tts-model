The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre (symbol W⋅m −2 or W/m 2 ). The CGS unit erg per square centimetre per second (erg⋅cm −2 ⋅s −1 ) is often used in astronomy . Irradiance is often called intensity , but this term is avoided in radiometry where such usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity . In astrophysics, irradiance is called radiant flux .

[ 1 ] Spectral irradiance is the irradiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength , depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The two forms have different dimensions and units: spectral irradiance of a frequency spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per hertz (W⋅m −2 ⋅Hz −1 ), while spectral irradiance of a wavelength spectrum is measured in watts per square metre per metre (W⋅m −3 ), or more commonly watts per square metre per nanometre (W⋅m −2 ⋅nm −1 ).

Mathematical definitions [ edit ] Comparison of photometric and radiometric quantities Irradiance [ edit ] Irradiance of a surface, denoted E e ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as [ 2 ] E e = ∂ ∂ Φ Φ e ∂ ∂ A , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} }={\frac {\partial \Phi _{\mathrm {e} }}{\partial A}},} where ∂ is the partial derivative symbol; Φ e is the radiant flux received; A is the area.

The radiant flux emitted by a surface is called radiant exitance .

Spectral irradiance [ edit ] Spectral irradiance in frequency of a surface, denoted E e,ν , is defined as [ 2 ] E e , ν ν = ∂ ∂ E e ∂ ∂ ν ν , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} ,\nu }={\frac {\partial E_{\mathrm {e} }}{\partial \nu }},} where ν is the frequency.

Spectral irradiance in wavelength of a surface, denoted E e,λ , is defined as [ 2 ] E e , λ λ = ∂ ∂ E e ∂ ∂ λ λ , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} ,\lambda }={\frac {\partial E_{\mathrm {e} }}{\partial \lambda }},} where λ is the wavelength.

Property [ edit ] Irradiance of a surface is also, according to the definition of radiant flux , equal to the time-average of the component of the Poynting vector perpendicular to the surface: E e = ⟨ ⟨ | S | ⟩ ⟩ cos ⁡ ⁡ α α , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} }=\langle |\mathbf {S} |\rangle \cos \alpha ,} where ⟨ • ⟩ is the time-average; S is the Poynting vector; α is the angle between a unit vector normal to the surface and S .

For a propagating sinusoidal linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave , the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude. The irradiance of a surface is then given by [ 3 ] E e = n 2 μ μ 0 c E m 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ α α = n ε ε 0 c 2 E m 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ α α = n 2 Z 0 E m 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ α α , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} }={\frac {n}{2\mu _{0}c}}E_{\mathrm {m} }^{2}\cos \alpha ={\frac {n\varepsilon _{0}c}{2}}E_{\mathrm {m} }^{2}\cos \alpha ={\frac {n}{2Z_{0}}}E_{\mathrm {m} }^{2}\cos \alpha ,} where E m is the amplitude of the wave's electric field; n is the refractive index of the medium of propagation; c is the speed of light in vacuum ; μ 0 is the vacuum permeability ; ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity ; c = 1 ε ε 0 μ μ 0 {\textstyle c={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\varepsilon _{0}\mu _{0}}}}} Z 0 = μ μ 0 c {\textstyle Z_{0}=\mu _{0}c} is the impedance of free space .

This formula assumes that the magnetic susceptibility is negligible; i.e. that μ r ≈ 1 ( μ ≈ μ 0 ) where μ r is the relative magnetic permeability of the propagation medium. This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range .

Point source [ edit ] A point source of light produces spherical wavefronts. The irradiance in this case varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source.

E = P A = P 4 π π r 2 , {\displaystyle E={\frac {P}{A}}={\frac {P}{4\pi r^{2}}},} where r is the distance; P is the radiant flux ; A is the surface area of a sphere of radius r .

For quick approximations, this equation indicates that doubling the distance reduces irradiation to one quarter; or similarly, to double irradiation, reduce the distance to 71%.

In astronomy, stars are routinely treated as point sources even though they are much larger than the Earth. This is a good approximation because the distance from even a nearby star to the Earth is much larger than the star's diameter. For instance, the irradiance of Alpha Centauri A (radiant flux: 1.5 L ☉ , distance: 4.34 ly ) is about 2.7 × 10 −8 W/m 2 on Earth.

Solar irradiance [ edit ] Main article: Solar irradiance The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance E e,dir and diffuse irradiance E e,diff . On a tilted plane, there is another irradiance component, E e,refl , which is the component that is reflected from the ground. The average ground reflection is about 20% of the global irradiance. Hence, the irradiance E e on a tilted plane consists of three components: [ 4 ] E e = E e , d i r + E e , d i f f + E e , r e f l .

{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {e} }=E_{\mathrm {e} ,\mathrm {dir} }+E_{\mathrm {e} ,\mathrm {diff} }+E_{\mathrm {e} ,\mathrm {refl} }.} The integral of solar irradiance over a time period is called " solar exposure " or " insolation ".

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Average solar irradiance at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m 2 , but at surface irradiance is approximately 1000 W/m 2 on a clear day.
