Standard (trivial) self-similarity [ 1 ] In mathematics , a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e., the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines , are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.

[ 2 ] Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals .

Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample , whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.

Peitgen et al.

explain the concept as such: If parts of a figure are small replicas of the whole, then the figure is called self-similar ....A figure is strictly self-similar if the figure can be decomposed into parts which are exact replicas of the whole. Any arbitrary part contains an exact replica of the whole figure.

[ 3 ] Since mathematically, a fractal may show self-similarity under arbitrary magnification, it is impossible to recreate this physically. Peitgen et al.

suggest studying self-similarity using approximations: In order to give an operational meaning to the property of self-similarity, we are necessarily restricted to dealing with finite approximations of the limit figure. This is done using the method which we will call box self-similarity where measurements are made on finite stages of the figure using grids of various sizes.

[ 4 ] This vocabulary was introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1964.

[ 5 ] Self-affinity [ edit ] A self-affine fractal with Hausdorff dimension = 1.8272 In mathematics , self-affinity is a feature of a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the x and y directions. This means that to appreciate the self-similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation .

Definition [ edit ] A compact topological space X is self-similar if there exists a finite set S indexing a set of non- surjective homeomorphisms { f s : s ∈ ∈ S } {\displaystyle \{f_{s}:s\in S\}} for which X = ⋃ ⋃ s ∈ ∈ S f s ( X ) {\displaystyle X=\bigcup _{s\in S}f_{s}(X)} If X ⊂ ⊂ Y {\displaystyle X\subset Y} , we call X self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of Y such that the equation above holds for { f s : s ∈ ∈ S } {\displaystyle \{f_{s}:s\in S\}} . We call L = ( X , S , { f s : s ∈ ∈ S } ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {L}}=(X,S,\{f_{s}:s\in S\})} a self-similar structure . The homeomorphisms may be iterated , resulting in an iterated function system . The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid . When the set S has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid . The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree ; more generally, if the set S has p elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.

The automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group ; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.

A more general notion than self-similarity is self-affinity .

Examples [ edit ] Self-similarity in the Mandelbrot set shown by zooming in on the Feigenbaum point at (−1.401155189..., 0) An image of the Barnsley fern which exhibits affine self-similarity The Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points .

Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering , packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar.

[ 6 ] This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.

Similarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity , i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown.

[ 7 ] Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics .

[ 8 ] Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle .

Some space filling curves , such as the Peano curve and Moore curve , also feature properties of self-similarity.

[ 9 ] A triangle subdivided repeatedly using barycentric subdivision . The complement of the large circles becomes a Sierpinski carpet In cybernetics [ edit ] The viable system model of Stafford Beer is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.

In nature [ edit ] Close-up of a Romanesco broccoli Further information: Patterns in nature Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. Plants, such as Romanesco broccoli , exhibit strong self-similarity.

In music [ edit ] Strict canons display various types and amounts of self-similarity, as do sections of fugues .

A Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.

The Danish composer Per Nørgård made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the infinity series in much of his music.

In the research field of music information retrieval , self-similarity commonly refers to the fact that music often consists of parts that are repeated in time.

[ 10 ] In other words, music is self-similar under temporal translation, rather than (or in addition to) under scaling.
