Definition [ edit ] The dual bundle of a vector bundle π π : E → → X {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X} is the vector bundle π π ∗ ∗ : E ∗ ∗ → → X {\displaystyle \pi ^{*}:E^{*}\to X} whose fibers are the dual spaces to the fibers of E {\displaystyle E} .

Equivalently, E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} can be defined as the Hom bundle H o m ( E , R × × X ) , {\displaystyle \mathrm {Hom} (E,\mathbb {R} \times X),} that is, the vector bundle of morphisms from E {\displaystyle E} to the trivial line bundle R × × X → → X .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \times X\to X.} Constructions and examples [ edit ] Given a local trivialization of E {\displaystyle E} with transition functions t i j , {\displaystyle t_{ij},} a local trivialization of E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} is given by the same open cover of X {\displaystyle X} with transition functions t i j ∗ ∗ = ( t i j T ) − − 1 {\displaystyle t_{ij}^{*}=(t_{ij}^{T})^{-1}} (the inverse of the transpose ). The dual bundle E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} is then constructed using the fiber bundle construction theorem . As particular cases: The dual bundle of an associated bundle is the bundle associated to the dual representation of the structure group .

The dual bundle of the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold is its cotangent bundle .

Properties [ edit ] If the base space X {\displaystyle X} is paracompact and Hausdorff then a real, finite-rank vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} and its dual E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} are isomorphic as vector bundles. However, just as for vector spaces , there is no natural choice of isomorphism unless E {\displaystyle E} is equipped with an inner product .

This is not true in the case of complex vector bundles : for example, the tautological line bundle over the Riemann sphere is not isomorphic to its dual. The dual E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle E^{*}} of a complex vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} is indeed isomorphic to the conjugate bundle E ¯ ¯ , {\displaystyle {\overline {E}},} but the choice of isomorphism is non-canonical unless E {\displaystyle E} is equipped with a hermitian product .

The Hom bundle H o m ( E 1 , E 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Hom} (E_{1},E_{2})} of two vector bundles is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product bundle E 1 ∗ ∗ ⊗ ⊗ E 2 .

{\displaystyle E_{1}^{*}\otimes E_{2}.} Given a morphism f : E 1 → → E 2 {\displaystyle f:E_{1}\to E_{2}} of vector bundles over the same space, there is a morphism f ∗ ∗ : E 2 ∗ ∗ → → E 1 ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle f^{*}:E_{2}^{*}\to E_{1}^{*}} between their dual bundles (in the converse order), defined fibrewise as the transpose of each linear map f x : ( E 1 ) x → → ( E 2 ) x .

{\displaystyle f_{x}:(E_{1})_{x}\to (E_{2})_{x}.} Accordingly, the dual bundle operation defines a contravariant functor from the category of vector bundles and their morphisms to itself.
