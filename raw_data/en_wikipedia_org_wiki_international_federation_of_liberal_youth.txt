IFLRY ) is a Political international & liberal youth organization. It consists of a global membership of national youth organizations. These are often but not exclusively affiliated with political parties that are members of Liberal International .

IFLRY holds full member status to Liberal International [ 2 ] and the European Youth Forum ( YFJ ), [ 3 ] which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with both these bodies. Since 2014, IFLRY has held special consultative status to ECOSOC .

[ 4 ] IFLRY also holds observer status to UNFCCC [ 5 ] and has sent delegations to COP since COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009.

History [ edit ] IFLRY continues the tradition of two predecessors. The first was the World Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth (WFLRY), founded in 1947 in Cambridge , United Kingdom . WFLRY aimed to be a global organization, but mostly had active members in Europe. This led in 1969 to the separate forming of the European Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth (EFLRY). WFLRY was dissolved in 1978.

In 1979, at the EFLRY 6th Congress in Silkeborg , Denmark , EFLRY renamed itself IFLRY International Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth . This marked the start of a global expansion of the organization. The 6th Congress is thus recognized as the founding congress of IFLRY.

[ 6 ] In 2001, the organization was renamed into IFLRY – International Federation of Liberal Youth.

Structure [ edit ] IFLRY's highest body is the General Assembly, which meets at least every year. It adopts IFLRY's political platform, the Manifesto, and decides about IFLRY's activities. These are stated in a two-year Programme of Action. The General Assembly also decides on the federation's policies by adopting resolutions. Furthermore, the General Assembly elects the Bureau and decides upon the budget.

The Executive Committee is composed of one representative from each member organisation and the Bureau. It meets twice a year and takes all policy decisions within the framework of the General Assembly's resolutions.

The IFLRY Bureau consists of a President, a Secretary General, a Treasurer and four Vice-Presidents. The Bureau has the responsibility for IFLRY's day-to-day management and is elected every two years. The IFLRY Bureau appoints an Executive Director who runs the IFLRY secretariat in Berlin.
