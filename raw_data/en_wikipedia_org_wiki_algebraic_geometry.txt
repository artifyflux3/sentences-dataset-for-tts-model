This [Togliatti surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togliatti_surface "Togliatti surface") is an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") of degree five. The picture represents a portion of its real [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)").

**Algebraic geometry** is a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") which uses [abstract algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra") techniques, mainly from [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"), to solve [geometrical problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"). Classically, it studies [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of [multivariate polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_polynomial "Multivariate polynomial"); the modern approach generalizes this in a few different aspects.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety"), which are geometric manifestations of [solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") of [systems of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_polynomial_equations "Systems of polynomial equations"). Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), [hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"), [cubic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve") like [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve"), and quartic curves like [lemniscates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli "Lemniscate of Bernoulli") and [Cassini ovals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_oval "Cassini oval"). These are [plane algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_algebraic_curve "Plane algebraic curve"). A point of the plane lies on an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation"). Basic questions involve the study of points of special interest like [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_a_curve "Singular point of a curve"), [inflection points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point "Inflection point") and [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity"). More advanced questions involve the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") of the curve and the relationship between curves defined by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis"), topology and [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"). As a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry begins with finding specific solutions via [equation solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving"), and then proceeds to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations. This understanding requires both conceptual theory and computational technique.

In the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.

*   The mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an [algebraically closed field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field").
*   [Real algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_algebraic_geometry "Real algebraic geometry") is the study of the real algebraic varieties.
*   [Diophantine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_geometry "Diophantine geometry") and, more generally, [arithmetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_geometry "Arithmetic geometry") is the study of algebraic varieties over [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") that are not algebraically closed and, specifically, over fields of interest in [algebraic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_theory "Algebraic number theory"), such as the field of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), [number fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_field "Number field"), [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field"), [function fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_function_field "Algebraic function field"), and [_p_-adic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number "P-adic number").
*   A large part of [singularity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory#Singularities_in_algebraic_geometry "Singularity theory") is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.
*   [Computational algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#Computational_algebraic_geometry) is an area that has emerged at the intersection of algebraic geometry and [computer algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra "Computer algebra"), with the rise of computers. It consists mainly of [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") design and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software") development for the study of properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.

Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [complex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry "Complex geometry"). One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is [Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck "Grothendieck")'s [scheme theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_theory "Scheme theory") which allows one to use [sheaf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_theory "Sheaf theory") to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_manifold "Differential manifold") and [analytic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"). This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through [Hilbert's Nullstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"), with a [maximal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_ideal "Maximal ideal") of the [coordinate ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_ring "Coordinate ring"), while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. [Wiles' proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem") of the longstanding conjecture called [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem") is an example of the power of this approach.

Sphere and slanted circle

In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more [polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_polynomial_equations "Systems of polynomial equations"). For instance, the [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere")[sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") of radius 1 in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**3 could be defined as the set of all points ![Image 3: {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22a8c93372e8f8b6e24d523bd5545aed3430baf4) with

A "slanted" circle in **R**3 can be defined as the set of all points ![Image 5: {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22a8c93372e8f8b6e24d523bd5545aed3430baf4) which satisfy the two polynomial equations

![Image 6: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-1=0,\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7db6d9ee74ec6ce4bb223f1a210d5e19c5ad3942)![Image 7: {\displaystyle x+y+z=0.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33c335caf234a007ac8f51d22ef263cbac54fbda)
First we start with a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")_k_. In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers **C**, but many of the same results are true if we assume only that _k_ is [algebraically closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field"). We consider the [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") of dimension _n_ over _k_, denoted **A**n(_k_) (or more simply **A**_n_, when _k_ is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinate system, one may identify **A**n(_k_) with _k_ _n_. The purpose of not working with _k_ _n_ is to emphasize that one "forgets" the vector space structure that _k_ n carries.

A function _f_: **A**_n_ → **A**1 is said to be _polynomial_ (or _regular_) if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial _p_ in _k_[_x_ 1,...,_x_ _n_] such that _f_(_M_) = _p_(_t_ 1,...,_t_ _n_) for every point _M_ with coordinates (_t_ 1,...,_t_ _n_) in **A**_n_. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in **A**_n_.

When a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine _n_-space may be identified with the ring of [polynomial functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_function "Polynomial function") in _n_ variables over _k_. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on **A**_n_ is a ring, which is denoted _k_[**A**_n_].

We say that a polynomial _vanishes_ at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let _S_ be a set of polynomials in _k_[**A**n]. The _vanishing set of S_ (or _vanishing locus_ or _zero set_) is the set _V_(_S_) of all points in **A**_n_ where every polynomial in _S_ vanishes. Symbolically,

![Image 8: {\displaystyle V(S)=\{(t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})\mid p(t_{1},\dots ,t_{n})=0{\text{ for all }}p\in S\}.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/515746f0489557e9f4bfa56da998d9ad398235c1)
A subset of **A**_n_ which is _V_(_S_), for some _S_, is called an _algebraic set_. The _V_ stands for _variety_ (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset _U_ of **A**_n_, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If _U_ is _any_ subset of **A**_n_, define _I_(_U_) to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains _U_. The _I_ stands for [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)"): if two polynomials _f_ and _g_ both vanish on _U_, then _f_+_g_ vanishes on _U_, and if _h_ is any polynomial, then _hf_ vanishes on _U_, so _I_(_U_) is always an ideal of the polynomial ring _k_[**A**_n_].

Two natural questions to ask are:

*   Given a subset _U_ of **A**_n_, when is _U_ = _V_(_I_(_U_))?
*   Given a set _S_ of polynomials, when is _S_ = _I_(_V_(_S_))?

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology"), a topology on **A**_n_ whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of _k_[**A**_n_]. Then _U_ = _V_(_I_(_U_)) if and only if _U_ is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by [Hilbert's Nullstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"). In one of its forms, it says that _I_(_V_(_S_)) is the [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_of_an_ideal "Radical of an ideal") of the ideal generated by _S_. In more abstract language, there is a [Galois connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_connection "Galois connection"), giving rise to two [closure operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_operator "Closure operator"); they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_connection#Examples "Galois connection") is elaborated at Galois connection.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set _U_. [Hilbert's basis theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem "Hilbert's basis theorem") implies that ideals in _k_[**A**_n_] are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called _[irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible\_component "Irreducible component")_ if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the _irreducible components_ of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a _[variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_variety "Algebraic variety")_. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a [prime ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal "Prime ideal") of the [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring").

Some authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use _irreducible variety_ to make the distinction when needed.

Just as [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") are the natural maps on [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") and [smooth functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") are the natural maps on [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called _regular functions_ or _polynomial functions_. A regular function on an algebraic set _V_ contained in **A**_n_ is the restriction to _V_ of a regular function on **A**_n_. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function").

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space "Normal space")[topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), where the [Tietze extension theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem "Tietze extension theorem") guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on _V_ form a ring, which we denote by _k_[_V_]. This ring is called the _[coordinate ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate\_ring "Coordinate ring") of V_.

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on **A**_n_, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on _V_ is the restriction of two functions _f_ and _g_ in _k_[**A**_n_], then _f_−_g_ is a polynomial function which is null on _V_ and thus belongs to _I_(_V_). Thus _k_[_V_] may be identified with _k_[**A**_n_]/_I_(_V_).

### Morphism of affine varieties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Morphism of affine varieties")]

Using regular functions from an affine variety to **A**1, we can define [regular maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism_of_algebraic_varieties "Morphism of algebraic varieties") from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let _V_ be a variety contained in **A**_n_. Choose _m_ regular functions on _V_, and call them _f_ 1, ..., _f_ _m_. We define a _regular map_ _f_ from _V_ to **A**_m_ by letting _f_ = (_f_ 1, ..., _f_ _m_). In other words, each _f_ _i_ determines one coordinate of the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of _f_.

If _V_′ is a variety contained in **A**_m_, we say that _f_ is a _regular map_ from _V_ to _V_′ if the range of _f_ is contained in _V_′.

The definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets. The regular maps are also called _morphisms_, as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the [morphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism "Morphism") are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.

Given a regular map _g_ from _V_ to _V_′ and a regular function _f_ of _k_[_V_′], then _f_ ∘ _g_ ∈ _k_[_V_]. The map _f_ → _f_ ∘ _g_ is a [ring homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism") from _k_[_V_′] to _k_[_V_]. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from _k_[_V_′] to _k_[_V_] defines a regular map from _V_ to _V_′. This defines an [equivalence of categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_of_categories "Equivalence of categories") between the category of algebraic sets and the [opposite category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(category_theory) "Dual (category theory)") of the finitely generated [reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_ring "Reduced ring")_k_-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of [scheme theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_theory "Scheme theory").

### Rational function and birational equivalence

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Rational function and birational equivalence")]

In contrast to the preceding sections, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.

If _V_ is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain") and has thus a [field of fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_fractions "Field of fractions") which is denoted _k_(_V_) and called the _field of the rational functions_ on _V_ or, shortly, the _[function field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function\_field\_of\_an\_algebraic\_variety "Function field of an algebraic variety")_ of _V_. Its elements are the restrictions to _V_ of the [rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function "Rational function") over the affine space containing _V_. The [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") of a rational function _f_ is not _V_ but the [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) "Complement (set theory)") of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of _f_ vanishes.

As with regular maps, one may define a _rational map_ from a variety _V_ to a variety _V_'. As with the regular maps, the rational maps from _V_ to _V_' may be identified to the [field homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism") from _k_(_V_') to _k_(_V_).

Two affine varieties are _birationally equivalent_ if there are two rational functions between them which are [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_inverse "Function inverse") one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.

An affine variety is a _[rational variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_variety "Rational variety")_ if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a _rational parameterization_, that is a [parametrization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(geometry) "Parametrization (geometry)") with [rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function "Rational function"). For example, the circle of equation ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee594b8851d760d0e2d44aba714907aca657b8f) is a rational curve, as it has the [parametric equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation")

![Image 10: {\displaystyle x={\frac {2\,t}{1+t^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d208b079aae8935893ac2f7a161ea682f00b151e)![Image 11: {\displaystyle y={\frac {1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51749329d32afc606b467370cf75a46942e3ff8b)
which may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.

The problem of [resolution of singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_of_singularities "Resolution of singularities") is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also [smooth completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_completion "Smooth completion")). It was solved in the affirmative in [characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra) "Characteristic (algebra)") 0 by [Heisuke Hironaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisuke_Hironaka "Heisuke Hironaka") in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Parabola_%26_cubic_curve_in_projective_space.png/250px-Parabola_%26_cubic_curve_in_projective_space.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parabola_%26_cubic_curve_in_projective_space.png)

Parabola (_y_ = _x_ 2, red) and cubic (_y_ = _x_ 3, blue) in projective space

Just as the formulas for the roots of second, third, and fourth degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number _i_, a root of the polynomial _x_ 2 + 1, projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points "at infinity", points where parallel lines may meet.

To see how this might come about, consider the variety _V_(_y_ − _x_ 2). If we draw it, we get a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"). As _x_ goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (_x_,_x_ 2) also goes to positive infinity. As _x_ goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.

Compare this to the variety _V_(_y_−_x_ 3). This is a [cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve"). As _x_ goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (_x_,_x_ 3) goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as _x_ goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior "at infinity" of _V_(_y_−_x_ 3) is different from the behavior "at infinity" of _V_(_y_−_x_ 2).

The consideration of the _projective completion_ of the two curves, which is their prolongation "at infinity" in the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), allows us to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a [regular point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Regular point of an algebraic variety"), whose tangent is the [line at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_at_infinity "Line at infinity"), while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a [cusp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity) "Cusp (singularity)"). Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by _x_, and the [Riemann-Roch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann-Roch_theorem_for_algebraic_curves "Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves") implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.

Thus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior "at infinity" and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, [Bézout's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_theorem "Bézout's theorem") on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

Nowadays, the _[projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective\_space "Projective space")_**P**_n_ of dimension _n_ is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension _n_ + 1, or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension _n_ + 1. When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension _n_ + 1, all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of _k_. This defines the [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates") of a point of **P**_n_ as a sequence of _n_ + 1 elements of the base field _k_, defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of _k_ (the same for the whole sequence).

A polynomial in _n_ + 1 variables vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is [homogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial"). In this case, one says that the polynomial _vanishes_ at the corresponding point of **P**_n_. This allows us to define a _projective algebraic set_ in **P**_n_ as the set _V_(_f_ 1, ..., _f_ _k_), where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials {_f_ 1, ..., _f_ _k_}  vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced [homogeneous ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_ideal "Homogeneous ideal") which define them. The _projective varieties_ are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose [homogeneous coordinate ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinate_ring "Homogeneous coordinate ring") is an [integral domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain "Integral domain"), the _projective coordinates ring_ being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in _n_ + 1 variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.

The only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the _field of the rational functions_ or _function field_ is a useful notion, which, similarly to the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.

Real algebraic geometry
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Real algebraic geometry")]

Real algebraic geometry is the study of real algebraic varieties.

The fact that the field of the real numbers is an [ordered field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field "Ordered field") cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation ![Image 13: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-a=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c613305193b3debdff2ea6268bdd170445d1bf13) is a circle if ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a>0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f34a80ea013edb56e340b19550430a8b6dfd7b9), but has no real points if ![Image 15: {\displaystyle a<0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5d7ca60f6ed64b99649dcee21847295fedf206c). Real algebraic geometry also investigates, more broadly, _[semi-algebraic sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-algebraic\_set "Semi-algebraic set")_, which are the solutions of systems of polynomial inequalities. For example, neither branch of the [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola") of equation ![Image 16: {\displaystyle xy-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa089ae542f18818ea8145eba8eeb97b8e337450) is a real algebraic variety. However, the branch in the first quadrant is a semi-algebraic set defined by ![Image 17: {\displaystyle xy-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa089ae542f18818ea8145eba8eeb97b8e337450) and ![Image 18: {\displaystyle x>0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80d24be5f0eb4a9173da6038badc8659546021d0).

One open problem in real algebraic geometry is the following part of [Hilbert's sixteenth problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_sixteenth_problem "Hilbert's sixteenth problem"): Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") of degree 8.

Computational algebraic geometry
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Computational algebraic geometry")]

One may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM'79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille "Marseille"), France, in June 1979. At this meeting,

*   Dennis S. Arnon showed that [George E. Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Collins "George E. Collins")'s [Cylindrical algebraic decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition "Cylindrical algebraic decomposition") (CAD) allows the computation of the topology of semi-algebraic sets,
*   [Bruno Buchberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Buchberger "Bruno Buchberger") presented [Gröbner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis") and his algorithm to compute them, and
*   [Daniel Lazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Lazard "Daniel Lazard") presented a new algorithm for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations with a [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity "Computational complexity") which is essentially polynomial in the expected number of solutions and thus singly exponential in the number of the unknowns. This algorithm is strongly related to [Macaulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Sowerby_Macaulay "Francis Sowerby Macaulay")'s [multivariate resultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant "Resultant").

Since then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is singly exponential in the number of the variables.

A body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called [numerical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algebraic_geometry "Numerical algebraic geometry") has been developed over the last several decades. The main computational method is [homotopy continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_continuation "Homotopy continuation"). This supports, for example, a model of [floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point "Floating point") computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.

A [Gröbner basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis") is a system of [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)#Definitions_and_motivation "Ideal (ring theory)") of a polynomial [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)") whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.

Given an ideal _I_ defining an algebraic set _V_:

*   _V_ is empty (over an algebraically closed extension of the basis field) if and only if the Gröbner basis for any [monomial ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order "Monomial order") is reduced to {1}.
*   By means of the [Hilbert series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_series "Hilbert series"), one may compute the [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") and the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_an_algebraic_variety "Degree of an algebraic variety") of _V_ from any Gröbner basis of _I_ for a monomial ordering refining the total degree.
*   If the dimension of _V_ is 0, then one may compute the points (finite in number) of _V_ from any Gröbner basis of _I_ (see [Systems of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_polynomial_equations "Systems of polynomial equations")).
*   A Gröbner basis computation allows one to remove from _V_ all irreducible components which are contained in a given hypersurface.
*   A Gröbner basis computation allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the image of _V_ by the projection on the _k_ first coordinates, and the subset of the image where the projection is not [proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_morphism "Proper morphism").
*   More generally, Gröbner basis computations allow one to compute the Zariski closure of the image and the [critical points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(mathematics) "Critical point (mathematics)") of a rational function of _V_ into another affine variety.

Gröbner basis computations do not allow one to compute directly the [primary decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_decomposition "Primary decomposition") of _I_ nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of _V_, but most algorithms for this involve Gröbner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gröbner bases use [regular chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_chain "Regular chain") but may need Gröbner bases in some exceptional situations.

Gröbner bases are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst-case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. [Faugère F5 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faug%C3%A8re_F5_algorithm "Faugère F5 algorithm") realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.

### Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)")]

CAD is an algorithm which was introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the [Tarski–Seidenberg theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%E2%80%93Seidenberg_theorem "Tarski–Seidenberg theorem") on [quantifier elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_elimination "Quantifier elimination") over the real numbers.

This theorem concerns the formulas of the [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") whose [atomic formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_formula "Atomic formula") are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators _and_ (∧), _or_ (∨), _not_ (¬), _for all_ (∀), and _there exists_ (∃). Tarski's theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifiers (∀, ∃).

The complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows one, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula—this is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.

While Gröbner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.

Since 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improving CAD or finding alternative algorithms in special cases of general interest.

As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least one point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test whether a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.

### Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency")]

The basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a doubly exponential worst-case [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"). More precisely, if _d_ is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and _n_ the number of variables, then their complexity is at most _d_ 2 _cn_ for some constant _c_, and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least _d_ 2 _c′n_ for another constant _c_′.

During the last 20 years of the 20th century, various algorithms were introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity ![Image 19: {\displaystyle d^{O(n^{2})}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b1820f6f2c447eda6918fda45f00a3390fd3ef8).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-1)

Among those algorithms which solve a subproblem of the problems solved by Gröbner bases, one may cite _testing whether an affine variety is empty_ and _solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions._ Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries, [Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faug%C3%A8re%27s_F4_and_F5_algorithms "Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms") have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (_probably_ because the evaluation of the complexity of Gröbner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).

The main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite _counting the number of connected components_, _testing whether two points are in the same components_, and _computing a [Whitney stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney\_stratification "Whitney stratification") of a real algebraic set_. They have a complexity of ![Image 20: {\displaystyle d^{O(n^{2})}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b1820f6f2c447eda6918fda45f00a3390fd3ef8), but the constant involved by _O_ notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and it is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.

Abstract modern viewpoint
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Abstract modern viewpoint")]

The modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, [formal schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_scheme "Formal scheme"), [ind-schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ind-scheme "Ind-scheme"), [algebraic spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_space "Algebraic space"), [algebraic stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_stack "Algebraic stack"), and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within the theory of varieties; for example, the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing [nilpotent elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent_element "Nilpotent element") in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions, and developing formal grounds for natural [intersection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_theory "Intersection theory") and [deformation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_theory "Deformation theory") lead to some of the further extensions.

Most remarkably, in the early 1960s, [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") were subsumed into [Alexander Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck "Alexander Grothendieck")'s concept of a [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"). Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are [locally ringed spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_ringed_space "Locally ringed space") which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field _k_, and the category of finitely generated reduced _k_-algebras. The gluing is along the Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the [Yoneda embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_embedding "Yoneda embedding"), within the more abstract category of [presheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presheaves "Presheaves") of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set-theoretic sense is then replaced by a [Grothendieck topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology "Grothendieck topology"). Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the [étale topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_topology "Étale topology"), and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples have become prominent, including the [Nisnevich topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisnevich_topology "Nisnevich topology"). Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to [stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(mathematics) "Stack (mathematics)") in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to [Artin stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin_stack "Artin stack") and, even finer, [Deligne–Mumford stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deligne%E2%80%93Mumford_stack "Deligne–Mumford stack"), both often called [algebraic stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_stack "Algebraic stack").

Sometimes, other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, [Nikolai Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Durov "Nikolai Durov") has introduced commutative algebraic [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory) "Monad (category theory)") as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry "Tropical geometry"), of an [absolute geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry "Absolute geometry") over a [field of one element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element "Field with one element"), and an algebraic analogue of [Arakelov's geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakelov%27s_geometry "Arakelov's geometry") were realized in this setup.

Another formal generalization is possible to [universal algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebraic_geometry "Universal algebraic geometry") in which every [variety of algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra) "Variety (universal algebra)") has its own algebraic geometry. The term _variety of algebras_ should not be confused with _algebraic variety_.

The language of schemes, stacks, and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and become cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.

Algebraic stacks can be further generalized, and for many practical questions like [deformation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_theory "Deformation theory") and [intersection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_theory "Intersection theory"), this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the [Grothendieck site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_site "Grothendieck site") of affine schemes to a [higher-categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_category_theory "Higher category theory") site of [derived affine schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_affine_scheme "Derived affine scheme"), by replacing the commutative rings with an [infinity category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_category "Infinity category") of [differential graded commutative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_graded_commutative_algebra "Differential graded commutative algebra"), or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets with presheaves of [simplicial sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set "Simplicial set") (or of [infinity groupoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity-groupoid "Infinity-groupoid")). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery, one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which satisfies certain infinite-categorical versions of sheaf axioms (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). [Quillen model categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quillen_model_category "Quillen model category"), Segal categories, and [quasicategories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicategory "Quasicategory") are some of the most-used tools to formalize this, yielding the _[derived algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived\_algebraic\_geometry "Derived algebraic geometry")_, introduced by the school of [Carlos Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Simpson "Carlos Simpson"), including Andre Hirschowitz, [Bertrand Toën](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_To%C3%ABn "Bertrand Toën"), Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié, and others; and developed further by [Jacob Lurie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lurie "Jacob Lurie"), [Bertrand Toën](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_To%C3%ABn "Bertrand Toën"), and [Gabriele Vezzosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Vezzosi "Gabriele Vezzosi"). Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories, has been developed from the early 1990s by [Maxim Kontsevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Kontsevich "Maxim Kontsevich") and followers.

### Before the 16th century

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Before the 16th century")]

Some of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the [Hellenistic Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Greece "Hellenistic Greece") from the 5th century BC. The [Delian problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_problem "Delian problem"), for instance, was to construct a length _x_ so that the cube of side _x_ contained the same volume as the rectangular box _a_ 2 _b_ for given sides _a_ and _b_. [Menaechmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menaechmus "Menaechmus") (c. 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics _ay_=_x_ 2 and _xy_=_ab_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-Dieudonn%C3%A9-2) In the 3rd century BC, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") and [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") systematically studied additional problems on [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_sections "Conic sections") using coordinates.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-Dieudonn%C3%A9-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKline1972108,_90-3)[Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") in the Conics further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") by some 1800 years.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-4) His application of reference lines, a [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"), and a [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding coordinates using geometric methods like using parabolas and curves.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-7) Medieval mathematicians, including [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam "Omar Khayyam"), [Leonardo of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_of_Pisa "Leonardo of Pisa"), [Gersonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides "Gersonides") and [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme") in the [Medieval Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKline1972193-8) solved certain cubic and quadratic equations by purely algebraic means and then interpreted the results geometrically. The [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people") mathematician [Omar Khayyám](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m "Omar Khayyám") (born 1048 AD) believed that there was a relationship between [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"), [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKline1972193%E2%80%93195-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-11) This was criticized by Jeffrey Oaks, who claims that the study of curves by means of equations originated with Descartes in the seventeenth century.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-12)

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") mathematicians such as [Gerolamo Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano "Gerolamo Cardano") and [Niccolò Fontana "Tartaglia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Fontana_Tartaglia "Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia") on their studies of the cubic equation. The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th- and 17th-century mathematicians, notably [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal") who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKline1972279-13) The French mathematicians [Franciscus Vieta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscus_Vieta "Franciscus Vieta") and later [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") and [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat") revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of [coordinate geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_geometry "Coordinate geometry"). They were interested primarily in the properties of _algebraic curves_, such as those defined by [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations "Diophantine equations") (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).

During the same period, Blaise Pascal and [Gérard Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Desargues "Gérard Desargues") approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the [synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry") notions of [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"). Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek _ruler-and-compass construction_. Ultimately, the [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th-century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"). However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the _calculus of infinitesimals_ of [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange") and [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler").

### 19th and early 20th century

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: 19th and early 20th century")]

It took the simultaneous 19th-century developments of [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") and [Abelian integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_integral "Abelian integral") in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by [Edmond Laguerre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Laguerre "Edmond Laguerre") and [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley"), who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of _homogeneous polynomial forms_, and more specifically [quadratic forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form"), on projective space. Subsequently, [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of [transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_group "Transformation group") on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the [projective linear transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_linear_transformation "Projective linear transformation") which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental [Kleinian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinian_geometry "Kleinian geometry") on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher-degree [birational transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational_transformation "Birational transformation"). This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century [Italian school of algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_school_of_algebraic_geometry "Italian school of algebraic geometry") to classify [algebraic surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") up to [birational isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational_isomorphism "Birational isomorphism").

The second early-19th-century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") to the development of [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface").

In the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"). The prominent results in this direction are [Hilbert's basis theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem "Hilbert's basis theorem") and [Hilbert's Nullstellensatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"), which are the basis of the connection between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and [Macaulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Sowerby_Macaulay "Francis Sowerby Macaulay")'s [multivariate resultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_resultant "Multivariate resultant"), which is the basis of [elimination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_theory "Elimination theory"). Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by [singularity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory") and computational algebraic geometry.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-14)

[B. L. van der Waerden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._L._van_der_Waerden "B. L. van der Waerden"), [Oscar Zariski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Zariski "Oscar Zariski"), and [André Weil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil "André Weil") developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"), including [valuation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_theory "Valuation theory") and the theory of [ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)"). One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of the [Italian school of algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_school_of_algebraic_geometry "Italian school of algebraic geometry"). In particular, this school used systematically the notion of [generic point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_point "Generic point") without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, [Jean-Pierre Serre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre "Jean-Pierre Serre") and [Alexander Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck "Alexander Grothendieck") recast the foundations making use of [sheaf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_theory "Sheaf theory"). Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)") was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of [homological techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra "Homological algebra"). After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory") and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"), [moduli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space"), and [formal moduli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_moduli "Formal moduli").

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the [abelian varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_variety "Abelian variety"), which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"). The prototypical examples are the [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve"), which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem") of [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem") and are also used in [elliptic-curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography "Elliptic-curve cryptography").

In parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of [Gröbner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis"), introduced by [Bruno Buchberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Buchberger "Bruno Buchberger") in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the [cylindrical algebraic decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition "Cylindrical algebraic decomposition"), introduced by [George E. Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Collins "George E. Collins") in 1973.

See also: [derived algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_algebraic_geometry "Derived algebraic geometry").

An **[analytic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_variety "Analytic variety")** over the field of real or complex numbers is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving [analytic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function"). It is analogous to the concept of [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") in that it carries a structure sheaf of analytic functions instead of regular functions. Any [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") is a complex analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity "Mathematical singularity"), not all complex analytic varieties are manifolds. Over a non-archimedean field analytic geometry is studied via [rigid analytic spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_analytic_space "Rigid analytic space").

Modern analytic geometry over the field of complex numbers is closely related to complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by [Jean-Pierre Serre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre "Jean-Pierre Serre") in his paper _[GAGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAGA "GAGA")_,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-15) the name of which is French for _Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry_. The GAGA results over the field of complex numbers may be extended to rigid analytic spaces over non-archimedean fields.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#cite_note-16)
