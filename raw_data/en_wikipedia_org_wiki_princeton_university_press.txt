**Princeton University Press** is a nonprofit [publisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing "Academic publishing") closely affiliated with [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University"). Its mission is to disseminate scholarship within [academia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia "Academia") and [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society "Society") at large.

The press was founded by Whitney Darrow, with the financial support of [Charles Scribner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scribner_II "Charles Scribner II"), as a [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") to serve the Princeton community in 1905.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-ErectedNYT-2) Its distinctive building was constructed in 1911 on William Street in Princeton.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-3) Its first book was a new 1912 edition of [John Witherspoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Witherspoon "John Witherspoon")'s _Lectures on Moral Philosophy._[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-HistoryPUP-4)

Princeton University Press was founded in 1905 by Princeton graduate and manager of the _Alumni Weekly_, Whitney Darrow. It began as Princeton Alumni Press, a small printing house which published the _Princeton Alumni Weekly_. The press received financial support from Princeton alumnus, [Charles Scribner II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scribner_II "Charles Scribner II").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-:0-5) Darrow and Scribner purchased the equipment and assumed the operations of two already existing local publishers, that of the _Princeton Alumni Weekly_ and the Princeton Press. The new press printed both local newspapers, university documents, _[The Daily Princetonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Daily\_Princetonian "The Daily Princetonian")_, and later added book publishing to its activities.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-Axtell-6) Beginning as a small, for-profit printer, Princeton University Press was reincorporated as a nonprofit in 1910.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-PW-79-22-7)

Since 1911, the press has been headquartered in a purpose-built gothic-style building designed by [Ernest Flagg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Flagg "Ernest Flagg"). The design of press's building, which was named the Scribner Building in 1965, was inspired by the Plantin-Moretus Museum, a printing museum in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1912, the Press published its first book, a new edition of _Lectures on Moral Philosophy_ by [John Witherspoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Witherspoon "John Witherspoon").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-:0-5)

Princeton University Press established a European office, in Woodstock, England, north of Oxford, in 1999, and opened an additional office, in Beijing, in early 2017.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-:0-5)

Princeton University Press joined The [Association of American Publishers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Publishers "Association of American Publishers") trade organization in the [Hachette v. Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_v._Internet_Archive "Hachette v. Internet Archive") lawsuit which resulted in the removal of access to over 500,000 books from global readers.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-9)

In 2025, Princeton University Press was criticized when several members of its staff appeared in Chinese [state media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media "State media") on an officially-sanctioned tour of sites in [Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Press#cite_note-12)
