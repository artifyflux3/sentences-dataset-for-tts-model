Find sources: "Poinsot's spirals" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2024 ) In mathematics , Poinsot's spirals are two spirals represented by the polar equations r = a csch ⁡ ⁡ ( n θ θ ) {\displaystyle r=a\ \operatorname {csch} (n\theta )} r = a sech ⁡ ⁡ ( n θ θ ) {\displaystyle r=a\ \operatorname {sech} (n\theta )} where csch is the hyperbolic cosecant , and sech is the hyperbolic secant .

[ 1 ] They are named after the French mathematician Louis Poinsot .

Examples of the two types of Poinsot's spirals [ edit ] The Poinsot spiral r=csch(θ/3).

The Poinsot spiral r=sech(θ/3).
