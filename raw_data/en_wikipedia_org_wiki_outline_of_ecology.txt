The environment of an organism includes both physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local abiotic factors such as solar insolation , climate and geology , as well as the other organisms that share its habitat .  Also called ecological science .

Essence of ecology [ edit ] Nature – Material world and its phenomena, or Natural environment – Living and non-living things on Earth Ecosystem – Community of living organisms together with the nonliving components of their environment, or Biome – Biogeographical unit with a particular biological community Community (ecology) – Associated populations of species in a given area, or Biocoenosis – Interacting organisms living together in a habitat Species – Basic unit of taxonomic classification, below genus Population – All the organisms of a given species that live in a specified region Organism – Individual living life form Biodiversity – Variety and variability of life forms Food web – Natural interconnection of food chains Other criteria [ edit ] Ecology can also be classified on the basis of: the primary kinds of organism under study, e.g.

animal ecology , plant ecology , insect ecology ; the biomes principally studied, e.g.

forest ecology , grassland ecology , desert ecology , benthic ecology , marine ecology , urban ecology ; the geographic or climatic area, e.g.

arctic ecology , tropical ecology ; the spatial scale under consideration, e.g.

macroecology , landscape ecology ; the philosophical approach, e.g.

systems ecology which adopts a holistic approach; the methods used, e.g.

molecular ecology .

Subdisciplines of ecology, and subdiscipline classification [ edit ] Ecology is a broad discipline comprising many subdisciplines. The field of ecology can be subdivided according to several classification schemes: By methodology used for investigation [ edit ] Field ecology – Collection of information outside a laboratory, library or workplace setting – Quantitative ecology – Theoretical ecology – Scientific discipline – the development of ecological theory, usually with mathematical, statistical and/or computer modeling tools.

By spatial scale of ecological system under study [ edit ] Global ecology – Global sum of all ecosystems on Earth – Macroecology – Study of relationships between organisms and their environment at large spatial scales – Microecology – Microbial ecology or ecology of a microhabitat.

By level of organisation or scope [ edit ] Arranged from lowest to highest level of organisation : [ 1 ] Autecology – Study of interactions of individual organisms with the environment – the study of individual organisms of a single species in relation to their environment; Synecology – Associated populations of species in a given area Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets – the study of homogenous or heterogenous groups of organisms in relation to their environment; Population ecology – Field of ecology – the study of homogenous groups of organisms related as a single species; Community ecology – Associated populations of species in a given area – the study of heterogenous groups of organisms of multiple associated species; Ecosystem ecology – Study of living and non-living components of ecosystems and their interactions.

By biological classification or taxon under study [ edit ] Human ecology – Study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments – Animal ecology – Scientific study of the relationships between living animals and their environment – Insect ecology – The study of how insects interact with the surrounding environment – Microbial ecology – Study of the relationship of microorganisms with their environment – Plant ecology – Study of effect of the environment on the abundance and distribution of plants.

By biogeographic realm or climatic area under study [ edit ] Arctic ecology – Study of the relationships between biotic and abiotic factors in the arctic – Polar ecology – Relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment – Tropical ecology – Study of the relationships between the biotic and abiotic components of the tropics.

By ecological aspects or phenomena under investigation [ edit ] Behavioral ecology – Study of the evolutionary basis for animal behavior due to ecological pressures – Chemical ecology – Study of chemically-mediated interactions between living organisms – which deals with the ecological role of biological chemicals used in a wide range of areas including defense against predators and attraction of mates; Disease ecology – Sub-discipline of ecology – which studies host-pathogen interactions, particularly those of infectious diseases, within the context of environmental factors; Ecophysiology – Study of adaptation of an organism's physiology to environmental conditions – which studies the interaction of physiological traits with the abiotic environment; Ecotoxicology – Study of the effects of toxic chemicals on organisms – which looks at the ecological role of toxic chemicals (often pollutants , but also naturally occurring compounds); Evolutionary ecology – Interaction of biology and evolution – or ecoevolution which looks at evolutionary changes in the context of the populations and communities in which the organisms exist; Fire ecology – Study of fire in ecosystems – which looks at the role of fire in the environment of plants and animals and its effect on ecological communities; Functional ecology – Branch of ecology – the study of the roles, or functions, that certain species (or groups thereof) play in an ecosystem; Genetic ecology – Study of genetic material in the environment – Landscape ecology – Relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems – Landscape limnology – Spatially explicit study of lakes, streams, and wetlands as they interact with landscapes – Molecular ecology – Subdiscipline of ecology – Paleoecology – Study of interactions between organisms and their environments across geologic timescales – Social ecology – Study of relationships between people and their environment – Soil ecology – Study of the interaction of soil and life – the ecology of the pedosphere – Sensory ecology – Spatial ecology – Study of the distribution or space occupied by species – Thermal ecology – the study of the relationship between temperature and organisms.

Ecology-involved interdisciplinary fields [ edit ] Agroecology – Study of ecological processes in agriculture – Applied ecology – the practice of employing ecological principles and understanding to solve real world problems (includes agroecology and conservation biology ); Conservation ecology – Study of threats to biological diversity – which studies how to reduce the risk of species extinction; Restoration ecology – Scientific study of renewing and restoring ecosystems Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets – which attempts to understand the ecological basis needed to restore impaired or damaged ecosystems; Biogeochemistry – Study of chemical cycles of the earth that are either driven by or influence biological activity – Biogeography – Study of distribution of species – Ecological design – Design approach sensitive to environmental impacts – Ecological economics – Interdependence of human economies and natural ecosystems – Ecological engineering – Environmental engineering – Ecological anthropology – Study of cultural adaptations to environments – Festive ecology – Study of ecology and cultural events – Ecological health – Ecosophy – Philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium as developed by Arne Næss or Félix Guattari – Environmental psychology – Academic study of the mind's relationship to one's immediate surroundings – Natural history – Study of organisms including animals or plants in their environment – Systems ecology – Holistic approach to the study of ecological systems – Other disciplines [ edit ] Ecology has also inspired (and lent its name to) other non-biological disciplines such as: Media ecology Industrial ecology Information ecology Biogeographic regions [ edit ] Map of six of the world's eight terrestrial realms Nearctic Palearctic Afrotropic Indomalaya Australasia Neotropic Oceania and Antarctic realms not shown Biosphere – Global sum of all ecosystems on Earth Terrestrial realms [ edit ] Biogeographic realm – Broadest biogeographic division of Earth.
