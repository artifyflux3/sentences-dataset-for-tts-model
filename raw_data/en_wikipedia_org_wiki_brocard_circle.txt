It passes through the circumcenter and symmedian point of the triangle, and is centered at the midpoint of the line segment joining them (so that this segment is a diameter ).

Equation [ edit ] In terms of the side lengths a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} , and c {\displaystyle c} of the given triangle, and the areal coordinates ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)} for points inside the triangle (where the x {\displaystyle x} -coordinate of a point is the area of the triangle made by that point with the side of length a {\displaystyle a} , etc), the Brocard circle consists of the points satisfying the equation [ 1 ] b 2 c 2 x 2 + a 2 c 2 y 2 + a 2 b 2 z 2 − − a 4 y z − − b 4 x z − − c 4 x y = 0.

{\displaystyle b^{2}c^{2}x^{2}+a^{2}c^{2}y^{2}+a^{2}b^{2}z^{2}-a^{4}yz-b^{4}xz-c^{4}xy=0.} Related points [ edit ] The two Brocard points lie on this circle, as do the vertices of the Brocard triangle .

[ 2 ] These five points, together with the other two points on the circle (the circumcenter and symmedian), justify the name "seven-point circle".

The Brocard circle is concentric with the first Lemoine circle .

[ 3 ] Special cases [ edit ] If the triangle is equilateral , the circumcenter and symmedian coincide and therefore the Brocard circle reduces to a single point.

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] The Brocard circle is named for Henri Brocard , [ 5 ] who presented a paper on it to the French Association for the Advancement of Science in Algiers in 1881.
