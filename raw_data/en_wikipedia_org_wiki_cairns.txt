In the 2021 census , Cairns had a population of 153,181 people.

[ 1 ] The city was founded in 1876 and named after Sir William Wellington Cairns , following the discovery of gold in the Hodgkinson River .

[ 3 ] During World War II , the city became a staging ground for the Allied Forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea . By the late 20th century the city had become a centre of international tourism . In the early 21st century, it has developed into a major regional city.

The economy of Cairns is based primarily on tourism, healthcare and education, along with a major capacity in aviation, marine and defence industries.

[ 4 ] The city has a gross regional product at about $12.2 billion as of 2024.

[ 5 ] The city is served by Cairns International Airport , the seventh-busiest airport in Australia . Cairns also has a major cruise ship industry servicing both domestic and international markets, with terminals at Cairns Seaport and Cairns Wharf Complex .

Cairns is a major tourist destination, with access to two UNESCO world heritage sites: the Daintree Rainforest as part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland , and the Great Barrier Reef , one of the seven natural wonders of the world .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Cairns Prior to British settlement , the Cairns area was inhabited by the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji people, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] who still claim their native title rights .

[ 8 ] Yidinji (also known as Yidinj, Yidiny, and Idindji) is an Australian Aboriginal language . Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region , in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale , and the Mulgrave River , and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi . The area in which the city is located  is known in the local Yidiny language as Gimuy, [ 6 ] and the clan who inhabited the region before colonisation are the Gimuy-walubarra clan.

[ 7 ] 1874 map showing native wells situated within the future site of Cairns From 1770 to the early 1870s, the area was known to the British simply as Trinity Bay . The arrival of beche de mer fishermen from the late 1860s saw the first European presence in the area. On the site of the modern-day Cairns foreshore, there was a large native well which was used by these fishermen. A violent confrontation occurred in 1872 between local Yidinji people and Phillip Garland, a beche de mer fisherman, over the use of this well. The area from this date was subsequently called Battle Camp .

[ 9 ] In 1876, hastened by the need to export gold mined from the Hodgkinson goldfields on the tablelands to the west, closer investigation by several official expeditions established its potential for development into a port. Brinsley G. Sheridan surveyed the area and selected a place further up Trinity Inlet known to the diggers as Smith's Landing for a settlement which he renamed Thornton .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] However, after Native Police officers Alexander Douglas-Douglas and Robert Arthur Johnstone opened a new track from the goldfields to Battle Camp, this more coastal site became preferable.

[ 12 ] The area was named Cairns in late 1876 in honour of the then Governor of Queensland, William Cairns.

[ 3 ] The site was predominantly mangrove swamps and sand ridges. Labourers gradually cleared the swamps, and the sand ridges were filled with dried mud, sawdust from local sawmills, and ballast from a quarry at Edge Hill.

Throughout the late 19th century, Cairns prospered from the settlement of Chinese immigrants who helped develop the region's agriculture.

[ 13 ] Soon after Cairns was established "a few entrepreneurial Chinese men began to experiment with crops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, rice, sugar, and bananas, while market gardeners grew much needed fruit and vegetables. This marked the beginning of the agricultural industry, which became the dominant industry." [ 14 ] "The growing agricultural industry in the Cairns region provided the impetus for Cairns Chinatown to develop as Chinese men turned to support industries such as market gardening and shop keeping. They were not only ex-miners, but a growing number of immigrants arriving directly from China to take advantage of the agricultural boom. In 1886 the Chinese population accounted for 60% of all farmers and 90% of gardeners, that is 795 cultivators and gardeners." [ 15 ] As agricultural changes and the White Australia policy impacted the Chinese population of Cairns, including its once thriving Chinatown declined. A Police census stated the Chinese population of Cairns was 450 in 1909, a decrease of around 1,000 since 1901.

[ 16 ] "Grafton Street, Cairns was the historical site for Cairns Chinatown - the largest and longest running Chinese community outside Brisbane from the 1880s until the mid 1940s. Supporting a diverse population of Chinese settlers, entrepreneurs, women and families, ..." [ 17 ] "From the early 1880s when the Lily Creek Chinese camp moved into Sachs Street, Chinatown was a busy and thriving community. According to Cathie May, the social structure of the community was divided according to place of origin with storekeepers on the eastern side of Sachs Street predominantly Sze Yap, and Chung Shan storekeepers and merchants on the western side. Nearly all Chinese immigrants to Cairns were from Guangdong Province in the Southern Delta area of China. Most came from Loong Dou, a small distinct district in Chung Shan, with a smaller group from Sze Yap or the "Four Districts" in Toishan. Some also came from Sam Yap or "Three Districts." " [ 18 ] As the 20th century progressed the Cairns Chinatown declined. "Australian Born Chinese showed little interest in maintaining the Chinese enclave. Many were westernised having at least one European parent or grandparent, or had themselves grown up assimilated into the broader Cairns community through their experiences at school. Neither cultural tastes, nor race relations, provided an incentive for Australian born Chinese to remain living in Chinatown. The barriers causing racial residential segregation were removed and many families lived outside Chinatown." [ 19 ] The Cairns Parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns ) was established in 1884.

[ 20 ] Farm in Cairns in 1897 Cairns War Memorial, c.

1936 Debris from the construction of a railway to Herberton on the Atherton Tableland, a project which started in 1886, was also used. The railway opened up land later used for agriculture on the lowlands (sugar cane, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples), and for fruit and dairy production on the Tableland. The success of local agriculture helped establish Cairns as a port, and the creation of a harbour board in 1906 supported its robust economic future.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] The Wharf Estate Cairns went on sale in Brisbane via auction on 19 February 1889 by John Macnamara & Co. Land Auctioneers. The land was part of the place known as the Railway Reserve. The sale was described by the Auctioneers as the 'largest ever yet held in Northern Queensland'.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] On 25 April 1926 ( ANZAC Day ), the Cairns Sailors and Soldiers War Memorial was unveiled by Alexander Frederick Draper , the mayor of the City of Cairns .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] During World War II, the Allied Forces used Cairns as a staging base for operations in the Pacific, [ 28 ] with United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force operational bases (now the airport), as well as a major military seaplane base, Naval Base Cairns , in Trinity Inlet, and United States Navy and Royal Australian Navy bases near the current wharf. Combat missions were flown out of Cairns in support of the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942.

Edmonton and White Rock south of Cairns were major military supply areas and U.S.

Paratroopers trained at Gordonvale and the Goldsborough Valley . A Special Forces training base was established at the old " Fairview " homestead on Munro's Hill, Mooroobool . This base was officially known as the Z Experimental Station , but referred to informally as "The House on the Hill".

[ 29 ] After World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the Cairns International Airport in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism particularly from the emerging Japanese market.

[ 30 ] Demographics [ edit ] In the 2016 census , the urban area of Cairns had a population of 144,730 people.

[ 31 ] In the 2021 census , the urban area of Cairns had a population of 153,181 people.

[ 1 ] Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 9.7% of the population.

[ 1 ] 68.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.0%, New Zealand 2.9%, Papua New Guinea 1.5%, Philippines 1.3% and India 1.2%.

[ 1 ] 76.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Japanese 1.5%, Nepali 0.7%, Mandarin 0.7%, Punjabi 0.6%, and Creole languages 0.6%.

[ 1 ] The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.9%, Catholic 19.7%, Not stated 10.1%,  Anglican 9.8%, other Christian 2.8%.

[ 1 ] Due to Far North Queensland's close proximity to Melanesia , the region has a large number of people of Melanesian origin. Cairns notably has a large Papua New Guineans community. Approximately 10,000 Papua New Guineans live in Cairns, more than anywhere outside of Papua New Guinea itself.

[ 32 ] Geography [ edit ] The Skyrail Rainforest Cableway goes over the rainforest and is one of the city's main tourist attractions.

The Mulgrave River running through the Goldsbrough Valley to the south of Gordonvale Fruit bats hanging from a mango tree, central Cairns Cairns is located on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula on a coastal strip between the Coral Sea and the Great Dividing Range .

[ 33 ] The northern part of the city is located on Trinity Bay and the city centre is located on Trinity Inlet . To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah . Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The Mulgrave River and Barron River flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the Cairns CBD . The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.

[ citation needed ] Urban layout [ edit ] City centre of Cairns Cairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at Ellis Beach . The city is approximately 52 km (32 mi) from north to south; it has experienced a recent urban sprawl , with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.

[ citation needed ] The Northern Beaches consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the Captain Cook Highway . From south to north, these are Machans Beach , Holloways Beach , Yorkeys Knob , Trinity Park , Trinity Beach , Kewarra Beach , Clifton Beach , Palm Cove , and Ellis Beach .

[ citation needed ] The suburb of Smithfield is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.

[ citation needed ] South of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River flood plain are the suburbs of Caravonica , Kamerunga , Freshwater , and Stratford . This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch , on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and Brinsmead on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation 365 m (1,198 ft)) and Whitfield Range.

Crystal Cascades and Copperlode Falls Dam are also behind this range. ( Kuranda , a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the Tablelands local government area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.) [ citation needed ] The city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of Cairns North , and Parramatta Park , Bungalow , Portsmith , and close to Westcourt , Manunda , Manoora , Edge Hill , Whitfield , Kanimbla , City View, Mooroobool , Earlville , Woree and Bayview Heights . The small suburb of Aeroglen is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford.

[ citation needed ] Southside Cairns , situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of White Rock , Mount Sheridan , Bentley Park and Edmonton . The townships of Goldsborough , Little Mulgrave , and Aloomba are near Gordonvale , on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the Bruce Highway . Several other small towns and communities within Cairns's jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce Highway, the furthest being Bramston Beach , 81 km (50 mi) south of the Cairns CBD ; the largest of these townships is Babinda , about 60 km (37 mi) from the city.

[ citation needed ] Climate [ edit ] Tropical beach near Cairns Cairns experiences a tropical climate, specifically a tropical monsoon ( Am ) under the Köppen climate classification .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] A wet season with heavy monsoonal downpours runs from November to May, with a relatively dry season from June to October, though light showers occur during this period.

[ 36 ] Cairns's mean annual rainfall is just under 2,000 millimetres (79 in), although monthly totals in the wet season from December to April can exceed 1,000 mm (39 in), with the highest monthly rainfall being recorded in January 1981, when over 1,417.4 mm (55.80 in) of rain fell.

[ 37 ] In contrast, as little as 721 millimetres or 28.39 inches fell in the record dry calendar year of 2002.

Cairns has hot, humid summers and very warm winters.

[ 36 ] Mean maximum temperatures vary from 26.2 °C (79.2 °F) in July to 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) in January.

Monsoonal activity during the wet season occasionally causes major flooding of the Barron and Mulgrave Rivers, cutting off-road and rail access to the city. Cairns has 97.0 clear days, annually. Dewpoint in the wet season (summer) averages at 23 °C (73 °F). The average temperature of the sea ranges from 23.8 °C (74.8 °F) in July to 29.4 °C (84.9 °F) in January.

The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 9 councillors, elected from 9 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional preferential voting system. Elections are held every four years.

[ 76 ] The Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original City of Cairns , consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the Shire of Mulgrave (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the Shire of Douglas , which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms and then de-amalgamated in 2014.

[ 77 ] At the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns CBD . The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision, new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith at 119–145 Spence Street.

[ 78 ] Cairns has three representatives in the Queensland Parliament , from the electoral districts of Barron River , Cairns and Mulgrave . The city is represented in the Federal Parliament by representatives elected from the districts of Leichhardt and Kennedy .

Cairns Pier Cairns serves as the major commercial centre for the Far North Queensland and Cape York Peninsula Regions. It is a base for the regional offices of various government departments.

Tourism [ edit ] Tourism plays a major part in the Cairns economy . According to Tourism Australia , the Cairns region is the fourth-most-popular destination for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

[ 81 ] While the city does not rank amongst Australia's top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts a significant number of Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals.

[ 82 ] There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese leisure market with regular scheduled direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. During the 2013 Chinese Lunar New Year period alone, Cairns saw 20,000 Chinese holidaymakers flying in on chartered flights.

[ 83 ] The city is near the Great Barrier Reef , the Wet Tropics of Queensland , and the Atherton Tableland . Great Barrier Reef tours that operate from Cairns are very popular and hence Cairns is also considered as the gateway to Great Barrier Reef.

[ citation needed ] The Cairns esplanade includes a swimming lagoon with adjoining barbecue areas. Cairns Esplanade Lagoon opened in March 2003.

[ 84 ] Though initially controversial, the 4800-square-metre pool has proved a very popular local attraction since its opening. In May 2003, the then Cairns Mayor Kevin Byrne declared that topless sunbathing is permitted here.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] Commercial [ edit ] Several shopping centres of various sizes are located throughout Cairns. The largest of these are Cairns Central shopping centre, located in the central business district (CBD), and Stockland Cairns, located in the suburb of Earlville. In Westcourt, one of the city's oldest shopping centres has been refurbished, with the city's first DFO .

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] To service the needs of suburbs further from the city centre, shopping complexes are also located at Mount Sheridan, Redlynch, Smithfield, and Clifton Beach.
