( December 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Atmospheric motion matching a planet's rotation Cyclonic rotation or cyclonic circulation is the atmospheric motion in the same direction as a planet's rotation , as opposed to anticyclonic rotation . In the case of Earth's rotation , the Coriolis effect causes cyclonic rotation to be in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere .

[ 1 ] A closed area of winds rotating cyclonically is known as a cyclone .
