Lusurier was a native of Paris ; her mother, Jeanne Callot, was a dressmaker, while her father Pierre was a member of a family of milliners . She was the niece of Hubert Drouais , to whom she was apprenticed until his death, whereupon she continued to live with his widow, Marie–Marguerite Lusurier, on the rue des Orties in the parish of Saint-Roch; today the street no longer exists, having been torn up to make way for the avenue de l'Opéra during the Second Empire .

While in their atelier , she likely worked alongside François-Hubert Drouais and his son Jean Germain Drouais . Twenty-one paintings, including portraits of Jean Drouais as a boy and of Jean le Rond d'Alembert , have been ascribed to Lusurier, who was only twenty-eight at the time of her death.

[ 1 ] A drawing of a boy is owned by the National Gallery of Art , [ 2 ] and a portrait of a girl, formerly ascribed to François-Hubert Drouais, is in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum .

[ 3 ] The portrait of Jean Drouais is owned by the Louvre , while that of d'Alembert is in the Carnavalet Museum .
