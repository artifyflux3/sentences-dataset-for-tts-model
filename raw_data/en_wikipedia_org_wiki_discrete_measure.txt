The Dirac measure is a discrete measure whose support is the point 0. The Dirac measure of any set containing 0 is 1, and the measure of any set not containing 0 is 0.

In mathematics , more precisely in measure theory , a measure on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure ) if it is concentrated on an at most countable set . The support need not be a discrete set . Geometrically, a discrete measure (on the real line, with respect to Lebesgue measure) is a collection of point masses.

Definition and properties [ edit ] See also: Atom (measure theory) Given two (positive) œÉ-finite measures Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } and ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } on a measurable space ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} . Then Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } is said to be discrete with respect to ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } if there exists an at most countable subset S ‚äÇ ‚äÇ X {\displaystyle S\subset X} in Œ£ Œ£ {\displaystyle \Sigma } such that All singletons { s } {\displaystyle \{s\}} with s ‚àà ‚àà S {\displaystyle s\in S} are measurable  (which implies that any subset of S {\displaystyle S} is measurable) ŒΩ ŒΩ ( S ) = 0 {\displaystyle \nu (S)=0\,} Œº Œº ( X ‚àñ ‚àñ S ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \mu (X\setminus S)=0.\,} A measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } on ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is discrete (with respect to ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } ) if and only if Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } has the form Œº Œº = ‚àë ‚àë i = 1 ‚àû ‚àû a i Œ¥ Œ¥ s i {\displaystyle \mu =\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }a_{i}\delta _{s_{i}}} with a i ‚àà ‚àà R > 0 {\displaystyle a_{i}\in \mathbb {R} _{>0}} and Dirac measures Œ¥ Œ¥ s i {\displaystyle \delta _{s_{i}}} on the set S = { s i } i ‚àà ‚àà N {\displaystyle S=\{s_{i}\}_{i\in \mathbb {N} }} defined as Œ¥ Œ¥ s i ( X ) = { 1 if s i ‚àà ‚àà X 0 if s i ‚àâ X {\displaystyle \delta _{s_{i}}(X)={\begin{cases}1&{\mbox{ if }}s_{i}\in X\\0&{\mbox{ if }}s_{i}\not \in X\\\end{cases}}} for all i ‚àà ‚àà N {\displaystyle i\in \mathbb {N} } .

One can also define the concept of discreteness for signed measures . Then, instead of conditions 2 and 3 above one should ask that ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } be zero on all measurable subsets of S {\displaystyle S} and Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } be zero on measurable subsets of X ‚àñ ‚àñ S .

{\displaystyle X\backslash S.} [ clarification needed ] Example on R [ edit ] A measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } defined on the Lebesgue measurable sets of the real line with values in [ 0 , ‚àû ‚àû ] {\displaystyle [0,\infty ]} is  said to be discrete if there exists a (possibly finite) sequence of numbers s 1 , s 2 , ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ {\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},\dots \,} such that Œº Œº ( R ‚àñ ‚àñ { s 1 , s 2 , ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ } ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \mu (\mathbb {R} \backslash \{s_{1},s_{2},\dots \})=0.} Notice that the first two requirements in the previous section are always satisfied for an at most countable subset of the real line if ŒΩ ŒΩ {\displaystyle \nu } is the Lebesgue measure.

The simplest example of a discrete measure on the real line is the Dirac delta function Œ¥ Œ¥ .

{\displaystyle \delta .} One has Œ¥ Œ¥ ( R ‚àñ ‚àñ { 0 } ) = 0 {\displaystyle \delta (\mathbb {R} \backslash \{0\})=0} and Œ¥ Œ¥ ( { 0 } ) = 1.

{\displaystyle \delta (\{0\})=1.} More generally, one may prove that any discrete measure on the real line has the form Œº Œº = ‚àë ‚àë i a i Œ¥ Œ¥ s i {\displaystyle \mu =\sum _{i}a_{i}\delta _{s_{i}}} for an appropriately chosen (possibly finite) sequence s 1 , s 2 , ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ {\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},\dots } of real numbers and a sequence a 1 , a 2 , ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2},\dots } of numbers in [ 0 , ‚àû ‚àû ] {\displaystyle [0,\infty ]} of the same length.
