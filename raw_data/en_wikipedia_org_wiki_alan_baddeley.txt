He is known for his research on memory and for developing the three-component model of working memory . He is a professor of psychology at the University of York .

Biography [ edit ] Baddeley was born in Leeds , Yorkshire on 23 March 1934.

[ 1 ] He lived there with his parents, Donald and Nellie Baddeley, until leaving for university.

[ 2 ] He decided to study psychology and was originally interested in psychoanalysis . Later he changed his focus to evidence-based psychology.

[ 3 ] In 1956, Baddeley went to the United States of America to continue his studies. After spending a year in America, he returned home. He then went to Cambridge, where he met and married Hilary Ann White. Baddeley and his wife have three sons.

[ 2 ] Baddeley has taught and conducted research at University of Sussex , University of Stirling , MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Churchill College , University of Cambridge , and University of Bristol . He is currently a professor of psychology at the University of York .

[ 4 ] Education [ edit ] Baddeley attended the University College London from 1953 to 1956. He then obtained an MA from Princeton University 's Department of Psychology in 1957. He earned a PhD from University of Cambridge in 1962.

[ 5 ] He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by University of Essex in 1999, [ 6 ] Plymouth University in 2000, [ 7 ] and University of Bristol in 2019.

[ 8 ] Career and research [ edit ] In 1974, working with Graham Hitch , Baddeley developed an influential model of working memory called Baddeley's model of working memory , [ 9 ] which argues for the existence of multiple short-term memory stores and a separate interacting system for manipulating the content of these stores. There are three components of this model: the phonological loop, the central executive, and the visuospatial sketch pad.

[ 9 ] In 2000, Baddeley suggested adding a fourth component to his memory model called the episodic buffer.

[ 10 ] The model accounts for much of the empirical data on short-term retention and manipulation of information.

The Working Memory Model (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974, revised 2000) His landmark study in 1975 on the capacity of short-term memory [ 11 ] showed that people remembered more short words than long words in a recall test. This was called the word length effect and it demonstrated that pronunciation time rather than number of items determines the capacity of verbal short-term memory. This study also found that when participants repeated an irrelevant sound while reading the words, the word length effect does not happen.

[ 11 ] Working with Barbara Wilson , Baddeley also did several important studies on amnesia and memory.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] They studied patients with temporal lobe damage that caused memory problems. Results of such studies provide evidence that short-term and long-term memory are not one system. The amnesia patients had normal short-term memory but impaired long-term memory.

[ 14 ] Baddeley has also done research studies using divers and various underwater conditions. He studied the effects of depth and pressure on dexterity, [ 15 ] the impact of temperature on response time, [ 16 ] and context-dependent memory on land and underwater.

[ 17 ] Baddeley was the director of the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit , a branch of the UK Medical Research Council , based in Cambridge , from 1974 - 1997.

[ 18 ] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1993 [ 19 ] and in 1996, was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 20 ] In 2001, Baddeley received the American Psychological Association (APA) Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions.

[ 21 ] Baddeley was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the British Psychological Society in 2012.

[ 22 ] He also received the Major Advancement in Psychological Science Prize from the International Union of Psychological Science in 2016.

[ 23 ] Other notable works [ edit ] Baddeley has also part authored a number of neuropsychological tests including the Doors and People , [ 24 ] Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CN REP), [ 25 ] the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), [ 26 ] Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI), [ 27 ] Visual Patterns Test (VPT) [ 28 ] and the Speed and Capacity of Language Processing Test (SCOLP).

[ 29 ] Baddeley was involved in the design of United Kingdom postcodes , [ 30 ] and was one of the founders of the European Society for Cognitive Psychology .
