An example of spectroscopy: a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics) "Prism (optics)") separates white light by [dispersing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics) "Dispersion (optics)") it into its component colors.

**Spectroscopy** is the field of study that measures and interprets [electromagnetic spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-Crouch-Skoog-Holler2007-2) In narrower contexts, spectroscopy is the precise study of [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color "Color") as generalized from [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light "Visible light") to all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental exploratory tool in the fields of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), allowing the composition, physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be investigated at the atomic, [molecular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") and macro scale, and over [astronomical distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measures_(cosmology) "Distance measures (cosmology)").

Historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of the wavelength dependence of the absorption by gas phase matter of visible light dispersed by a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics) "Prism (optics)"). Current applications of spectroscopy include [biomedical spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_spectroscopy "Biomedical spectroscopy") in the areas of [tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)") analysis and [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging"). [Matter waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave") and [acoustic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_wave "Acoustic wave") can also be considered forms of radiative energy, and recently [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave") have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO "LIGO") (LIGO).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-3)

Spectroscopy is a branch of science concerned with the [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum") of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") as a function of its wavelength or frequency measured by [spectrographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrograph "Spectrograph") equipment, and other techniques, in order to obtain information concerning the structure and properties of matter.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-4) Spectral measurement devices are referred to as [spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometers "Spectrometers"), [spectrophotometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometers "Spectrophotometers"), [spectrographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrograph "Spectrograph") or [spectral analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_analyzer "Spectral analyzer"). Most spectroscopic analysis in the laboratory starts with a sample to be analyzed, then a light source is chosen from any desired range of the light spectrum, then the light goes through the sample to a dispersion array (diffraction grating instrument) and captured by a [photodiode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode "Photodiode"). For astronomical purposes, the telescope must be equipped with the light dispersion device. There are various versions of this basic setup that may be employed.

Spectroscopy began with [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") splitting light with a prism; a key moment in the development of modern [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-5) Therefore, it was originally the study of visible light that we call [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color "Color") that later under the studies of [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") came to include the entire [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-6) Although color is involved in spectroscopy, it is not equated with the color of elements or objects that involve the absorption and reflection of certain electromagnetic waves to give objects a sense of color to our eyes. Rather spectroscopy involves the splitting of light by a prism, diffraction grating, or similar instrument, to give off a particular discrete line pattern called a "spectrum" unique to each different type of element. Most elements are first put into a gaseous phase to allow the spectra to be examined although today other methods can be used on different phases. Each element that is diffracted by a prism-like instrument displays either an absorption spectrum or an emission spectrum depending upon whether the element is being cooled or heated.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-auto-7)

Until recently all spectroscopy involved the study of line spectra and most spectroscopy still does.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-8) Vibrational spectroscopy is the branch of spectroscopy that studies the spectra.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-9) However, the latest developments in spectroscopy can sometimes dispense with the dispersion technique. In biochemical spectroscopy, information can be gathered about biological tissue by absorption and light scattering techniques. Light scattering spectroscopy is a type of reflectance spectroscopy that determines tissue structures by examining elastic scattering.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-link.aps.org-10) In such a case, it is the tissue that acts as a diffraction or dispersion mechanism.

Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), because the first useful atomic models described the spectra of hydrogen, which include the [Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model"), the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"), and [Matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics"), all of which can produce the spectral lines of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), therefore providing the basis for discrete quantum jumps to match the discrete hydrogen spectrum. Also, [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck")'s explanation of [blackbody radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation "Blackbody radiation") involved spectroscopy because he was comparing the wavelength of light using a photometer to the temperature of a [Black Body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Body "Black Body").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-11) Spectroscopy is used in [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry "Physical chemistry") and [analytical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry "Analytical chemistry") because [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules") have unique spectra. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy "Astronomical spectroscopy") and [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing") on Earth. Most research [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopes "Telescopes") have spectrographs. The measured spectra are used to determine the chemical composition and [physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property "Physical property") of [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_objects "Astronomical objects") (such as their [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), density of elements in a star, [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes") and more).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-12) An important use for spectroscopy is in biochemistry. Molecular samples may be analyzed for species identification and energy content.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-13)

The underlying premise of spectroscopy is that light is made of different wavelengths and that each wavelength corresponds to a different frequency. The importance of spectroscopy is centered around the fact that every element in the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table") has a unique light spectrum described by the frequencies of light it emits or absorbs consistently appearing in the same part of the electromagnetic spectrum when that light is diffracted. This opened up an entire field of study with anything that contains atoms. Spectroscopy is the key to understanding the atomic properties of all matter. As such spectroscopy opened up many new sub-fields of science yet undiscovered. The idea that each atomic element has its unique spectral signature enabled spectroscopy to be used in a broad number of fields each with a specific goal achieved by different spectroscopic procedures. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") maintains a public Atomic Spectra Database that is continually updated with precise measurements.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-14)

The broadening of the field of spectroscopy is due to the fact that any part of the electromagnetic spectrum may be used to analyze a sample from the infrared to the ultraviolet telling scientists different properties about the very same sample. For instance in chemical analysis, the most common types of spectroscopy include atomic spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy "Raman spectroscopy") and [nuclear magnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Nuclear magnetic resonance").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-15) In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the theory behind it is that frequency is analogous to [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance "Resonance") and its corresponding resonant frequency. Resonances by the frequency were first characterized in mechanical systems such as [pendulums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulums "Pendulums"), which have a frequency of motion noted famously by [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-16)

Classification of methods
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spectroscopy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Classification of methods")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/A_Taste_of_ESPRESSO.jpg/250px-A_Taste_of_ESPRESSO.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_Taste_of_ESPRESSO.jpg)

A huge diffraction grating at the heart of the ultra-precise [ESPRESSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPRESSO "ESPRESSO") spectrograph.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-17)

Spectroscopy is a sufficiently broad field that many sub-disciplines exist, each with numerous implementations of specific spectroscopic techniques. The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways.

### Type of radiative energy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spectroscopy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Type of radiative energy")]

The types of spectroscopy are distinguished by the type of radiative energy involved in the interaction. In many applications, the spectrum is determined by measuring changes in the intensity or frequency of this energy. The types of radiative energy studied include:

*   [Electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") was the first source of energy used for spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ electromagnetic radiation are typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and include [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_spectroscopy "Microwave spectroscopy"), [terahertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_spectroscopy_and_technology "Terahertz spectroscopy and technology"), [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy"), [near-infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy "Near-infrared spectroscopy"), [ultraviolet-visible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet%E2%80%93visible_spectroscopy "Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy"), [x-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_spectroscopy "X-ray spectroscopy"), and [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_spectroscopy "Gamma spectroscopy") spectroscopy.
*   Particles, because of their [de Broglie waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave"), can also be a source of radiative energy. Both [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_spectroscopy "Electron spectroscopy") and [neutron spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_spectroscopy "Neutron spectroscopy") are commonly used. For a particle, its [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") determines its wavelength.
*   [Acoustic spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram "Spectrogram") involves radiated pressure waves.
*   [Dynamic mechanical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mechanical_analysis "Dynamic mechanical analysis") can be employed to impart radiating energy, similar to acoustic waves, to solid materials.

### Nature of the interaction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spectroscopy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Nature of the interaction")]

The types of spectroscopy also can be distinguished by the nature of the interaction between the energy and the material. These interactions include:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-Crouch-Skoog-Holler2007-2)

*   [Absorption spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy "Absorption spectroscopy"): Absorption occurs when energy from the radiative source is absorbed by the material. Absorption is often determined by measuring the fraction of energy transmitted through the material, with absorption decreasing the transmitted portion.
*   [Emission spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectroscopy "Emission spectroscopy"): Emission indicates that radiative energy is released by the material. A material's [blackbody spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_spectrum "Blackbody spectrum") is a spontaneous emission spectrum determined by its temperature. This feature can be measured in the infrared by instruments such as the atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-18) Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as [flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_spectroscopy "Flame spectroscopy"), [sparks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_(fire) "Spark (fire)"), [electric arcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc "Electric arc") or electromagnetic radiation in the case of [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy "Fluorescence spectroscopy").
*   [Elastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_scattering "Elastic scattering") and [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity "Reflectivity") spectroscopy determine how incident radiation is reflected or scattered by a material. [Crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography "Crystallography") employs the scattering of high energy radiation, such as x-rays and electrons, to examine the arrangement of atoms in proteins and solid crystals.
*   [Impedance spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_spectroscopy "Impedance spectroscopy"): Impedance is the ability of a medium to impede or slow the transmittance of energy. For [optical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") applications, this is characterized by the [index of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_refraction "Index of refraction").
*   [Inelastic scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inelastic_scattering "Inelastic scattering") phenomena involve an exchange of energy between the radiation and the matter that shifts the wavelength of the scattered radiation. These include [Raman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering "Raman scattering") and [Compton scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering "Compton scattering").
*   [Coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_spectroscopy "Coherent spectroscopy") or resonance spectroscopy are techniques where the radiative energy couples two quantum states of the material in a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)") interaction that is sustained by the radiating field. The coherence can be disrupted by other interactions, such as particle collisions and energy transfer, and so often require high intensity radiation to be sustained. [Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy") is a widely used resonance method, and [ultrafast laser spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafast_laser_spectroscopy "Ultrafast laser spectroscopy") is also possible in the infrared and visible spectral regions.
*   [Nuclear spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_spectroscopy "Nuclear spectroscopy") are methods that use the properties of specific [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") to probe the [local structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_structure "Local structure") in matter, mainly [condensed matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter "Condensed matter"), [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") in liquids or frozen liquids and bio-molecules.
*   [Quantum logic spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_spectroscopy "Quantum logic spectroscopy") is a general technique used in [ion traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_traps "Ion traps") that enables precision spectroscopy of ions with internal structures that preclude [laser cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cooling "Laser cooling"), state manipulation, and detection. [Quantum logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic "Quantum logic") operations enable a controllable ion to exchange information with a co-trapped ion that has a complex or unknown electronic structure.

Spectroscopic studies are designed so that the [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy "Radiant energy") interacts with specific types of matter.

Atomic spectra comparison table, from "Spektroskopische Methoden der analytischen Chemie" (1922).

[Atomic spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectroscopy "Atomic spectroscopy") was the first application of spectroscopy. [Atomic absorption spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy "Atomic absorption spectroscopy") and [atomic emission spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_emission_spectroscopy "Atomic emission spectroscopy") involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, often referred to as atomic spectral lines, are due to [electronic transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_structure#Energy_levels "Atomic structure") of outer shell electrons as they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states.

Atoms of different elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic spectroscopy allows for the identification and quantitation of a sample's elemental composition. After inventing the spectroscope, [Robert Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen "Robert Bunsen") and [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff") discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra. Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as [Fraunhofer lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines "Fraunhofer lines") after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the [hydrogen spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series "Hydrogen spectral series") was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the [Lamb shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift "Lamb shift") observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further led to the development of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics").

Modern implementations of atomic spectroscopy for studying visible and ultraviolet transitions include [flame emission spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_emission_spectroscopy "Flame emission spectroscopy"), [inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy "Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy"), [glow discharge spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glow_discharge#Use_in_analytical_chemistry "Glow discharge"), [microwave induced plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_induced_plasma "Microwave induced plasma") spectroscopy, and spark or arc emission spectroscopy. Techniques for studying x-ray spectra include [X-ray spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_spectroscopy "X-ray spectroscopy") and [X-ray fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence "X-ray fluorescence").

The combination of atoms into molecules leads to the creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states ([electron paramagnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_paramagnetic_resonance "Electron paramagnetic resonance")), [molecular rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_spectroscopy "Rotational spectroscopy"), [molecular vibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_vibration "Molecular vibration"), and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimetre-wave spectral regions. Rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy "Raman spectroscopy"). Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as [fluorescence spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy "Fluorescence spectroscopy").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-Crouch-Skoog-Holler2007-2)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-22)

Studies in molecular spectroscopy led to the development of the first [maser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser "Maser") and contributed to the subsequent development of the [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser").

#### Crystals and extended materials

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spectroscopy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Crystals and extended materials")]

The combination of atoms or molecules into crystals or other extended forms leads to the creation of additional energetic states. These states are numerous and therefore have a high density of states. This high density often makes the spectra weaker and less distinct, i.e., broader. For instance, blackbody radiation is due to the thermal motions of atoms and molecules within a material. Acoustic and mechanical responses are due to collective motions as well. Pure crystals, though, can have distinct spectral transitions, and the crystal arrangement also has an effect on the observed molecular spectra. The regular [lattice structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_structure "Lattice structure") of crystals also scatters x-rays, electrons or neutrons allowing for crystallographic studies.

Nuclei also have distinct energy states that are widely separated and lead to [gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray") spectra. Distinct nuclear spin states can have their energy separated by a magnetic field, and this allows for [nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy").

Other types of spectroscopy are distinguished by specific applications or implementations:

There are several applications of spectroscopy in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Taking advantage of the properties of [absorbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance "Absorbance") and with [astronomy emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomy_emission&action=edit&redlink=1 "Astronomy emission (page does not exist)"), spectroscopy can be used to identify certain states of nature. The uses of spectroscopy in so many different fields and for so many different applications has caused specialty scientific subfields. Such examples include:

*   Determining the atomic structure of a sample[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-Bowers-32)
*   Studying spectral emission lines of the sun and distant galaxies[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-Brand_57-33)
*   Space exploration

*   [In-ovo sexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ovo_sexing "In-ovo sexing"): spectroscopy allows to determine the sex of the egg while it is hatching. Developed by French and German companies, both countries decided to ban [chick culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling "Chick culling"), mostly done through a macerator, in 2022.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-36)
*   Process monitoring in [Industrial process control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_process_control "Industrial process control")[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-grauluque2021-37)

The history of spectroscopy began with [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s optics experiments (1666–1672). According to [Andrew Fraknoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fraknoi "Andrew Fraknoi") and [David Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morrison_(astrophysicist) "David Morrison (astrophysicist)"), "In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society"), Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole and then through a prism. Newton found that sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-open-astro-38) Newton applied the word "spectrum" to describe the rainbow of colors that combine to form white light and that are revealed when the white light is passed through a prism.

Fraknoi and Morrison state that "In 1802, [William Hyde Wollaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston "William Hyde Wollaston") built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun's spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the spectrum."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-open-astro-38) During the early 1800s, [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer "Joseph von Fraunhofer") made experimental advances with dispersive spectrometers that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in chemistry, physics, and astronomy. Per Fraknoi and Morrison, "Later, in 1815, German physicist Joseph Fraunhofer also examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), are now known as Fraunhofer lines, or Absorption lines."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-open-astro-38)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two quantum mechanical [stationary states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state "Stationary state") of one system, such as an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), via an oscillatory source of energy such as a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"). The coupling of the two states is strongest when the energy of the source matches the energy difference between the two states. The energy E of a photon is related to its frequency ν by _E_ = _hν_ where h is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), and so a spectrum of the system response vs. photon frequency will peak at the resonant frequency or energy. Particles such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") have a comparable relationship, the [de Broglie relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie_relations "De Broglie relations"), between their kinetic energy and their wavelength and frequency and therefore can also excite resonant interactions.

Spectra of atoms and molecules often consist of a series of spectral lines, each one representing a resonance between two different quantum states. The explanation of these series, and the spectral patterns associated with them, were one of the experimental enigmas that drove the development and acceptance of quantum mechanics. The [hydrogen spectral series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series "Hydrogen spectral series") in particular was first successfully explained by the [Rutherford–Bohr quantum model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") of the hydrogen atom. In some cases spectral lines are well separated and distinguishable, but spectral lines can also overlap and appear to be a single transition if the [density of energy states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_states "Density of states") is high enough. Named series of lines include the [principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_series_(spectroscopy) "Principal series (spectroscopy)"), [sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_series "Sharp series"), [diffuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_series "Diffuse series") and [fundamental series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_series "Fundamental series").

Spectroscopy has emerged as a growing practice within the [maker movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture "Maker culture"), enabling hobbyists and educators to construct functional spectrometers using readily available materials.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-39) Utilizing components like CD/DVD diffraction gratings, smartphones, and 3D-printed parts, these instruments offer a hands-on approach to understanding light and matter interactions. Smartphone applications[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-41) along with open-source tools[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-42) facilitate integration, greatly simplify the capturing and analysis of spectral data. While limitations in resolution, calibration accuracy, and stray light management exist compared to professional equipment, DIY spectroscopy provides valuable educational experiences[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy#cite_note-43) and contributes to citizen science initiatives, fostering accessibility to spectroscopic techniques.
