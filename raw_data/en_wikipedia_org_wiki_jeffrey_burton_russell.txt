[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Early life [ edit ] Russell received his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1955 and his PhD in History from Emory University in 1960.

Career [ edit ] Russell held a number of academic posts, moving to the History Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara until his retirement. He taught History and Religious Studies at Berkeley, Riverside , California State University, Sacramento , Harvard , New Mexico , and Notre Dame .

[ 3 ] Russell published widely, largely on medieval European history and the history of Christian theology . His first book was Dissent and Reform in the Early Middle Ages (1965). He is most noted for his five-volume history of the concept of the Devil : The Devil (1977), Satan (1981), Lucifer (1984), Mephistopheles (1986) and The Prince of Darkness (1988), all published by Cornell University Press .

In Inventing the Flat Earth (1991) he argues that 19th century anti- Christians invented and spread the falsehood that educated people in the Middle Ages believed that the earth was flat . As one writer summarizes, "Russell also examined a large selection of textbooks and found those written before 1870 usually included the correct account, but most textbooks written after 1880 uncritically repeated the erroneous claims in Washington Irving , John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White . Russell concludes that Irving, Draper and White were the main writers responsible for introducing the erroneous flat-earth myth that is still with us today." Russell wrote two books on the history of the notion of Heaven : A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence (1997), which deals with the period from around 200 B.C. up to Dante , and Paradise Mislaid (2006), which takes the story up to the early 21st century.
