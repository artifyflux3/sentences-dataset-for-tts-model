It was discovered by astronomers of the LINEAR program at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico .

1999 JV 6 is a contact binary object consisting of two distinct lobes, as seen in radar images from various observatories including Arecibo and Goldstone in January 2015.

Close approaches [ edit ] Radar images of 1999 JV 6 taken by the Goldstone Radar on 9 January 2015 In January 2015, 1999 JV 6 approached Earth within a distance of 32.4 lunar distances (0.0833 AU).

[ 1 ] During the encounter, 1999 JV 6 was observed by radar from the Arecibo , Green Bank , and Goldstone observatories.

[ 3 ] In January 2016, 1999 JV 6 has made another close approach at a distance of 12 lunar distances (0.032 AU), several times closer than the encounter in 2015.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] The Minor Planet Center has classified 1999 JV 6 as a potentially hazardous asteroid due to its large size and small Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.03 AU.

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] Physical characteristics [ edit ] 1999 JV 6 was discovered in May 1999 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico. Most properties of 1999 JV 6 have been determined through photometry , spectroscopy , infrared radiometry , and radar imaging .

[ 3 ] Binzel et al.

(2001) have found that 1999 JV 6 has a spectral class of an Xk-type asteroid . Thermal infrared observations using the WISE spacecraft by Mainzer et al.

(2011) and the Spitzer Space Telescope by Mueller et al. (2011) give a diameter of 0.45 km (0.28 mi). Warner et al.

(2014, 2015) suggest that 1999 JV 6 has a highly elongated shape due to its large light curve amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes . Based on 1999 JV 6 's large brightness changes, they measured a rotation period of 6.54 hours. In January 2015, radar imaging by the Arecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Observatory confirmed 1999 JV 6 's elongated shape and provided delay-Doppler images used to obtain a preliminary estimate of a 3D model for its shape. The radar data reveal an apparent concavity and suggest that 1999 JV 6 is a contact binary .
