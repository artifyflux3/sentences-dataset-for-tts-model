In a narrower sense, the term refers to a parliamentary group in the Prussian House of Representatives . Its origin was the Vincke faction in the 1850s. After 1866, if they had not gone over to the German Progress Party in 1861, their deputies became part of the National Liberal Party or the Free Conservative Party .

The term altliberal is contemporary and was used by Robert von Mohl after 1849 to describe the supporters of a constitutional system of government.
