Related ethnic groups see List of Indigenous Australian group names Indigenous Australians are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands. The Torres Strait Islanders are Indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are at the northernmost tip of Queensland near Papua New Guinea . The term "Aboriginal" has traditionally been applied to Indigenous inhabitants of mainland Australia, Tasmania , and some of the other adjacent islands . Since the colonisation of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians have been segregated from European Australians both in their rights and socially within society. The 'firsts' listed in this article contain historical steps that have changed this initial racist segregation both legally and culturally.
