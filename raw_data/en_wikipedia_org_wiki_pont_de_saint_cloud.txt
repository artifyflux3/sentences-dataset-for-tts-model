History [ edit ] Pont de Saint-Cloud The first Pont de Saint-Cloud appeared in 841 because of a conflict between Charles the Bald et Lothaire I ; it consisted of a wooden bridge supporting several mills.

[ 1 ] Although the Seine has been traversable at this location for twelve centuries, tradition holds that no king of France has traversed it on the bridge without suffering a sudden death. As a result, sovereigns crossed the Seine by boat. The wooden bridge was demolished after the death of François I . In 1556 his son Henri II constructed a new stone bridge consisting of eleven arches.

This bridge was in turn demolished during the Second Fronde and replaced with a bridge made of wooden arches.

Napoléon ordered its renovation in 1808, giving it a new width of 12.8 metres (14.0 yd). It was again reconstructed in 1940, expanded another 30 metres (33 yd) for a total width of 186 metres (203 yd). The single-piece deck crosses the entire river, supported by six columns of reinforced concrete.

[ 2 ] To facilitate circulation across the banks, underground passages have been built on the two sides of the river.

A Métro station, Boulogne–Pont de Saint-Cloud , the western terminus of Line 10 in Boulogne-Billancourt, has been named after the bridge.

Painting [ edit ] The bridge was the subject of a work by Alfred Sisley , Le Pont de Saint-Cloud , 1877, and Maurice Loirand, Environs du pont de Saint-Cloud , 1953, which is in the collections of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes .

[ 3 ] Genevieve Pezet , painter and sculptor, had her studio from 1958 to 1965 in a barge anchored at the bridge of Saint-Cloud.
