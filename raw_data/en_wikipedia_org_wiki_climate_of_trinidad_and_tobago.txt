They are southeasterly islands of the Lesser Antilles , Monos , Huevos , Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), Little Tobago , and St. Giles Island .

Trinidad is 11 km (6.8 mi) off the northeast coast of Venezuela and 130 km (81 mi) south of the Grenadines .

[ citation needed ] The island measures 4,768 km 2 (1,841 sq mi) in area (comprising 93.0% of the country's total area) with an average length of 80 km (50 mi) and an average width of 59 km (37 mi).

[ citation needed ] The island appears rectangular in shape with three projecting peninsular corners.

[ 1 ] Tobago is 30 km (19 mi) northeast of Trinidad and measures about 298 km 2 (115 sq mi) in area, or 5.8% of the country's area, 41 km (25.5 mi) in length and 12 km (7.5 mi) at its greatest width.

[ citation needed ] The island is cigar-shaped in appearance, with a northeast–southwest alignment.

Physical geography [ edit ] Trinidad is traversed by three distinct mountain ranges that are a continuation of the Venezuelan coastal cordillera.

[ 1 ] The Northern Range , an outlier of the Andes Mountains of Venezuela, consists of rugged hills that parallel the coast.

[ 1 ] This range rises into two peaks.

[ 1 ] The highest, El Cerro del Aripo , is 940 metres (3,084 ft) high; the other, El Tucuche , reaches 936 metres (3,071 ft).

[ 1 ] The Central Range extends diagonally across the island and is a low-lying range with swampy areas rising to rolling hills; its maximum elevation is 325 metres (1,066 ft).

[ 1 ] The Caroni Plain, composed of alluvial sediment, extends southward, separating the Northern Range and Central Range.

[ 1 ] The Southern Range consists of a broken line of hills with a maximum elevation of 305 metres (1,001 ft).

[ 1 ] There are numerous rivers and streams on the island of Trinidad; the most significant are the Ortoire River , 50 kilometres (31.1 mi) long, which extends eastward into the Atlantic, and the 40-kilometre (24.9 mi)-long Caroni River , reaching westward into the Gulf of Paria.

[ 1 ] Most of the soils of Trinidad are fertile, with the exception of the sandy and unstable terrain found in the southern part of the island.

[ 1 ] Tobago is mountainous and dominated by the Main Ridge , which is 29 kilometres (18 mi) long with elevations up to 550 meters.

[ 1 ] There are deep, fertile valleys running north and south of the Main Ridge.

[ 1 ] The southwestern tip of the island has a coral platform.

[ 1 ] Although Tobago is volcanic in origin, there are no active volcanoes.

[ 1 ] Forestation covers 43% of the island.

[ 1 ] There are numerous rivers and streams, but flooding and erosion are less severe than in Trinidad.

[ 1 ] The coastline is indented with numerous bays, beaches, and narrow coastal plains.

[ 1 ] Tobago has several small satellite islands.

[ 1 ] The largest of these, Little Tobago, is starfish-shaped, hilly, and 1.2 km 2 (0.46 sq mi).

[ 1 ] Because it was once part of continental South America, Trinidad has an assortment of tropical vegetation and wildlife considerably more varied than that of most Caribbean islands.

[ 1 ] Tobago has a generally similar but less varied assortment.

[ 1 ] Geology [ edit ] Main article: Geology of Trinidad and Tobago Geologically , the islands are not part of the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc .

[ 1 ] Rather, Trinidad was once part of the South American mainland and is situated on its continental shelf , and Tobago is part of a sunken island arc chain related to the Pacific-derived Caribbean Plate.

[ 1 ] The islands are separated from the continent of South America by the Gulf of Paria ; Bocas del Dragón , a 19-kilometre (11.8 mi)-wide northern passage; and Serpent's Mouth , a 14-kilometre (8.7 mi)-wide southern passage.

[ 1 ] The Northern Range consists mainly of Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous metamorphic rocks .

[ 2 ] The Northern Lowlands ( East–West Corridor and Caroni Plains) consist of younger shallow marine clastic sediments .

[ citation needed ] South of this, the Central Range fold and thrust belt consists of Cretaceous and Eocene sedimentary rocks , with Miocene formations along the southern and eastern flanks.

[ citation needed ] The Naparima Plains and the Nariva Swamp form the southern shoulder of this uplift.

[ citation needed ] The Southern Lowlands consist of Miocene and Pliocene sands, clays, and gravels.

[ citation needed ] These overlie oil and natural gas deposits, especially north of the Los Bajos Fault.

[ citation needed ] The Southern Range forms the third anticlinal uplift.

[ citation needed ] It consists of several chains of hills, most famous being the Trinity Hills .

[ citation needed ] The rocks consist of sandstones , shales , siltstones and clays formed in the Miocene and uplifted in the Pleistocene .

[ citation needed ] Oil sands and mud volcanoes are especially common in this area.

[ citation needed ] Political geography [ edit ] Regional corporations and municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad is split into 14 regional corporations and municipalities , consisting of 9 regions and 5 municipalities, which have a limited level of autonomy.

[ citation needed ] The various councils are made up of a mixture of elected and appointed members. Elections are due to be held every three years with the last elections held in 2019.

[ citation needed ] The island of Tobago is administered by the Tobago House of Assembly .

[ citation needed ] Climate [ edit ] Köppen climate map of the islands of the West Indies, with the climate of Trinidad and Tobago visible in the southeast corner.

The country lies in the tropics, enjoying a generally pleasant maritime tropical climate influenced by the northeast trade winds.

[ 1 ] In Trinidad the annual mean temperature is 26 °C (78.8 °F), and the average maximum temperature is 34 °C (93.2 °F).

[ 1 ] The highest temperature ever was 37.8 degrees Celsius. The lowest (coldest felt) temperature recorded in Trinidad was 16.1 °C (61.0 °F) in January 1964.

[ citation needed ] The humidity is high, particularly during the rainy season, when it averages 85 to 87%.

[ 1 ] The island receives an average of 2,110 millimeters (83.1 in) of rainfall per year, usually concentrated in the months of June through December, when brief, intense showers frequently occur.

[ 1 ] Precipitation is highest in the Northern Range, which may receive as much as 3,810 millimeters (150 in).

[ 1 ] During the dry season, drought plagues the island's central interior.

[ 1 ] Tobago's climate is similar to Trinidad's but slightly cooler.

[ 1 ] Its rainy season extends from June to December; the annual rainfall is 2,500 millimeters (98.4 in).

[ 1 ] The islands lie outside the hurricane belt; [ 1 ] [ 3 ] despite this, Hurricane Flora damaged Tobago in 1963. The hurricane killed 18 people on Tobago and caused $30:million in crop and property damages (1963 USD).

[ 4 ] Tropical Storm Alma hit Trinidad in 1974, causing damage before reaching full strength.

[ 1 ] Wind gusts reached 91 mph (147 km/h) at the Savonette gas field during the storm.
