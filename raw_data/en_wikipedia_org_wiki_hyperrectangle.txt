Only the edges of the higher-dimensional cells are shown.

In geometry , a hyperrectangle (also called a box , hyperbox , k {\displaystyle k} -cell or orthotope [ 2 ] ), is the generalization of a rectangle (a plane figure ) and the rectangular cuboid (a solid figure ) to higher dimensions . A necessary and sufficient condition is that it is congruent to the Cartesian product of finite intervals .

[ 3 ] This means that a k {\displaystyle k} -dimensional rectangular solid has each of its edges equal to one of the closed intervals used in the definition. Every k {\displaystyle k} -cell is compact .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] If all of the edges are equal length, it is a hypercube . A hyperrectangle is a special case of a parallelotope .

Formal definition [ edit ] For every integer i {\displaystyle i} from 1 {\displaystyle 1} to k {\displaystyle k} , let a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} and b i {\displaystyle b_{i}} be real numbers such that a i < b i {\displaystyle a_{i}<b_{i}} . The set of all points x = ( x 1 , … … , x k ) {\displaystyle x=(x_{1},\dots ,x_{k})} in R k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}} whose coordinates satisfy the inequalities a i ≤ ≤ x i ≤ ≤ b i {\displaystyle a_{i}\leq x_{i}\leq b_{i}} is a k {\displaystyle k} -cell .

[ 6 ] Intuition [ edit ] A k {\displaystyle k} -cell of dimension k ≤ ≤ 3 {\displaystyle k\leq 3} is especially simple. For example, a 1-cell is simply the interval [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} with a < b {\displaystyle a<b} . A 2-cell is the rectangle formed by the Cartesian product of two closed intervals, and a 3-cell is a rectangular solid.

The sides and edges of a k {\displaystyle k} -cell need not be equal in (Euclidean) length; although the unit cube (which has boundaries of equal Euclidean length) is a 3-cell, the set of all 3-cells with equal-length edges is a strict subset of the set of all 3-cells.

Types [ edit ] A four-dimensional orthotope is likely a hypercuboid.

[ 7 ] The special case of an n -dimensional orthotope where all edges have equal length is the n - cube or hypercube.

[ 2 ] By analogy, the term "hyperrectangle" can refer to Cartesian products of orthogonal intervals of other kinds, such as ranges of keys in database theory or ranges of integers , rather than real numbers .

Symmetry group [2 n −1 ] , order 2 n Dual polyhedron n -orthotope Properties convex , isotopal The dual polytope of an n -orthotope has been variously called a rectangular n - orthoplex , rhombic n - fusil , or n - lozenge . It is constructed by 2 n points located in the center of the orthotope rectangular faces.

An n -fusil's Schläfli symbol can be represented by a sum of n orthogonal line segments: { } + { } + ... + { } or n { }.

A 1-fusil is a line segment . A 2-fusil is a rhombus . Its plane cross selections in all pairs of axes are rhombi .
