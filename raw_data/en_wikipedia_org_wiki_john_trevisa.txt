1342–1402 AD) was a Cornish writer and professional translator.

Trevisa was born at Trevessa in the parish of St Enoder in mid-Cornwall, in Britain and was a native Cornish speaker.

[ 1 ] He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford , and became Vicar of Berkeley, Gloucestershire , chaplain to the 5th Lord Berkeley , and Canon of Westbury on Trym .

He translated into English for his patron the Latin Polychronicon of Ranulf Higden , [ 2 ] adding remarks of his own, and prefacing it with a Dialogue on Translation between a Lord and a Clerk . He likewise made various other translations, including Bartholomaeus Anglicus ' On the Properties of Things (De Proprietatibus Rerum) , a medieval forerunner of the encyclopedia. It seems likely that he was the translator of the Bible into Cornish, a language, which until recently, was thought not to have possessed a bible translation.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] A fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford , from 1372 to 1376 at the same time as John Wycliff and Nicholas of Hereford , Trevisa may well have been one of the contributors to the Early Version of Wycliffe's Bible .  The preface to the King James Version of 1611 singles him out as a translator amongst others at that time: "even in our King Richard the second 's days, John Trevisa translated them [the Gospels] into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen that divers translated, as it is very probable, in that age" .  Trevisa does not seem to have been a Wycliffite or Lollard, though he had some views in common about corruption.

[ 5 ] : 96 Subsequently, he translated a number of books of the Bible into French for Lord Berkeley, including a version of the Book of Revelation , which his patron had written up onto the ceiling of the chapel at Berkeley Castle .
Trevisa's reputation as a writer rests principally on his translations of encyclopaedic works from Latin into English, undertaken with the support of his patron, Thomas (IV), the fifth Baron Berkeley, as a continuous programme of enlightenment for the laity.

[ 6 ] John Trevisa is the 18th most frequently cited author in the Oxford English Dictionary and the third most frequently cited source for the first evidence of a word (after Geoffrey Chaucer and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ).
