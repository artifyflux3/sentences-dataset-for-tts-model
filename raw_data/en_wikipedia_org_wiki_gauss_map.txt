( July 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Gauss map provides a mapping from every point on a curve or a surface to a corresponding point on a unit sphere. In this example, the curvature of a 2D-surface is mapped onto a 1D unit circle.

In differential geometry , the Gauss map of a surface is a function that maps each point in the surface to its normal direction , a unit vector that is orthogonal to the surface at that point. Namely, given a surface X in Euclidean space R 3 , the Gauss map is a map N : X → S 2 (where S 2 is the unit sphere ) such that  for each p in X , the function value N ( p ) is a unit vector orthogonal to X at p . The Gauss map is named after Carl F. Gauss .

The Gauss map can be defined (globally) if and only if the surface is orientable , in which case its degree is half the Euler characteristic . The Gauss map can always be defined locally (i.e. on a small piece of the surface). The Jacobian determinant of the Gauss map is equal to Gaussian curvature , and the differential of the Gauss map is called the shape operator .

Gauss first wrote a draft on the topic in 1825 and published in 1827.

[ 1 ] [ citation needed ] There is also a Gauss map for a link , which computes linking number .

( May 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Gauss map can be defined for hypersurfaces in R n as a map from a hypersurface to the unit sphere S n − 1 ⊆ R n .

For a general oriented k - submanifold of R n the Gauss map can also be defined, and its target space is the oriented Grassmannian G ~ ~ k , n {\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}_{k,n}} , i.e. the set of all oriented k -planes in R n . In this case a point on the submanifold is mapped to its oriented tangent subspace. One can also map to its oriented normal subspace; these are equivalent as G ~ ~ k , n ≅ ≅ G ~ ~ n − − k , n {\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}_{k,n}\cong {\tilde {G}}_{n-k,n}} via orthogonal complement.
In Euclidean 3-space , this says that an oriented 2-plane is characterized by an oriented 1-line, equivalently a unit normal vector (as G ~ ~ 1 , n ≅ ≅ S n − − 1 {\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}_{1,n}\cong S^{n-1}} ), hence this is consistent with the definition above.

Finally, the notion of Gauss map can be generalized to an oriented submanifold X of dimension k in an oriented ambient Riemannian manifold M of dimension n . In that case, the Gauss map then goes from X to the set of tangent k -planes in the tangent bundle TM . The target space for the Gauss map N is a Grassmann bundle built on the tangent bundle TM . In the case where M = R n {\displaystyle M=\mathbf {R} ^{n}} , the tangent bundle is trivialized (so the Grassmann bundle becomes a map to the Grassmannian), and we recover the previous definition.

Total curvature [ edit ] The area of the image of the Gauss map is called the total curvature and is equivalent to the surface integral of the Gaussian curvature .  This is the original interpretation given by Gauss.

∬ ∬ R ± ± | N u × × N v | d u d v = ∬ ∬ R K | X u × × X v | d u d v = ∬ ∬ S K d A {\displaystyle \iint _{R}\pm |N_{u}\times N_{v}|\ du\,dv=\iint _{R}K|X_{u}\times X_{v}|\ du\,dv=\iint _{S}K\ dA} The Gauss–Bonnet theorem links total curvature of a surface to its topological properties.

Cusps of the Gauss map [ edit ] A surface with a parabolic line and its Gauss map. A ridge passes through the parabolic line giving rise to a cusp on the Gauss map.

The Gauss map reflects many properties of the surface: when the surface has zero Gaussian curvature, (that is along a parabolic line ) the Gauss map will have a fold catastrophe .

[ 2 ] This fold may contain cusps and these cusps were studied in depth by Thomas Banchoff , Terence Gaffney and Clint McCrory . Both parabolic lines and cusp are stable phenomena and will remain under slight deformations of the surface. Cusps occur when: The surface has a bi-tangent plane A ridge crosses a parabolic line at the closure of the set of inflection points of the asymptotic curves of the surface.

There are two types of cusp: elliptic cusp and hyperbolic cusps .
