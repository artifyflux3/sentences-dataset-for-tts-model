[ 5 ] It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search , Gmail , and Google Docs , according to Verma et al.

[ 6 ] Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.

[ 7 ] Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service , platform as a service , and serverless computing environments.

In April 2008, Google announced App Engine , a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers , which was the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.

Google Cloud Platform is a part [ 8 ] of Google Cloud , which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as Google Workspace (G Suite), enterprise versions of Android and ChromeOS , and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services. Since at least 2022, [ 9 ] Google's official materials have stated that "Google Cloud" is the new name for "Google Cloud Platform," which may cause naming confusion.
