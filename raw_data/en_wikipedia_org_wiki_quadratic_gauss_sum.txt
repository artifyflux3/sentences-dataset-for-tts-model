( July 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In number theory , quadratic Gauss sums are certain finite sums of roots of unity. A quadratic Gauss sum can be interpreted as a linear combination of the values of the complex exponential function with coefficients given by a quadratic character; for a general character, one obtains a more general Gauss sum . These objects are named after Carl Friedrich Gauss , who studied them extensively and applied them to quadratic , cubic , and biquadratic reciprocity laws.

Definition [ edit ] For an odd prime number p and an integer a , the quadratic Gauss sum g ( a ; p ) is defined as g ( a ; p ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 ζ ζ p a n 2 , {\displaystyle g(a;p)=\sum _{n=0}^{p-1}\zeta _{p}^{an^{2}},} where ζ ζ p {\displaystyle \zeta _{p}} is a primitive p th root of unity , for example ζ ζ p = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 π π i / p ) {\displaystyle \zeta _{p}=\exp(2\pi i/p)} .
Equivalently, we can write this using the Legendre symbol as g ( a ; p ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 ( 1 + ( n p ) ) ζ ζ p a n .

{\displaystyle g(a;p)=\sum _{n=0}^{p-1}{\big (}1+\left({\tfrac {n}{p}}\right){\big )}\,\zeta _{p}^{an}.} For a divisible by p , and we have ζ ζ p a n 2 = 1 {\displaystyle \zeta _{p}^{an^{2}}=1} and thus g ( a ; p ) = p .

{\displaystyle g(a;p)=p.} For a not divisible by p , we have ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 ζ ζ p a n = 0 {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{p-1}\zeta _{p}^{an}=0} , implying that g ( a ; p ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 ( n p ) ζ ζ p a n = G ( a , ( ⋅ ⋅ p ) ) , {\displaystyle g(a;p)=\sum _{n=0}^{p-1}\left({\tfrac {n}{p}}\right)\,\zeta _{p}^{an}=G(a,\left({\tfrac {\cdot }{p}}\right)),} where G ( a , χ χ ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 χ χ ( n ) ζ ζ p a n {\displaystyle G(a,\chi )=\sum _{n=0}^{p-1}\chi (n)\,\zeta _{p}^{an}} is the Gauss sum defined for any character χ modulo p .

Properties [ edit ] The value of the Gauss sum is an algebraic integer in the p th cyclotomic field Q ( ζ ζ p ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} (\zeta _{p})} .

The evaluation of the Gauss sum for an integer a not divisible by a prime p > 2 can be reduced to the case a = 1 : g ( a ; p ) = ( a p ) g ( 1 ; p ) .

{\displaystyle g(a;p)=\left({\tfrac {a}{p}}\right)g(1;p).} The exact value of the Gauss sum for a = 1 is given by the formula: [ 1 ] g ( 1 ; p ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 p − − 1 e 2 π π i n 2 p = { ( 1 + i ) p if p ≡ ≡ 0 ( mod 4 ) , p if p ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod 4 ) , 0 if p ≡ ≡ 2 ( mod 4 ) , i p if p ≡ ≡ 3 ( mod 4 ) .

{\displaystyle g(1;p)=\sum _{n=0}^{p-1}e^{\frac {2\pi in^{2}}{p}}={\begin{cases}(1+i){\sqrt {p}}&{\text{if}}\ p\equiv 0{\pmod {4}},\\{\sqrt {p}}&{\text{if}}\ p\equiv 1{\pmod {4}},\\0&{\text{if}}\ p\equiv 2{\pmod {4}},\\i{\sqrt {p}}&{\text{if}}\ p\equiv 3{\pmod {4}}.\end{cases}}} Remark In fact, the identity g ( 1 ; p ) 2 = ( − − 1 p ) p {\displaystyle g(1;p)^{2}=\left({\tfrac {-1}{p}}\right)p} was easy to prove and led to one of Gauss's proofs of quadratic reciprocity . However, the determination of the sign of the Gauss sum turned out to be considerably more difficult: Gauss could only establish it after several years' work. Later, Dirichlet , Kronecker , Schur and other mathematicians found different proofs.

Generalized quadratic Gauss sums [ edit ] Let a , b , c be natural numbers . The generalized quadratic Gauss sum G ( a , b , c ) is defined by G ( a , b , c ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 c − − 1 e 2 π π i a n 2 + b n c {\displaystyle G(a,b,c)=\sum _{n=0}^{c-1}e^{2\pi i{\frac {an^{2}+bn}{c}}}} .

The classical quadratic Gauss sum is the sum g ( a , p ) = G ( a , 0, p ) .

Properties The Gauss sum G ( a , b , c ) depends only on the residue class of a and b modulo c .

Gauss sums are multiplicative , i.e. given natural numbers a , b , c , d with gcd ( c , d ) = 1 one has G ( a , b , c d ) = G ( a c , b , d ) G ( a d , b , c ) .

{\displaystyle G(a,b,cd)=G(ac,b,d)G(ad,b,c).} This is a direct consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem .

One has G ( a , b , c ) = 0 if gcd( a , c ) > 1 except if gcd( a , c ) divides b in which case one has G ( a , b , c ) = gcd ( a , c ) ⋅ ⋅ G ( a gcd ( a , c ) , b gcd ( a , c ) , c gcd ( a , c ) ) {\displaystyle G(a,b,c)=\gcd(a,c)\cdot G\left({\frac {a}{\gcd(a,c)}},{\frac {b}{\gcd(a,c)}},{\frac {c}{\gcd(a,c)}}\right)} .

Thus in the evaluation of quadratic Gauss sums one may always assume gcd( a , c ) = 1 .

Let a , b , c be integers with ac ≠ 0 and ac + b even. One has the following analogue of the quadratic reciprocity law for (even more general) Gauss sums [ 2 ] ∑ ∑ n = 0 | c | − − 1 e π π i a n 2 + b n c = | c a | 1 2 e π π i | a c | − − b 2 4 a c ∑ ∑ n = 0 | a | − − 1 e − − π π i c n 2 + b n a {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{|c|-1}e^{\pi i{\frac {an^{2}+bn}{c}}}=\left|{\frac {c}{a}}\right|^{\frac {1}{2}}e^{\pi i{\frac {|ac|-b^{2}}{4ac}}}\sum _{n=0}^{|a|-1}e^{-\pi i{\frac {cn^{2}+bn}{a}}}} .

Define ε ε m = { 1 if m ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod 4 ) i if m ≡ ≡ 3 ( mod 4 ) {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{m}={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if}}\ m\equiv 1{\pmod {4}}\\i&{\text{if}}\ m\equiv 3{\pmod {4}}\end{cases}}} for every odd integer m . The values of Gauss sums with b = 0 and gcd( a , c ) = 1 are explicitly given by G ( a , c ) = G ( a , 0 , c ) = { 0 if c ≡ ≡ 2 ( mod 4 ) ε ε c c ( a c ) if c ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod 2 ) ( 1 + i ) ε ε a − − 1 c ( c a ) if c ≡ ≡ 0 ( mod 4 ) .

{\displaystyle G(a,c)=G(a,0,c)={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if}}\ c\equiv 2{\pmod {4}}\\\varepsilon _{c}{\sqrt {c}}\left({\dfrac {a}{c}}\right)&{\text{if}}\ c\equiv 1{\pmod {2}}\\(1+i)\varepsilon _{a}^{-1}{\sqrt {c}}\left({\dfrac {c}{a}}\right)&{\text{if}}\ c\equiv 0{\pmod {4}}.\end{cases}}} Here ( ⁠ a / c ⁠ ) is the Jacobi symbol . This is the famous formula of Carl Friedrich Gauss .

For b > 0 the Gauss sums can easily be computed by completing the square in most cases. This fails however in some cases (for example, c even and b odd), which can be computed relatively easy by other means. For example, if c is odd and gcd( a , c ) = 1 one has G ( a , b , c ) = ε ε c c ⋅ ⋅ ( a c ) e − − 2 π π i ψ ψ ( a ) b 2 c , {\displaystyle G(a,b,c)=\varepsilon _{c}{\sqrt {c}}\cdot \left({\frac {a}{c}}\right)e^{-2\pi i{\frac {\psi (a)b^{2}}{c}}},} where ψ ( a ) is some number with 4 ψ ( a ) a ≡ 1 (mod c ) . As another example, if 4 divides c and b is odd and as always gcd( a , c ) = 1 then G ( a , b , c ) = 0 . This can, for example, be proved as follows: because of the multiplicative property of Gauss sums we only have to show that G ( a , b , 2 m ) = 0 if m > 1 and a , b are odd with gcd( a , c ) = 1 . If b is odd then an 2 + bn is even for all 0 ≤ n < c − 1 . For every q , the equation an 2 + bn + q = 0 has at most two solutions in Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } /2 n Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } . Indeed, if n 1 {\displaystyle n_{1}} and n 2 {\displaystyle n_{2}} are two solutions of same parity, then ( n 1 − − n 2 ) ( a ( n 1 + n 2 ) + b ) = α α 2 m {\displaystyle (n_{1}-n_{2})(a(n_{1}+n_{2})+b)=\alpha 2^{m}} for some integer α α {\displaystyle \alpha } , but ( a ( j 1 + j 2 ) + b ) {\displaystyle (a(j_{1}+j_{2})+b)} is odd, hence j 1 ≡ ≡ j 2 ( mod 2 m ) {\displaystyle j_{1}\equiv j_{2}{\pmod {2^{m}}}} .

[ clarification needed ] Because of a counting argument an 2 + bn runs through all even residue classes modulo c exactly two times. The geometric sum formula then shows that G ( a , b , 2 m ) = 0 .

If c is an odd square-free integer and gcd( a , c ) = 1 , then G ( a , 0 , c ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 c − − 1 ( n c ) e 2 π π i a n c .

{\displaystyle G(a,0,c)=\sum _{n=0}^{c-1}\left({\frac {n}{c}}\right)e^{\frac {2\pi ian}{c}}.} If c is not squarefree then the right side vanishes while the left side does not. Often the right sum is also called a quadratic Gauss sum.

Another useful formula G ( n , p k ) = p ⋅ ⋅ G ( n , p k − − 2 ) {\displaystyle G\left(n,p^{k}\right)=p\cdot G\left(n,p^{k-2}\right)} holds for k ≥ 2 and an odd prime number p , and for k ≥ 4 and p = 2 .
