Naming [ edit ] The name was proposed by Denham and Crook in 1976, [ 1 ] to describe a thermal front that extends from Australia and New Zealand between the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Geography [ edit ] Originating in the edge of the East Australian Current (EAC), the Tasman Front meanders eastward between longitudes 152° E and 164° E and latitudes 31° S and 37° S, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] then reattaches to the coastline at New Zealand, forming the East Auckland Current.

[ 6 ] Topography plays a dominant role in establishing the Tasman Front.

[ 2 ] Data on the Tasman Front shows that the path of the front is influenced in part by the forcing of the flow over the major ridge systems.

[ 7 ] Meanders observed in the Tasman Front can be driven by meridional flows along ridges such as those observed at the New Caledonia Trough (166° E) and the Norfolk Ridge (167° E).

Abyssal currents also drive meanders associated with the Lord Howe Rise (161° E) and Dampier Ridge (159° E).

[ 8 ] Oceanography [ edit ] There have been a number of observational [ 5 ] [ 7 ] and modeling [ 8 ] [ 9 ] studies on this front in addition to a number of paleo-oceanographic studies of marine sediments.

[ 10 ] Contrarily, there have been few biological observational studies, but those have been conducted resulted in relating the physical features of the front to properties of fish communities.

[ 11 ] Likewise, there are even fewer studies relating biogeochemical properties to physical processes of the Tasman Front.
