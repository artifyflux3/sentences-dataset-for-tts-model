Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Clade : Discoba Phylum: Euglenozoa Class: Euglenida Genus: † Moyeria Thusu, 1973 Type species Moyeria uticana Thusu, 1973 Species M. uticana M. cabottii Moyeria is a genus of fossils interpreted as euglenids , a type of microbial eukaryotes characterized for their cells surrounded by a pellicle composed of proteinaceous strips. Described in 1973, the genus contains two species, M. uticana and M. cabottii , that fossilized from the Middle Ordovician to the Silurian.

Description [ edit ] Moyeria is a genus of fossils initially considered acritarchs , of unknown evolutionary affinity. They were widely interpreted as resting cysts of marine algae. Its vesicle wall has a distinct ultrastructure that resembles the pellicle of euglenids , which is composed of proteinaceous strips. For this reason, during the 20th century some authors  proposed Moyeria as part of the Euglenida.

[ 1 ] After examinations through transmission electron microscopy , the stripes in the wall of these microfossils were revealed to correspond to the pellicle strips of modern euglenids, and Moyeria was formally transferred to the Euglenida in 2019.

[ 2 ] Classification [ edit ] Moyeria was first described in 1973 by paleontologist Brinda Thusu from microfossils located along the south branch of Moyer Creek , near the town of Ilion, New York . The fossils originate from the Wenlock epoch , in the Silurian , and were assigned to the species Moyeria uticaensis . Thusu published four illustrated specimens along with the species description, but he did not specify which one was the holotype .

[ 3 ] In 1976, some authors proposed Moyeria uticaensis as a junior synonym of another species of striated acritarchs, Eupoikilofusa cabottii .

[ 4 ] However, the genus Eupoikilofusa was rejected by other authors because the vesicle was not consistently fusiform, and the species E. cabottii was instead transferred to Moyeria as M. cabottii .

[ 5 ] Subsequently, several helically striated acritarchs with variable shape that were found in Ordovician and Silurian rocks were assigned to M. cabottii .

[ 1 ] In 2019, Paul K. Strother and coauthors located the original intended holotype specimen according to the coordinates given by Thusu in 1973, consequently validating the genus Moyeria . They corrected the type species epithet to M. uticana . After analyzing more material from the original rocks, they managed to further investigate and distinguish the two proposed fossil species. Thus, two species are currently accepted in this genus: [ 2 ] Moyeria uticana (= M. uticaensis ) Thusu, 1973 Moyeria cabottii (Cramer) Miller & Eames, 1982 (= Eupoikilofusa cabottii Cramer, 1971 ) References [ edit ] ^ a b c Gray, Jane; Boucot, A.
