[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is considered the highest honor bestowed by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The recipient receives a monetary award and presents a survey lecture at the SIAM Annual Meeting.

[ 7 ] Selection process [ edit ] Anybody is able to nominate a mathematician for the prize. Nominations are reviewed by a selection committee, consisting of members of SIAM who serve two-year appointments.

[ 8 ] The committee selects one recipient for the prize nine months before the SIAM Annual Meeting and forwards their nomination to SIAM's Executive Committee and Vice President for Programs.
