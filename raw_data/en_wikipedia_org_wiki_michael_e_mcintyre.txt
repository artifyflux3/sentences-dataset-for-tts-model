Michael E. McIntyre FRS McIntyre in 2012 Born ( 1941-07-28 ) 28 July 1941 (age 84) Sydney, Australia Nationality English Alma mater University of Otago (BSc.) Spouse Ruth McIntyre Awards Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal , 1987 Julius Bartels Medal , 1999 [ 1 ] Symons Gold Medal , 2023 Scientific career Fields Applied mathematics , meteorology , atmospheric dynamics , musical acoustics Doctoral advisor Francis Bretherton Michael Edgeworth McIntyre FRS (born 28 July 1941) [ 2 ] is a mathematician and Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Dynamics.

McIntyre has contributed to the fundamental understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics in the Earth's atmosphere , oceans and the Sun's Interior. McIntyre is also known for his contributions to the physics of stringed musical instruments [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and has published several works on lucidity and science.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and is the holder of the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal , the highest honour of the American Meteorological Society , and the Julius Bartels Medal of the European Geophysical Society .

He also received the 2023 Symons Gold Medal from the Royal Meteorological Society for distinguished work in the field of meteorological science.

[ 8 ] Research [ edit ] In the field of fluid dynamics and atmospheric science, McIntyre, together with Peter H. Haynes , established the Impermeability Theorem [ 9 ] [ 10 ] for potential vorticity (PV), which states that there can be no net transport of PV across isentropic surfaces, and that PV can neither be created nor destroyed within a volume bounded by isentropic surfaces. In light of the aforementioned result, PV substance, which corresponds to PV multiplied by the mass density in isentropic coordinates, integrated over a volume of an isentropic layer, is either diluted or concentrated by diabatic mass flux through the isentropic layer bounds.

Books [ edit ] In 2021, he published a book, titled "Science, Music, and Mathematics: The Deepest Connections" [ 11 ] which draws on his experience as a musician as well as a scientist.  A wide variety of topics is covered including, for instance, how the skilful use of language can be informed by the way music works, and what science can and cannot tell us about the climate problem and its uncertainties. A second edition of the book will be published in August 2023.
