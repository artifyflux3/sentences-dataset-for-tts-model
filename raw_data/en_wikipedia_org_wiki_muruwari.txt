Language [ edit ] A monograph on and a dictionary of Muruwari have been published by Lynette Oates.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Country [ edit ] The Muruwari traditional lands The Muruwari lands stretch over some 6,300 square miles (16,000 km 2 ) around Barringun , on the Queensland - New South Wales border, extending north as far as Mulga Downs and Weela in the former state.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It includes Enngonia on the Warrego River ; Brenda, and Weilmoringle on the Culgoa River , as well as Milroy, and south as far as the vicinity of Collerina.

[ 3 ] History of contact [ edit ] The explorer Thomas Mitchell , during his expedition to find a route to the Gulf of Carpentaria, surveyed the area of the Culgoa and Balonne Rivers in 1846, relying on a Wiradjuri guide and interpreter Yuranigh.  At the same time, In 1845 his son Roderick Mitchell, who was Commissioner of Crown Lands , on hearing stockmen's reports of rich pasturage in the area, began mapping it.

[ 5 ] By 1850 regulations allowed settlers to take up 50 square miles (130 km 2 ) of land on 14 year leases. Conflicts arose over land use, and several massacres and killings took place in the following years.

[ 6 ] Many Muruwari attached themselves to established stations, working there except for specific periods when ritual duties or "going bush" led them to take leave: newspaper reports at the time single out Thomas Caddell's Tatala run, managed by Frederick Wherritt, as a station where relations were conducted "with tact and humanity". Wherritt's approach paid off: several hundred sheep were saved in the 1861 flood when the local blacks rescued them by herding them up to the one piece of high dry ground in the area.
