This beach ball would be a hosohedron with 6 spherical lune faces, if the 2 white caps on the ends were removed.

In geometry , a spherical polyhedron or spherical tiling is a tiling of the sphere in which the surface is divided or partitioned by great arcs into bounded regions called spherical polygons . A polyhedron whose vertices are equidistant from its center can be conveniently studied by projecting its edges onto the sphere to obtain a corresponding spherical polyhedron.

The most familiar spherical polyhedron is the soccer ball , thought of as a spherical truncated icosahedron . The next most popular spherical polyhedron is the beach ball , thought of as a hosohedron .

Some "improper" polyhedra, such as hosohedra and their duals , dihedra , exist as spherical polyhedra, but their flat-faced analogs are degenerate . The example hexagonal beach ball, {2, 6}, is a hosohedron, and {6, 2} is its dual dihedron.

History [ edit ] During the 10th Century, the Islamic scholar Abū al-Wafā' Būzjānī (Abu'l Wafa) studied spherical polyhedra as part of a work on the geometry needed by craftspeople and architects.

[ 1 ] The work of Buckminster Fuller on geodesic domes in the mid 20th century triggered a boom in the study of spherical polyhedra.

[ 2 ] At roughly the same time, Coxeter used them to enumerate all but one of the uniform polyhedra , through the construction of kaleidoscopes ( Wythoff construction ).

[ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] All regular polyhedra , semiregular polyhedra , and their duals can be projected onto the sphere as tilings: Schläfli symbol {p,q} t{p,q} r{p,q} t{q,p} {q,p} rr{p,q} tr{p,q} sr{p,q} Vertex config.

Improper cases [ edit ] Spherical tilings allow cases that polyhedra do not, namely hosohedra : figures as {2,n}, and dihedra : figures as {n,2}. Generally, regular hosohedra and regular dihedra are used.

∞.∞ Relation to tilings of the projective plane [ edit ] Spherical polyhedra having at least one inversive symmetry are related to projective polyhedra [ 4 ] (tessellations of the real projective plane ) – just as the sphere has a 2-to-1 covering map of the projective plane, projective polyhedra correspond under 2-fold cover to spherical polyhedra that are symmetric under reflection through the origin .

The best-known examples of projective polyhedra are the regular projective polyhedra, the quotients of the centrally symmetric Platonic solids , as well as two infinite classes of even dihedra and hosohedra : [ 5 ] Hemi-cube , {4,3}/2 Hemi-octahedron , {3,4}/2 Hemi-dodecahedron , {5,3}/2 Hemi-icosahedron , {3,5}/2 Hemi-dihedron, {2p,2}/2, p≥1 Hemi-hosohedron, {2,2p}/2, p≥1 See also [ edit ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Spherical polyhedra .
