Set on which a generalization of volumes and integrals is defined A measure space is a basic object of measure theory , a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes . It contains an underlying set, the subsets of this set that are feasible for measuring (the σ -algebra ) and the method that is used for measuring (the measure ). One important  example of a measure space is a probability space .

A measurable space consists of the first two components without a specific measure.

Definition [ edit ] A measure space is a triple ( X , A , μ μ ) , {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu ),} where [ 1 ] [ 2 ] X {\displaystyle X} is a set A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is a σ -algebra on the set X {\displaystyle X} μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a measure on ( X , A ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}})} μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } must satisfy countable additivity. That is, if ( A n ) n = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle (A_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }} are pair-wise disjoint then μ μ ( ∪ ∪ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ μ μ ( A n ) {\displaystyle \mu (\cup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n})=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\mu (A_{n})} In other words, a measure space consists of a measurable space ( X , A ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}})} together with a measure on it.

Example [ edit ] Set X = { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle X=\{0,1\}} . The σ σ {\textstyle \sigma } -algebra on finite sets such as the one above is usually the power set , which is the set of all subsets (of a given set) and is denoted by ℘ ℘ ( ⋅ ⋅ ) .

{\textstyle \wp (\cdot ).} Sticking with  this convention, we set A = ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}=\wp (X)} In this simple case, the power set can be written down explicitly: ℘ ℘ ( X ) = { ∅ ∅ , { 0 } , { 1 } , { 0 , 1 } } .

{\displaystyle \wp (X)=\{\varnothing ,\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}\}.} As the measure, define μ μ {\textstyle \mu } by μ μ ( { 0 } ) = μ μ ( { 1 } ) = 1 2 , {\displaystyle \mu (\{0\})=\mu (\{1\})={\frac {1}{2}},} so μ μ ( X ) = 1 {\textstyle \mu (X)=1} (by additivity of measures) and μ μ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\textstyle \mu (\varnothing )=0} (by definition of measures).

This leads to the measure space ( X , ℘ ℘ ( X ) , μ μ ) .

{\textstyle (X,\wp (X),\mu ).} It is a probability space , since μ μ ( X ) = 1.

{\textstyle \mu (X)=1.} The measure μ μ {\textstyle \mu } corresponds to the Bernoulli distribution with p = 1 2 , {\textstyle p={\frac {1}{2}},} which is for example used to model a fair coin flip.

Important classes of measure spaces [ edit ] Most important classes of measure spaces are defined by the properties of their associated measures. This includes, in order of increasing generality: Probability spaces , a measure space where the measure is a probability measure [ 1 ] Finite measure spaces, where the measure is a finite measure [ 3 ] σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite measure spaces, where the measure is a σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite measure [ 3 ] Another class of measure spaces are the complete measure spaces .
