( December 2021 ) Symbolic boundaries are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by cultural sociologists .
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.” [ 1 ] Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.

[ 1 ] Durkheim [ edit ] Émile Durkheim saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.

[ 2 ] Rituals - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.

[ 3 ] Mary Douglas has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society; [ 4 ] while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of deviancy as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement .

[ 5 ] As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common", [ 6 ] thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

Transgressing boundaries [ edit ] Prejudice is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that, like a nation's frontiers, may in fact be real as well as symbolic.

[ 7 ] (The ancient ceremony of beating the bounds highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds.) [ 8 ] Salman Rushdie has emphasised the role of the migrant as a postmodern representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.

[ 9 ] Marjorie Garber has explored the role of the transvestite in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.

[ 10 ] Symbolic/social boundaries [ edit ] Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.” [ 1 ] Play [ edit ] Playing may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken frames set about social activities.

[ 11 ] Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.

[ 12 ] Cultural examples [ edit ] Michael Jackson , in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.
