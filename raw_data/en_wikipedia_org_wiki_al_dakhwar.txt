[ 1 ] He was also administratively responsible for medicine in Cairo and Damascus . Al-Dakhwar educated or influenced most of the prominent physicians of Egypt and Syria in the century, [ 2 ] including writer Ibn Abi Usaibia and Ibn al-Nafis , the discoverer of blood circulation in the human body.

[ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Al-Dakhwar was born and brought up in Damascus, [ 1 ] the son of an oculist .

[ 2 ] Initially, he too was an oculist at the Nuri Hospital of Damascus, [ 4 ] but afterward he studied medicine with Ibn al-Matran .

[ 2 ] Physician of the Ayyubids [ edit ] In 1208, al-Adil , the Sultan of Egypt , told his vizier al-Sahib ibn Shukur, that he was in need of another physician with the equivalent skill of the chief of medicine at the time, Abd al-Aziz al-Sulami. Al-Adil believed that al-Sulami was busy enough serving as physician of the army. Ibn Shukur recommended al-Dakhwar for the post and offered him 30 dinars a month. Al-Dakhwar turned him down, citing that al-Sulami receives 100 dinars a month and stating "I know my ability in this field and I will not take less!" [ 5 ] Al-Sulami died on June 7 and soon after al-Dakhwar himself came into contact with al-Adil , [ 4 ] and the latter was greatly impressed by him. He not only appointed him as his personal physician, but also as one of his confidants.

[ 1 ] When al-Adil died, his son and successor in Damascus, al-Mu'azzam , made him chief superintendent of the Nasiri Hospital. There he wrote books and gave lectures on medicine to his students. Later, when al-Adil's other son al-Ashraf annexed Damascus after al-Mu'azzam died, al-Dakhwar was promoted as chief medical officer of the Ayyubid state.
