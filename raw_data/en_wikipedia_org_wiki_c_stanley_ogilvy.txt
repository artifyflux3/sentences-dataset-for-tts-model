He was a professor of mathematics at Hamilton College (New York) , and a frequent competitor at the Star World Championships . His many books include works on both mathematics and sailing.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Sailing [ edit ] Ogilvy grew up sailing near New Rochelle, New York , on the mainland side of the Long Island Sound .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Beginning in 1931 he crewed for Howard McMichael on the two-man Star class Grey Fox , and in 1934 he bought the boat and renamed it the Jay .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] He won over 47 regattas, and was a frequent competitor in the Star World Championships ; [ 3 ] his best finishes were second in 1947 (crewing for Hilary Smart ) and third in 1949 and 1951 (both with his own boat, Flame ).

[ 5 ] Later, he also sailed Etchells .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Ogilvy belonged to the Larchmont Yacht Club for 62 years, and served as its historian.

[ 1 ] He was the first vice president of the International Star Class Yacht Racing Association, edited its publications for many years, and also served as historian for the class.

[ 3 ] In 1990, Ogilvy was the second recipient of the Harry Nye Memorial Trophy of the International Star Class Yacht Racing Association, in recognition of his contributions to Star class sailing.

[ 6 ] The C. Stanley Ogilvy Masters Trophy, an antique sextant awarded to a sailor over the age of 50, was named in his honor and has been presented annually by the Etchells World Championships since 1999.

[ 7 ] Education and career [ edit ] Ogilvy went to the Berkshire School , then did his undergraduate studies at Williams College .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] During World War II , his bad eyesight preventing him from serving in the Navy; instead he became the commander of a rescue boat on the Pacific Front for the U.S. Army .

[ 8 ] After earning an M.A. from Cambridge University and an M.S. at Columbia University , and doing additional studies at Princeton University , Ogilvy finished his graduate studies with a PhD in mathematics from Syracuse University in 1954.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 9 ] His thesis, supervised by Walter R. Baum, was entitled An Investigation of Some Properties of Asymptotic Lines on Surfaces of Negative Gaussian Curvature .

[ 9 ] Ogilvy began his teaching career at Trinity College (Connecticut) , and joined the faculty of Hamilton College (New York) in 1953.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] He chaired the mathematics department beginning in 1969, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . He remained at Hamilton until 1974, when he retired so that he could spend more of his time sailing.

[ 2 ] Ogilvy died on June 21, 2000, in Mamaroneck, New York .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Books [ edit ] Ogilvy wrote many books on both mathematics and sailing, [ 2 ] which were translated into several other languages.

[ 1 ] They include: Successful Yacht Racing (Norton, 1951) [ 1 ] [ 10 ] Through the Mathescope (Oxford Univ. Press, 1956).
