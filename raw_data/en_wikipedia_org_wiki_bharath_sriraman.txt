[ 8 ] He obtained his M.S in Mathematics in 1999 followed by a PhD in Mathematical Sciences in 2002 both from Northern Illinois University under the functional analyst Robert Wheeler.

[ 9 ] In 2009, Northern Illinois University named him as one of 50 "Golden alumni" in the last 50 years for his significant contributions to research in mathematics education, gifted education and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mathematics-science-arts.

[ 10 ] He previously received the School Science and Mathematics Association Early Scholar Award in 2007.

[ 11 ] In 2016 he was the recipient of the University of Montana Distinguished Scholar Award.

[ 12 ] At the 15th International Congress on Mathematical Education (2024) in Sydney, he chaired the plenary panel on What counts as evidence in mathematics education [ 13 ] Academic and editorial work [ edit ] Sriraman is the founder and editor-in-chief of The Mathematics Enthusiast , an independent open access journal hosted by University of Montana.

[ 14 ] He is the co-founder/co-editor-in-chief of two series with Springer Science+Business Media namely Advances in Mathematics Education [ 15 ] and Creativity Theory and Action in Education .

[ 16 ] In addition to editing he is a prolific scholar with over 300 publications to date in numerous areas of research, [ 17 ] and held numerous visiting professorships including those as International Fulbright Specialist [ 18 ] at institutions in Nordic countries, [ 19 ] Eurasia and South America.

[ 20 ] He also holds an adjunct appointment in the department of Central and Southwest-Asian Studies at the University of Montana [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Bibliography of Edited Works (selection) [ edit ] Mathematics Education [ edit ] Sriraman, B., English, L.
