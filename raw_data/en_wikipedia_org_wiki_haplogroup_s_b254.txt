[ 1 ] Until 2016, it was known as Haplogroup S1.

S-M254 is the most common haplogroup among males in the Papua New Guinea Highlands . It is also relatively common in some parts of Oceania , Wallacea and among indigenous Australians .

[ citation needed ] In a major correction to the phylogenetic tree during 2016, Haplogroup S-M230 was "demoted" from the position of basal clade S*, becoming S1a1b, while S-B254 was "promoted" in its place to the level of S*.

[ citation needed ] It has two primary subclades: S1 (B255) and S2 (P378).

[ 1 ] The existence of a third subclade, defined by the SNP, P336 has not been confirmed.

Prevalence [ edit ] In a study conducted among ~300 individuals who had ancestry in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, 66 of them had ancestry under S-B254.

^ International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG; 2015), Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2015 . (Access date: 1 February 2015.) ^ Haplogroup A0-T is also known as A-L1085 (and previously as A0'1'2'3'4).

^ Haplogroup A1 is also known as A1'2'3'4.

^ F-Y27277, sometimes known as F2'4, is both the parent clade of F2 and F4 and a child of F-M89.

^ Haplogroup LT (L298/P326) is also known as Haplogroup K1.

^ Between 2002 and 2008, Haplogroup T-M184 was known as "Haplogroup K2". That name has since been re-assigned to K-M526 , the sibling of Haplogroup LT.

^ Haplogroup K2b (M1221/P331/PF5911) is also known as Haplogroup MPS.

^ Haplogroup K2b1 (P397/P399) is also known as Haplogroup MS, but has a broader and more complex internal structure.

^ Haplogroup P (P295) is also klnown as K2b2.

^ K-M2313*, which as yet has no phylogenetic name, has been documented in two living individuals, who have ethnic ties to India and South East Asia.  In addition, K-Y28299, which appears to be a primary branch of K-M2313, has been found in three living individuals from India. See: Poznik op. cit.
