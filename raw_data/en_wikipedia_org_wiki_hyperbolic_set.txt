An analogous definition applies to the case of flows .

In the special case when the entire manifold M is hyperbolic, the map f is called an Anosov diffeomorphism . The dynamics of f on a hyperbolic set, or hyperbolic dynamics , exhibits features of local structural stability and has been much studied, cf.

Axiom A .

Definition [ edit ] Let M be a compact smooth manifold , f : M → M a diffeomorphism , and Df : TM → TM the differential of f .  An f -invariant subset Λ of M is said to be hyperbolic , or to have a hyperbolic structure , if the restriction to Λ of the tangent bundle of M admits a splitting into a Whitney sum of two Df -invariant subbundles, called the stable bundle and the unstable bundle and denoted E s and E u . With respect to some Riemannian metric on M , the restriction of Df to E s must be a contraction and the restriction of Df to E u must be an expansion. Thus, there exist constants 0< λ <1 and c >0 such that T Λ Λ M = E s ⊕ ⊕ E u {\displaystyle T_{\Lambda }M=E^{s}\oplus E^{u}} and ( D f ) x E x s = E f ( x ) s {\displaystyle (Df)_{x}E_{x}^{s}=E_{f(x)}^{s}} and ( D f ) x E x u = E f ( x ) u {\displaystyle (Df)_{x}E_{x}^{u}=E_{f(x)}^{u}} for all x ∈ ∈ Λ Λ {\displaystyle x\in \Lambda } and ‖ ‖ D f n v ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ c λ λ n ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|Df^{n}v\|\leq c\lambda ^{n}\|v\|} for all v ∈ ∈ E s {\displaystyle v\in E^{s}} and n > 0 {\displaystyle n>0} and ‖ ‖ D f − − n v ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ c λ λ n ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|Df^{-n}v\|\leq c\lambda ^{n}\|v\|} for all v ∈ ∈ E u {\displaystyle v\in E^{u}} and n > 0 {\displaystyle n>0} .

If Λ is hyperbolic then there exists a Riemannian metric for which c = 1 — such a metric is called adapted .

Examples [ edit ] Hyperbolic equilibrium point p is a fixed point , or equilibrium point, of f , such that ( Df ) p has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1. In this case, Λ = { p }.

More generally, a periodic orbit of f with period n is hyperbolic if and only if Df n at any point of the orbit has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1, and it is enough to check this condition at a single point of the orbit.
