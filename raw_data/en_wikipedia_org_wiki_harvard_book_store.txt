Harvard Book Store was established in 1932 by Mark Kramer, father of longtime owner Frank Kramer, and originally sold used textbooks to students.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Family-owned for over seventy-five years, the store was sold in the fall of 2008 to Jeffrey Mayersohn and Linda Seamonson of Wellesley, Massachusetts , and remains an independent business.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Though often confused with the Harvard Coop , [ citation needed ] the store has no affiliation with Harvard University or the Harvard Coop bookstore, which is managed by Barnes & Noble .  With a focus on an academic and intellectual audience, the store's selection and customer service is repeatedly honored by local publications and surveys.

[ citation needed ] Forbes named the book store as its top bookshop in its "World's Top Shops 2005" list.

[ 5 ] In 2009, the store introduced an on-demand book printing service called the Espresso Book Machine , produced by New York firm On Demand Books , using books in the public domain available through Google Library.

[ 6 ] In recent years, a well-attended author event series has hosted Al Gore , Salman Rushdie , Haruki Murakami , John Updike , Orhan Pamuk , and Stephen King , in addition to a number of local writers and academics.
