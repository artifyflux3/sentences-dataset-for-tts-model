[ 1 ] Grisez's development of ideas from Thomas Aquinas has redirected Catholic thought and changed the way it has engaged with secular moral philosophy. In 'The First Principle of Practical Reason: A Commentary on the Summa Theologiae , I-II, Q. 94, A. 2' (1965), Grisez attacked the neo-scholastic interpretation of Aquinas as holding that moral norms are derived from methodologically antecedent knowledge of human nature . Grisez defended the idea of metaphysical free choice and proposed a natural law theory of practical reasoning and moral judgment which, although broadly Thomistic , departs from Aquinas on significant points.

[ 2 ] Grisez was Professor of Christian Ethics at Mount St. Mary's University in Emmitsburg, MD [ 3 ] from 1979 to his retirement in 2009.
