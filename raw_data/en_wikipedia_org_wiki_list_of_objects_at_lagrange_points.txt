This is a list of known objects which occupy, have occupied, or are planned to occupy any of the five Lagrange points of two-body systems in space.

A diagram showing the five Lagrange points in a two-body system Sun–Earth Lagrange points [ edit ] Sun–Earth L 1 [ edit ] L 1 is the Lagrange point located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth towards the Sun.

Past probes [ edit ] International Cometary Explorer , formerly the International Sun–Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE-3), diverted out of L 1 in 1983 for a comet rendezvous mission.  Currently in heliocentric orbit . The Sun–Earth L 1 is also the point to which the Reboot ISEE-3 mission was attempting to return the craft as the first phase of a recovery mission (as of September 25, 2014 all efforts have failed and contact was lost).

[ 1 ] NASA's Genesis probe collected solar wind samples at L 1 from December 3, 2001, to April 1, 2004, when it returned the sample capsule to Earth. It returned briefly in late 2004 before being pushed into heliocentric orbit in early 2005.

LISA Pathfinder (LPF) was launched on 3 December 2015, and arrived at L 1 on 22 January 2016, where, among other experiments, it tested the technology needed by (e)LISA to detect gravitational waves. LISA Pathfinder used an instrument consisting of two small gold alloy cubes.

The Chang'e 5 orbiter [ 2 ] (during extended mission. After ferrying lunar samples back to Earth in 2020, the transport module was sent to L 1 where it is permanently stationed to conduct limited Earth-Sun observations.) Present probes [ edit ] The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in a halo orbit around L1 Mission: Investigation of the outer layer of the Sun, making observations of solar wind and associated phenomena in the vicinity of L1, probing the interior structure of the Sun.

Launched: 2 December 1995 Arrival: Operational orbit in May 1996 Institution: ESA The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) in a Lissajous orbit WIND (At L 1 since 2004) Animation of Deep Space Climate Observatory 's trajectory from 11 February 2015 to 3 January 2017 DSCOVR · Earth · Moon The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), designed to image the sunlit Earth in 10 wavelengths (EPIC) and monitor total reflected radiation (NISTAR). Launched on 11 February 2015, began orbiting L 1 on 8 June 2015 to study the solar wind and its effects on Earth.

[ 3 ] DSCOVR is unofficially known as GORESAT, because it carries a camera always oriented to Earth and capturing full-frame photos of the planet similar to the Blue Marble . This concept was proposed by then-Vice President of the United States Al Gore in 1998 [ 4 ] and was a centerpiece in his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth .

[ 5 ] Aditya-L1 was successfully launched on 2 September 2023 and entered the halo orbit around the lagrange point on 6 January 2024.

[ 6 ] It is a Solar observation mission by ISRO . It will study solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms , and their impact on the environment around the Earth.

[ 7 ] Planned probes [ edit ] Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe slated for launch in late 2025 NEO Surveyor SWFO-L1 Vigil (ESA). One spacecraft in L1 and one in L5.

Sun–Earth L 2 [ edit ] L 2 is the Lagrange point located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun. Spacecraft at the Sun–Earth L 2 point are in a Lissajous orbit until decommissioned, when they are sent into a heliocentric graveyard orbit .

[ citation needed ] Past probes [ edit ] Animation of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 's trajectory from 1 July 2001 to 7 April 2009 WMAP · Earth 2001 – 2010: NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) [ 8 ] observed the cosmic microwave background. It was moved to a heliocentric orbit to avoid posing a hazard to future missions.

2003 – 2004: NASA's WIND . The spacecraft then went to Earth orbit, before heading to the L 1 point, where it remains in service.

[ 9 ] 2009 – 2013: [ 10 ] The ESA Herschel Space Observatory exhausted its supply of liquid helium and was moved from the Lagrangian point in June 2013.

2009 – 2013: At the end of its mission ESA's Planck spacecraft was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions.

2011 – 2012: CNSA 's Chang'e 2 .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Chang'e 2 was then placed onto a heliocentric orbit that took it past the near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis .

The CNSA Chang'e 6 orbiter 2013 – 2025: The ESA Gaia mission’s thrusters moved the spacecraft away from L2 on 27 March 2025 and into a stable retirement orbit around the Sun that will minimise the chance that it comes within 10 million km Earth for at least the next century.

Cancelled probes [ edit ] The ESA Eddington mission The NASA Terrestrial Planet Finder mission (may be placed in an Earth-trailing orbit instead) Sun–Earth L 3 [ edit ] L 3 is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located on the side of the Sun opposite Earth, slightly outside the Earth's orbit. Direct communication with spacecraft in this position is blocked by the Sun.

There are no known objects in this orbital location.

[ citation needed ] Sun–Earth L 4 [ edit ] L 4 is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located close to the Earth's orbit 60° ahead of Earth.

Asteroid (706765) 2010 TK 7 is the first discovered tadpole orbit companion to Earth, orbiting L 4 ; like Earth, its mean distance to the Sun is about one astronomical unit .

Asteroid (614689) 2020 XL 5 is the second Earth trojan, confirmed in November 2021, oscillating around L 4 in a tadpole orbit and expected to remain there for at least 4000 years, until destabilized by Venus.

[ 13 ] STEREO A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Ahead) made its closest pass to L 4 in September 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly faster than Earth.

[ 14 ] OSIRIS-REx passed near the L4 point and performed a survey for asteroids between 9 and 20 February 2017.

Sun–Earth L 5 [ edit ] L 5 , or Earth-trailing orbit,  is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located close to the Earth's orbit 60° behind Earth.

Asteroid (419624) 2010 SO 16 , in a horseshoe companion orbit with Earth, is currently proximal to L 5 but at a high inclination.

STEREO B (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Behind) made its closest pass to L 5 in October 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly slower than Earth.

[ 14 ] The Spitzer Space Telescope is in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away c. 0.1 AU per year. In c. 2013–15 it has passed L 5 in its orbit.

Hayabusa2 passed near L 5 during the spring of 2017, and imaged the surrounding area to search for Earth trojans on 18 April 2018.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Past probes [ edit ] Hiten was the first spacecraft to demonstrate a low energy trajectory , passing by L 4 and L 5 to achieve lunar orbit at a very low fuel expense, compared to usual orbital techniques. Hiten did not find any conclusive increase in dust density at Lagrange points.

[ 19 ] Proposed objects [ edit ] Exploration Gateway Platform In his 1976 book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space Dr.

Gerard O'Neill proposed the establishment of gigantic Space Islands in L 5 . The inhabitants of the L5 Society should convert lunar material to huge solar power satellites . Many works of fiction, most notably the Gundam series, involve colonies at these locations.

Sun–Venus Lagrange points [ edit ] L4 [ edit ] 2013 ND 15 Sun–Mars Lagrange points [ edit ] Sun–Mars L1 [ edit ] Proposed objects [ edit ] In a 2017 NASA workshop, [ 20 ] former NASA Chief Scientist Jim Green proposed the placement of a magnetic dipole located at the Mars Lagrange orbit L 1 at about 320 R ♂ , creating a partial and distant artificial magnetosphere . If constructed, the shield may allow the planet to partially restore its atmosphere and potentially enabling the terraforming of Mars .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Sun–Mars L4 and L5 [ edit ] Asteroids in the L 4 and L 5 Sun–Mars Lagrangian points are sometimes called Mars trojans , with a lower-case t, as "Trojan asteroid" was originally defined as a term for Lagrangian asteroids of Jupiter. They may also be called Mars Lagrangian asteroids.
