[ 1 ] He wrote an important book on the history of medicine. His works on pharmacology were frequently quoted by physicians in Al-Andalus during the 10th and 11th centuries. Some of his works were later studied by Albertus Magnus , like De secretis , under Latinized version of his name, Gilgil .

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] Starting from the age of fourteen, Ibn Juljul studied medicine for ten years working under the physician Hasdai ibn Shaprut . He later became the personal physician of Caliph Hisham II , and continued working as a teacher of medicine.

Ibn al-Baghunish of Toledo was one of his disciples.

Works [ edit ] Ibn Juljul's major book is Ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbā’ w’al-hukamā’ ( Generations of physicians and Wise Men , Arabic : طبقات الأطباء والحكماء ) which is an important work on the history of medicine using both Eastern and Western sources.

[ 3 ] The book includes 57 biographies of famous Greek, Islamic, African, and Spanish physicians and philosophers, and contains interesting information on the earliest accounts of Syriac translations into Arabic .

[ 2 ] The included biographies of contemporary Spanish physicians are notable because they give a clear insight about life in Cordoba during the 10th century. One of the biographies is that of Mohammed ibn Abdun al-Jabali , Ibn Juljul's contemporary and colleague physician at the court of Cordoba.

[ 4 ] Composed in 377/987, the Ṭabaqāt is considered to be the second oldest collection of biographies of physicians written in Arabic ; the earliest being Taʾrīkh al-aṭibbāʾ by Ishaq ibn Hunayn .

[ 5 ] The Ṭabaqāt also records some of Ibn Juljul's thoughts on the decline of science in the Eastern Islamic provinces. Ibn Juljul states that: The Abbasid empire was weakened by the power of the Daylamites and Turks, who were not concerned with science: scholars appear only in states whose kings seek knowledge.

[ 2 ] Ibn Juljul also wrote a number of different treatises and letters concerning pharmacology , and wrote multiple translations and commentaries on the works of Dioscorides .
