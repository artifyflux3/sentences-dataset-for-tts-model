This result is found as Proposition 36 in Book 3 of Euclid 's Elements .

Given a secant g intersecting the circle at points G 1 and G 2 and a tangent t intersecting the circle at point T and given that g and t intersect at point P , the following equation holds: | P T | 2 = | P G 1 | ⋅ ⋅ | P G 2 | {\displaystyle |PT|^{2}=|PG_{1}|\cdot |PG_{2}|} The tangent-secant theorem can be proven using similar triangles (see graphic).

Like the intersecting chords theorem and the intersecting secants theorem , the tangent-secant theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle, namely, the power of point theorem .
