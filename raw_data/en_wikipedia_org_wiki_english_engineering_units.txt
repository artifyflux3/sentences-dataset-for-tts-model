[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Despite its name, the system is based on United States customary units of measure.

Definition [ edit ] The English Engineering Units is a system of units used in the United States. The set is defined by the following units, [ 3 ] and definitive conversions to the International System of Units .

[ 4 ] Dimension English Engineering Unit SI unit Unit conversion (of intervals) time second (s) second (s) 1 s length foot (ft) metre (m) 0.3048 m mass pound mass (lb) kilogram (kg) 0.453 592 37 kg force pound-force (lbf) newton (N) 4.448 221 615 2605 N temperature degree Fahrenheit (°F) degree Celsius (°C) ⁠ 5 / 9 ⁠ °C [ a ] absolute temperature degree Rankine (°R) kelvin (K) ⁠ 5 / 9 ⁠ K Units for other physical quantities are derived from this set as needed.

In English Engineering Units, the pound-mass and the pound-force are distinct base units, and Newton's second law of motion takes the form F = m a g c {\displaystyle F=m{\frac {a}{g_{\mathrm {c} }}}} where a {\displaystyle a} is the acceleration in ft/s 2 and g c = 32.174 lb·ft/(lbf·s 2 ) .

History and etymology [ edit ] The term English units strictly refers to the system used in England until 1826, when it was replaced by (more rigorously defined) imperial units . The United States continued to use the older definitions until the Mendenhall Order of 1893, which established the United States customary units. Nevertheless, the term "English units" persisted in common speech and was adapted as "English engineering units" but these are based on US customary units rather than the pre-1826 English system.

British Engineering Units [ edit ] A similar system, termed British Engineering Units by Halliday and Resnick (1974), is a system that uses the slug as the unit of mass, and in which Newton's law retains the form F = m a .

[ 5 ] Modern British engineering practice has used SI base units since at least the late 1970s.

1.2 These new sections represent the first stage of a complete revision and metrication of the 'Railway Construction and Operation Requirements for Passenger Lines and Recommendations for Goods Lines of the Minister of Transport', 1950 (Reprinted 1970). They are published separately in advance of the complete revision because of the urgent need for an up-to-date metric guide to the Department's requirements for clearances, both structural and electrical.
