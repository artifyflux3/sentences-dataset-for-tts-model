↓ Reconstruction  of Thuchomyces in an Archean soil.

Scientific classification (unranked): incertae sedis Genus: † Thuchomyces Hallbauer & Jahns, 1977 Species: † T. lichenoides Binomial name † Thuchomyces lichenoides Hallbauer & Jahns, 1977 Thuchomyces (sometimes mistakenly called “Thucomyces”) is a genus of Archean fossils from the Witwatersrand of South Africa , and is the earliest macroscopic land life known.

[ 1 ] The generic name derives from thucholite , the carbonaceous material which Thuchomyces is preserved in, and the Ancient Greek word "myces", meaning "fungus". The specific name, lichenoides , derives from its similarity to some modern lichens.

[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] Thuchomyces resembles modern columnar biomats, alongside certain lichens , however the latter are far more recent, only having appeared at most 300 million years ago, and therefore it almost certainly is not a lichen, or even a eukaryote at all.

[ 2 ] Some fossils have a round structure at their tip, interpreted as a diaspore , and these structures can also be observed in the rock surrounding the fossils.

[ 1 ] The internal structure of Thuchomyces consists of a network of hyphae , made of intensely branching cells possibly connected via anastomoses . The outer layer of the organism consists of highly agglutinated  hyphae with a layer of loose tissue inside it, alongside a "central cord" observed in immature specimens which disappears with age.

Thuchomyces columns are roughly 200–500 micrometers across, and reach a height of roughly 1 mm.

[ 1 ] Thuchomyces shares many similarities with the Paleoproterozoic Diskagma , having a similar size and shape, alongside both forming dense palisades on paleosols . However it lacks the spines of Diskagma and has complex vertical partitions, alongside having rounded terminations instead of the cup-like tips of Diskagma .

[ 3 ] Paleoecology [ edit ] Taking into account various features such as ventifacts , the concentration of carbon-13 in the rock and other geological features, the sediments Thuchomyces is known from are interpreted as being a wind-blasted desert environment crossed by ephemeral streams, which was occasionally flooded. In addition another organism named Witwateromyces conidiophorus , a possible actinomycete bacterium, was found associated with Thuchomyces , possibly as a decomposer .
