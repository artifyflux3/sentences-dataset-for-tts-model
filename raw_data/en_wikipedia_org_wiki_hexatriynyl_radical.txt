 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Chemical compound

The **hexatriynyl radical**, C 6 H, is an organic [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") molecule consisting of a [linear chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_molecular_geometry "Linear molecular geometry") of six [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") atoms terminated by a [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") (H−C≡C−C≡C−C≡C•). The [unpaired electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaired_electron "Unpaired electron") is located at the opposite end to the hydrogen atom, as indicated. Both experimental work and computer simulations on this species was done in the early 1990s.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexatriynyl_radical#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexatriynyl_radical#cite_note-2)

Synthesis of the radical
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexatriynyl_radical&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Synthesis of the radical")]

The radical can be synthesized by [photolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis "Photolysis"). Two different examples involve

*   Argon gas and [buta-1,3-diene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buta-1,3-diene "Buta-1,3-diene") in a mole ratio of 1500:1
*   Argon gas and [acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene "Acetylene") in a mole ratio of 100:1

Hexatriyne anion
----------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexatriynyl_radical&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Hexatriyne anion")]

In 2006 the negatively charged hexatriyne anion of this molecule, C 6 H−, was the first negatively charged ion to be discovered to exist in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), using the [Green Bank Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope "Green Bank Telescope").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexatriynyl_radical#cite_note-3) Negative ions were thought to be unstable in this environment due to the prevalence of [ultraviolet light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_light "Ultraviolet light"), which dislodges extra electrons such as this.

### Synthesis of the anion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexatriynyl_radical&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Synthesis of the anion")]

The laboratory synthesis starts from [acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene "Acetylene") C 2 H 2. The reaction takes place within a DC discharge at reduced pressure in a mixture with 15% [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"). The product is observed by millimeter-wave spectroscopy.

### Analogous species

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hexatriynyl_radical&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Analogous species")]

The two species C 4 H− and [C 8 H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatetraynyl_radical "Octatetraynyl radical")− have also been detected.
