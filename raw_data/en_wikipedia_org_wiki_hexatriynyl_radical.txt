Infobox references Chemical compound The hexatriynyl radical , C 6 H , is an organic radical molecule consisting of a linear chain of six carbon atoms terminated by a hydrogen ( H−C≡C−C≡C−C≡C• ). The unpaired electron is located at the opposite end to the hydrogen atom, as indicated.  Both experimental work and computer simulations on this species was done in the early 1990s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Synthesis of the radical [ edit ] The radical can be synthesized by photolysis . Two different examples involve Argon gas and buta-1,3-diene in a mole ratio of 1500:1 Argon gas and acetylene in a mole ratio of 100:1 Hexatriyne anion [ edit ] In 2006 the negatively charged hexatriyne anion of this molecule, C 6 H − , was the first negatively charged ion to be discovered to exist in the interstellar medium , using the Green Bank Telescope .

[ 3 ] Negative ions were thought to be unstable in this environment due to the prevalence of ultraviolet light , which dislodges extra electrons such as this.

Synthesis of the anion [ edit ] The laboratory synthesis starts from acetylene C 2 H 2 . The reaction takes place within a DC discharge at reduced pressure in a mixture with 15% argon . The product is observed by millimeter-wave spectroscopy.

Analogous species [ edit ] The two species C 4 H − and C 8 H − have also been detected.
