For the end of a business, see Liquidation .

The effects of soil liquefaction , seen after 2011 Canterbury earthquake In materials science , liquefaction [ 1 ] is a process that generates a liquid from a solid or a gas [ 2 ] or that generates a non-liquid phase which behaves in accordance with fluid dynamics .

[ 3 ] It occurs both naturally and artificially . As an example of the latter, a "major commercial application of liquefaction is the liquefaction of air to allow separation of the constituents, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and the noble gases." [ 4 ] Another is the conversion of solid coal into a liquid form usable as a substitute for liquid fuels.

[ 5 ] In geology , soil liquefaction refers to the process by which water-saturated, unconsolidated sediments are transformed into a substance that acts like a liquid, often in an earthquake.

[ 6 ] Soil liquefaction was blamed for building collapses in the city of Palu, Indonesia in October 2018.

[ 7 ] In a related phenomenon, liquefaction of bulk materials in cargo ships may cause a dangerous shift in the load.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In physics and chemistry , the phase transitions from solid and gas to liquid ( melting and condensation , respectively) may be referred to as liquefaction. The melting point (sometimes called liquefaction point) is the temperature and pressure at which a solid becomes a liquid. In commercial and industrial situations, the process of condensing a gas to liquid is sometimes referred to as liquefaction of gases .

Coal liquefaction is the production of liquid fuels from coal using a variety of industrial processes.

Liquefaction is also used in commercial and industrial settings to refer to mechanical dissolution of a solid by mixing , grinding or blending with a liquid. In kitchen or laboratory settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes in combination with a liquid, for example in food preparation or laboratory use. This may be done with a blender .

In biology , liquefaction often involves organic tissue turning into a more liquid-like state. For example, liquefactive necrosis in pathology , [ 10 ] or liquefaction as a parameter in semen analysis .

[ 11 ] See also [ edit ] Cryogenic energy storage Fluidization Liquifaction point Thixotropy References [ edit ] ^ Some authors contend that there is a distinction between liquefaction and liquification (which is more commonly considered a misspelling), with the latter term applying only to processes involving heat.

[by] a process of liquefaction is meant any process the effect of which is to cause a solid or gaseous body to assume or pass into the liquid state.
