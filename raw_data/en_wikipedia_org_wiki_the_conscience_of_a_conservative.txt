It helped revive the American conservative movement and make Goldwater a political star, and it has influenced countless conservatives in the United States, helping to lay the foundation for the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s.

[ 1 ] The book was largely ghostwritten by L. Brent Bozell Jr.

, brother-in-law of William F. Buckley Jr.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Bozell and Buckley had been members of Yale's debate team. They had co-authored the controversial book, McCarthy and His Enemies , in 1955. Bozell had been Goldwater's speechwriter in the 1950s and was familiar with many of his ideals.

Content [ edit ] The 123-page book covers such topics as education, labor unions and policies, civil rights , agricultural policy and farm subsidies , social welfare programs, and income taxation . The book is considered to be a significant statement of politically and economically American conservative ideas which were to gain influence during the following decades.

[ 1 ] In his book, Goldwater states explicitly that there are "laws of God" and "truths of God" which inform his concept of 'conservatism' and under which the US should operate.

[ 3 ] Later editions [ edit ] A half-century edition, edited by C.C. Goldwater (his granddaughter), with a foreword by George Will , and an afterword by Robert F. Kennedy Jr , was published by the Princeton University Press in 2007.

Namesake books [ edit ] The book, and its title, continue to inspire contemporary political commentary.

Mayer Schiller (1978), The (Guilty) Conscience of a Conservative In 2007, Paul Krugman entitled his own book The Conscience of a Liberal , saying in the introduction that he wanted his work to stand as a counterpoint to Goldwater's.
