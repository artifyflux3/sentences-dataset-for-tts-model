The Xenia, Ohio , F5 tornado of April 3, 1974 . Ted Fujita assigned this tornado a preliminary rating of F6.

[ 1 ] This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F5, EF5, IF5, T10-T11, the highest possible ratings on the various tornado intensity scales. These scales – the Fujita scale , the Enhanced Fujita scale , the International Fujita scale , and the TORRO tornado intensity scale – attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path.

[ note 1 ] [ note 2 ] Background [ edit ] Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in the central United States and Europe .

[ 9 ] In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale . The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F5 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 261 mph (420 km/h) and 318 mph (512 km/h).

[ 10 ] [ note 3 ] F5 damage in Bridge Creek, Oklahoma , from the May 3, 1999, tornado .

Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999 , engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale .

[ 11 ] The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F5/EF5 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T10 to T11 on the T-Scale.

In the United States, between 1950 and January 31, 2007, a total of 50 tornadoes were officially rated F5, and since February 1, 2007, a total of nine tornadoes have been officially rated EF5.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Since 1950, Canada has had one tornado officially rated an F5.

[ 14 ] Outside the United States and Canada, seven tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5/IF5: two each in France and Germany , and one each in Italy , Argentina and Australia .

Several other tornadoes have also been documented as possibly attaining this status, though they are not officially rated as such. The work of tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis revealed the existence of several dozen likely F5 tornadoes between 1880 and 1995. Grazulis also called into question the ratings of several tornadoes currently rated F5 by official sources. Many tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4 or equivalent have been disputed and described as actual F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent tornadoes, and vice versa; since structures are completely destroyed in both cases, distinguishing between an EF4 tornado and an EF5 tornado is often very difficult.

[ 15 ] Additionally, because tornado ratings are damage-based, many tornadoes capable of causing F5/EF5/T10+ damage, such as those that move through rural areas, may receive lower ratings because their strongest winds do not strike any suitable damage indicators.

A chart by Villanova University in 2025 showing EF5 tornadoes are responsible for 0.1% of all tornadoes In July 2023, the International Fujita scale (IF-scale) was officially published, creating a new scale which improved on issues from the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales.

[ 17 ] In March 2024, Anthony W. Lyza, Matthew D. Flournoy, and A. Addison Alford, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory , Storm Prediction Center , CIWRO , and the University of Oklahoma 's School of Meteorology, published a paper stating, ">20% of supercell tornadoes may be capable of producing EF4–EF5 damage".

[ 18 ] In May 2024, researchers with the University of Western Ontario 's Northern Tornado Project and engineering department conducted a case study on the 2018 Alonsa EF4 tornado , the 2020 Scarth EF3 tornado , and the 2023 Didsbury EF4 tornado . In their case study, the researchers assessed extreme damage caused by the tornado which is ineligible for ratings on the Canadian Enhanced Fujita scale or the American Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-scale). In their analysis, it was determined all three tornadoes caused damage well-beyond their assigned EF-scale ratings, with all three tornadoes having EF5-intensity winds. At the end of the analysis, the researchers stated, "the lofting wind speeds given by this model are much higher than the rating based on the ground survey EF-scale assessment. This may be due to the current tendency to bias strong EF5 tornadoes lower than reality, or limitations in conventional EF-scale assessments".

[ 19 ] List of events [ edit ] F5 and EF5 Tornadoes in the United States 1950–2019 Detailed map The tornadoes on this list have been formally rated F5 by an official government source. Unless otherwise noted, the source of the F5 rating is the U.S.

National Weather Service (NWS), as shown in the archives of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Prior to 1950, assessments of F5 tornadoes are based primarily on the work of Thomas P. Grazulis. The NCDC has accepted 38 of his F5 classifications of tornadoes occurring between 1880 and 1950. In addition to the accepted ones, Grazulis rated a further 25 during the same period which were not accepted. Grazulis' work has identified 16 additional F5 tornadoes between 1950 and 1995, [ 22 ] with four later being accepted by the NCDC.

[ 21 ] From 1950 to 1970, tornadoes were assessed retrospectively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, as well as newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys.

[ 23 ] As of February 1, 2007, tornadoes in the United States are rated using the Enhanced Fujita scale , which replaced the Fujita scale in order to more accurately correlate tornadic intensity with damage indicators and to augment and refine damage descriptors. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated on the original Fujita scale. France and Canada also adopted the EF-Scale in subsequent years. Since the creation of the International Fujita scale in 2018, two tornadoes have been rated IF5.

Official F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes [ edit ] Worldwide, a total of 67 tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5/IF5: 59 in the United States, two each in France and Germany, and one each in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Italy. Of the 59 tornadoes in the United States, 50 are officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 11, 1953, and May 3, 1999), and nine are officially rated EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 4, 2007, and May 20, 2013).

In total worldwide, 55 of these tornadoes have been rated F5, ten have been rated EF5, and two have been rated IF5.

F5 tornadoes [ edit ] Worldwide, 55 tornadoes have the rating of F5 on the Fujita scale .

Tornadoes officially rated F5 Day Year Country Sub­division Location Fata­lities Rated by Jun 29 1764 Germany Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Woldegk 1 ESSL , Genzmer 1764 Woldegk tornado — This extremely intense tornado caused tremendous damage to vegetation and large debris from leveled homes was carried over 10 km (6.2 mi). This tornado was among the strongest ever recorded and rated as F5/T11, indicating potential winds over 300 mph (480 km/h). The rating was assigned based on several surveys by German scientist Gottlob Burchard Genzmer . 5-to-10-centimetre-diameter (2.0 to 3.9 in) hail occurred during this tornado as well.

[ 24 ] Apr 23 1800 Germany Saxony Hainichen 0 ESSL Homes were completely destroyed, trees and shrubbery debarked, and several heads of livestock fatally mutilated.

[ 25 ] Feb 22 1876 Australia Queensland Bowen 0 BoM A tornado struck near the city of Bowen . In the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) database, the tornado is marked as striking present-day Brisbane; however, local papers confirmed the tornado caused "a large amount of damage" to Bowen.

Vehicles were thrown and stripped down to their frames, including a pickup truck that was partially wrapped around a tree. A 30-by-40- foot (9.1 by 12.2 m ) concrete block building was obliterated, with the foundation left mostly bare. Numerous trees were debarked as well.

[ 37 ] Apr 3 1956 United States Michigan Hudsonville , Grand Rapids 18 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis Tornado outbreak of April 2–3, 1956 – Many homes and businesses were swept completely away, leaving bare foundations behind. Extensive wind-rowing of debris was observed and vehicles were tossed hundreds of yards as well. One home that was swept away had all of its tile flooring scoured from the foundation. Grazulis initially listed this tornado as an F4 but noted that it "probably produced F5 damage"; he subsequently upgraded it to F5.

[ 38 ] May 20 1957 United States Kansas, Missouri Spring Hill (KS) , Kansas City (MO) 44 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis 1957 Ruskin Heights tornado – Entire rows of homes were swept away, with extensive wind-rowing of structural debris noted in nearby fields. Some homes had their anchor-bolted [ citation needed ] subfloors swept away as well, leaving only empty basements behind. A steel-reinforced [ citation needed ] school was partially leveled and many shops and businesses sustained F5 damage. Homes were leveled in both states, but F5-level damage occurred to both homes and stores in Missouri, chiefly the neighborhoods of Martin City , Ruskin Heights , and Hickman Mills .

[ 39 ] Jun 20 1957 United States North Dakota, Minnesota Fargo (ND) , Moorhead (MN) 10 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis , Fujita Fargo tornado – Homes in the newest part of Fargo were leveled, some of which were swept away. Part of the Golden Ridge subdivision was scattered long distances into nearby fields. Fujita considered this more intense than the strongest tornadoes he surveyed from April 11, 1965 .

[ 40 ] Dec 18 1957 United States Illinois Sunfield 3 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis Tornado outbreak sequence of December 18–20, 1957 – The entire Sunfield community "vanished." [ 41 ] Jun 4 1958 United States Wisconsin Menomonie , Colfax 21 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis Tornado outbreak of June 3–4, 1958 – Homes were swept away and numerous trees were completely debarked. A car was wrapped around the side of a small steel [ citation needed ] bridge that collapsed in the tornado. Grazulis initially rated this as an F4, but later upgraded it to F5.

[ 42 ] May 5 1960 United States Oklahoma Prague , Iron Post , Sapulpa 5 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis May 1960 tornado outbreak sequence – Homes were swept away between Prague and Paden, at “Iron Post,” and at the northwest edge of Sapulpa.

[ 43 ] Apr 3 1964 United States Texas Wichita Falls 7 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis 1964 Wichita Falls tornado – Two homes adjacent to each other were swept away at F5 intensity and a boxcar was thrown 100 yd (91 m). A car was thrown a block and a half.

[ 44 ] May 5 1964 United States Nebraska Bradshaw 4 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis 1964 Central Nebraska tornado – Numerous farms were swept away.

[ 45 ] May 8 1965 United States South Dakota Colome 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis Early May 1965 tornado outbreak – Many farms were destroyed, including three that were swept completely away.

[ 47 ] Mar 3 1966 United States Mississippi Jackson , Flowood , Leesburg , Forkville , Midway 57 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis 1966 Candlestick Park tornado outbreak – Homes were swept away and a brick church was obliterated. The pavement was scoured from roads and cars were thrown more than 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) from where they originated. The newly built Candlestick Park shopping center was leveled and concrete masonry blocks were scattered for long distances. Steel girders were "twisted like wet noodles" at a glass plant.

[ 48 ] Jun 8 1966 United States Kansas Topeka 16 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis Tornado outbreak sequence of June 1966 – Entire rows of homes were swept away and grass was scoured from lawns. Eight homes incurred F5-level damage on Burnett's Mound, disproving a myth that the mound protected Topeka from tornadoes.

[ 49 ] Oct 14 1966 United States Iowa Belmond 6 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC [ 46 ] A house was swept away on the outskirts of town. On this basis, the tornado was officially rated F5, however, the home was likely poorly anchored as debris was deposited in a neat pile near the foundation and nearby homes only showed F1-level damage. Grazulis rated this tornado as an F4.

[ 50 ] Apr 23 1968 United States Ohio Wheelers­burg , Gallipolis 7 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC [ 46 ] Tornado outbreak of April 21–24, 1968 – Homes were swept away with only their foundations left in some cases. A large metal electrical transmission tower was ripped off at the base and thrown. The F5 rating is disputed as structures swept away were not anchored properly. Grazulis rated this tornado as an F4.

[ 51 ] May 15 1968 United States Iowa Charles City 13 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis 1968 Hansell-Charles City tornado – Many homes and farms were leveled or swept away. Very intense, cycloidal ground scouring associated with multiple vortices was noted.

[ 52 ] May 15 1968 United States Iowa Oelwein , Maynard 5 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis 1968 Oelwein tornado – Homes were swept completely away in both towns.

[ 53 ] Jun 13 1968 United States Minnesota Tracy 9 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis 1968 Tracy tornado – Several businesses, farms, and homes were swept completely away. A heavy boxcar was thrown more than a full block and two others were thrown 300 yd (270 m). A steel I-beam was carried for 2 mi (3.2 km) on a piece of roof. Extensive ground scouring occurred as well.

[ 54 ] May 11 1970 United States Texas Lubbock 26 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis , Fujita Lubbock tornado – Homes were swept away at F5 intensity and trees were almost completely debarked. A high-rise building suffered structural deformation, a 13-ton (26,000 lb; 12,000 kg) metal fertilizer tank was thrown nearly 1 mi (1.6 km) through the air, and large oil tanks were carried for over 300 yd (270 m); however, none of these cases were deemed to have the required winds of F5 intensity. This tornado was surveyed by Fujita and individual cases of damage in Lubbock were used as guidelines for the newly created Fujita scale. This tornado was originally rated F6 but was later downgraded to F5.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Feb 21 1971 United States Louisiana , Mississippi Delhi (LA) , Waverly (LA) , Delta City (MS) , Inverness (MS) , Moorhead (MS) 47 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis 1971 Inverness tornado – This was the sole F5 tornado on record in Louisiana. Numerous small homes were completely leveled in both states, but the only official F5 damage occurred in Louisiana as damage in Mississippi only reached F4-level intensity. Grazulis originally rated this tornado as an F4 but later upgraded it to F5.

[ 57 ] Jan 10 1973 Argentina Santa Fe Province San Justo 63 Balbi, Barbieri, Grazulis 1973 San Justo tornado – Masonry homes reportedly vanished with little or no trace and vehicles were thrown hundreds of meters from where they originated and were mangled beyond recognition. Large factories were completely leveled and grass was scoured from the ground. A vehicle motor was found embedded into a poured concrete wall and a tractor was thrown 500 m (1,600 ft) into a wooded area.

[ 58 ] This slow-moving tornado was not rated until 2017.

[ 59 ] May 6 1973 United States Texas Valley Mills 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis , Fujita This tornado was rated F5 by wind engineers on the basis of vehicles being carried long distances. Two pickup trucks were lofted for hundreds of yards, one of which traveled 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) through the air. Peak structural damage was only of F2 intensity as two rural barns were obliterated.

[ 60 ] The F5 rating was accepted by Fujita at the time.

[ 61 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Indiana Depauw , Palmyra , Martinsburg , Daisy Hill 6 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1974 Super Outbreak – This was one of six tornadoes on April 3 to be rated F5 by Fujita. Homes were swept completely away and entire farms were leveled.

[ 63 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Ohio Xenia , Wilberforce 32 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1974 Xenia tornado – This was the deadliest tornado of the 1974 Super Outbreak . Aerial photography and isoline surveys by Fujita showed that entire rows of brick homes were swept away and sustained F5 damage. Wind-rowing of debris occurred in nearby fields and very intense damage was reported to steel-reinforced schools. This tornado was originally rated F6 by Fujita in a survey of the Super Outbreak.

[ 1 ] [ 64 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Kentucky, Indiana Hardins­burg (KY) , Branden­burg (KY) , Harrison County (IN) 31 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1974 Brandenburg tornado – Multiple well-built, anchor-bolted homes were swept away, including one that sustained total collapse of its poured concrete walk-out basement wall. The grass was scoured from the ground and aerial photography showed extensive wind-rowing in Brandenburg. Trees were completely debarked and low-lying shrubs next to leveled homes were uprooted and stripped. Multiple vehicles were also thrown hundreds of yards and stripped down to their frames.

[ 65 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio Rising Sun (IN) , Boone County (KY) , Sayler Park (West Cincinnati, OH) , Mack (OH) , Bridgetown (OH) 3 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1974 Cincinnati tornado – Homes were swept away in Sayler Park and a large floating restaurant barge was lifted, ripped from its moorings, and flipped upside-down by the tornado. Boats and vehicles were carried long distances through the air.

[ 66 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Alabama Mount Hope , Mount Moriah, Tanner , Capshaw , Harvest 28 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita First Tanner tornado – Numerous homes were swept away and scattered. In Limestone County , where the F5 damage occurred, a large swath of trees was leveled and ground scouring occurred nearby with dirt found to have been dug up and plastered to the bark. A pump was lifted out of a well at one location and shrubbery was debarked as well.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Alabama, Tennessee Tanner (AL) , Capshaw (AL) , Harvest (AL) , Hazel Green (AL) , Vanntown (TN) 22 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] NWA Second Tanner tornado – This tornado is officially listed as an F5, but was rated an F4 by Grazulis and Fujita. It crossed into Tennessee and did F4 damage in both states, though the supposed F5 damage only occurred in Alabama where numerous homes were swept away and extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred. Some of the damage in Tennessee was previously rated F5, but later downgraded to F4.

[ 67 ] [ 69 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Alabama Guin , Twin , Delmar 28 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1974 Guin tornado – According to the NWS in Birmingham, Alabama , this is considered one of the strongest tornadoes ever to impact the United States. Sources indicate that F5 damage was reported along much of the path and that many homes in and near Guin sustained F5 damage. Many of these homes were swept away, their debris being scattered across fields, and some reportedly had their "foundations dislodged and in some cases swept away as well." A large industrial plant in Guin was reduced to a pile of mangled beams. Additionally, photographs showed intense wind-rowing from suction vortices. The path of the tornado was visible in satellite imagery, as thousands of trees, including in the William B. Bankhead National Forest , were snapped.

[ 70 ] Mar 26 1976 United States Oklahoma Spiro 2 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis Frame homes were swept away and 134,000-pound (61,000 kg) coal cars were tossed. Grazulis originally rated this tornado as an F4, but later upgraded it to F5.

[ 71 ] Apr 19 1976 United States Texas Brownwood 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis 1976 Brownwood tornado – Homes were swept away, with only a bathtub remaining on one of the foundations. Several teenagers were caught in the open and were picked up and thrown 1,000 yd (910 m; 0.57 mi) but survived. Mesquite trees were shredded. Grazulis originally rated this tornado as an F4, but later upgraded it to F5.

[ 72 ] Jun 13 1976 United States Iowa Jordan 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 62 ] Grazulis , Fujita Homes were swept away and well-built farms reportedly vanished without a trace. In a conversation with Grazulis concerning the "worst" tornadoes, this tornado was reportedly mentioned by Fujita as having produced some of the most intense instances of damage he surveyed, along with the 1974 Xenia tornado.

[ 73 ] Apr 4 1977 United States Alabama Birmingham , Tarrant 22 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita Tornado outbreak of April 1977 – Many homes were swept away, some of which had all of their cinder block walk-out basement walls completely swept away as well. Trees were debarked, and two dump trucks were thrown through the air. Along with an example from the 1970 Lubbock tornado, Fujita used a visual example from this tornado to illustrate F5 damage. Fujita surveyed the damage personally and according to the National Weather Service, he "toyed with the idea of rating the Smithfield tornado an F6".

[ 75 ] Apr 2 1982 United States Oklahoma Speer, Messer , Golden , Broken Bow 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Fujita Tornado outbreak of April 2–3, 1982 – A house was swept away with only carpet tacks left on the empty foundation. The F5 rating is disputed because the home was likely not anchored properly and its destruction "probably" reflected F3-level winds instead. Due to its appearance, Fujita maintained the F5 rating. Other houses suffered F4 damage.

[ 76 ] Jun 7–8 1984 United States Wisconsin Barneveld , Black Earth 9 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita Tornado outbreak of June 7–8, 1984 – A cul-de-sac of newly built homes was swept away and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards. Small trees were debarked as well. Like the 1966 Topeka tornado, this event also disproved a myth that a nearby ridge or "mound" protected an area from tornadoes.

[ 77 ] May 31 1985 United States Ohio, Pennsylvania Newton Falls (OH) , Lordstown (OH) , Niles (OH) , Wheatland (PA) , Hermitage (PA) 18 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak – This tornado caused F5 damage along much of its path through Niles and Wheatland. A shopping center in Niles was obliterated, causing several deaths and sustaining F5 damage. Metal girders at the center twisted and buckled. Well-built, anchor-bolted homes were swept away and 75,000-pound (34,000 kg) petroleum storage tanks were ripped from their anchors and thrown hundreds of feet. Pavement was scoured from a parking lot and a steel-frame trucking plant was obliterated and partially swept away with the beams severely mangled. Routing slips from the plant were found wedged into the remaining asphalt of the parking lot. An airplane wing was carried 10 mi (16 km) from where it originated. The tornado remains the only F5 or EF5 in Pennsylvania history. Grazulis called it a "maxi-tornado" to denote its extreme intensity.

[ 78 ] Mar 13 1990 United States Kansas Castleton , Haven , Burrton , Hesston 1 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita March 1990 Central United States tornado outbreak – Many homes and businesses were swept away in town with only slabs and empty basements remaining. Industrial buildings were obliterated and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and stripped down to their frames.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] Mar 13 1990 United States Kansas Goessel 1 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita March 1990 Central United States tornado outbreak – Homes were obliterated and swept away, but the F5 rating was assigned due to very intense cycloidal ground scouring. The tornado is considered by some sources to be one of the strongest tornadoes ever surveyed at the time, though little detailed information about the damage is available.

[ 81 ] Aug 28 1990 United States Illinois Oswego , Plainfield , Crest Hill , Joliet 29 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Fujita 1990 Plainfield tornado – A mature corn crop was scoured from the ground, leaving nothing but bare soil behind. Several inches of topsoil were blown away as well. A 20-ton (40,000 lb; 18,000 kg) tractor-trailer was tossed from a road and thrown more than 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) and vehicles were picked up and carried through the air. The F5 rating is based solely upon the extreme ground scouring; areas in Plainfield sustained high-end F4 structural damage, though the ground scouring nearby was much less intense than where the corn crop was obliterated. Fujita considered the ground scouring to be "comparable to the worst he had seen." [ 82 ] Apr 26 1991 United States Kansas McConnell Air Force Base , Andover 17 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis 1991 Andover tornado – Many large, well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away, leaving bare foundations behind, and the grass was scoured from the ground. Extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred, leaving streaks of debris extending away from empty foundations. Trees and small twigs were completely stripped of their bark. Vehicles were thrown up to 3 ⁄ 4 mi (1.2 km) from where they originated and were mangled beyond recognition.

[ 83 ] Jun 16 1992 United States Minnesota Chandler , Lake Wilson 1 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis , Narramore 1992 Chandler–Lake Wilson tornado – Multiple homes were swept away and vehicles were thrown and stripped down to their frames.

[ 84 ] Jul 18 1996 United States Wisconsin Oakfield 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis 1996 Oakfield tornado outbreak – Well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away, including one where rebar supports were bent at 60° to 90°. Vehicles were thrown up to 400 yd (370 m) through the air and mangled beyond recognition. Crops were scoured to 1-inch (2.5 cm) stubble.

[ 85 ] While listing the tornado as an F5, Grazulis considered its rating to be "somewhat questionable." [ 22 ] May 27 1997 United States Texas Jarrell 27 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis Jarrell tornado – This tornado produced some of the most extreme damage ever documented. The entire subdivision of Double Creek Estates was swept completely away with very little debris remaining. Some of the obliterated homes were well-built and properly anchor-bolted to their foundations. Long expanses of pavement, cumulatively 525 ft (160 m) in length, were torn from roads and a large swath of ground was scoured out to a depth of 18 in (46 cm). Vehicles were torn apart and scattered across fields, "several dozen" of which were reportedly never found, and a recycling plant was obliterated. Trees were completely debarked and mutilated cattle were carried more than 1 ⁄ 4 mi (0.40 km). The tornado was very slow-moving, which may have exacerbated the destruction to some extent.

[ 86 ] Apr 8 1998 United States Alabama Oak Grove , Sylvan Springs , Pleasant Grove , Edgewater , Birmingham 32 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 74 ] Grazulis 1998 Oak Grove–Birmingham tornado – Many homes were swept away along the path.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Apr 16 1998 United States Tennessee Wayne County , Lawrence County 0 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 89 ] NWA , Grazulis Tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998 – Many large and well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards. A swath of grass 200 ft (61 m) wide was scoured from the ground, with nothing but bare soil and clumps of dirt remaining; according to Grazulis, this phenomenon indicated "extreme" winds at ground level.

[ 90 ] [ 89 ] [ 91 ] This tornado is the only documented F5 in the history of Tennessee.

[ 92 ] May 3 1999 United States Oklahoma Amber , Bridge Creek , Newcastle , Moore , Oklahoma City , Del City , Midwest City 36 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] NCDC , [ 89 ] Grazulis , DOW , Wurman 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado – Mobile radar recorded winds up to 321 mph (517 km/h), which is the highest wind speed ever measured on Earth. Many homes were swept completely away, some of which were well-bolted to their foundations, and debris from some homes was finely granulated. Severe ground and pavement scouring occurred including removing pavement. Trees and shrubs were completely debarked and vehicles were thrown up to 440 yd (400 m) from where they originated. An airplane wing was carried for several miles and a 36,000-pound (16,000 kg) freight car was bounced 3 ⁄ 4 mi (1.2 km).

[ 93 ] [ 89 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] This was the 50th and last tornado to be officially rated F5 on the Fujita scale in the United States before the introduction of the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007.

Jun 22 2007 Canada Manitoba Elie 0 ECCC 2007 Elie tornado – Two homes were swept away, including one that was well-bolted to its foundation. A few of the bolts themselves were snapped off. A van was thrown 150 m (490 ft) through the air and nearby trees were debarked as well.

[ 97 ] Only officially rated F5 tornado in Canada.

[ 98 ] Last tornado to be rated F5 due to Environment Canada utilizing the Enhanced Fujita Scale beginning April 1, 2013.

EF5 tornadoes [ edit ] Worldwide, ten tornadoes have the rating of EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale .

Tornadoes officially rated EF5 Day Year Country Sub­division Location Fata­lities Rated by Aug 19 1845 France Normandy Montville 75 Keraunos , ESSL , TORRO Three large mills, at least one of which was newly built, were leveled and partly swept clean. One of the mills was a four-story structure that likely collapsed. Large debris was carried 30 km (19 mi) and mature trees were thrown "very far." This tornado was rated EF5 by the French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos), with the European Severe Storms Laboratory acknowledging the EF5 rating as its "maximum intensity", though ESSL also rated the tornado F5. TORRO rated the tornado T10.

[ 99 ] May 4 2007 United States Kansas Greensburg 11 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] Marshall Greensburg tornado – This tornado destroyed 95% of the town, including seven well-built homes with anchor bolts that were swept away. Vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled, including a pickup truck that was split in two and found a mile away. Furthermore, freight train cars were overturned, and multi-ton oil tanks were destroyed. Fire hydrants were ripped from the ground in town and large trees were completely denuded and debarked as well.

[ 100 ] Aerial views of the tornado's path showed spiral and erratic paths from suction vortices in fields before it hit Greensburg; the area was severely scoured with some vegetation removed. Just northwest of the town, extraordinary damage to evergreen trees occurred.

[ citation needed ] This was the first tornado to have been rated EF5 after the retirement of the original Fujita Scale in the United States in February 2007.

May 25 2008 United States Iowa Parkers­burg , New Hartford 9 SPC - NWS [ 20 ] 2008 Parkersburg–New Hartford tornado – Well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away, 17 of which were assessed to have sustained EF5 damage. Two of them had no visible debris left anywhere near the foundations.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] A concrete walk-out basement wall was pushed over at one home and the concrete floor was cracked. A rebar support set into the foundation of another home was found snapped in half and reinforced concrete light poles were snapped and dragged along the ground. A large industrial building was completely destroyed with metal beams twisted and sheared off at their bases and the foundation pushed clean of the metal framing and debris. Vehicles were thrown long distances and stripped down to their frames as well. Additionally, a large field east of Parkersburg was filled with finely granulated debris that was wind-rowed in long streaks. Trees were completely debarked and shrubs were uprooted and stripped in some areas. Numerous vehicles were mangled beyond recognition, including a ford minivan that was left torn apart by the winds.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Apr 27 2011 United States Mississippi Northern Philadelphia , Coy, Winston County , Noxubee County 3 SPC - NWS [ 20 ] 2011 Philadelphia, Mississippi tornado – Rated EF5 based upon extreme ground scouring. The tornado dug a trench 2 ft (0.61 m) deep into a pasture, leaving nothing but large clumps of dirt and bare topsoil behind.

[ 104 ] A tied-down mobile home was lofted through the air and carried 300 yd (270 m) with no indication of contact with the ground. Several vehicles were tossed hundreds of yards and wrapped around trees [ 104 ] and a steel I-beam was twisted and embedded into the ground. A well-built frame home was nearly swept clean off its foundation. Pavement was scoured from roads as well and extreme debarking and denuding of trees occurred, some of which were ripped out of the ground and thrown up to 20 yd (18 m) away.

Apr 27 2011 United States Alabama Hamilton , Hackleburg , Phil Campbell , Mount Hope , Tanner , Athens , Harvest 71 SPC - NWS [ 20 ] 2011 Hackleburg–Phil Campbell tornado – This was the deadliest tornado in Alabama history and the deadliest tornado of the 2011 Super Outbreak . Numerous homes, some of which were large, well-built, and anchor-bolted were swept away. Debris from some obliterated homes was scattered and wind-rowed well away from the foundations.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] One home that was swept away had its concrete stem-walls sheared off at ground level. Vehicles were thrown at least 200 yd (180 m), [ 105 ] and at least one large vehicle that was missing after the tornado was never located, another was wrapped around a debarked tree.

[ 106 ] Hundreds of trees were completely debarked and twisted and in some cases were reduced only to stubs.

[ 106 ] Pavement was scoured from roads, a large industrial plant was leveled to the ground, and a restaurant that was swept away had a small portion of its foundation slab torn apart as well.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] Apr 27 2011 United States Mississippi, Alabama Smithville , Shottsville 23 SPC - NWS [ 20 ] 2011 Smithville tornado – This tornado produced some of the most violent damage ever documented. Numerous well-built, anchor-bolted brick homes were swept away. Floor tiles were ripped from the foundations of several homes. An SUV was thrown half a mile into the top of the town's water tower and was recovered on the opposite side of town. Other vehicles were torn into multiple pieces, stripped down to their frames, wrapped around trees, or simply never recovered. In the most intense damage area, all plumbing and appliances at home-sites were "shredded or missing" and debris was finely granulated.

[ 108 ] Chip and tar pavement was torn from road and large trees were completely debarked. A large brick funeral home was reduced to a bare slab and extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred next to the foundation. Outside of town, the ground was deeply scoured in an open field. Additionally, low-lying vegetation and shrubbery were completely debarked and shredded.

[ 109 ] Apr 27 2011 United States Alabama, Georgia Fyffe , Shiloh , Rainsville , Sylvania , Henagar , Ider , Rising Fawn 25 SPC - NWS [ 20 ] 2011 Rainsville tornado – Many homes were swept away, some of which had their concrete porches torn away and shattered with debris strewn up to a mile away from the foundations in some cases. A few of the homes were bolted to their foundations. An 800-pound (360 kg) safe was ripped from its anchors and thrown 600 ft (180 m) and its door was ripped from its frame. Ground scouring occurred and sidewalk pavement was pulled up. Many vehicles were mangled beyond recognition, including a pickup truck which was tossed 250 yd (230 m) and torn apart. A school bus was hurled across a highway and shredded down to its bare chassis. An underground storm shelter had much of its dirt covering scoured away and was heaved slightly out of the ground and pavement was scoured from roads. One well-built stone house was obliterated and a stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground at that residence, pulling up a section of house foundation in the process.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] May 22 2011 United States Missouri Joplin , Duquesne 158 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] Marshall Joplin tornado – This was the deadliest tornado in the United States since 1947. Many homes, business, and steel-frame industrial buildings were swept away and large vehicles including semi-trucks and buses were thrown hundreds of yards. A large multi-story hospital had its foundation and underpinning system so severely damaged that it was structurally compromised and had to be torn down. Reinforced concrete porches were deformed, lifted, and tossed, and 300-pound (140 kg) concrete parking stops anchored with rebar were ripped from parking lots and tossed well over 100 ft (30 m). Vehicles were thrown several blocks away from the residences where they originated and a few were never recovered. Damage to driveways was noted at some residences as well. A large steel-reinforced concrete "step and floor structure" leading to one building was warped slightly and cracked.

[ 112 ] Ground and pavement scouring occurred and heavy manhole covers were removed from roads as well. On June 10, 2013, an engineering study found no evidence of EF5 structural damage in Joplin due to the poor quality of construction of many buildings. However, the EF5 rating stood as the National Weather Service in Springfield, Missouri , stated that survey team found an area of EF5 structural damage (at and around the hospital) and that it could have easily been missed in the survey. The EF5 rating was mainly based on large vehicles being thrown long distances, along with non-conventional, non-structural instances of damage, such as removal of manhole covers, pavement, concrete porches, driveways, parking stops, and the presence of wind-rowed debris. Furthermore, the engineering survey only examined a small portion of the damage swath. Timothy Marshall identified 22 homes which sustained EF5 damage, some of the most EF5 damage rated by a single tornado. This is also the deadliest single tornado in over 50 years and the deadliest day SPC "Moderate Risk" (i.e. no "High Risk" area) convective outlook day on record.

[ 113 ] [ 112 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] Some unofficial estimates have put the peak winds as high as 225–250 mph (362–402 km/h), but this has not been confirmed.

[ 116 ] May 24 2011 United States Oklahoma Hinton , Calumet , El Reno , Piedmont , Guthrie 9 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] Wurman , DOW 2011 El Reno–Piedmont tornado – Many homes were swept away, trees were completely debarked, and extensive ground scouring occurred. At the Cactus 117 oil rig, a 1,900,000-pound (860,000 kg) oil derrick was blown over and rolled several times. Cars were thrown long distances and wrapped around trees, including an SUV that was thrown 780 yd (710 m) and had its body ripped from the frame. Several cars near the beginning of the path were thrown more than 1,093 yd (999 m).

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] Additionally, a 20,000-pound (9,100 kg) oil tanker truck was thrown approximately 1 mi (1.6 km).

[ 119 ] [ 120 ] Mobile Doppler weather radar indicated wind speeds as high as 295 mph (475 km/h), which are some of the highest wind speeds ever recorded in a tornado.

[ 121 ] May 20 2013 United States Oklahoma Newcastle , Moore 24 SPC - NWS , [ 20 ] Marshall 2013 Moore tornado – Many homes were swept away, including nine that were well-built and bolted to their foundations. Two elementary schools were completely destroyed.

[ 122 ] Extensive ground scouring occurred with only bare soil left in some areas and a 10-ton (20,000 lb; 9,100 kg)  propane tank was thrown more than 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) through the air. Trees and shrubs were completely debarked, wind-rowing of debris was noted, and an oil tank was thrown a full mile from a production site while another was never found.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] A manhole cover was removed near Moore Medical Center and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and torn into multiple pieces. The tornado was originally assigned a rating of a high end EF4, but was upgraded to EF5 on May 21.

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] IF5 tornadoes [ edit ] Worldwide, two tornadoes have the rating of IF5 on the International Fujita scale .

Tornadoes officially rated IF5 Day Year Country Sub­division Location Fata­lities Rated by Jul 24 1930 Italy Treviso , Udine Volpago del Montello , Selva del Montello , Giavera del Montello , Nervesa della Battaglia 23 ESSL , TORRO 1930 Montello tornado – An extremely powerful tornado which destroyed many villages and 200 homes. A large stone monastery was partially leveled to the ground.

TORRO rated the tornado T10 on the TORRO scale , while the European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado F5 on the Fujita scale . In May 2024, the F5 rating was changed to IF5, marking the first tornado to receive an IF5 rating on the International Fujita scale .

[ 127 ] Jun 24 1967 France Hauts-de-France Palluel 6 ESSL , Keraunos Homes were leveled or swept away in and near Palluel, cars were thrown over 200 m (220 yd) and a strong-framed building with thick walls was almost completely leveled to the ground. This tornado was rated EF5 by the French Observatory of Tornadoes and Violent Thunderstorms (Keraunos). Grazulis rated this tornado as an F3. In 2024, the initial F5 rating from the European Severe Storms Laboratory was changed to IF5.

[ 128 ] Possible F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes [ edit ] See also: Disagreements on the intensity of tornadoes and List of F4, EF4, and IF4 tornadoes Because the distinctions between F4/EF4/T9 and F5/EF5/T10 tornadoes are often ambiguous, the official ratings of numerous other tornadoes formally rated below F5/EF5/T10 or equivalent have been disputed, with certain government sources or independent studies contradicting the official record.

Previously rated F5/EF5/IF5 or rated F5/EF5/IF5 by others [ edit ] This is an incomplete list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by participating in discussions about tornadoes for this list.

This list includes tornadoes previously rated F5 or EF5 by the National Weather Service as well as tornadoes rated F5/EF5 by other branches of the United States government, tornado experts (i.e.

Thomas P. Grazulis , Ted Fujita ), or meteorological research institutions (i.e.

European Severe Storms Laboratory ).

1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Tornadoes rated F5/EF5/T10 by other experts or groups besides the National Weather Service Day Year Country Sub­division Location Fata­lities Rated by Mar 21 1952 United States Mississippi , Tennessee Byhalia (MS) , Moscow (TN) 17 NCDC [ 27 ] Tornado outbreak of March 21–22, 1952 – This tornado is officially rated F4 in tornado databases; however, the National Climatic Data Center lists this as an F5 event in a technical report listing all known F5 tornadoes.

[ 27 ] The only possible F5 damage was to a concrete block structure that may or may not have been steel-reinforced. It originally was the first officially ranked F5 tornado in the United States, but was later downgraded to F4.

[ 92 ] Jun 9 1953 United States Massachusetts Petersham , Barre , Rutland , Holden , Worcester , Shrewsbury , Westborough , Southborough 94 Grazulis 1953 Worcester tornado – Many strong structures with numerous interior walls were leveled, and entire blocks of homes were swept cleanly away. The large, brick Assumption College sustained severe damage, and its upper stories were completely destroyed. A large, multi-ton storage tank was carried over a road, and trees along the path were debarked as well. Debris from this tornado was found in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1993 Grazulis noted that an F5 rating was "probably appropriate," and in a later publication of his, in 2001, the tornado was posthumously rated F5, based on newly available photographs of the "immense" destruction, which indicated that the tornado merited an F5 rating and "should" have been rated as such in 1975, but was instead rated F4 at that time. Even after an unprecedented reassessment of damages in 2005, a panel of experts assembled by the National Weather Service determined that anchoring techniques for the homes that were swept away or had completely vanished could not be determined. Without a proper engineering qualification, it would be nearly impossible to determine with 100% accuracy which damage was F5 and which was F4, as appearances would be similar. As a result, the panel decided that the rating would remain a high-end F4.

[ 55 ] [ 129 ] May 19 1960 United States Kansas Wamego , St. Marys 0 Grazulis Two farms were swept away. This tornado was rated F5 by Grazulis.

[ 130 ] May 30 1961 United States Nebraska Custer County , Valley County 0 NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis All buildings and machinery were swept away from a farm. Widely accepted as an F5 tornado, including within a NCDC technical report; [ 36 ] however, it is listed as an F4 in the official databases.

[ 131 ] Apr 11 1965 United States Indiana Dunlap 36 NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak – This was the second violent tornado to strike Dunlap within 90 minutes. A well-built truck stop was leveled and many permanent homes were swept away in two subdivisions.

[ 132 ] Apr 11 1965 United States Indiana Lebanon , Sheridan 28 NCDC [ 36 ] 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak – Farms were obliterated and vehicles were thrown up 100 yd (91 m).

[ 133 ] Apr 11 1965 United States Ohio Pittsfield Township , Strongsville 18 NCDC , [ 36 ] Grazulis 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak – Homes were cleanly swept away in Strongsville and Pittsfield, and Pittsfield was completely destroyed. Only a concrete war monument remained standing in Pittsfield, where homes "vanished." [ 134 ] May 8 1965 United States Nebraska Wolbach , Primrose 4 NCDC , [ 46 ] Grazulis Early May 1965 tornado outbreak – Homes and businesses were leveled and swept away, along with mature trees that were reduced to pulpy "matchsticks". Cars were moved 400–440 yd (0.23–0.25 mi), and the body of a truck was tossed and rolled 2 mi (3.2 km). Grazulis listed this tornado as an F5.

[ 135 ] Apr 27 1971 United States Kentucky Gosser Ridge 2 NCDC [ 46 ] 1971 Gosser Ridge tornado – Most buildings on a farm were swept away. The tornado is listed as a "questionable" F5 in the NCDC Tech Report, [ 46 ] and is rated an F4 according to Grazulis and official records.

[ 136 ] Mar 31 1973 United States South Carolina Calhoun Falls , Abbeville 7 NCDC , Fujita Over 100 homes were affected. 30 people were injured. This tornado was initially rated F5 by Ted Fujita, though it was later downgraded to F4.

[ 137 ] Apr 3 1974 United States Tennessee Lincoln County , Franklin County , Coffee County 11 NWS , NWA 1974 Super Outbreak – This intense tornado caused unverifiable F5 damage when it leveled and swept away several "well-constructed homes" in Franklin County.

[ 136 ] Destroyed roughly 46 homes and 90 barns in just that county alone. Developed from the same thunderstorm that produced the first F5 Tanner tornado.

[ 136 ] Previously rated F5 by NWS, but later downgraded to F4.

[ 92 ] Jun 9 1984 Soviet Union ( Russia ) Ivanovo Oblast Ivanovo , Lunevo 69 TORRO , ESSL 1984 Soviet Union tornado outbreak – An extremely intense multiple-vortex tornado [ 138 ] overturned a crane and "tied him into knot", threw a multi-ton water tank over 200 m (660 ft), uprooted and threw trees long distances, [ 139 ] and obliterated a reinforced concrete building.

[ 140 ] The tornado was exceptionally long-lived, remaining on the ground for roughly 100 mi (160 km) over the course of two hours. At least 69 fatalities were confirmed, though the actual toll was likely higher. This tornado was originally rated as an F5, but was downgraded to an F4 in 2018.

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] Jun 8 1995 United States Texas McLean , Kellerville 0 VORTEX Tornado outbreak of June 8, 1995 - Project VORTEX assessed this tornado to be an F5. Intense pavement and ground scouring occurred, with only bare soil left in some areas.

[ 143 ] Jun 8 1995 United States Texas Allison 0 NWS , VORTEX Tornado outbreak of June 8, 1995 - A National Weather Service damage survey was not conducted due in part to the extensive damage and injuries from another tornado in Pampa, Texas . Four homes were destroyed and more than 800 head of livestock were killed. An NCDC report states that "all sighting reports would place this as an F5 tornado" with storm spotters calling it "one of the biggest and meanest appearing tornadoes they had ever seen". However, this tornado hit few man-made structures and a significant amount of time elapsed before damage could be examined, so it could not be rated higher than F4.

[ 144 ] Apr 16 1998 United States Tennessee Hardin County , Wayne County 3 NWS Tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998 – Originally considered part of a very long-tracked F5 tornado but was later determined to have been the first in a series of three separate, violent tornadoes. Multiple homes were reduced to their foundations. Although officially rated an F4, a re-analysis conducted in 2013 by the NWS Office in Nashville noted that the damage in Wayne County may warrant EF5; however, no tornadoes are rated using the enhanced scale that occurred prior to February 2007.

[ 91 ] Apr 28 2002 United States Maryland La Plata 3 NWS 2002 La Plata tornado — Initially rated F5 by the National Weather Service, but was downgraded in a secondary damage survey conducted by Timothy Marshall . This preliminary F5 rating, partly due to damage to a brick building in downtown La Plata, was lowered to F4, after the damage assessment team determined some of the damage was likely due to flying debris from a lumber company nearby. Damage to houses, initially rated F5, were lowered when an engineering survey determined these homes were not properly anchored, causing them to be swept off their foundations by lesser winds.

[ 145 ] Apr 27 2011 United States Alabama Tuscaloosa , Holt , Hueytown , Concord , Pleasant Grove , McDonald Chapel , Birmingham , Fultondale 64 NWS , Murayama, Velev, Zlateva 2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado – Officially rated high-end EF4, though the final rating was a source of controversy, and one survey team rated some of the damage as EF5. Many homes, a large section of an apartment building, and a clubhouse were swept away, though these structures were either poorly anchored, lacked interior walls, or surrounded by contextual damage not consistent with an EF5 tornado. A manhole cover was removed from a drain and thrown into a ravine near the clubhouse. A 34-ton (68,000 lb; 31,000 kg) railroad trestle support structure was thrown 100 ft (30 m) up a hill, and a 35.8-ton (71,600 lb; 32,500 kg) coal car was thrown 391 ft (119 m) through the air.

[ 96 ] [ 110 ] In 2019, Yuko Murayama, Dimiter Velev & Plamena Zlateva edited a book of revised academically peer-reviewed papers, in which they directly rated the Tuscaloosa tornado an EF5.

[ 146 ] May 24 2011 United States Oklahoma Bradley , Washington , Goldsby 0 Ortega, Murayama, Velev, Zlateva Tornado outbreak sequence of May 21–26, 2011 — Officially rated high-end EF4 with winds up to 200 mph (320 km/h), this tornado leveled or completely swept away multiple well-built structures. Vehicles were thrown long distances and mangled almost beyond recognition. The National Weather Service noted the structures destroyed were "falling just short of the damage indicator for an EF5." Kiel Ortega, a National Weather Service damage surveyor discussed with another surveyor saying, "some people believe it should have been rated EF5". In 2019, Yuko Murayama, Dimiter Velev & Plamena Zlateva edited a book of revised academically peer-reviewed papers, in which they directly rated the Washington—Goldsby tornado an EF5.

[ 147 ] May 31 2013 United States Oklahoma El Reno 8 NWS , Murayama, Velev, Zlateva 2013 El Reno tornado — Originally rated as an EF5, which is based on mobile Doppler Weather Radar data of picking up winds of 302 mph (486 km/h).

[ 121 ] However, the lack of available damage resulted into rating downgrading from EF5 to an EF3. This tornado holds the record for the widest tornado ever recorded at 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide.

[ 148 ] In 2019, Yuko Murayama, Dimiter Velev & Plamena Zlateva edited a book of revised academically peer-reviewed papers, in which they directly rated the El Reno tornado an EF5.

[ 146 ] This was reaffirmed in March 2024 by scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and University of Oklahoma which stated winds between 115–150 m/s (260–340 mph; 410–540 km/h) was measured less than 100 metres (110 yd) off the ground.

Some victims were mutilated, dismembered or stripped of their clothes.

[ 149 ] May 18 1951 United States Texas Olney 2 Grazulis Many homes in town were destroyed, some of which were swept away with very little debris left. Grazulis called this tornado a "possible" F5.

[ 150 ] Sep 26 1951 United States Wisconsin Waupaca 6 Grazulis This tornado obliterated a trio of farmsteads. It was mentioned as a probable F5 by Grazulis.

[ 151 ] May 22 1952 United States Kansas Linwood , Edwardsville 0 Grazulis Tornado outbreak of May 21–24, 1952 – The home of a bank president was leveled. Grazulis considered the tornado to be "possibly F5."

[ 157 ] Jun 10 1958 United States Kansas El Dorado 15 Grazulis Reports indicated possible F5-level damage to homes. A car was thrown 100 yd (91 m), but damage photographs were inconclusive as to whether F5 structural damage occurred. Nevertheless, the tornado was considered to be a probable F5 by Grazulis.

[ 130 ] Jun 6 1963 United States South Dakota Swett , Patricia 0 Grazulis A church and a home literally vanished. Grazulis considered the tornado to be "possibly" F5, but it listed as only F3 in the official database.

[ 161 ] May 31 1985 United States Pennsylvania Parker Dam State Park , Moshannon State Forest 0 NWS 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak – This tornado may have been capable of producing F5 damage over rural areas.

[ 162 ] Jul 31 1987 Canada Alberta Edmonton 27 ECCC Edmonton tornado – Heavy trailers and oil tanks were tossed, and large factories were leveled. If confirmed by Environment Canada, this would make it the earliest such tornado since records have been kept, next to the 2007 Elie tornado .

[ 163 ] Jan 7 1989 United States Illinois Allendale 0 Grazulis This tornado was considered by Grazulis to be a more plausible candidate for an F5 rating than the "questionable" Oakfield tornado in 1996.

[ 22 ] Apr 26 1991 United States Kansas Arkansas City , Hackney , Winfield , Tisdale 1 Grazulis 1991 Andover tornado outbreak – According to an informal survey conducted by a group of storm chasers, one home was so obliterated that the National Weather Service survey likely missed it.

[ 22 ] Nov 29 1992 Australia Queensland Bucca 0 Callaghan Bucca tornado — One of the most violent tornadoes ever to have occurred in Australia and was the first Australian tornado to be officially rated F4. The tornado flattened some houses to the ground, trees were snapped and stones were embedded into the trunks. A refrigerator was blown away and never found and a 3-ton truck was thrown 300 m (330 yd). Jeff Callaghan, a retired senior severe weather forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology conducted a case study on this tornado and said it "was rated a F4 or possibly an F5".

[ 164 ] Jun 8 1995 United States Texas Pampa 0 Grazulis This tornado would have likely produced F5 damage had it struck residential areas. Grazulis considered the tornado a candidate for an F6 rating based on photogrammetric video analysis.

[ 165 ] May 11 1999 United States Texas Loyal Valley 1 Flores, Hecke 1999 Loyal Valley tornado — Officially rated high-end F4, though one survey revealed potential F5 damage.

[ 166 ] Two homes were completely swept away, with debris scattered over great distances. Large pieces of a pickup truck were found 3 ⁄ 4 mi (1.2 km) from the residence where it originated, and a 720-foot (220 m) stretch of pavement was scoured from a road. Ground scouring occurred, and numerous mesquite trees were completely denuded and debarked.

[ 167 ] A reporter who also witnessed the destruction at Jarrell, Eddie Flores, said: "I hadn't seen anything like that. I couldn't believe what it did to animals. This was wiped clean, too, but the cattle - their hides had been ripped right off of them. Some of them were missing heads, and some were caught up and entwined in barbed wire". Had this tornado touched down in an urban area, the devastation likely would have rivaled that from Oklahoma City or the storm that leveled a subdivision in Jarrell in 1997, - stated meteorologist Bill Hecke.

[ 168 ] May 12 2004 United States Kansas Harper 0 Haynes A well-built, two-story farmhouse was completely swept away with debris being very finely granulated. Trees and shrubs were completely debarked, and cars were torn apart. Chance Haynes from the NWS in Wichita, Kansas rated this tornado as F4 for its very slow movement, but later express regret over the conservative rating.

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] May 24 2011 United States Oklahoma Chickasha , Blanchard , Newcastle 1 NWS , Murayama, Velev, Zlateva 2011 Chickasha–Blanchard tornado – Officially rated a high-end EF4; however, the survey conducted by NWS Norman mentions this tornado as being a "plausible EF5". Well-built homes with anchor bolts were swept away, pavement was scoured from roads and driveways, and vehicles were thrown up to 600 yd (550 m) away, some of which were torn into multiple pieces or stripped down to their frames. Trees were reduced to completely debarked stumps, and severe ground scouring occurred, with all grass and several inches of topsoil removed in some areas. A reinforced concrete dome home was severely damaged and cracked.

[ 96 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] In 2019, Yuko Murayama, Dimiter Velev & Plamena Zlateva edited a book of revised academically peer-reviewed papers, in which they directly rated the Chickasha tornado an EF5.

[ 146 ] Mar 2 2012 United States Indiana , Kentucky Fredericksburg , Henryville , Bedford 11 NWS 2012 Southern Indiana tornado — A violent stovepipe tornado (often referred to as the "Henryville Tornado") that carved a 49 mi (79 km) path of damage from Fredericksburg, Indiana to the Bedford, Kentucky area. This tornado was officially rated a low-end EF4. In 2022, the National Weather Service of Louisville referred to a possible EF5 damage location at a demolished house, where a pickup truck was blown away and never found and a backhoe was deposited into the basement of the house.

[ 173 ] Apr 27 2014 United States Arkansas Mayflower , Vilonia 16 NWS , Marshall , Grazulis , Murayama, Velev, Zlateva 2014 Mayflower–Vilonia tornado – Officially rated high-end EF4, though the rating was a major source of controversy, and meteorologist/civil engineer Timothy P. Marshall noted that the rating assigned was "lower-bound" and "the possibility that EF5 winds could have occurred" despite the structural flaws responsible for the EF4 rating.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] Numerous homes were swept completely away with only bare slabs left, including one that was well-bolted to its foundation, and extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred. Trees were completely debarked and denuded, shrubs were shredded and debarked, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and stripped down to their frames. In one instance, a well-built house was swept away, but an EF5 rating was not assigned as it was just one house and it had been struck by debris from other buildings.

[ 176 ] A large 30,000-pound (14,000 kg) metal fertilizer tank was found approximately 3 ⁄ 4 mi (1.2 km) away from where it originated.

[ 174 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Extensive ground scouring occurred as well.

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] In 2019, Yuko Murayama, Dimiter Velev & Plamena Zlateva edited a book of revised academically peer-reviewed papers, in which they directly rated the Mayflower—Vilonia tornado an EF5.

[ 146 ] Mar 24 2023 United States Mississippi Rolling Fork , Silver City 17 NWS , NSSL , OU 2023 Rolling Fork–Silver City tornado – A violent tornado that damaged or destroyed over 78% Rolling Fork and over 96% of Silver City, with at least 300 homes sustaining damage in Rolling Fork. Following the tornado, Logan Poole, a meteorologist and damage surveyor with the National Weather Service in Jackson, Mississippi gave an interview regarding the tornado and why it was rated EF4 rather than EF5. In the interview, Poole stated, "The Green Apple Florist, essentially a single family home that was modified to built to be a floral shop and it is slabbed to the ground and swept clean. Why not F5? Why not EF5? And two things really stuck out to us from the consensus on why not EF5. One was this building, even though it was extremely, extremely destroyed, I mean on its own, taken out of context, I think most people would agree this would be representative of an EF5 tornado; the damage to that building...If there had even been two of these side-by-side that had suffered the same fate, then maybe we could have had more confidence on that, but we didn't...But it was, to that point that we were very very close and this is probably about as close as you'll get across that threshold, without making it".

[ 181 ] In 2025, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the University of Oklahoma ’s School of Meteorology published a paper to the American Meteorological Society , where they stated the Rolling Fork tornado was an "EF5 candidate" at the floral shop.

[ 182 ] Possible F5/EF5/IF5 intensity [ edit ] This is an incomplete list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by participating in discussions about tornadoes for this list.

This list includes tornadoes believed or confirmed to have been at F5 or EF5 intensity. These indications can come from the United States government, Doppler on Wheels , tornado experts (i.e.

Thomas P. Grazulis , Ted Fujita ), or meteorological research institutions (i.e.

European Severe Storms Laboratory ).

1930 1970 1990 2010 2020 Tornadoes officially rated below F5/EF5/T10 or equivalent but which may have been F5/EF5/T10+ intensity Day Year Country Sub­division Location Fata­lities Rated by Jul 20 1931 Poland Lublin Voivodeship Lublin 6 ESSL This tornado is officially rated F4; however, the Polish Weather Service estimated winds at 246 to 324 mph (396 to 521 km/h), potentially ranking it as an F5.

[ 142 ] Apr 2 1957 United States Texas Dallas 10 Segner Tornado outbreak sequence of April 2–5, 1957 — E. Segner estimated 302 mph (486 km/h), which is based on obliteration of a large billboard.

[ 183 ] Aug 29 1969 China Hebei , Tianjin Bazhou , Tianjin 146 Chen Trees were completely debarked, and numerous reinforced concrete factories were leveled. The village of Chuhegang was completely destroyed. This tornado was rated >F3, with indications of possible F4 or F5 intensity.

[ 184 ] [ 185 ] May 24 1973 United States Oklahoma Union City 2 NSSL A carport was carried intact to the north while the rest of the house was cleanly swept away. A barn was destroyed and trees still standing were denuded, a flatbed truck rolled over, a car was stripped down to its frame. A small frame house was also completely swept away.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] May 27 1973 United States Alabama Greensboro , Brent , Centreville , Montevallo , Columbiana , Wilsonville , Childersburg 7 NWS , Brasher 1973 Central Alabama tornado — John Brasher, a reporter and photographer for the Centreville Press, stated that as the tornado struck Main Street in Brent, “the tornado's already violent F4 winds would ramp up to, and possibly beyond, the threshold of F5 strength”.

[ 188 ] The National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, noted the rating for this tornado was F4 on the Fujita scale, which has a wind speed range of 207 to 260 miles per hour (333 to 418 km/h). However, the wind speeds assigned to this tornado was between 210 and 261 miles per hour (338 and 420 km/h), indicating the potential that this tornado had winds up to F5 intensity.

[ 189 ] Apr 26 1991 United States Oklahoma Red Rock 0 Bluestein , DOW , Lyza , Flournoy, Alford 1991 Andover tornado outbreak – Mobile Doppler weather radar used by storm chasers indicated wind speeds in the range of the F5 threshold, with winds up to 268 mph (431 km/h). Pavement and ground scouring occurred, and a large oil rig was toppled. The tornado is officially rated F4, but is mentioned by some sources as an F5 or possible F5.

[ 190 ] This was reaffirmed in March 2024 by scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and University of Oklahoma which stated 120–125 metres per second (270–280 mph; 430–450 km/h) was measured between 150–190 metres (160–210 yd) off the ground.

[ 18 ] May 30 1998 United States South Dakota Spencer 6 Wurman , DOW , Lyza , Flournoy, Alford Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho – DOW recorded maximum wind speeds at 264 mph (425 km/h) at 160 ft (49 m) above ground level, which the NWS classified at almost ground level. Such wind speeds would fall well into the EF5 range on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, though the maximum damage intensity observed in the town of Spencer was F4. The town's water tower was toppled to the ground, an apartment building was leveled, and many homes were completely destroyed, a few of which were swept away.

[ 191 ] This was reaffirmed in 2024 after Anthony W. Lyza, Matthew D. Flournoy, and A. Addison Alford, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory , Storm Prediction Center , CIWRO , and the University of Oklahoma 's School of Meteorology, published a paper stating the radar "showed a broad swath" of wind speeds in the F4 to minimal F5 range. They went on to say, "However, no F5/EF5 damage was observed, despite winds observed well into the EF5 range".

[ 18 ] May 3 1999 United States Oklahoma Mulhall 2 Lyza, Flournoy, Alford 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak – In March 2024, Anthony W. Lyza, Matthew D. Flournoy, and A. Addison Alford, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory , Storm Prediction Center , CIWRO , and the University of Oklahoma 's School of Meteorology, published a paper stating 115 metres per second (260 mph; 410 km/h) was measured in the tornado only 30 metres (33 yd) off the ground.

[ 18 ] May 28 2013 United States Kansas Bennington 0 The Weather Channel , DOW , Wurman, Kosiba, Robinson, Marshall Tornado outbreak of May 26–31, 2013 – Officially rated EF3. However, a DOW instrument estimated winds inside the tornado at 247 mph (398 km/h), 300 ft (91 m) above the ground.

[ 192 ] According to the Joshua Wurman, Karen Kosiba, Paul Robinson, and Tim Marshall in their research, the DOW windspeed measurements were found to be 264 mph (425 km/h), 153 ft (47 m) above the ground.

[ 193 ] May 9 2016 United States Oklahoma Sulphur 0 NWS , Marshall Tornado outbreak of May 7–10, 2016 - This tornado was recorded to have attained 218 mph winds in an open field by RaXPol mobile radar. This would have been sufficient to produce EF5 damage had the tornado impacted any substantial structures during this time period.

[ 194 ] Several homes were swept away at high-end EF3 strength, and many other outbuildings were destroyed as well. A large metal storage garage was swept away, with vehicles stored inside being thrown up to 280 yards away. An 18-year old and his cousin were able to survive the tornado by taking shelter in an interior bathroom, which was the only standing section of the house after the tornado had impacted it.

[ 195 ] May 24 2016 United States Kansas Dodge City 0 NCEI , CSWR , DOW Tornado outbreak sequence of May 22–26, 2016 – During the initial stages of development, there was DOW data on this tornado. It intensified from 40 metres per second (89 mph; 140 km/h) to 90 metres per second (201 mph; 320 km/h) in a span of 21 seconds that lasted less than a minute at those velocities. This would have been enough to produce EF5 damage briefly, based on those velocities. As the tornado moved north into a housing addition just west of Dodge City, it showed multiple vortex characteristics and did EF2 damage. One person was seriously hurt in a home that was heavily damaged.

[ 196 ] May 25 2016 United States Kansas Solomon , Abilene , Chapman 0 NWS Tornado outbreak sequence of May 22–26, 2016 – An anchor-bolted brick farm home was swept away and was ripped from its foundation so violently that part of the foundation was severely cracked, though the area surrounding the home was not swept completely clean. Vehicles and large pieces of farm machinery were thrown and mangled beyond recognition, and a section of metal railroad track was bent horizontally by the tornado. Officially rated EF4 with winds of 180 mph (290 km/h), though NWS Topeka damage surveyors later noted that based on the severity of the damage in rural areas, it "could have very well been" rated EF5 had it struck Chapman directly.

[ 197 ] [ 176 ] [ 198 ] Jun 18 2017 Russia Kurgan Oblast Maloye Pes'yanovo 0 Chernokulsky, Shikhov, Bykov, Azhigov The tornado was strong enough to be rated IF4 on the International Fujita scale and F4 on the Fujita scale .

[ 199 ] Two log homes were leveled to the ground. Researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences and Perm State University published a paper in the academically peer-reviewed journal Atmosphere , providing an assessment of this tornado in which they state that the tornado possessed EF5 intensity, due to it blowing down or snapping 100% of the trees in a 100-by-100-meter (110 yd) forested area.

[ 200 ] [ 201 ] Aug 3 2018 Canada Manitoba Alonsa , Silver Ridge 1 Northern Tornadoes Project Tornadoes of 2018 — Rated EF4, with maximum windspeeds in the EF5 range.

[ 202 ] A later study, also by the Northern Tornadoes Project, determined that the tornado lofted haybales into Lake Manitoba , which they estimated required winds between 87.9 m/s (197 mph) and 127 m/s (280 mph).

[ 203 ] Apr 13 2019 United States Mississippi Greenwood Springs 0 Lyza , Goudeau, Knupp Tornado outbreak of April 13–15, 2019 — This tornado was officially rated EF2, based on an incomplete damage survey from the National Weather Service, where 8.7 miles (14 km) of the tornado's track was unable to be officially surveyed. A NEXRAD radar only 980 yards (900 m) away from the tornado documented radial velocities of up to 182 mph (293 km/h). A research team, from the University of Oklahoma , National Severe Storms Laboratory , and University of Alabama in Huntsville was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to investigate the unsurveyed portion of the tornado track. In their survey, published in Monthly Weather Review , they note that the tornado "produced forest devastation and electrical infrastructure damage up to at least EF4 intensity" and conclude by writing that "the Greenwood Springs event was a violent tornado, potentially even EF5 intensity." [ 204 ] Aug 7 2020 Canada Manitoba Scarth 2 Northern Tornadoes Project Tornadoes of 2020 — A photogenic tornado, rated EF3, was determined to have likely lofted two vehicles over 1 meter into the air and between 30 and 100 meters laterally. Researchers with the Northern Tornadoes Project found a median wind speed of 110 m/s (250 mph) would be required to achieve this, well above the criteria for EF5 intensity.

[ 203 ] Dec 10 2021 United States Tennessee , Kentucky Woodland Mills , Cayce , Mayfield , Princeton , Dawson Springs , Bremen , McDaniels 57 Marshall , Wienhoff, Smith, Wielgos 2021 Western Kentucky tornado — A long-tracked wedge spawned by the Quad-State supercell, that damaged, destroyed, or obliterated thousands of structures along a path of 165.6 mi (266.5 km) while moving at 60 mph (97 km/h). In 2022, Timothy Marshall, a meteorologist, and structural and forensic engineer , Christine L. Wielgos, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Paducah, & Brian E. Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Omaha, published a damage survey of portions of the tornado's track, particularly through Mayfield and Dawson Springs. At the end of the report, they said, "the tornado damage rating might have been higher had more wind resistant structures been encountered. Also, the fast forward speed of the tornado had little 'dwell' time of strong winds over a building and thus, the damage likely would have been more severe if the tornado were slower".

[ 205 ] July 1 2023 Canada Alberta Didsbury 0 Northern Tornadoes Project Tornadoes of 2023 — This EF4 tornado moved a combine harvester 80 to 100 meters from its original position. Researchers with the Northern Tornadoes Project determined the harvester was likely lofted roughly 1.26 meters into the air, with median estimated winds of 118 m/s (260 mph), above EF5 criteria.

[ 203 ] June 5 2025 United States Texas Morton 0 Waugh , NSSL Tornadoes of 2025 — This tornado was rated EF2 by the National Weather Service office in Lubbock, Texas (NWS Lubbock). In July 2025, Sean Waugh released that the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Hail Camera truck, positioned 200 metres (220 yd) away from the tornado, captured a 1.6 inches (4.1 cm)-diameter hailstone that was "being ejected from the tornado" at speeds up to 202 miles per hour (325 km/h).

[ 206 ] Possible F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes with no official rating [ edit ] This is an incomplete list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by participating in discussions about tornadoes for this list.

Many other tornadoes have never been formally rated by an official government source but have nonetheless been described as F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent, often by independent studies. Most of these tornadoes occurred prior to 1950, before tornadoes were rated according to standardized damage assessments, and their unofficial classifications as F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent have been made in retrospect, largely on the basis of photographic analysis and eyewitness accounts. A few, such as the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, are widely accepted as F5/EF5/T10+ tornadoes, despite not being rated as such in official records.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by participating in discussions about tornadoes for this list.

Theodore Fujita in the early 1970s. Prior to the advent of the scale in 1971, tornadoes in the United States were officially unrated.

[ 2 ] The Fujita scale has been superseded by the Enhanced Fujita scale in the U.S. since February 1, 2007; [ 3 ] Canada used the old scale until April 1, 2013; [ 4 ] nations elsewhere, like the United Kingdom, apply other classifications such as the TORRO scale .

[ 5 ] ^ Historically, the number of tornadoes globally and in the United States was and is likely underrepresented: research by Grazulis on annual tornado activity suggests that, as of 2001, only 53% of yearly U.S. tornadoes were officially recorded. Documentation of tornadoes outside the United States was historically less exhaustive, owing to the lack of monitors in many nations and, in some cases, to internal political controls on public information.

[ 6 ] Most countries only recorded tornadoes that produced severe damage or loss of life.

[ 7 ] Significant low biases in U.S. tornado counts likely occurred through the early 1990s, when advanced NEXRAD was first installed and the National Weather Service began comprehensively verifying tornado occurrences.

[ 8 ] ^ The winds estimated by the Fujita scale are estimated values and have not been verified scientifically.

The authors sent a detailed letter to the SPC recommending the two tornadoes from 1974, and the 1952 tornado mentioned above, be downgraded to F4. The SPC agreed to all three of these changes. The SPC database now reflects the conclusions of Professor Fujita's map of 1974, and Grazulis 1952 tornado report (1993). ... The authors suggested that the three former F5 tornadoes in Tennessee should be reclassified as F4. These changes have been adopted, making the 16 April 1998 Lawrence County tornado the only documented F5 in the history of Tennessee.
