[ 1 ] United States [ edit ] See also: Upland hunting As of 2013 the population of upland game birds such as pheasants had been falling in agricultural states such as Iowa where increased commodity prices for crops such as corn had resulted in reductions in game habitat in acreage set aside in the Conservation Reserve Program. A significant reduction in the number of hunters over the previous 20 years was also reported.

[ 2 ] State laws [ edit ] At least ten states have passed laws wherein there is a definition of "upland game" giving a list of species.

[ 3 ] These lists are not at all the same, and some of them contain non-avian species. These species may be listed by common name instead of by scientific name , which can make it difficult to determine from the laws alone what species they intend to protect. The following species appear on one or more state lists of "upland game."
