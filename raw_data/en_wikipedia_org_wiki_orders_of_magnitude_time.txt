In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a "second" or "year". In other cases, the quantity name implies the base unit , like "century". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years.

Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years. Therefore, it is said "a million years" instead of "a megayear". Clock time and calendar time have duodecimal or sexagesimal orders of magnitude rather than decimal, e.g., a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.

The smallest meaningful increment of time is the Planck time ―the time light takes to traverse the Planck distance , many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.

[ 1 ] The largest realized amount of time, based on known scientific data, is the age of the universe , about 13.8 billion years—the time since the Big Bang as measured in the cosmic microwave background rest frame .

[ 2 ] Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude. Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10 −30 to 10 30 , 60 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second.

Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science, although this depends on the author. For everyday use and most other scientific contexts, the common units of minutes, hours (3 600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months, and years are significantly variable units whose lengths depend on the choice of calendar and are often not regular even with a calendar, e.g., leap years versus regular years in the Gregorian calendar . This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI , since it is not clear which version is being used.

Because of this, the table below does not include weeks, months, and years. Instead, the table uses the annum or astronomical Julian year (365.25 days of 86 400 seconds), denoted with the symbol a. Its definition is based on the average length of a year according to the Julian calendar , which has one leap year every four years. According to the geological science convention, this is used to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it; at least up to giga-annum or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ( short scale : one billion years, long scale : one milliard years).

62.064 ks : one day on Uranus.

86.399 ks (23 h 59 min 59 s): The length of one day with a removed leap second on UTC time scale. Such has not yet occurred.

86.4 ks (24 h): The length of one day of Earth by standard. More exactly, the mean solar day is 86.400 002 ks due to tidal braking , and increasing at the rate of approximately 2 ms/century; to correct for this time standards like UTC use leap seconds with the interval described as "a day" on them being most often 86.4 ks exactly by definition but occasionally one second more or less so that every day contains a whole number of seconds while preserving alignment with astronomical time. The hour hand of an analogue clock will typically cycle twice around the dial in this period as most analogue clocks are 12-hour , less common are analogue 24-hour clocks in which it cycles around once.

86.401 ks (24 h 0 min 1 s): One day with an added leap second on UTC time scale. While this is strictly 24 hours and 1 second in conventional units, a digital clock of suitable capability level will most often display the leap second as 23:59:60 and not 24:00:00 before rolling over to 00:00:00 the next day, as though the last "minute" of the day was crammed with 61 seconds and not 60, and similarly the last "hour" was crammed with 3,601 seconds instead of 3,600.

7.9 Ps (250 Ma): The approximate time since the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the actually largest known mass extinction in Earth history which wiped out 95% of all extant species and believed to have been caused by the consequences of massive long-term volcanic eruptions in the area of the Siberian Traps .

+1 Ga : The estimated remaining habitable lifetime of Earth, according to some models. At this point in time the stellar evolution of the Sun will have increased its luminosity to the point that enough energy will be reaching the Earth to cause the evaporation of the oceans and their loss into space (due to the UV flux from the Sun at the top of the atmosphere dissociating the molecules), making it impossible for any life to continue.

136 Ps (4.32 Ga): The length of the legendary unit Kalpa in Hindu mythology , or one day (but not including the following night) of the life of Brahma .

A much simplified way of thinking about this time is that in a model in which history repeats itself arbitrarily many times due to properties of statistical mechanics , this is the time scale when it will first be somewhat similar (for a reasonable choice of "similar") to its current state again.
