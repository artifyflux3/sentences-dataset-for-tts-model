Find sources: "Louis François Cauchy" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2017 ) Louis François Cauchy (27 May 1760 – 28 December 1848) was a senior French government official and the father of the mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy .

Born on 27 May 1760 in Rouen into an upper-middle-class family, Cauchy successfully studied at the Collège de Lisieux in Paris .  In 1771 he received the top prize in the concours général .

He became a lawyer at the Parlement of Normandy , and in 1783 he joined the office of the Intendant Général of Rouen, Louis Thiroux de Crosne . When de Crosne took charge of the Paris police , Cauchy followed him as his senior aide. In October 1787 he married Marie-Madeleine Desestre, who came from a family of Parisian officers, and the couple had four children, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792–1857), Eugène François Cauchy (1802–1877) and a daughter.

[ 1 ] On the year of Augustin-Louis Cauchy's birth, Louis François moved his entire family to the small village of Arcueil .

[ 1 ] In April 1794, de Crosne was executed by the French revolutionary government . Cauchy then had no official role until the country came under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte .

In 1800, he was elected Keeper of the Seals ( Garde des Sceaux ) in the French Senate, and also became secretary and archivist of the Chamber of Peers . He was ennobled by King Charles X in 1825.

He died in Arcueil in 1848.
