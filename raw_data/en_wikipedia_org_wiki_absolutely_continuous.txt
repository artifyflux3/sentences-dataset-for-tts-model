The notion of absolute continuity allows one to obtain generalizations of the relationship between the two central operations of calculus — differentiation and integration . This relationship is commonly characterized (by the fundamental theorem of calculus ) in the framework of Riemann integration , but with absolute continuity it may be formulated in terms of Lebesgue integration . For real-valued functions on the real line , two interrelated notions appear: absolute continuity of functions and absolute continuity of measures . These two notions are generalized in different directions. The usual derivative of a function is related to the Radon–Nikodym derivative , or density , of a measure. We have the following chains of inclusions for functions over a compact subset of the real line: absolutely continuous ⊆ uniformly continuous = {\displaystyle =} continuous and, for a compact interval, continuously differentiable ⊆ Lipschitz continuous ⊆ absolutely continuous ⊆ bounded variation ⊆ differentiable almost everywhere .

Absolute continuity of functions [ edit ] A continuous function fails to be absolutely continuous if it fails to be uniformly continuous , which can happen if the domain of the function is not compact – examples are tan( x ) over [0, π /2) , x 2 over the entire real line, and sin(1/ x ) over (0, 1]. But a continuous function f can fail to be absolutely continuous even on a compact interval. It may not be "differentiable almost everywhere" (like the Weierstrass function , which is not differentiable anywhere). Or it may be differentiable almost everywhere and its derivative f ′ may be Lebesgue integrable , but the integral of f ′ differs from the increment of f (how much f changes over an interval). This happens for example with the Cantor function .

Definition [ edit ] Let I {\displaystyle I} be an interval in the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . A function f : : I → → R {\displaystyle f\colon I\to \mathbb {R} } is absolutely continuous on I {\displaystyle I} if for every positive number ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , there is a positive number δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals ( x k , y k ) {\displaystyle (x_{k},y_{k})} of I {\displaystyle I} with x k < y k {\displaystyle x_{k}<y_{k}} satisfies [ 1 ] ∑ ∑ k = 1 N ( y k − − x k ) < δ δ {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{N}(y_{k}-x_{k})<\delta } then ∑ ∑ k = 1 N | f ( y k ) − − f ( x k ) | < ε ε .

{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{N}|f(y_{k})-f(x_{k})|<\varepsilon .} The collection of all absolutely continuous functions on I {\displaystyle I} is denoted AC ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {AC} (I)} .

Equivalent definitions [ edit ] The following conditions on a real-valued function f on a compact interval [ a , b ] are equivalent: [ 2 ] f is absolutely continuous; f has a derivative f ′ almost everywhere , the derivative is Lebesgue integrable, and f ( x ) = f ( a ) + ∫ ∫ a x f ′ ( t ) d t {\displaystyle f(x)=f(a)+\int _{a}^{x}f'(t)\,dt} for all x on [ a , b ]; there exists a Lebesgue integrable function g on [ a , b ] such that f ( x ) = f ( a ) + ∫ ∫ a x g ( t ) d t {\displaystyle f(x)=f(a)+\int _{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt} for all x in [ a , b ].

If these equivalent conditions are satisfied, then necessarily any function g as in condition 3. satisfies g = f ′ almost everywhere.

Equivalence between (1) and (3) is known as the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integral calculus , due to Lebesgue .

[ 3 ] For an equivalent definition in terms of measures see the section Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity .

Properties [ edit ] The sum and difference of two absolutely continuous functions are also absolutely continuous. If the two functions are defined on a bounded closed interval, then their product is also absolutely continuous.

[ 4 ] If an absolutely continuous function f is defined on a bounded closed interval and is nowhere zero then 1/f is absolutely continuous.

[ 5 ] Every absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous and, therefore, continuous . Every (globally) Lipschitz-continuous function is absolutely continuous.

[ 6 ] If f : [ a , b ] → R is absolutely continuous, then it is of bounded variation on [ a , b ].

[ 7 ] If f : [ a , b ] → R is absolutely continuous, then it can be written as the difference of two monotonic nondecreasing absolutely continuous functions on [ a , b ].

If f : [ a , b ] → R is absolutely continuous, then it has the Luzin N property (that is, for any N ⊆ ⊆ [ a , b ] {\displaystyle N\subseteq [a,b]} such that λ λ ( N ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (N)=0} , it holds that λ λ ( f ( N ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (f(N))=0} , where λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } stands for the Lebesgue measure on R ).

f : I → R is absolutely continuous if and only if it is continuous, is of bounded variation and has the Luzin N property. This statement is also known as the Banach-Zareckiǐ theorem.

[ 8 ] If f : I → R is absolutely continuous and g : R → R is globally Lipschitz-continuous , then the composition g ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } f is absolutely continuous. Conversely, for every function g that is not globally Lipschitz continuous there exists an absolutely continuous function f such that ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } f is not absolutely continuous.

[ 9 ] Examples [ edit ] The following functions are uniformly continuous but not absolutely continuous: The Cantor function on [0, 1] (it is of bounded variation but not absolutely continuous); The function: f ( x ) = { 0 , if x = 0 x sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / x ) , if x ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}0,&{\text{if }}x=0\\x\sin(1/x),&{\text{if }}x\neq 0\end{cases}}} on a finite interval containing the origin.

The following functions are absolutely continuous but not α-Hölder continuous: The function f ( x ) = x β on [0, c ], for any 0 < β < α < 1 The following functions are absolutely continuous and α-Hölder continuous but not Lipschitz continuous : The function f ( x ) = √ x on [0, c ], for α ≤ 1/2.

Generalizations [ edit ] Let ( X , d ) be a metric space and let I be an interval in the real line R . A function f : I → X is absolutely continuous on I if for every positive number ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , there is a positive number δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals [ x k , y k ] of I satisfies: ∑ ∑ k | y k − − x k | < δ δ {\displaystyle \sum _{k}\left|y_{k}-x_{k}\right|<\delta } then: ∑ ∑ k d ( f ( y k ) , f ( x k ) ) < ε ε .

{\displaystyle \sum _{k}d\left(f(y_{k}),f(x_{k})\right)<\varepsilon .} The collection of all absolutely continuous functions from I into X is denoted AC( I ; X ).

A further generalization is the space AC p ( I ; X ) of curves f : I → X such that: [ 10 ] d ( f ( s ) , f ( t ) ) ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ s t m ( τ τ ) d τ τ for all [ s , t ] ⊆ ⊆ I {\displaystyle d\left(f(s),f(t)\right)\leq \int _{s}^{t}m(\tau )\,d\tau {\text{ for all }}[s,t]\subseteq I} for some m in the L p space L p (I).

Properties of these generalizations [ edit ] Every absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous and, therefore, continuous . Every Lipschitz-continuous function is absolutely continuous.

If f : [ a , b ] → X is absolutely continuous, then it is of bounded variation on [ a , b ].

For f ∈ AC p ( I ; X ), the metric derivative of f exists for λ - almost all times in I , and the metric derivative is the smallest m ∈ L p ( I ; R ) such that: [ 11 ] d ( f ( s ) , f ( t ) ) ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ s t m ( τ τ ) d τ τ for all [ s , t ] ⊆ ⊆ I .

{\displaystyle d\left(f(s),f(t)\right)\leq \int _{s}^{t}m(\tau )\,d\tau {\text{ for all }}[s,t]\subseteq I.} Absolute continuity of measures [ edit ] Definition [ edit ] A measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on Borel subsets of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } if for every λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } -measurable set A , {\displaystyle A,} λ λ ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (A)=0} implies μ μ ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)=0} . Equivalently, μ μ ( A ) > 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)>0} implies λ λ ( A ) > 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (A)>0} . This condition is written as μ μ ≪ ≪ λ λ .

{\displaystyle \mu \ll \lambda .} We say μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is dominated by λ λ .

{\displaystyle \lambda .} In most applications, if a measure on the real line is simply said to be absolutely continuous — without specifying with respect to which other measure it is absolutely continuous — then absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure is meant.

The same principle holds for measures on Borel subsets of R n , n ≥ ≥ 2.

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},n\geq 2.} Equivalent definitions [ edit ] The following conditions on a finite measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on Borel subsets of the real line are equivalent: [ 12 ] μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is absolutely continuous; For every positive number ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } there is a positive number δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} such that μ μ ( A ) < ε ε {\displaystyle \mu (A)<\varepsilon } for all Borel sets A {\displaystyle A} of Lebesgue measure less than δ δ ; {\displaystyle \delta ;} There exists a Lebesgue integrable function g {\displaystyle g} on the real line such that: μ μ ( A ) = ∫ ∫ A g d λ λ {\displaystyle \mu (A)=\int _{A}g\,d\lambda } for all Borel subsets A {\displaystyle A} of the real line.

For an equivalent definition in terms of functions see the section Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity .

Any other function satisfying (3) is equal to g {\displaystyle g} almost everywhere. Such a function is called Radon–Nikodym derivative , or density, of the absolutely continuous measure μ μ .

{\displaystyle \mu .} Equivalence between (1), (2) and (3) holds also in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} for all n = 1 , 2 , 3 , … … .

{\displaystyle n=1,2,3,\ldots .} Thus, the absolutely continuous measures on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} are precisely those that have densities; as a special case, the absolutely continuous probability measures are precisely the ones that have probability density functions .

Generalizations [ edit ] If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are two measures on the same measurable space ( X , A ) , {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}}),} μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } if μ μ ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)=0} for every set A {\displaystyle A} for which ν ν ( A ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \nu (A)=0.} [ 13 ] This is written as " μ μ ≪ ≪ ν ν {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu } ". That is: μ μ ≪ ≪ ν ν if and only if for all A ∈ ∈ A , ( ν ν ( A ) = 0 implies μ μ ( A ) = 0 ) .

{\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu \qquad {\text{ if and only if }}\qquad {\text{ for all }}A\in {\mathcal {A}},\quad (\nu (A)=0\ {\text{ implies }}\ \mu (A)=0).} When μ μ ≪ ≪ ν ν , {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu ,} then ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is said to be dominating μ μ .

{\displaystyle \mu .} Absolute continuity of measures is reflexive and transitive , but is not antisymmetric , so it is a preorder rather than a partial order . Instead, if μ μ ≪ ≪ ν ν {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu } and ν ν ≪ ≪ μ μ , {\displaystyle \nu \ll \mu ,} the measures μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are said to be equivalent .  Thus absolute continuity induces a partial ordering of such equivalence classes .

If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a signed or complex measure , it is said that μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is absolutely continuous with respect to ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } if its variation | μ μ | {\displaystyle |\mu |} satisfies | μ μ | ≪ ≪ ν ν ; {\displaystyle |\mu |\ll \nu ;} equivalently, if every set A {\displaystyle A} for which ν ν ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle \nu (A)=0} is μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } - null .

The Radon–Nikodym theorem [ 14 ] states that if μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is absolutely continuous with respect to ν ν , {\displaystyle \nu ,} and both measures are σ-finite , then μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } has a density, or "Radon-Nikodym derivative", with respect to ν ν , {\displaystyle \nu ,} which means that there exists a ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } -measurable function f {\displaystyle f} taking values in [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ) , {\displaystyle [0,+\infty ),} denoted by f = d μ μ / d ν ν , {\displaystyle f=d\mu /d\nu ,} such that for any ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } -measurable set A {\displaystyle A} we have: μ μ ( A ) = ∫ ∫ A f d ν ν .

{\displaystyle \mu (A)=\int _{A}f\,d\nu .} Singular measures [ edit ] Via Lebesgue's decomposition theorem , [ 15 ] every σ-finite measure can be decomposed into the sum of an absolutely continuous measure and a singular measure with respect to another σ-finite measure. See singular measure for examples of measures that are not absolutely continuous.

Relation between the two notions of absolute continuity [ edit ] A finite measure μ on Borel subsets of the real line is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure if and only if the point function: F ( x ) = μ μ ( ( − − ∞ ∞ , x ] ) {\displaystyle F(x)=\mu ((-\infty ,x])} is an absolutely continuous real function. More generally, a function is locally (meaning on every bounded interval) absolutely continuous if and only if its distributional derivative is a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

If absolute continuity holds then the Radon–Nikodym derivative of μ is equal almost everywhere to the derivative of F .

[ 16 ] More generally, the measure μ is assumed to be locally finite (rather than finite) and F ( x ) is defined as μ ((0, x ]) for x > 0 , 0 for x = 0 , and − μ (( x ,0]) for x < 0 . In this case μ is the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure generated by F .

[ 17 ] The relation between the two notions of absolute continuity still holds.
