Vakil (born February 22, 1970) is a Canadian-American mathematician working in algebraic geometry . He is the current president of the American Mathematical Society .

Education and career [ edit ] Vakil attended high school at Martingrove Collegiate Institute in Etobicoke , Ontario, where he won several mathematical contests and olympiads.

[ 2 ] After earning a BSc and MSc from the University of Toronto in 1992, he completed a PhD in mathematics at Harvard University in 1997 under Joe Harris .

[ 3 ] He has since been an instructor at both Princeton University and MIT .  Since the fall of 2001, he has taught at Stanford University , [ 4 ] becoming a full professor in 2007.

The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry , a mathematical textbook about algebraic geometry by Ravi Vakil, will be published in 2025, although drafts have already been available online ever since he began to write in 2010.

Contributions [ edit ] Vakil is an algebraic geometer and his research work spans over enumerative geometry , topology , Gromov–Witten theory , and classical algebraic geometry. He has solved several old problems in Schubert calculus .  Among other results, he proved that all Schubert problems are enumerative [ 5 ] over the real numbers , a result that resolves an issue mathematicians have worked on for at least two decades.

Awards and honors [ edit ] Vakil has received many awards, including an NSF CAREER Fellowship,  a Sloan Research Fellowship, an American Mathematical Society Centennial Fellowship, a G. de B. Robinson prize for the best paper published (2000) in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics and the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin , [ 6 ] and the André-Aisenstadt Prize from the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques at the Université de Montréal (2005), and the Chauvenet Prize [ 1 ] (2014).

In 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 7 ] Vakil was elected as its president in 2024 and began his two-year term on 1 February 2025.

[ 8 ] Mathematics contests [ edit ] He was a member of the Canadian team in three International Mathematical Olympiads , winning silver, gold (perfect score), and gold in 1986, 1987, and 1988 respectively. He was also the fourth person to be a four-time Putnam Fellow in the history of the contest.  Also, he has been the coordinator of weekly Putnam preparation seminars at Stanford.
