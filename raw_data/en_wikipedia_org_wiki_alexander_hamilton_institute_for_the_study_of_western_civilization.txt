Paquette of Hamilton College led an attempt to create an "Alexander Hamilton Center" on the Hamilton College campus, but it was unsuccessful.

[ 3 ] A faculty vote voiced concern that the proposal to establish this alumni-financed center to study " capitalism , natural law and the role of religion in politics " would have an overt conservative political tendency and would not be subject to sufficient oversight by the school. The college's decision not to proceed drew criticism from conservative commentators, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and the institute was established as an off-campus, independent entity.

[ 6 ] The first director of the institute was federal appeals court judge David Aldrich Nelson .

[ 7 ] Philanthropist Jane Fraser joined the board in the institute's first year.

[ 8 ] Since its founding, it has continued to host numerous speakers and hold events on-campus. It helps to maintain on-campus academic reading clusters and conservative organizations.
