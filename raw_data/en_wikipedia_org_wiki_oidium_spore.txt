: oidia ) is an asexually produced fungal spore that (in contrast to conidia ) is presumed not to constitute the main reproductive preoccupation of the fungus at that time.
The hypha breaks up into component cells/ small pieces and develop into spores. Oidia cannot survive in unfavourable conditions.
