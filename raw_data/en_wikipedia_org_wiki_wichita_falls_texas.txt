[ 6 ] It is the principal city of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area , which encompasses all of Archer , Clay , and Wichita Counties. According to the 2020 census , it had a population of 102,316, [ 7 ] making it the 43rd-most populous city in Texas. Wichita Falls is home to Midwestern State University , enrolling more than 5,500 students.

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Wichita Falls, Texas Map of Wichita Falls in 1890 Kemp-Kell Building, circa 1910, now known as the Holt Hotel, was one of the first five-story office buildings in the city.

From the early 18th century to the mid 19th century, the Wichita Falls area was inhabited by the Wichita and the Comanche people. The Spanish called the lands controlled by the Comanche as Comancheria . The Wichita were forced onto a reservation in Oklahoma after 1859. The last battle with the Comanche in this area occurred in 1872 and the Comanche were finally defeated in 1874.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Anglo American presence in the area began in the 1860s.

[ 11 ] The future city was platted and named Wichita Falls on September 27, 1876, as the Wichita River runs through the area and a waterfall was in the river's course in 1876. The first permanent resident arrived in 1879. In 1886, a flood destroyed the original waterfall on the Wichita River for which the city was named.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The city built an artificial waterfall in 1987 beside the river in Lucy Park. The recreated falls are 54 ft (16 m) high.

On the day the city was named in 1876, a sale of town lots was held at what is now the corner of Seventh and Ohio Streets – the birthplace of the city.

[ 15 ] The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway arrived in September 1882, the same year the city became the county seat of Wichita County .

[ 16 ] The city grew westwards from the original FW&DC train depot which was located at the northwest corner of Seventh Street and the FW&DC.

[ 15 ] This area is now referred to as the Depot Square Historic District , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark .

[ 19 ] The early history of Wichita Falls well into the 20th century also rests on the work of two entrepreneurs, Joseph A. Kemp [ 20 ] and his brother-in-law, Frank Kell. Kemp and Kell were pioneers in food processing and retailing, flour milling, railroads, cattle, banking, and oil.

[ 21 ] The city is home to the Newby-McMahon Building (otherwise known as the " world's littlest skyscraper "), constructed downtown in 1919 and featured in Robert Ripley 's Ripley's Believe It or Not!

.

[ citation needed ] Downtown Wichita Falls was the city's main shopping area for many years. Those shops lost ground to the creation of new shopping centers throughout the city beginning with Parker Square in 1953 and other similar developments during the 1960s and 1970s, culminating with the opening of Sikes Senter Mall in 1974. The city has been seeking funding to rebuild and restore the downtown area since 2010.

[ 16 ] Wichita Falls was once home to offices of several oil companies and related industries, along with oil refineries operated by the Continental Oil Company (now ConocoPhillips ) until 1952 and Panhandle Oil Company (founded in Wichita Falls, sold to American Petrofina in 1965). Both firms continued to use a portion of their former refineries as gasoline/oil terminal facilities for many years.

1964 tornado [ edit ] Main article: 1964 Wichita Falls tornado A powerful F5-rated tornado hit the northern and northwestern portions of Wichita Falls, along with Sheppard Air Force Base during the afternoon of April 3, 1964 (later referred to as "Black Friday"). As the first violent tornado on record to hit the Wichita Falls area, [ 22 ] it left seven dead and more than 100 injured. Additionally, the tornado caused roughly $15 million in property damage with about 225 homes destroyed and another 250 damaged.

[ 23 ] It was rated F5, the highest rating on the Fujita scale , but it is overshadowed by the 1979 tornado.

[ 24 ] 1979 tornado [ edit ] Main article: 1979 Red River Valley tornado outbreak § Wichita Falls, Texas An F4 tornado struck the heavily populated southern sections of Wichita Falls in the late afternoon on Tuesday, April 10, 1979 (known as "Terrible Tuesday"). It was part of an outbreak that produced 30 tornadoes around the region. Despite having nearly an hour's advance warning that severe weather was imminent, 42 people were killed (including 25 in vehicles) and 1,800 were injured because it arrived just as many people were driving home from work.

[ 25 ] It left 20,000 people homeless and caused $400 million in damage, a U.S. record not topped by an individual tornado until the F5 Moore–Oklahoma City tornado of May 3, 1999.

[ 26 ] Geography and climate [ edit ] Wichita Falls is about 15 miles (24 km) south of the border with Oklahoma , 115 mi (185 km) northwest of Fort Worth , and 140 mi (230 km) southwest of Oklahoma City . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 70.71 square miles (183.1 km 2 ), of which 0.02 square miles (0.052 km 2 ) (0.03%) is covered by water.

[ 27 ] Wichita Falls experiences a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification Cfa ), featuring long, very hot and humid summers, and cool winters. The city has some of the highest summer daily maximum temperatures in the entire U.S. outside of the Desert Southwest . Temperatures have hit 100 °F (38 °C) as early as March 27 and as late as October 17, but more typically reach that level on 28 days annually, with 102 days of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher annually; the average window for the latter mark is April 9–October 10. However, 59 to 60 nights of freezing lows occur, and an average of 4.8 days where the high does not rise above freezing. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 42.0 °F (5.6 °C) in January to 84.4 °F (29.1 °C) in July. The record low temperature is −12 °F (−24 °C) on January 4, 1947. The highest recorded temperature is 117 °F (47 °C) on June 28, 1980. Snowfall is sporadic and averages 4.1 in (10 cm) per season, while rainfall is typically greatest in early summer.

From 2010 through 2013, Wichita Falls, along with a large portion of the south-central US, experienced a persistent drought . In September 2011, Wichita Falls became the first Texas city [ 28 ] to have 100 days of 100 °F (38 °C) or higher within one year.

[ a ] On every day from June 22 to August 12, the temperature reached 100 °F or higher, and from May 27 to September 3, the temperature reached 90 °F or higher. In addition, the all-time warm daily minimum of 88 °F (31 °C) was set on July 26, and June, July, and August of that year were all the hottest on record.

[ 29 ] During the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma floods , Wichita Falls broke its all-time record for the wettest month, with 17.00 inches of rain recorded in May 2015.

[ 57 ] The United States Postal Service operates the Wichita Falls Post Office, the Morningside Post Office, the Bridge Creek Post Office, and the Sheppard Air Force Base Post Office.

[ 58 ] Education [ edit ] Primary and secondary schools [ edit ] Public primary and secondary education is covered by the following school districts: Wichita Falls Independent School District , City View Independent School District , Burkburnett Independent School District , and Iowa Park Consolidated Independent School District .

[ 59 ] Several private and parochial schools operate in the city, as does an active home-school community. Many of the local elementary schools participate in the Head Start program for preschool-aged children.

Two schools in the Wichita Falls ISD participated in the International Baccalaureate programs.

Hirschi High School offers the IB Diploma Programme , and G.H. Kirby Junior High School for the Middle Years Programme . Other public high schools were Wichita Falls High School and S. H. Rider High School (Wichita Falls ISD). All the high schools closed in 2024. The city opened 2 new high schools that year, Memorial High School and Legacy High School (both WFISD). The city also has City View High School (City View ISD).

By 1879, the first school was established. The first public school was a log structure established in the 1880s; in 1885, it was replaced with a former courthouse.

Wichita Falls High School opened in 1890. That year, a school district was created, but problems with the law allowing its establishment meant it was dissolved in 1894 and the city provided schooling until the second establishment of a school district in 1900. In 1908, the Texas Legislature issued a charter for WFISD.

[ 60 ] The city has a school for German children, Deutsche Schule Sheppard (DSS).

Transportation [ edit ] Highways [ edit ] Wichita Falls is the western terminus for Interstate 44 .

U.S. Highways leading to or through Wichita Falls include 287 , 277 , 281 , and 82 .

State Highway 240 ends at Wichita Falls and State Highway 79 runs through it. Wichita Falls has one of the largest freeway mileages for a city of its size [ citation needed ] as a result of a 1954 bond issue approved by city and county voters to purchase rights-of-way for several expressway routes through the city and county, the first of which was opened in the year 1958 as an alignment of U.S. 287 from Eighth Street at Broad and Holliday Streets northwestward across the Wichita River and bisecting Lucy and Scotland Parks to the Old Iowa Park Road, the original U.S. 287 alignment.

[ citation needed ] That was followed by other expressway links including U.S. 82–287 east to Henrietta (completed in the year 1968), U.S. 281 south toward Jacksboro (completed 1969), U.S. 287 northwest to Iowa Park and Electra (opened 1962), Interstate 44 north to Burkburnett and the Red River (opened 1964), and Interstate 44 from Old Iowa Park Road to U.S. 287/Spur 325 interchange on the city's north side along with Spur 325 from I-44/U.S. 287 to the main gate of Sheppard Air Force Base (both completed as a single project in 1960). However, cross-country traffic for many years had to contend with several ground-level intersections and traffic lights over Holliday and Broad Streets near the downtown area for about 13 blocks between connecting expressway links until a new elevated freeway running overhead was completed in 2001.

[ citation needed ] Efforts to create an additional freeway along the path of Kell Boulevard for U.S. 82–277 began in 1967 with the acquisition of right-of-way that included a former railroad right-of-way and the first project including construction of the present frontage roads completed in 1977, followed by freeway lanes, overpasses, and on/off ramps in 1989 from just east of Brook Avenue west to Kemp Boulevard; similar projects west from Kemp to Barnett Road in 2001 followed by Barnett Road west past FM 369 in 2010 to tie in which a project now underway to transform U.S. 277 into a continuous four-lane expressway between Wichita Falls and Abilene.

[ 64 ] Public transportation [ edit ] The city operates a bus system, Falls Ride, which runs on an hourly schedule with seven routes (except on Sundays, when only one route is in operation).

[ 65 ] Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service to other locations served by Greyhound via its new terminal at the Wichita Falls Travel Center located at Fourth and Scott in downtown.

[ 66 ] Skylark Van Service shuttles passengers to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on several runs during the day all week long.

[ 67 ] The Wichita Falls Municipal Airport is served by American Eagle , with two flights daily to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport . The Kickapoo Downtown Airport and the Wichita Valley Airport serve smaller, private planes.

Although still in the planning phase, local officials are currently working to potentially bring an Amtrak stop to the city. Wichita Falls last had passenger rail service in 1967.
