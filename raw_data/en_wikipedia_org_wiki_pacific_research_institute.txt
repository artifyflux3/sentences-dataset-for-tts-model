[ 3 ] PRI was founded in 1979 by British philanthropist Antony Fisher and San Francisco businessman James North.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The organization is headquartered in Pasadena, California , with an additional office in Sacramento .

[ 1 ] Policy areas [ edit ] The organization is active in the policy areas of education, economics, health care, the environment, and water supply.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] It operates the Center for California's Future, which has a goal of "reinvigorating California's entrepreneurial, self-reliant traditions" and the Laffer Center, which is "focused on educating people on free-markets and supply-side economics ." [ 8 ] From 1996 through 2009, the organization published an annual Index of Leading Environmental Indicators , which tracked environmental trends worldwide. PRI started the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest , a New York-based think tank focusing on health policy.

[ 9 ] In 2022, Pipes opposed federal efforts to cap copayments at $35 for insulin , and PRI opposed plans by California to back generic manufacturing of the drug.

[ 10 ] PRI is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025 , [ 11 ] a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election .

[ 12 ] Staff [ edit ] Sally C. Pipes has been president of the institute since 1991.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] She writes a regular column for Forbes.com , focusing on health care in the United States.

[ 15 ] In 2008 she founded the Benjamin Rush Institute as a conservative association for medical students with 20 chapters at medical schools across America.

[ 14 ] She is originally from Canada and became a U.S. citizen in 2006.

[ 14 ] She opposes single-payer health care systems.

[ 10 ] The current chairman of the board of trustees Clark S. Judge (since 2005) is also a cofounder of the White House Writers Group.

[ 16 ] Finances [ edit ] PRI's total revenues in 2020 were $5.6 million, according to ProPublica 's Nonprofit Explorer database.

[ 17 ] The Lilly Endowment , connected to Eli Lilly and Company , is a donor, contributing $175,000 a year in grants to PRI since 2015, according to The Intercept .
