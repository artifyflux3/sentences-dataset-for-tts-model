Recovery of [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") first-stage booster after its [first landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_flight_20 "Falcon 9 flight 20")

A **reusable launch vehicle** has parts that can be recovered and reflown, while carrying [payloads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload "Payload") from the surface to [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). [Rocket stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_stage "Rocket stage") are the most common [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") parts aimed for reuse. Smaller parts such as [fairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_fairing "Payload fairing"), [boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry) "Booster (rocketry)") or [rocket engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine "Rocket engine") can also be reused, though [reusable spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft "Reusable spacecraft") may be launched on top of an expendable launch vehicle. Reusable launch vehicles do not need to make these parts for each launch, therefore reducing its [launch cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_cost "Launch cost") significantly. However, these benefits are diminished by the cost of recovery and refurbishment.

Reusable launch vehicles may contain additional [avionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics "Avionics") and [propellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant "Propellant"), making them heavier than their expendable counterparts. Reused parts may need to [enter the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry") and navigate through it, so they are often equipped with [heat shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield "Heat shield"), [grid fins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_fin "Grid fin"), and other [flight control surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_control_surfaces "Flight control surfaces"). By modifying their shape, [spaceplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") can leverage [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation") mechanics to aid in its recovery, such as [gliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding "Gliding") or [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)"). In the atmosphere, [parachutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute "Parachute") or [retrorockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrorocket "Retrorocket") may also be needed to slow it down further. Reusable parts may also need specialized recovery facilities such as [runways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway "Runway") or [autonomous spaceport drone ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship "Autonomous spaceport drone ship"). Some concepts rely on ground infrastructures such as [mass drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver "Mass driver") to accelerate the launch vehicle beforehand.

Since at least in the early 20th century, [single-stage-to-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit "Single-stage-to-orbit") reusable launch vehicles have existed in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"). In the 1970s, the first reusable launch vehicle, the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), was developed. However, in the 1990s, due to the program's failure to meet expectations, reusable launch vehicle concepts were reduced to prototype testing. The rise of [private spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight") companies in the 2000s and 2010s lead to a resurgence of their development, such as in [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne"), [New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard"), [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Electron "Rocket Lab Electron"), [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9"), and [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy"). Many launch vehicles are now expected to debut with reusability in the 2020s, such as [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship"), [New Glenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glenn "New Glenn"), [Neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Neutron "Rocket Lab Neutron"), [Soyuz-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz-7_(rocket_family) "Soyuz-7 (rocket family)"), [Ariane Next](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_Next "Ariane Next"), [Long March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_(rocket_family) "Long March (rocket family)"), [Terran R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terran_R "Terran R"), [Stoke Space Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Space_Nova "Stoke Space Nova"), and the Dawn Mk-II Aurora.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-1)

The impact of reusability in launch vehicles has been foundational in the space flight industry. So much so that in 2024, the [Cape Canaveral Space Force Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station") initiated a 50 year forward looking plan for the Cape that involved major infrastructure upgrades (including to [Port Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Canaveral "Port Canaveral")) to support a higher anticipated launch cadence and landing sites for the new generation of vehicles.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-2)

Reusable launch systems may be either fully or partially reusable.

### Fully reusable launch vehicle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Fully reusable launch vehicle")]

Several companies are currently developing fully reusable launch vehicles as of January 2025. Each of them is working on a [two-stage-to-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit "Two-stage-to-orbit") system. [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") is testing [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship"), which has been in development since 2016 and has made [an initial test flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_1 "Starship flight test 1") in April 2023[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-3) and a total of 9 flights as of May 2025. [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin"), with [Project Jarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jarvis "Project Jarvis"), began development work by early 2021, but has announced no date for testing and have not discussed the project publicly.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-ars20210727-4)[Stoke Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Space "Stoke Space") is also developing a rocket which is planned to be reusable.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-6)

As of January 2025, Starship is the only [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") intended to be fully reusable that has been fully built and tested. The [fifth test flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_5 "Starship flight test 5") was on October 13, 2024, in which the vehicle completed a suborbital launch and landed both stages for the second time. The [Super Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Super_Heavy "SpaceX Super Heavy") booster was caught successfully by the "chopstick system" on Orbital Pad A for the first time. The Ship completed its second successful reentry and returned for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The test marked the second instance that could be considered meeting all requirements to be fully reusable.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-7)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability") – [see discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reusable\_launch\_vehicle#Starship\_IFT-4\_and\_full\_re-usability "Talk:Reusable launch vehicle")_]

### Partially reusable launch systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Partially reusable launch systems")]

Partial reusable launch systems, in the form of multiple stage to orbit systems have been so far the only reusable configurations in use.

#### Specific component reuse

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Specific component reuse")]

The historic [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") reused its [Solid Rocket Boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster "Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster"), its [RS-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25 "RS-25") engines and the [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter") that acted as an orbital insertion stage, but it did not reuse the [External Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Tank "External Tank") that fed the RS-25 engines. This is an example of a reusable launch system which reuses specific components of rockets. [ULA’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance "United Launch Alliance")[Vulcan Centaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_Centaur "Vulcan Centaur") was originally designed to reuse the first stage engines, while the tank is expended. The engines would splashdown on an inflatable [aeroshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroshell "Aeroshell"), then be recovered. On 23 February 2024, one of the nine Merlin engines powering a [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") launched for the 22nd time, making it the most reused liquid fuel engine used in an operational manner, having already surpassed [Space Shuttle Main Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Main_Engine "Space Shuttle Main Engine") number 2019's record of 19 flights.

As of 2024, [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") and [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy") are the only orbital rockets to reuse their boosters, although multiple other systems are in development. All aircraft-launched rockets reuse the aircraft.

Other than that a range of [non-rocket liftoff systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_launch "Non-rocket launch") have been proposed and explored over time as reusable systems for liftoff, from balloons[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-8)[_[relevant?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing\_better\_articles#Stay\_on\_topic "Wikipedia:Writing better articles")_] to [space elevators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator "Space elevator"). Existing examples are systems which employ winged horizontal jet-engine powered liftoff. Such aircraft can [air launch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_launch "Air launch") expendable rockets and can because of that be considered partially reusable systems if the aircraft is thought of as the first stage of the launch vehicle. An example of this configuration is the [Orbital Sciences Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Pegasus "Orbital Sciences Pegasus"). For suborbital flight the [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo") uses for liftoff a carrier plane, its [mothership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothership "Mothership") the [Scaled Composites White Knight Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two "Scaled Composites White Knight Two"). Rocket Lab is working on [Neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Neutron "Rocket Lab Neutron"), and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") is working on [Themis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis_programme "Themis programme"). Both vehicles are planned to recover the first stage.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-10)

#### Orbital insertion stages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Orbital insertion stages")]

So far, most launch systems achieve [orbital insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_insertion "Orbital insertion") with at least partially expended [multistaged rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistaged_rocket "Multistaged rocket"), particularly with the second and third stages. Only the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") has achieved a reuse of the orbital insertion stage, by using the engines and fuel tank of [its orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter"). The [Buran spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") and [Starship spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_spacecraft "Starship spacecraft") are two other reusable spacecraft that were designed to be able to act as orbital insertion stages and have been produced, however the former only made one uncrewed test flight before the project was cancelled, and the latter is not yet operational, having completed [eight suborbital test flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Starship_launches "List of Starship launches"), as of April 2025, which achieved all of its mission objectives at the fourth flight.

### Reusable spacecraft

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Reusable spacecraft")]

Launch systems can be combined with reusable spaceplanes or capsules. The [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter"), [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo"), Dawn Mk-II Aurora, and the under-development Indian [RLV-TD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLV-TD "RLV-TD") are examples for a reusable space vehicle (a [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane")) as well as a part of its launch system.

More contemporarily the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") launch system has carried reusable vehicles such as the [Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_2 "Dragon 2") and [X-37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-37 "X-37").

Contemporary reusable orbital vehicles include the X-37, the [Dream Chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Chaser "Dream Chaser"), the Dragon 2, the Indian RLV-TD and the upcoming European [Space Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Rider "Space Rider") (successor to the [IXV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXV "IXV")).

As with launch vehicles, all pure spacecraft during the early decades of human capacity to achieve spaceflight were designed to be single-use items. This was true both for [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") and [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probes "Space probes") intended to be left in space for a long time, as well as any object designed to return to Earth such as [human-carrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight")[space capsules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule "Space capsule") or the sample return canisters of space matter collection missions like [Stardust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(spacecraft) "Stardust (spacecraft)") (1999–2006)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-newscientist20060115-11) or [Hayabusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa "Hayabusa") (2005–2010).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-indyposted201006-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-sdc20100613-13) Exceptions to the general rule for space vehicles were the US [Gemini SC-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_SC-2 "Gemini SC-2"), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") spacecraft [Vozvraschaemyi Apparat (VA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VA_spacecraft "VA spacecraft"), the US [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter") (mid-1970s-2011, with 135 flights between 1981 and 2011) and the Soviet [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") (1980-1988, with just one uncrewed test flight in 1988). Both of these spaceships were also an integral part of the launch system (providing launch acceleration) as well as operating as medium-duration spaceships in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight "Orbital spaceflight"). This began to change in the mid-2010s.

In the 2010s, the [space transport cargo capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services "Commercial Resupply Services") from one of the suppliers resupplying the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") was designed for reuse, and after 2017,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-Dragon_reused-14) NASA began to allow the reuse of the SpaceX [Dragon cargo spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_1 "Dragon 1") on these NASA-contracted transport routes. This was the beginning of design and operation of a **reusable space vehicle**.

The [Boeing Starliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner "Boeing Starliner") capsules also reduce their fall speed with parachutes and deploy an airbag shortly before touchdown on the ground, in order to retrieve and reuse the vehicle.

As of 2021, SpaceX is building and testing the [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship") spaceship to be capable of surviving multiple [hypersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic "Hypersonic")[reentries through the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry "Atmospheric reentry") so that they become truly reusable long-duration spaceships; no Starship operational flights have yet occurred.

With possible inflatable [heat shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield#Spacecraft "Heat shield"), as developed by the US (Low Earth Orbit Flight Test Inflatable Decelerator - LOFTID)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-noaa-20190703-15) and China,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-16) single-use rockets like the [Space Launch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System "Space Launch System") are considered to be retrofitted with such heat shields to salvage the expensive engines, possibly reducing the costs of launches significantly.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-17) Heat shields allow an orbiting spacecraft to land safely without expending very much fuel. They need not take the form of inflatable heat shields, they may simply take the form of heat-resistant tiles that prevent [heat conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction "Heat conduction"). Heat shields are also proposed for use in combination with retrograde thrust to allow for full reusability as seen in [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft) "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)").

Reusable launch system stages such as the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") and the [New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard") employ retrograde burns for re-entry, and landing.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Reusable systems can come in [single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit "Single-stage-to-orbit") or multiple ([two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit "Two-stage-to-orbit") or [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-stage-to-orbit "Three-stage-to-orbit")) stages to orbit configurations. For some or all stages the following landing system types can be employed.

#### Parachutes and airbags

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Parachutes and airbags")]

These are landing systems that employ parachutes and bolstered hard landings, like in a [splashdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown "Splashdown") at sea or a touchdown at land. The latter may require an engine burn just before landing as parachutes alone cannot slow the craft down enough to prevent injury to astronauts. This can be seen in the Soyuz capsule.

Though such systems have been in use since the beginning of [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics") to recover space vehicles, only later have the vehicles been reused.

E.g.:

*   [Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Boosters "Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters")
*   [SpaceX Dragon capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon "SpaceX Dragon")

#### Horizontal (winged)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Horizontal (winged)")]

Single or main stages, as well as [fly-back boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fly-back_booster&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fly-back booster (page does not exist)") can employ a horizontal landing system. These vehicles land on earth much like a plane does, but they usually do not use propellant during landing.

Examples are:

*   [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter") - as part of the main stage
*   [Buran spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") - acted as an orbital insertion stage, however [Polyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft) "Polyus (spacecraft)") could also be used as a second stage for the [Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket) "Energia (rocket)") launch vehicle.
*   [Venturestar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturestar "Venturestar") - a project of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")
*   [Space Shuttle's studied fly-back booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studied_Space_Shuttle_designs#Liquid_Fly-back_Booster "Studied Space Shuttle designs")
*   [Energia II ("Uragan")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket) "Energia (rocket)") - an alternative [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") launch system concept
*   [OK-GLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK-GLI "OK-GLI") - another [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") spacecraft version
*   [Liquid Fly-back Booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Fly-back_Booster "Liquid Fly-back Booster") - a German concept
*   [Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_(rocket_booster) "Baikal (rocket booster)") - a former Russian project
*   [Reusable Booster System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_Booster_System "Reusable Booster System") - a U.S. research project
*   [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo") - a [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") for [space tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism "Space tourism") made by [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic")
*   [SpaceShipThree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipThree "SpaceShipThree") - a [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") under development for [space tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism "Space tourism") made by [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic")
*   Dawn Mk-II Aurora - a [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") under development by [Dawn Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Aerospace "Dawn Aerospace")
*   [XS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS-1_(spacecraft) "XS-1 (spacecraft)") - another U.S. research project
*   [RLV-TD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLV-TD "RLV-TD") - an ongoing Indian project
*   [Reaction Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines "Reaction Engines")[Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft) "Skylon (spacecraft)")[SSTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSTO "SSTO")

A variant is an in-air-capture tow back system, advocated by a company called EMBENTION with its FALCon project.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-18)

Vehicles that land horizontally on a runway require wings and undercarriage. These typically consume about 9-12% of the landing vehicle mass,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] which either reduces the payload or increases the size of the vehicle. Concepts such as [lifting bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_bodies "Lifting bodies") offer some reduction in wing mass,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] as does the [delta wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wing "Delta wing") shape of the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle").

#### Vertical (retrograde)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Vertical (retrograde)")]

Systems like the [McDonnell Douglas DC-X (Delta Clipper)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X "McDonnell Douglas DC-X") and those by [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") are examples of a retrograde system. The boosters of [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") and [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy") land using one of their nine engines. The [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") rocket is the first orbital rocket to vertically land its first stage on the ground. The first stage of [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship") is planned to land vertically, while the second is to be caught by arms after performing most of the typical steps of a retrograde landing. [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin")'s [New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard") suborbital rocket also lands vertically back at the launch site.

Retrograde landing typically requires about 10% of the total first stage propellant, reducing the payload that can be carried due to the [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_equation "Rocket equation").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-19)

#### Landing using aerostatic force

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Landing using aerostatic force")]

There is also the concept of a launch vehicle with an inflatable, reusable first stage. The shape of this structure will be supported by excess internal pressure (using light gases). It is assumed that the bulk density of the first stage (without propellant) is less than the bulk density of air. Upon returning from flight, such a first stage remains floating in the air (without touching the surface of the Earth). This will ensure that the first stage is retained for reuse. Increasing the size of the first stage increases aerodynamic losses. This results in a slight decrease in payload. This reduction in payload is compensated for by the reuse of the first stage.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-20)

Reusable stages weigh more than equivalent [expendable stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_vehicle "Expendable launch vehicle"). This is unavoidable due to the supplementary systems, landing gear and/or surplus propellant needed to land a stage. The actual mass penalty depends on the vehicle and the return mode chosen.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-IAC2017-21)

After the launcher lands, it may need to be refurbished to prepare it for its next flight. This process may be lengthy and expensive. The launcher may not be able to be recertified as human-rated after refurbishment, although SpaceX has flown reused Falcon 9 boosters for human missions. There is eventually a limit on how many times a launcher can be refurbished before it has to be retired, but how often a launcher can be reused differs significantly between the various launch system designs.

With the development of [rocket propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propulsion "Rocket propulsion") in the first half of the twentieth century, [space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") became a technical possibility.

Early ideas of a single-stage reusable [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") proved unrealistic and although even the first practical rocket vehicles ([V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2 "V-2")) could reach the fringes of space, reusable technology was too heavy. In addition, many early rockets were developed to deliver weapons, making reuse impossible by design. The problem of mass efficiency was overcome by using multiple expendable stages in a vertical launch [multistage rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket"). USAF and NACA had been studying orbital reusable spaceplanes since 1958, e.g. [Dyna-Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyna-Soar "Dyna-Soar"), but the first reusable stages did not fly until the advent of the US [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") in 1981.

[McDonnell Douglas DC-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X "McDonnell Douglas DC-X") used vertical takeoff and vertical landing

Perhaps the first reusable launch vehicles were the ones conceptualized and studied by [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun "Wernher von Braun") from 1948 until 1956. The [von Braun ferry rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Braun_ferry_rocket "Von Braun ferry rocket") underwent two revisions: once in 1952 and again in 1956. They would have landed using parachutes.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-23)

The [General Dynamics Nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_Nexus "General Dynamics Nexus") was proposed in the 1960s as a fully reusable successor to the Saturn V rocket, having the capacity of transporting up to 450–910 t (990,000–2,000,000 lb) to orbit.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-25) See also [Sea Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_(rocket) "Sea Dragon (rocket)"), and [Douglas SASSTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_SASSTO "Douglas SASSTO").

The [BAC Mustard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_Mustard "BAC Mustard") was studied starting in 1964. It would have comprised three identical spaceplanes strapped together and arranged in two stages. During ascent the two outer spaceplanes, which formed the first stage, would detach and glide back individually to earth. It was canceled after the last study of the design in 1967 due to a lack of funds for development.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-26)

NASA started the [Space Shuttle design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_design_process "Space Shuttle design process") in 1968, with the vision of creating a fully reusable [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") using a crewed [fly-back booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFBB_(NASA) "LFBB (NASA)"). This concept proved expensive and complex, therefore the design was scaled back to reusable [solid rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_rocket "Solid rocket") boosters and an expendable [external tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_tank "External tank").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-nasaStudy1982-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-nasaStudy1980-28) Space Shuttle _[Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia")_ launched and landed 27 times and was lost with all crew on the 28th landing attempt; _[Challenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Challenger "Space Shuttle Challenger")_ launched and landed 9 times and was lost with all crew on the 10th launch attempt; _[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")_ launched and landed 39 times; _[Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Atlantis "Space Shuttle Atlantis")_ launched and landed 33 times; _[Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Endeavour "Space Shuttle Endeavour")_ launched and landed 25 times.

In 1986 President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") called for an air-breathing [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet "Scramjet")[National Aerospace Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aerospace_Plane "National Aerospace Plane") (NASP)/[X-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-30 "X-30"). The project failed due to technical issues and was canceled in 1993.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-29)

In the late 1980s a fully reusable version of the [Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket) "Energia (rocket)") rocket, the Energia II, was proposed. Its boosters and core would have had the capability of landing separately on a runway.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-30)

In the 1990s the [McDonnell Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas "McDonnell Douglas")[Delta Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Clipper "Delta Clipper") VTOL SSTO proposal progressed to the testing phase. The [DC-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC-X "DC-X") prototype demonstrated rapid turnaround time and automatic computer control.

In mid-1990s, British research evolved an earlier [HOTOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTOL "HOTOL") design into the far more promising [Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft) "Skylon (spacecraft)") design, which remained in development until 2024 when the company developing Skylon went bankrupt.

From the late 1990s to the 2000s, the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") studied the recovery of the [Ariane 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5 "Ariane 5")[solid rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_rocket "Solid rocket") boosters.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-31) The last recovery attempt took place in 2009.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-32)

The commercial ventures, [Rocketplane Kistler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketplane_Kistler "Rocketplane Kistler") and [Rotary Rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Rocket "Rotary Rocket"), attempted to build reusable privately developed rockets before going bankrupt.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

NASA proposed reusable concepts to replace the Shuttle technology, to be demonstrated under the [X-33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-33 "X-33") and [X-34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-34 "X-34") programs, which were both cancelled in the early 2000s due to rising costs and technical issues.

The [Ansari X Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansari_X_Prize "Ansari X Prize") contest was intended to develop private suborbital reusable vehicles. Many private companies competed, with the winner, [Scaled Composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites "Scaled Composites"), reaching the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") twice in a two-week period with their reusable [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne").

In 2012, [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") started a flight test program with [experimental vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Grasshopper "SpaceX Grasshopper"). These subsequently led to the development of the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") reusable rocket launcher.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-nsw20130328-33)

On 23 November 2015 the [New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard") rocket became the first [Vertical Take-off, Vertical Landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTVL "VTVL") (VTVL) sub-orbital rocket to reach space by passing the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") (100 km or 62 mi), reaching 329,839 ft (100,535 m) before returning for a propulsive landing.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-space20151124-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-arstechnica20151125-35)

SpaceX achieved the first vertical soft landing of a reusable orbital rocket stage on December 21, 2015, after delivering 11 [Orbcomm OG-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbcomm_OG-2 "Orbcomm OG-2") commercial satellites into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-36)

The first reuse of a Falcon 9 first stage occurred on 30 March 2017.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-37) SpaceX now routinely recovers and reuses [their first stages, as well as reusing fairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program#Fairing_reuse "SpaceX reusable launch system development program").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-38)

In 2019 [Rocket Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab "Rocket Lab") announced plans to recover and reuse the first stage of their [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(rocket) "Electron (rocket)") launch vehicle, intending to use [parachutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute "Parachute") and [mid-air retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-air_retrieval "Mid-air retrieval").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-rlab20190806-39) On 20 November 2020, Rocket Lab successfully returned an Electron first stage from an orbital launch, the stage softly splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-SpaceNews_2020-40)

China is researching the reusability of the [Long March 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_8 "Long March 8") system.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-41)

As of May 2020, the only operational reusable orbital-class launch systems are the Falcon 9 and [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy"), the latter of which is based upon the Falcon 9. SpaceX is also developing the fully reusable [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship") launch system.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-musk20170929-42)[Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") is developing its own [New Glenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glenn "New Glenn") partially reusable orbital rocket, as it is intending to recover and reuse only the first stage.

5 October 2020, Roscosmos signed a development contract for [Amur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_(launch_vehicle) "Amur (launch vehicle)") a new launcher with a reusable first stage.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-roscosmos20201005-43)

Return to launch site
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reusable_launch_vehicle&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Return to launch site")]

After 1980, but before the 2010s, two orbital launch vehicles developed the capability to **return to the launch site** (RTLS). Both the US [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle")—with one of its [abort modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes#Return_to_launch_site_(RTLS) "Space Shuttle abort modes")[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-46)—and the Soviet [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)")[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-ng2016041-47) had a designed-in capability to return a part of the launch vehicle to the launch site via the mechanism of [horizontal-landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTHL "HTHL") of the [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") portion of the launch vehicle. In both cases, the main vehicle thrust structure and the large propellant tank were [expendable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_vehicle "Expendable launch vehicle"), as had been the standard procedure for all orbital launch vehicles flown prior to that time. Both were subsequently demonstrated on actual orbital nominal flights, although both also had an abort mode during launch that could conceivably allow the crew to land the spaceplane following an off-nominal launch.

In the 2000s, both [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") and [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") have [privately developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight") a set of technologies to support [vertical landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_landing "Vertical landing") of the booster stage of a launch vehicle. After 2010, SpaceX undertook a [development program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program "SpaceX reusable launch system development program") to acquire the ability to bring back and [vertically land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTVL "VTVL") a part of the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_FT "Falcon 9 FT")[orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight "Orbital spaceflight") launch vehicle: the [first stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_stage_(rocketry) "First stage (rocketry)"). The first successful landing was done in December 2015,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-abc2015121-48) since then several additional rocket stages landed either at a [landing pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Zones_1_and_2 "Landing Zones 1 and 2") adjacent to the launch site or on a [landing platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Spaceport_Drone_Ship "Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship") at sea, some distance away from the launch site.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-49) The [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy") is similarly designed to reuse the three cores comprising its first stage. On its [first flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight "Falcon Heavy test flight") in February 2018, the two outer cores successfully returned to the launch site landing pads while the center core targeted the landing platform at sea but did not successfully land on it.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-50)

[Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") developed similar technologies for bringing back and landing their [suborbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suborbital "Suborbital")_[New Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Shepard "New Shepard")_, and successfully demonstrated return in 2015, and successfully reused the same booster on a second suborbital flight in January 2016.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-51) By October 2016, Blue had reflown, and landed successfully, that same launch vehicle a total of five times.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-sn20161005-52) It must however be noted that the launch trajectories of both vehicles are very different, with New Shepard going straight up and down without achieving orbital flight, whereas Falcon 9 has to cancel substantial horizontal velocity and return from a significant distance downrange, while delivering the payload to orbit with the second stage.

Both Blue Origin and SpaceX also have additional reusable launch vehicles under development. Blue is developing the first stage of the orbital [New Glenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glenn "New Glenn") LV to be reusable, with first flight planned for no earlier than 2024. SpaceX has a new super-heavy launch vehicle under development for missions to [interplanetary space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight "Interplanetary spaceflight"). The [SpaceX Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship") is designed to support RTLS, vertical-landing and full reuse of _both_ the booster stage and the integrated second-stage/large-spacecraft that are designed for use with Starship.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#cite_note-53) Its [first launch attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_1 "SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 1") took place in April 2023; however, both stages were lost during ascent. On the [fourth launch attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_4 "SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 4") however, both the booster and the ship achieved a soft landing in the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") and the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), respectively.
