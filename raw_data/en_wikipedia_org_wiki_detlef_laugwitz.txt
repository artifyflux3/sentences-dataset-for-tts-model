Detlef Laugwitz (1932–2000) was a German mathematician and historian, who worked in differential geometry , history of mathematics , functional analysis , and non-standard analysis .

Biography [ edit ] He was born on 11 May 1932 in Breslau , Germany . Starting in 1949, he studied mathematics, physics , and philosophy at the Georg-August-University at Göttingen , where he received his doctorate in 1954.

[ 1 ] Until 1956 he worked in the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach . In 1958 he became a lecturer at the Technical University of Munich , where he obtained his Habilitation. In 1958 he moved to the Technical University of Darmstadt , where in 1962 he became a professor, and remained until his retirement. From 1976 to 1984 he was a visiting professor at Caltech .

Work [ edit ] Laugwitz worked in differential geometry of infinite dimensional vector spaces (his dissertation) and in Finsler geometry . In 1958 he and Curt Schmieden developed their own approach to infinitesimals through field extensions, independently of Abraham Robinson . They described this as "infinitesimal mathematics" and leading back to the historical roots in Leibniz . In 1996 he published the standard biography of Bernhard Riemann .
