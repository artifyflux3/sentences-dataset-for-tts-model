[ 2 ] [ 3 ] An artist's rendering from 2023 of the fully assembled International Space Station Due to the complexity of building a station in space , space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks.

[ 1 ] From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven Space Shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station .

[ 1 ] The initial spacewalk to begin the assembly of the International Space Station was held on 7 December 1998, [ 4 ] following the launch of the first section of the station, Zarya , from Baikonur Cosmodrome , Kazakhstan , on 20 November 1998.

[ 5 ] The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built Unity node to Zarya .

[ 4 ] The longest spacewalk was performed on 11 March 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the airlock, but remained in their suits ready to exit the airlock again in case the robotics operations ran into problems. The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.

[ 6 ] As of 2 December 2021, there have been 245 spacewalks devoted to assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1548 hours and 26 minutes. Thirty-seven of those spacewalks were performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock , thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment , and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda service module.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] * denotes spacewalks performed from the Pirs docking compartment in Russian Orlan suits.

^ denotes spacewalks performed from the Poisk module in Russian Orlan suits.

† denotes spacewalks performed from the visiting Space Shuttle's airlock.

‡ denotes the one EVA and one IVA performed from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda Service Module.

All other spacewalks were performed from the Quest airlock .

ISS Expedition spacewalks are separated from shuttle spacewalks by a separator.

Expedition 28 EVA 1 Ronald J. Garan Jr.

Michael E. Fossum 12 July 2011 13:22 12 July 2011 19:53 6 hours, 31 minutes This spacewalk was kind of special in that it was the last spacewalk performed while a space shuttle was docked to the station. However, other than the previous spacewalks during docked operations, this one was performed by the station crew and not by the space shuttle crew.

The need for this spacewalk arose since a failed pump module on the station should be returned for inspection to the ground on the space shuttle. This having been the main objective done during this EVA the spacewalkers also installed a Robotic Refueling Mission experiment and fully deployed the MISSE 8 experiment (which was only half deployed during a previous spacewalk).

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] 161.

Expedition 28 EVA 2 * Sergei Volkov Aleksandr Samokutyayev 3 August 2011 14:50 3 August 2011 21:13 6 hours, 23 minutes The spacewalkers installed laser communications equipment which eventually will test transmissions of up to 100 Mbit/s of Russian science data with the ground on the Zvezda service module.

Radioskaf-V a small satellite for a student experiment was deployed and an antenna which was used for the docking of Poisk was removed and brought back into the station.
As part of the research work on the station the BIORISK experiment was installed on a handrail outside Pirs.
Last but not least photographs were taken including some of an antenna with signs of degraded performance to support engineers on the ground to trouble-shoot the cause of the degradation.
Due to time constraints the task to relocate the STEAL-1 cargo boom was canceled for this EVA.

Expedition 65 EVA 2 Thomas Pesquet Shane Kimbrough 16 June 2021 12:11 16 June 2021 19:26 7 hours, 15 minutes First in a series of spacewalks to install the iROSA solar arrays on the P6 Truss. While working on releasing the arrays from their launch carrier, Kimbrough's spacesuit experienced issues with its Display and Control Module (DCM), so he was sent back to the airlock to connect to station umbilicals to restart it. The restart was successful, although it delayed the EVA. Additionally, an issue was discovered with his suit's sublimator, which threatened to end the EVA prematurely; this was determined to be a false reading, allowing work to resume. Following this, the astronauts successfully released the solar arrays and installed them on the P6 mounting bracket. A subsequent attempt to unfold the two rolled arrays, which were folded side by side during launch, failed due to interference (blockage) from a structure near the mounting area. As the EVA was then past the six-hour mark, ground controllers instructed the astronauts to finish securing the array structure to the station, photograph the work site, and return to the airlock. The next steps of unfolding the array pair, making electrical connections, and unfurling the rolled arrays were postponed to a future EVA pending ground analysis of the interference issue. CSA astronaut Jenni Sidey was Ground IV.

Expedition 65 EVA 5 ^ Oleg Novitsky Pyotr Dubrov 3 September 2021 14:41 3 September 2021 22:35 7 hours, 54 minutes First in a series of spacewalks to outfit Nauka . The cosmonauts routed power and Ethernet cables interconnecting Nauka with the US segment via Zarya and PMA-1 , and installed EVA handrails along Nauka' s exterior. The complex series of tasks planned for this EVA was budgeted at a nominal 7 hours, but was delayed substantially by cumulative minor complications, ultimately stretching to nearly 8 hours with several tasks postponed. The power cables were successfully mated and a good power path was confirmed by ground controllers; the Ethernet cables were routed but not all connections were mated due to lack of time. Mating of the final Ethernet cables and jettisoning of the cable reel were deferred to a future spacewalk. One of the three planned handrail installations was partially completed, but had trouble with one of its screws as the EVA was then past the 7-hour mark, ground controllers instructed Dubrov to attach it temporarily with wire ties for completion on the next EVA. Additional tasks deferred to future EVAs include the installation of three Biorisk microorganism exposure experiment modules on the exterior of the station, and a photo survey of the Zarya module's exterior.

[ 288 ] [ 289 ] The cosmonauts continued where they left off from EVA 5, finishing Ethernet cable connections and installing four EVA handrails on Nauka (including the troublesome one left incomplete from EVA 5). They subsequently connected cable bundles between Nauka and Zvezda , providing Ethernet links between those modules as well as links for Nauka 's TV cameras and docking navigation antennas ( Kurs and TORU ). They then mounted three Biorisk microorganism exposure experiment modules on the exterior of the Poisk airlock module. Additionally, the cosmonauts took survey photos of the exterior of the Russian segment of the station, including the Kurs docking antennas of the Progress MS-17 cargo vehicle (confirming that they were undamaged) and external sensors on Nauka ; they also realigned a thruster plume measurement unit on Poisk . Finally, the cosmonauts tied together and jettisoned a junk cable reel cover along with some leftover insulation from the Biorisk experiments.

Expedition 67 EVA 2 ^ Oleg Artemyev Denis Matveev 28 April 2022 14:58 28 April 2022 22:40 7 hours 42 minutes Fourth spacewalk in a series to activate Nauka and Prichal and to commission ERA.

During the spacewalk the cosmonauts jettisoned thermal covers, released launch locks, and walked off  the arm to its stowage point at worksite 2 on the forward face of the lab where it was latched in place. Because of time they did not release the grapple at worksite 1 and the arm is bent over the solar arrays. The cosmonauts also installed handrails on Nauka and the arm and deployed a banner for Victory Day on the side of the station. ERA was checked out inside and attempts to grapple at worksite 3 were unsuccessful. The arm was backed off and parked to get the hands out of the way of docked operations and Nauka 's thrusters and solar arrays. On the next spacewalk, Samantha Cristoforetti will troubleshoot the arm before it is re-grappled to worksite 3 and moved to its final location at worksite 4. During the spacewalk, a cable which was deployed during Russian EVA 51 back in January got snagged and caused issues with the KURS antennas on Prichal , which forced Soyuz MS-21 to be flown in manually. Artemyev tied down the cables with wire ties and the antenna was redeployed into a safe configuration.

Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti worked on the ERA robotic arm as part of the work scheduled to commission the Nauka module and robotic arm. They launched two Tsiolkovsky-Ryazan (No. 1-2) and eight YUZGU-55 (No. 5-12) satellites, installed an ERA grapple point on Poisk to facilitate future relocation of the experiment airlock on the next spacewalk, translated a work platform over to Nauka , reconfigured ERA and set the control panel from "grapple mode" to "stowed", replaced a camera port window on ERA that prevented grappling on the previous spacewalk, replaced MLI blankets on Nauka that were knocked loose by the thruster firings when the module arrived, and installed retainers on Strela 1 on Poisk . The final task to relocate Strela 2 on Zarya over to Poisk and install its retainer was deferred to the next EVA as the spacewalkers were running heavily behind schedule due to a later-than-planned start. Cristoforetti became the first female European astronaut to perform a spacewalk, and only the third woman to perform a spacewalk using the Russian Orlan spacesuit (after Svetlana Savitskaya and Peggy Whitson ).

The primary task to install cameras on the elbow joint was completed on time and both cameras passed their telemetry checkouts. The final tasks to relocate the ERA control panel, set the arm back to "grapple mode", and remove the launch rings from the wrist of ERA will be moved to the next spacewalk. Artemyev was in the process of removing the launch ring at worksite 2 from ERA when he suffered a voltage drop in his spacesuit batteries.

Mission Control Moscow ordered him back inside the airlock where he connected to internal power to recharge his suit. Because they were ahead and then behind the timeline, in light of the battery issue Mission Control Moscow gave the order to terminate the EVA at 16:34 GMT and the spacewalk concluded at 17:54 GMT, 4 hours and 1 minute into the spacewalk.

[ 312 ] Artemyev was never in any danger and they will be replacing the battery before the next spacewalk. Because of the early EVA termination, the getahead task to relocate Strela 2 over to Poisk was also moved to the next spacewalk along with the other tasks.

Expedition 70 EVA 1 ^ Oleg Kononenko Nikolai Chub 25 October 2023 17:49 26 October 2023 01:30 7 hours 41 minutes The cosmonauts ventured outside and installed a mini radar experiment on Nauka , launched a CubeSat which will test solar sails, and photographed the RTOd radiator and closed valves to isolate the radiator and vented residual coolant so plans can be done to fix a leaking cooling line that delayed two US spacewalks. During one of the vents, Kononenko got sprayed and the coolant got on one of his tethers. The tether was placed in a trash bag and stowed externally to decontaminate it, while Kononenko's suit was wiped down to prevent coolant from entering the station. During the radar deployment, one of the hinges got stuck. The cosmonauts will go out on the next spacewalk and will use special tools and lock the hinges so it can be deployed. During the satellite deployment, the telescoping booms did not come out and ground controllers are working to manually deploy them so the satellite can track the sun.

Expedition 70 EVA 2 Jasmin Moghbeli Loral O'Hara Anne McClain 1 November 2023 12:05 1 November 2023 18:47 6 hours 42 minutes Moghbeli and O'Hara ventured outside and removed an H fixture from the 3B mass canister on the S4 truss in preparation for the arrival of the struts and the IROSA solar arrays in 2025. They also replaced a damaged Trundle Bearing under Cover 2 which had been giving them trouble in the past and greased the tracks before the new Trundle Bearing was installed on the port SARJ , secured a cable on Camera 8 which was shorting out a light used for dockings, and released wedge clamps on the SASA antenna. The primary task to retrieve the SASA antenna from ESP2 so it can be returned to Earth on SpaceX CRS-29 was moved to the next spacewalk because of issues removing the covers from the SARJ. O'Hara was not secured properly during the removal and had to be assisted by Moghbeli to get the cover stowed. During the spacewalk, the bag containing the grease gun was lost, but the tools were not needed and the bag posed no collision risk to the station. This was the fourth all-female spacewalk on the station, following Christina Koch and Jessica Meir's three spacewalks during Expedition 61.
