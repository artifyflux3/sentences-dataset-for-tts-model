In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **rate** is the [quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient "Quotient") of two [quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity "Quantity"), often represented as a [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction "Fraction").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates_of_change#cite_note-1) If the [divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_(mathematics) "Divisor (mathematics)") (or fraction denominator) in the rate is equal to one expressed as a single unit, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable")), then the [dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_(mathematics) "Dividend (mathematics)") (the fraction numerator) of the rate expresses the corresponding **rate of change** in the other ([dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_variable "Dependent variable")) variable. In some cases, it may be regarded as a change to a value, which is caused by a change of a value in respect to another value. For example, acceleration is a change in velocity with respect to time.

_Temporal rate_ is a common type of rate ("per unit of time"), such as [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"), [heart rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate "Heart rate"), and [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates_of_change#cite_note-International_Electrotechnical_Vocabulary_x558-2) In fact, often _rate_ is a synonym of [rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm "Rhythm") or [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency"), a count per second (i.e., [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz")); e.g., [radio frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequencies "Radio frequencies") or [sample rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_rate "Sample rate"). In describing the units of a rate, the word "per" is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate; for example, a [heart rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate "Heart rate") is expressed as "beats per minute".

Rates that have a non-time divisor or denominator include [exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate "Exchange rate"), [literacy rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate "Literacy rate"), and [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") (in volts per meter).

A rate defined using two numbers of the same units will result in a [dimensionless quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity "Dimensionless quantity"), also known as _[ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio")_ or simply as a _rate_ (such as [tax rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate "Tax rate")) or counts (such as [literacy rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate "Literacy rate")). Dimensionless rates can be expressed as a [percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage "Percentage") (for example, the global [literacy rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate "Literacy rate") in 1998 was 80%), [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)"), or [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_(mathematics) "Multiple (mathematics)").

Properties and examples

Further information: [Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio")

Rates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc. Thus they are often [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)").

A rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio, [benefit-cost ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit-cost_ratio "Benefit-cost ratio"), all considered in the broad sense. For example, miles per hour in transportation is the output (or benefit) in terms of miles of travel, which one gets from spending an hour (a cost in time) of traveling (at this velocity).

A set of sequential indices may be used to enumerate elements (or subsets) of a set of ratios under study. For example, in finance, one could define I by assigning consecutive integers to companies, to political subdivisions (such as states), to different investments, etc. The reason for using indices I is so a set of ratios (i=0, N) can be used in an equation to calculate a function of the rates such as an average of a set of ratios. For example, the average velocity found from the set of v I 's mentioned above. Finding averages may involve using weighted averages and possibly using the [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean "Harmonic mean").

A ratio r=a/b has both a numerator "a" and a denominator "b". The value of a and b may be a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"). The [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of a ratio r is 1/r = b/a. A rate may be equivalently expressed as an inverse of its value if the ratio of its units is also inverse. For example, 5 [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile") (mi) per [kilowatt-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour "Kilowatt-hour") (kWh) corresponds to 1/5 kWh/mi (or 200 [Wh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt-hour "Watt-hour")/mi).

Rates are relevant to many aspects of everyday life. For example: _How fast are you driving?_ The speed of the car (often expressed in miles per hour) is a rate. _What interest does your savings account pay you?_ The amount of interest paid per year is a rate.

Consider the case where the numerator ![Image 1: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) of a rate is a function ![Image 2: {\displaystyle f(a)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/368cb4b81ba5754d7a354a4ce49c2f1084bdaace) where ![Image 3: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) happens to be the denominator of the rate ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \delta f/\delta a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f1ec75e4c1a5d887e8cd3459eb265da6a79144f). A rate of change of ![Image 5: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) with respect to ![Image 6: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) (where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) is incremented by ![Image 8: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a)) can be formally defined in two ways:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates_of_change#cite_note-3)

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mbox{Average rate of change}}&={\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}\\{\mbox{Instantaneous rate of change}}&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/572a2507f0289daa866dc95eae409bd223a78c3e)
where _f_(_x_) is the function with respect to _x_ over the interval from _a_ to _a_+_h_. An instantaneous rate of change is equivalent to a [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative").

For example, the average [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") of a car can be calculated using the total distance traveled between two points, divided by the travel time. In contrast, the instantaneous velocity can be determined by viewing a [speedometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedometer "Speedometer").
