History of concept [ edit ] The name "Proto-Tethys" has been used inconsistently for several concepts for a supposed predecessor of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean , a palaeocean that separated the margins of Gondwana , often referred to as peri-Gondwana, from various continents and Gondwana-derived continental fragments from Precambrian times and onwards.
According to von Raumer & Stampfli 2008 , after the Cadomian orogenic events 550 Ma, the Proto-Tethys Ocean formed the eastern part of an oceanic domain (of which the Iapetus and Tornquist oceans formed the western parts) which subducted under the northern margins of Gondwana .  In this model the Proto-Tethys separated the North China and Baltica continents from Gondwana.

[ 1 ] In the Early Ordovician 500-480 Ma, the Proto-Tethys was subducted under Cadomia as a result of the Chamrousse back-arc basin .

[ 2 ] Torsvik & Cocks 2009 used the name 'Ran Ocean' for a similar concept, the Cambrian-Ordovician ocean that separated Baltica from Gondwana.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Other geologists dispute the existence of such an ocean.

[ 5 ] Palaeozoic evolution [ edit ] The ocean formed when Pannotia disintegrated, Proto-Laurasia (Laurentia, Baltica, and Siberia) rifted away from a supercontinent that would become Gondwana .  Proto-Tethys formed between these two supercontinents.  The ocean was bordered by Panthalassic Ocean to the north, separating it from Panthalassa by island arcs and Kazakhstania .  The Proto-Tethys expanded during the Cambrian .  The ocean was at its widest during the Late Ordovician to Middle Silurian .  The ocean was situated between the Siberia to the west, and Gondwana to the east.  The ocean began to shrink during the Late Silurian, when North China , and South China moved away from Gondwana and headed north.  In the late Devonian , the microcontinent of Kazakhstania collided with Siberia, shrinking the ocean even more.  The ocean closed when the North China craton collided with Siberia-Kazakstania continent in the Carboniferous , while the Paleo-Tethys Ocean expanded.
