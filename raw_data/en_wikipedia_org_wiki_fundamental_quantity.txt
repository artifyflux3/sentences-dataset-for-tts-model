A **base unit of measurement** (also referred to as a **base unit** or **fundamental unit**) is a [unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement") adopted for a _[base quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base\_quantity "Base quantity")_. A base quantity is one of a conventionally chosen subset of [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"), where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the others. The [SI base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_units "SI base units"), or _Systéme International d'unités_, consists of the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela.

A **unit multiple** (or **multiple of a unit**) is an integer [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_(mathematics) "Multiple (mathematics)") of a given unit; likewise a **unit submultiple** (or **submultiple of a unit**) is a [submultiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submultiple "Submultiple") or a [unit fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_fraction "Unit fraction") of a given unit.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-80000-1:2009-1)_[Unit prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_prefix "Unit prefix")_ are common base-10 or base-2 powers multiples and submultiples of units.

While a base unit is one that has been explicitly so designated,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-2) a **derived unit** is unit for a _[derived quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived\_quantity "Derived quantity")_, involving the combination of quantities with different units;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-80000-1:2009-1) several _[SI derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI\_derived\_units "SI derived units")_ are specially named. A _[coherent derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent\_derived\_unit "Coherent derived unit")_ involves no [conversion factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_factor "Conversion factor").

In the language of [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement "Measurement"), _[physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_quantities "Physical quantities")_ are [quantifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifiable "Quantifiable") aspects of the world, such as [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"), [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), and [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight "Weight"), and _units_ are used to describe their magnitude or quantity. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of a quantities can be generally be expressed as a product of powers of other units; for example, momentum is mass multiplied by velocity, while velocity is distance divided by time. These relationships are discussed in [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis"). Those that can be expressed in this fashion in terms of the base units are called [derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_unit_(measurement) "Derived unit (measurement)").

International System of Units
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Base_unit_of_measurement&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: International System of Units")]

In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), there are seven base units: [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram"), [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela"), [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere"), [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"), and [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)"). Several derived units have been defined, many with special names and symbols.

In 2019 the seven SI base units were redefined in terms of seven defining constants. Therefore the SI base units are no longer necessary but were retained because for historical and practical reasons.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-Brochure9_2019-3) See _[2019 revision of the SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\_revision\_of\_the\_SI "2019 revision of the SI")_.

A set of base dimensions of quantity is a minimal set of units such that every physical quantity can be expressed in terms of this set. The traditional base dimensions are [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"), [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), and [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), but in principle, other base quantities could be used. [Electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") could be used instead of charge or [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") could be used instead of length. Some physicists have not recognized temperature as a base dimension since it simply expresses the energy per particle per degree of freedom which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-4) Duff argues that only dimensionless values have physical meaning and all dimensional units are human constructs.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-hep-th1412.2040-5)

There are other relationships between physical quantities that can be expressed by means of fundamental constants, and to some extent it is an arbitrary decision whether to retain the fundamental constant as a quantity with dimensions or simply to define it as unity or a fixed [dimensionless number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity "Dimensionless quantity"), and reduce the number of explicit base quantities by one. The [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological "Ontological") issue is whether these fundamental constants really exist as dimensional or dimensionless quantities. This is equivalent to treating length as the same as time or understanding electric charge as a combination of quantities of mass, length, and time which may seem less natural than thinking of temperature as measuring the same material as energy (which is expressible in terms of mass, length, and time).

For instance, time and distance are related to each other by the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), _c_, which is a fundamental constant. It is possible to use this relationship to eliminate either the base unit of time or that of distance. Similar considerations apply to the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), _h_, which relates energy (with dimension expressible in terms of mass, length and time) to frequency (with dimension expressible in terms of time). In theoretical physics it is customary to use such units (natural units) in which _c_ = 1 and _ħ_ = 1. A similar choice can be applied to the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity"), _ε_ 0.

*   One could eliminate either the metre or the second by setting _c_ to unity (or to any other fixed dimensionless number).
*   One could then eliminate the kilogram by setting _ħ_ to a dimensionless number.
*   One could eliminate the ampere by setting either the vacuum permittivity _ε_ 0 or the [elementary charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge")_e_ to a dimensionless number.
*   One could eliminate the mole as a base unit by setting the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant")_N_ A to 1. This is natural as it is a technical scaling constant.
*   One could eliminate the kelvin as it can be argued that temperature simply expresses the energy per particle per [degree of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_freedom "Degree of freedom"), which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Another way of saying this is that the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant")_k_ B is a technical scaling constant and could be set to a fixed dimensionless number.
*   Similarly, one could eliminate the candela, as that is defined in terms of other physical quantities via a technical scaling constant, _K_ cd.
*   That leaves one base dimension and an associated base unit, but there are several fundamental constants left to eliminate that too – for instance, one could use _G_, the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), _m_ e, the [electron rest mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_rest_mass "Electron rest mass"), or Λ, the [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant").

The preferred choices vary by the field in physics. Using natural units leaves every physical quantity expressed as a dimensionless number, which is noted by physicists disputing the existence of incompatible base quantities.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-hep-th1412.2040-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_quantity#cite_note-7)

Because, however, of the arbitrary character of dimensions, as presented so ably by Bridgman, the choice and number of fundamental units are arbitrary.
