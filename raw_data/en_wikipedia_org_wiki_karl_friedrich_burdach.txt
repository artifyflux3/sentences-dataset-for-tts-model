He was the first to use the word "biology" and was a pioneer of neuroanatomy .

Life [ edit ] Burdach came from a family of physicians in Leipzig. He graduated in medicine at Leipzig in 1800 and trained in Vienna;  became professor of physiology in the University of Dorpat in 1811, and four years later took a similar position at the University of Königsberg . He was influenced into Natural Philosophy by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph  von Schelling (1775- 1854).

[ citation needed ] He provided in 1822 the name, due to the arching shape of its longest fibres, of the arcuate fasciculus , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the term amygdala , [ 3 ] and in 1800 the name " Biology " in the modern sense of the term. He used the word biology and morphology as footnotes in his book Propädeutik zum Studium der gesammten Heilkunst . Burdach was an advocate of vitalism . He believed in a life force that "created the whole world and produced each living thing." [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Legacy [ edit ] Burdach's work on the anatomy of the brain and nervous system introduced a number of names. It was published in three volumes Vom Baue und Leben des Gehirns (1819-1826). The column of Burdach or fasciculus cuneatus , the lateral portion of the dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord is named for him.

[ 6 ] He differentiated the caudate nucleus from the putamen and identified the globus pallidus and its inner and outer segments.
