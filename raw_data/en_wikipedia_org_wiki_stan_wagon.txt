He is the author of multiple books on number theory , geometry, and computational mathematics, and is also known for his snow sculpture .

Biography [ edit ] Wagon was born in Montreal, to Sam and Diana (Idlovitch) Wagon.

[ 1 ] His sister Lila (Wagon) Hope-Simpson died in 2021.

[ 2 ] Wagon did his undergraduate studies at McGill University in Montreal, graduating in 1971. He earned his Ph.D. in 1975 from Dartmouth College , under the supervision of James Earl Baumgartner . He married mathematician Joan Hutchinson , and the two of them shared a single faculty position at Smith College and again at Macalester, where they moved in 1990.
