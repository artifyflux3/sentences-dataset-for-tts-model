More formally, a mathematical symbol is any grapheme used in mathematical formulas and expressions. As formulas and expressions are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics.

The most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet . The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the Hindu–Arabic numeral system . Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants . Letters are used for representing many other types of mathematical object . As the number of these types has increased, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters have also come to be used. For more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface ⁠ a , A , b , B , … … {\displaystyle \mathbf {a,A,b,B} ,\ldots } ⁠ , script typeface A , B , … … {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A,B}},\ldots } (the lower-case script face is rarely used because of the possible confusion with the standard face), German fraktur ⁠ a , A , b , B , … … {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a,A,b,B}},\ldots } ⁠ , and blackboard bold ⁠ N , Z , Q , R , C , H , F q {\displaystyle \mathbb {N,Z,Q,R,C,H,F} _{q}} ⁠ (the other letters are rarely used in this face, or their use is unconventional).  It is commonplace to use alphabets, fonts and typefaces to group symbols by type (for example, boldface is often used for vectors and uppercase for matrices ).

The use of specific Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see Variable § Conventional variable names and List of mathematical constants . However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as ∏ ∏ {\displaystyle \textstyle \prod {}} and ∑ ∑ {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum {}} .

These letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography ; others by deforming letter forms , as in the cases of ∈ ∈ {\displaystyle \in } and ∀ ∀ {\displaystyle \forall } . Others, such as + and = , were specially designed for mathematics.

Layout of this article [ edit ] Normally, entries of a glossary are structured by topics and sorted alphabetically. This is not possible here, as there is no natural order on symbols, and many symbols are used in different parts of mathematics with different meanings, often completely unrelated. Therefore, some arbitrary choices had to be made, which are summarized below.

The article is split into sections that are sorted by an increasing level of technicality. That is, the first sections contain the symbols that are encountered in most mathematical texts, and that are supposed to be known even by beginners. On the other hand, the last sections contain symbols that are specific to some area of mathematics and are ignored outside these areas. However, the long section on brackets has been placed near to the end, although most of its entries are elementary: this makes it easier to search for a symbol entry by scrolling.

Most symbols have multiple meanings that are generally distinguished either by the area of mathematics where they are used or by their syntax , that is, by their position inside a formula and the nature of the other parts of the formula that are close to them.

As readers may not be aware of the area of mathematics to which the symbol that they are looking for is related, the different meanings of a symbol are grouped in the section corresponding to their most common meaning.

When the meaning depends on the syntax, a symbol may have different entries depending on the syntax. For summarizing the syntax in the entry name, the symbol ◻ ◻ {\displaystyle \Box } is used for representing the neighboring parts of a formula that contains the symbol. See § Brackets for examples of use.

Most symbols have two printed versions. They can be displayed as Unicode characters, or in LaTeX format. With the Unicode version, using search engines and copy-pasting are easier. On the other hand, the LaTeX rendering is often much better (more aesthetic), and is generally considered a standard in mathematics. Therefore, in this article, the Unicode version of the symbols is used (when possible) for labelling their entry, and the LaTeX version is used in their description. So, for finding how to type a symbol in LaTeX, it suffices to look at the source of the article.

For most symbols, the entry name is the corresponding Unicode symbol. So, for searching the entry of a symbol, it suffices to type or copy the Unicode symbol into the search textbox. Similarly, when possible, the entry name of a symbol is also an anchor , which allows linking easily from another Wikipedia article. When an entry name contains special characters such as [,], and |, there is also an anchor, but one has to look at the article source to know it.

Finally, when there is an article on the symbol itself (not its mathematical meaning), it is linked to in the entry name.

Blackboard bold [ edit ] The blackboard bold typeface is widely used for denoting the basic number systems . These systems are often also denoted by the corresponding uppercase bold letter. A clear advantage of blackboard bold is that these symbols cannot be confused with anything else. This allows using them in any area of mathematics, without having to recall their definition.

If x is a variable depending on time, then x ˙ ˙ , {\displaystyle {\dot {x}},} read as "x dot", is its derivative with respect to time. In particular, if x represents a moving point, then x ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {x}}} is its velocity .

◻ ◻ ¨ ¨ {\displaystyle {\ddot {\Box }}} Newton's notation , for the second derivative : If x is a variable that represents a moving point, then x ¨ ¨ {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}} is its acceleration .

⁠ d □ / d □ ⁠ Leibniz's notation for the derivative , which is used in several slightly different ways.

1.  If y is a variable that depends on x , then d y d x {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x}}} , read as "d y over d x" (commonly shortened to "d y d x"), is the derivative of y with respect to x .

2.  If f is a function of a single variable x , then d f d x {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} f}{\mathrm {d} x}}} is the derivative of f , and d f d x ( a ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} f}{\mathrm {d} x}}(a)} is the value of the derivative at a .

3.

That is, d f d x = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x i d x i d x {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} f}{dx}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}}\,{\frac {\mathrm {d} x_{i}}{\mathrm {d} x}}} .

⁠ ∂ □ / ∂ □ ⁠ Partial derivative : If f ( x 1 , … … , x n ) {\displaystyle f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} is a function of several variables, ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x i {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}}} is the derivative with respect to the i th variable considered as an independent variable , the other variables being considered as constants.

⁠ 𝛿 □ / 𝛿 □ ⁠ Functional derivative : If f ( y 1 , … … , y n ) {\displaystyle f(y_{1},\ldots ,y_{n})} is a functional of several functions , δ δ f δ δ y i {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\delta f}{\delta y_{i}}}} is the functional derivative with respect to the n th function considered as an independent variable , the other functions being considered constant.

☡ Bourbaki dangerous bend symbol : Sometimes used in the margin to forewarn readers against serious errors, where they risk falling, or to mark a passage that is tricky on a first reading because of an especially subtle argument.

∴ Abbreviation of "therefore". Placed between two assertions, it means that the first one implies the second one. For example: "All humans are mortal, and Socrates is a human. ∴ Socrates is mortal." ∵ Abbreviation of "because" or "since". Placed between two assertions, it means that the first one is implied by the second one. For example: " 11 is prime ∵ it has no positive integer factors other than itself and one." ∋ 1.  Abbreviation of "such that". For example, x ∋ ∋ x > 3 {\displaystyle x\ni x>3} is normally printed " x such that x > 3 {\displaystyle x>3} ".

2.  Sometimes used for reversing the operands of ∈ ∈ {\displaystyle \in } ; that is, S ∋ ∋ x {\displaystyle S\ni x} has the same meaning as x ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle x\in S} . See ∈ in § Set theory .

∝ Abbreviation of "is proportional to".

Miscellaneous [ edit ] !

1.

Factorial : if n is a positive integer , n !

is the product of the first n positive integers, and is read as "n factorial".

2.

Double factorial : if n is a positive integer , n !!

is the product of all positive integers up to n with the same parity as n ; that is, if n is odd, the product of all odd integers from 1 up to and including n , and if n is even, the product of all even integers, up to and including n . It is read as "the double factorial of n ".

3.

Subfactorial : if n is a positive integer, !

n is the number of derangements of a set of n elements, and is read as "the subfactorial of n".

* Many different uses in mathematics; see Asterisk § Mathematics .

| 1.

Divisibility : if m and n are two integers, m ∣ ∣ n {\displaystyle m\mid n} means that m divides n evenly.

2.  In set-builder notation , it is used as a separator meaning "such that"; see {□ | □} .

3.

Restriction of a function : if f is a function , and S is a subset of its domain , then f | S {\displaystyle f|_{S}} is the function with S as a domain that equals f on S .

4.

Conditional probability : P ( X ∣ ∣ E ) {\displaystyle P(X\mid E)} denotes the probability of X given that the event E occurs. Also denoted P ( X / E ) {\displaystyle P(X/E)} ; see " / ".

5.  For several uses as brackets (in pairs or with ⟨ and ⟩ ) see § Other brackets .

∤ Non-divisibility : n ∤ ∤ m {\displaystyle n\nmid m} means that n is not a divisor of m .

∥ 1.  Denotes parallelism in elementary geometry : if PQ and RS are two lines , P Q ∥ ∥ R S {\displaystyle PQ\parallel RS} means that they are parallel.

2.

Parallel – the harmonic sum – an arithmetical operation used in electrical engineering for summing two impedances wired in parallel (e.g.

parallel resistors ) or two admittances wired in series (e.g.

series capacitors ): x ∥ ∥ y = 1 1 x + 1 y = x y x + y .

{\displaystyle \ x\parallel y={\frac {1}{\ {\frac {\ 1\ }{x}}+{\frac {\ 1\ }{y}}\ }}={\frac {x\ y}{\ x+y\ }}~.} 3.  Used in pairs as brackets, denotes a norm ; see ||□|| .

4.

Concatenation : Typically used in computer science, x | | y {\displaystyle x\mathbin {\vert \vert } y} is said to represent the value resulting from appending the digits of y to the end of x .

5.

D KL ( P ∥ ∥ Q ) {\displaystyle {\displaystyle D_{\text{KL}}(P\parallel Q)}} , denotes a statistical distance or measure of how one probability distribution P is different from a second, reference probability distribution Q.

∦ Sometimes used for denoting that two lines are not parallel; for example, P Q ∦ R S {\displaystyle PQ\not \parallel RS} .

⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle \perp } 1.  Denotes perpendicularity and orthogonality . For example, if A, B, C are three points in a Euclidean space , then A B ⊥ ⊥ A C {\displaystyle AB\perp AC} means that the line segments AB and AC are perpendicular , and form a right angle .

2.  For the similar symbol, see ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } .

⊙ Hadamard product of power series : if S = ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ s i x i {\displaystyle \textstyle S=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }s_{i}x^{i}} and T = ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ t i x i {\displaystyle \textstyle T=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }t_{i}x^{i}} , then S ⊙ ⊙ T = ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ s i t i x i {\displaystyle \textstyle S\odot T=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }s_{i}t_{i}x^{i}} . Possibly, ⊙ ⊙ {\displaystyle \odot } is also used instead of ○ for the Hadamard product of matrices .

^ The LaTeX equivalent to both Unicode symbols ∘ and ○ is \circ. The Unicode symbol that has the same size as \circ depends on the browser and its implementation. In some cases ∘ is so small that it can be confused with an interpoint , and ○ looks similar as \circ. In other cases, ○ is too large for denoting a binary operation, and it is ∘ that looks like \circ. As LaTeX is commonly considered as the standard for mathematical typography, and it does not distinguish these two Unicode symbols, they are considered here as having the same mathematical meaning.
