( May 2021 ) Numerical analysis and symbolic computation had been in most important place of the subject, but other kind of them is also growing now. A useful mathematical knowledge of such as algorism which exist before the invention of electronic computer , helped to mathematical software developing. On the other hand, by the growth of computing power (such as seeing on Moore's law ), the new treatment (for example, a new kind of technique such as data assimilation which combined numerical analysis and statistics ) needing conversely the progress of the mathematical science or applied mathematics .

The progress of mathematical information presentation such as TeX or MathML [ 2 ] will demand to evolution form formula manipulation language to true mathematics manipulation language (notwithstanding the problem that whether mathematical theory is inconsistent or not). And popularization of general purpose mathematical software, special purpose mathematical software [ 3 ] so called one purpose software which used special subject will alive with adapting for environment progress at normalization of platform. So the diversity of mathematical software will be kept.

Solvers [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Solver .

[ edit ] A solver is a piece of mathematical software, possibly in the form of a stand-alone computer program or as a software library , that 'solves' a mathematical problem. A solver takes problem descriptions in some sort of generic form and calculates their solution. In a solver, the emphasis is on creating a program or library that can easily be applied to other problems of similar type.

Software calculator [ edit ] Main article: Software calculator See also: List of software calculators A software calculator allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations, like addition, multiplication, exponentiation and trigonometry. Data input is typically manual, and the output is a text label.

Computer algebra systems [ edit ] Main article: List of computer algebra systems Many mathematical suites are computer algebra systems that use symbolic mathematics .  They are designed to solve classical algebra equations and problems in human readable notation.

Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the IMSL , NMath and NAG libraries ; a free alternative is the GNU Scientific Library .  A different approach is taken by the Numerical Recipes library, where emphasis is placed on clear understanding of algorithms.

Many computer algebra systems (listed above) can also be used for numerical computations.
