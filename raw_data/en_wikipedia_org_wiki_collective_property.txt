[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ nb 1 ] The breadth or narrowness of the group can range from a whole society to a set of coworkers in a particular enterprise (such as one collective farm ). In the latter narrower sense, collective ownership is distinguished from common ownership and the commons , which implies open access, the holding of assets in common, and the negation of ownership as such. Collective ownership of the means of production is the defining characteristic of socialism , [ 3 ] where collective ownership can refer to society-wide ownership ( social ownership ) or to cooperative ownership by an organization's members. When contrasted with public ownership , collective ownership commonly refers to group ownership (such as a producer cooperative).

[ 4 ] See also [ edit ] Condominium Employee stock ownership Market socialism Mutualization Personal property Possession (law) Worker cooperative Workers' self-management Notes [ edit ] ^ The private property definition (for example that of a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities) may not correspond to its colloquial usage in socialist contexts, where there is a distinction between personal property and private property (the means of production ).

Personal property , also called possession , includes items intended for personal use (e.g. one's toothbrush, clothes, homes, vehicles, and sometimes money). It must be gained in a socially fair manner and the owner has a distributive right to exclude others (e.g. the right to command a fair share of personal property).

Marxist socialists argue that private property is a social relation between the owner and persons deprived (not a relationship between person and thing), e.g. artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts, and seas—these generate capital for the owner without the owner necessarily having to perform any physical labor. Conversely, those who perform labor using somebody else's private property are considered deprived of the value of their work in Marxist theory , and are instead given a salary that is disjointed from the value generated by the worker. In this context, private property and ownership means ownership of the means of production, not personal possessions. To socialists, including anarchists , private property refers to capital or the means of production while personal property refers to non-capital and consumer goods and services.

There are three broad forms of property ownership – private, public, and collective (cooperative). Under private ownership, the three ownership rights ultimately belong to individuals, subject to limitations of disposition, use, and earnings. Under public ownership, these rights belong to the state. With collective ownership, property rights belong to the members of the collective.

Socialism is an economic system characterized by state or collective ownership of the means of production, land, and capital.

According to these definitions, socialism can be a theoretical or political idea that advocates a particular way of organizing economic and political life. It can be an actual economic system in which the state owns and controls resources, or it can be a system of collective or group ownership of property.
