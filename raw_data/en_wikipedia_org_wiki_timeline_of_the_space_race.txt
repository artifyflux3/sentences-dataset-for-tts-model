( October 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) This is a timeline of achievements in Soviet and United States spaceflight , spanning the Cold War era of nationalistic competition known as the Space Race .

This list is limited to first achievements by the USSR and USA which were important during the Space Race in terms of public perception and/or technical innovation. This excludes first uses of specific on-board equipment and new scientific discoveries, or achievements by other countries.
