Togo's geographic coordinates are a latitude of 8° north and a longitude of  1°10′ east. It is bordered by three countries: Benin to the east, with 644 km (400 mi) of border; Burkina Faso to the north, with 126 km (78 mi) of border; and Ghana , with 877 km (545 mi) of border. To the south Togo has 56 km (35 mi) of coastline along the Bight of Benin of the Gulf of Guinea in the North Atlantic Ocean . Togo stretches 579 km (360 mi) north from the Gulf and is only 160 km (99 mi) wide at the broadest point. In total, Togo has an area of 56,785 km 2 (21,925 sq mi), of which 54,385 km 2 (20,998 sq mi) is land and 2,400 km 2 (927 sq mi) is water.

Togo is commonly divided into six geographic regions. In the south are low-lying sandy beaches. The coastal region is narrow and followed by tidal flats and shallow lagoons . There are also over 200 lakes, the largest of which is Lake Togo .

Physical geography [ edit ] The country consists primarily of two savanna plains regions separated by a southwest–northeast range of hills (the Chaîne du Togo ). In the north lies the Ouatchi Plateau . This plateau is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) wide and located at an altitude of 60 to 90 metres (197 to 295 ft) above sea level.

Terre de Barre is another name for this region, in use because of the reddish leached soil which is rich in iron . This southern area of Togo has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion .

Northeast of the Ouatchi Plateau lies a tableland. At its highest this region is about 500 metres (1,640 ft) above sea level. The area is drained by the Mono River and its tributaries, including the Ogou River .

To the west and the southwest of the tableland lie the Togo Mountains . These mountains run across the central region of Togo, ranging from the southwest to the northeast. The mountain range reaches into Benin where it is known as the Atakora Mountains and Ghana where it is known as the Akwapim Hills . The highest mountain in Togo is Mount Agou with a height of 986 metres (3,235 ft).

[ 1 ] North of the Togo Mountains lies a sandstone plateau through which the Oti River flows. The vegetation is characterized by savanna. The River Oti which drains the plateau is one of the main tributaries of the River Volta .

In the far northwest of Togo lies a higher region which is characterized by its rocks: granite and gneiss . The cliffs of Dapaong (Dapango) are located in this part of Togo.

The five Regions of Togo span its climatic zones from the coastal equatorial climate of the south to the tropical savanna at the north. Data for Lomé, Sokodé and Mango are shown in the climate tables Climate [ edit ] Almost all of Togo has a tropical savanna climate ( Köppen Aw ). Average temperatures ranging from 27.5 °C (81.5 °F) on the coast to about 30 °C (86 °F) in the northernmost regions. There is a dry season between November and March dominated by the desert winds of the Harmattan , which bring less humid and less unpleasant weather. To the south there are two seasons of rain, the first between April and July and the second weaker rainy season between September and November. In this region rainfall is much lower than in the rest of southern West Africa due to divergent coast-parallel winds between mid-July and mid-September creating a short, foggy secondary dry season.
