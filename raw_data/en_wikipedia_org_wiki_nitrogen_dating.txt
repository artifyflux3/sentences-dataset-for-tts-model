[ 1 ] For human bones, the assumption of about 5% nitrogen in the bone, mostly in the form of collagen , allows fairly consistent dating techniques.

[ 2 ] Compared to other dating techniques, Nitrogen dating can be unreliable because leaching from bone is dependent on temperature, soil pH , ground water, and the presence of microorganism that digest nitrogen rich elements, like collagen.

[ 2 ] [ 1 ] Some studies compare nitrogen dating results with dating results from methods like fluorine absorption dating to create more accurate estimates.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Though some situations, like thin porous bones might more rapidly change the dating created by multiple methods.
