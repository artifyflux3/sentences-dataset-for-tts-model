[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Education [ edit ] Fauvel was from Scotland , where his father was a principal .

Ian Blair was a cousin.

John attended Trinity College, Glenalmond . He then studied mathematics at the University of Essex , where he graduated in 1970, and at the University of Warwick , where he obtained his master's degree in 1973. In 1977, he obtained his MPhil from the University of Warwick under the supervision of David Orme Tall, with a thesis entitled Fuzzy Theory .

From 1992 to 1996, he directed an international study group on the relations between history and mathematics pedagogy, which is affiliated with the International Commission for Mathematical Education (ICMI), and in 2000 he co-directed a major study of ICMI. In 1998, he was invited lecturer by the New Zealand Mathematical Society .

[ 1 ] Fauvel was a visiting scholar in the Mathematics Department at Colorado College on several occasions, including one on a Fulbright Fellowship during the Winter and Spring of 1999.

Fauvel died on 12 May 2001 of complications from liver disease.

[ 1 ] Publications [ edit ] Fauvel is known as an editor of books on the history of mathematics , [ 4 ] several of which have been translated.
