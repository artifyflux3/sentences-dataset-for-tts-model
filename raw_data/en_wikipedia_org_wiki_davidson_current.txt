The current is active year-round at 650 feet (200 meters) below sea level, but surfaces during the winter months, generally from mid-November through mid-February.

[ 1 ] In these months, northerly winds weaken and are replaced to some extent by southwesterly winds.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The Davidson Current was discovered by the American geodesist, astronomer, geographer, surveyor and engineer George Davidson , [ 5 ] who was associated with the early California Academy of Sciences (CAS) in San Francisco, California.
