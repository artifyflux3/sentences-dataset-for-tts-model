A contemporary copperplate by Matthäus Merian , 1617 Born December 27, 1566 Breslau , Silesia , Crown of Bohemia (now Wrocław, Poland ) Died June 21, 1621 (aged 54) Prague , Bohemia , Crown of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic ) Known for physician politician philosopher Scientific career Doctoral advisor Hieronymus Fabricius Doctoral students Daniel Sennert Jan Jesenius , also written as Jessenius ( German : Johannes Jessenius , Hungarian : Jeszenszky János , Slovak : Ján Jesenský ; December 27, 1566 – June 21, 1621), was a Bohemian physician , politician and philosopher .

Life [ edit ] Early years [ edit ] He was from an old noble family, the House of Jeszenszky , originally from the Kingdom of Hungary . He presented himself in his own works as eques Ungarus ("Hungarian knight ").

[ 1 ] According to scholar publications, he had Slovak , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Polish or German [ 1 ] roots. His father, Boldizsár Jeszenszky de Nagyjeszen, left Turóc County (today the Turiec region in Slovakia ) because of the Ottomans' military campaign against Upper Hungary and settled down in Silesia in 1555. He married Marta Schülerin, who came from a wealthy German bourgeois family.

[ 5 ] Jesenius was born in Breslau (Wrocław), where he studied at the Elisabeth gymnasium. From 1583 he studied at the University of Wittenberg , from 1585 at the University of Leipzig , and from 1588 at the University of Padua .

Professional achievements [ edit ] His most important philosophical work was Zoroaster (1593), a work of universal philosophy which attempted to recover the lost wisdom of the ancients.

From 1593 Jesenius was the physician of the Prince of Saxony , and from 1594 professor of anatomy at the University of Wittenberg . After 1600 he settled down in Prague as professor and anatomical consultant for Rudolf II, King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor .

In 1600 he attracted considerable public interest by performing a public autopsy in Prague. (His notes on the autopsy were published in 2005 by Karolinum , a publishing house of  Charles University of Prague.) [ 6 ] In 1617 he was elected rector of Charles University of Prague .

Political career [ edit ] He was also a diplomat and orator, and after the dethroning of Habsburgs in the Crown of Bohemia , he took several diplomatic missions for Bohemian estates and for the newly elected king Frederick of the Palatinate .

In 1618, Jesenius was arrested in Pressburg (Bratislava) after being sent as a deputy by the Bohemian estates, and was held in a prison of Vienna . In December, he was released in exchange for two Habsburg captives. There is a legend that, before his release, he wrote the inscription IMMMM on the wall of his prison cell. Ferdinand explained this as Imperator Mathias Mense Martio Morietur ( Latin for " Emperor Mathias will die in the month of March"), and he wrote another prophecy next to it: Iesseni, Mentiris, Mala Morte Morieris ("Jesenius, you lie, you will die a horrible death").

Both predictions came true: Emperor Mathias died in March 1619, and Jesenius was arrested after the defeat of King Frederick of Bohemia by Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620 ( Battle of White Mountain ) and executed, along with 26 other Bohemian estates leaders , on the Old Town Square in 1621.

Legacy [ edit ] Commemoration [ edit ] Hungary stamp #5874 commemorating Jan Jessenius Jesenius was honored during the 450th anniversary of his birth (2016) by a postage stamp jointly issued by Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, & Slovakia.
