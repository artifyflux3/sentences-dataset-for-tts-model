The growth is exceptional for a mature business, and there’s a holistic strategy that works… it’s a special business.” In 2017, Edward Elgar Publishing was awarded the prestigious Fox Williams Independent Publisher of the Year Award at the Independent Publishers Guild (IPG) Awards.

[ 10 ] As a "resolutely forward-looking business", expanding into law publishing and building digital platform Elgaronline, the judges praised EEP for "punching way above its weight despite competition from far larger operators". "Edward Elgar produced an outstanding performance in a difficult market in 2016," the judges said. "It is a very well run and profitable company with excellent partnerships, great author care and consistently superb customer service." At the same awards ceremony, EEP was also awarded the ProQuest Academic & Professional Publisher of the Year Award 2017.
