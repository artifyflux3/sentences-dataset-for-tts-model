Establishment [ edit ] Following China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War , intellectuals – including Kang Youwei , Liang Qichao , and Yan Fu – called for reforms to the country's education system. In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor , as part of the Hundred Days' Reform , authorised the creation of the Imperial University of Peking [ 6 ] ( Chinese : 京師大學堂 ; pinyin : Jīngshī Dàxuétáng ; lit.

'Capital Grand Study Hall').

[ 7 ] The Imperial University was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the royal charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority.

[ 6 ] William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president.

[ 7 ] Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. The university survived with altered objectives and reduced scope. It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.

[ 6 ] Following the Xinhai Revolution , the Imperial University of Peking was renamed "Government University of Peking" in 1912 and then "National University of Peking" in 1919 [ 7 ] ( simplified Chinese : 国立北京大学 ; traditional Chinese : 國立北京大學 ; pinyin : Guólì Běijīng Dàxué ).

Early Republic of China period (1916–1927) [ edit ] The noted scholar Cai Yuanpei was appointed president on 4 January 1917, and helped transform Peking University into the country's largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students.

On 1 May 1919, some students of Peking University learned that the Treaty of Versailles would allow Japan to receive Germany's colonising rights in Shandong province. An assembly at Peking University that included these students and representatives from other universities in Beijing was quickly organised. On 4 May, students from thirteen universities marched to Tiananmen to protest the terms of Treaty of Versailles , demanded the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the treaty. Demonstrators also demanded the immediate resignation of three officials: Cao Rulin , Minister of the Ministry of Transportation , Zhang Zongxiang, China's Ambassador to Japan and Lu Zongyu, Minister of Currency, who they believed were in cooperation with Japanese. The protest ended up with some protesters being beaten and arrested, and Cao Rulin's house burned by protesters. Following the protest on 4 May, students, workers and merchants from nearly all China's major cities went on strike and boycotted Japanese goods in China. The Beiyang government eventually agreed to release the arrested students and fired the three officials under intense public pressure, China's representatives in Paris refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles.

The university's second president was educator, politician, and revolutionary Cai Yuanpei , who was the first to bring European university concept to China after a stint at Free University of Berlin and fought for the school to be named "Beijing Daxue ". Cai equally protected the freedom of expression of his staff and students, allowing a plethora of influential journals, including New Youth and New Tide.

[ 114 ] Peking University students participated heavily in the May Fourth Movement, spurned and sometimes also held back by staff from the time.

More recently, the university has been home to influential economist Michael Pettis .
