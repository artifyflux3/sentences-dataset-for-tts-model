Hopkins Doctoral students Dustin Clausen Jacob Alexander Lurie (born December 7, 1977) is an American mathematician who is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study .

[ 1 ] In 2014, Lurie received a MacArthur Fellowship . Lurie's research interests are algebraic geometry , topology , and homotopy theory .

Life [ edit ] When he was a student in the Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School , Lurie took part in the International Mathematical Olympiad , where he won a gold medal with a perfect score in 1994.

[ 2 ] In 1996 he took first place in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and was featured in a front-page story in the Washington Times .

[ 3 ] Lurie earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard College in 2000 and was awarded in the same year the Morgan Prize for his undergraduate thesis on Lie algebras .

[ 4 ] He earned his Ph.D.

from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under supervision of Michael J. Hopkins , in 2004 with a thesis on derived algebraic geometry . In 2007, he became associate professor at MIT , and in 2009 he became professor at Harvard University .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2019, he joined the Institute for Advanced Study as a permanent faculty member in mathematics.

[ 7 ] Lurie is Jewish .

[ 8 ] Mathematical work [ edit ] Lurie's research interests started with logic and the theory of surreal numbers when he was in high school.

[ 9 ] He is best known for his work, starting with his thesis, on infinity categories and derived algebraic geometry . Derived algebraic geometry is a way of infusing homotopical methods into algebraic geometry , with two purposes: deeper insight into algebraic geometry (e.g. into intersection theory ) and the use of methods of algebraic geometry in stable homotopy theory . The latter area is the topic of Lurie's work on elliptic cohomology . Infinity categories (in the form of André Joyal 's quasi-categories) are a convenient framework to do homotopy theory in abstract settings. They are the main topic of his book Higher Topos Theory .

Another part of Lurie's work is his article on topological field theories , where he sketches a classification of extended field theories using the language of infinity categories ( cobordism hypothesis ). In  joint work with Dennis Gaitsgory , he used his non-abelian Poincaré duality in an algebraic-geometric setting, to prove the Siegel mass formula for function fields .

Lurie was one of the inaugural winners of the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014, "for his work on the foundations of higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry; for the classification of fully extended topological quantum field theories; and for providing a moduli-theoretic interpretation of elliptic cohomology." [ 10 ] Lurie was also awarded a MacArthur "genius grant" Fellowship in 2014.
