[ 2 ] : xl It was said to have begun at a time of 10 −44 seconds, or at 10 −8 seconds, [ 3 ] and ended at 10 −4 seconds. The temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and anti-matter in thermal equilibrium . After the discovery of quarks and gluons in the 1970s the model based on hadrons no longer made sense.

[ 2 ] However, hadron-antihadron pairs were only abundant for a brief time between about 5×10 −5 seconds, the time of the QCD phase transition , and about 7×10 −5 seconds, when the temperature of the universe dropped below the pion mass.

[ 4 ] Before the QCD phase transition, during the quark epoch , the universe was hot enough that quarks did not combine to form hadrons. At temperatures below the pion mass, most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving the Universe dominated by photons, neutrinos and electron-positron pairs. This subsequent period is referred to as the lepton era .

[ 3 ] Constituents [ edit ] Combining particle physics models with the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmological expansion, suggests when expansion cooled the universe to a transition temperature around 150MeV hadron formation was favored. From this time until neutrino decoupling , antimatter is an important constiutent of the universe.
