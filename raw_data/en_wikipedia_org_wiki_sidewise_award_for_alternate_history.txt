Overview [ edit ] The awards take their name from the 1934 short story " Sidewise in Time " by Murray Leinster , in which a strange storm causes portions of Earth to swap places with their analogs from other timelines.

The awards were created by Steven H Silver , Evelyn C. Leeper , and Robert B. Schmunk. Over the years, the number of judges has fluctuated between three and eight and have included judges in the United States , United Kingdom , Canada and South Africa .

Two awards are normally presented each year, usually at WorldCon or at NASFiC . The Short-Form award is presented to a work under 60,000 words in length. The Long-Form award is presented to a work or works longer than 60,000 words, which may include a single novel or a multi-volume series. The judges have four times also recognized an individual with a Special Achievement Award in recognition for works published prior to the award's inception or for other contributions to the genre.

Award winners [ edit ] Note: The Sidewise Awards are announced as for the year of publication rather than by the year of award presentation.
