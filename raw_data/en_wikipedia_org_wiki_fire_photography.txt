People who practise this form of photography are called fire photographers .

Since fire photography involves being close to dangerous situations, fire photographers must have special skills and knowledge about emergency incident scenes, operations, health, and safety.

[ 1 ] Fire photographers are often required to wear firefighter protective equipment .

[ 2 ] Uses of fire photography [ edit ] The work of fire photographers encompasses multiple applications. These include: Investigation Training Fire prevention Occupational health and safety Post-incident analysis Improvement of the public's view on emergency work Strengthening of sense of belonging for firefighters Involvement with fire departments [ edit ] Fire photographers may or may not be directly employed by fire departments .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] They provide a specialized photography service which may involve a fee per photograph. Access to safety perimeters can be an issue for fire photographers; thus, they usually develop good relationships with their local fire department to improve access to fire scenes.  Such access may, at the fire department's discretion, require additional training or other arrangements.

[ 6 ] Large departments do often have professional photo service units, such as those in New York City and Chicago.

Certification [ edit ] A formal fire photographer certification process is being drafted by the International Organization of Fire Photography.

[ 7 ] The intent of this certification is to attest that an individual has sufficient training, skills and knowledge in relevant areas (health & safety, firefighting operations, etc.) to operate within a safe perimeter of an emergency incident scene.
