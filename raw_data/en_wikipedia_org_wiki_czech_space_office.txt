It fulfilled tasks of the national information and advisory centre for the academia on opportunities to enter the international space scene and on space activities in the Czech Republic. It was a non-profit association created in November 2003 [ 1 ] that terminated operations in 2024 and asked IAF to be removed as a member on the same year. The bodies of the association were the management board, the supervisory board and the managing director .

[ 4 ] The CSO's work includes gathering and archiving information about Czech space projects as well as the information on foreign space programmes having importance for the development of Czech space activities. It covers the management of databases of the Czech institutions both academia and industrial.

[ 5 ] Moreover, the Czech Space Office also offers information on the Czech space activities and advertises their results inside and outside the country. It arranges seminars and conferences and supports the attendance of Czech institutions in specialized exhibitions dealing with space technologies.

Last but not least, CSO serves as an information point for the general public and academia. It prepares information and advertisement materials describing capacities and potentials of the Czech Republic academia in space, documents about their space activities and their results. It also communicates examples and information on the benefits of the space projects to schools and media.

[ 6 ] Finally, the Czech Space Office should not be confused with a Czech space agency. Such an agency does not yet exist, though it is envisaged in the National Space Plan. Until its establishment, the coordination of Czech space activities and the representation of the Czech Republic in ESA and EU space bodies is being coordinated by the Ministry of Transport. See the official space pages of the Ministry of Transport, which also include the government-approved National Space Plan document in English.

Czech companies and research institutions have contributed to the ESA's Proba-3 mission, which is focused on demonstrating new formation flying techniques.

[ 9 ] The Czech Republic is involved in the Copernicus Programme, Europe's Earth observation programme, providing data for environmental monitoring and disaster management.

[ 10 ] The Czech National Space Plan outlines the strategic objectives and priorities for the country's space activities. It focuses on strengthening national capabilities in space technologies and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and government.
