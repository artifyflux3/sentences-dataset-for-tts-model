It is separated on the east from the Okinawa plate by a rift that forms the Okinawa Trough which is a back-arc basin , on the south by the Sunda plate and the Philippine Sea plate , and on the north and west by the Eurasian plate . The Longmenshan Fault on the latter border was the site of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake .

[ 1 ] The Yangtze plate was formed by the disaggregation of the Rodinia supercontinent 750 million years ago, in the Neoproterozoic era .  South China rifted away from the Gondwana supercontinent in the Silurian .  During the formation of the great supercontinent Pangaea , South China was a smaller, separate continent located off the east coast of the supercontinent and drifting northward.  In the Triassic , the Yangtze plate collided with the North China plate , thereby connecting with Pangaea, and formed the Sichuan basin . In the Cenozoic, the Yangtze plate was influenced by the collision of the Indian plate and Eurasian plate creating the uplifting of the Longmen Mountains .

[ 2 ] Its southward motion is accommodated along the Red River fault .
