It is sometimes referred to as an equidimensional equation. Because of its particularly simple equidimensional structure, the differential equation can be solved explicitly.

The equation [ edit ] Let y ( n ) ( x ) be the n th derivative of the unknown function y ( x ) . Then a Cauchy–Euler equation of order n has the form a n x n y ( n ) ( x ) + a n − − 1 x n − − 1 y ( n − − 1 ) ( x ) + ⋯ ⋯ + a 0 y ( x ) = 0.

{\displaystyle a_{n}x^{n}y^{(n)}(x)+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}y^{(n-1)}(x)+\dots +a_{0}y(x)=0.} The substitution x = e u {\displaystyle x=e^{u}} (that is, u = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle u=\ln(x)} ; for x < 0 {\displaystyle x<0} , in which one might replace all instances of x {\displaystyle x} by | x | {\displaystyle |x|} , extending the solution's domain to R ∖ ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \setminus \{0\}} ) can be used to reduce this equation to a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. Alternatively, the trial solution y = x m {\displaystyle y=x^{m}} can be used to solve the equation directly, yielding the basic solutions.

[ 1 ] Second order – solving through trial solution [ edit ] Typical solution curves for a second-order Euler–Cauchy equation for the case of two real roots Typical solution curves for a second-order Euler–Cauchy equation for the case of a double root Typical solution curves for a second-order Euler–Cauchy equation for the case of complex roots The most common Cauchy–Euler equation is the second-order equation, which appears in a number of physics and engineering applications, such as when solving Laplace's equation in polar coordinates. The second order Cauchy–Euler equation is [ 1 ] [ 2 ] x 2 d 2 y d x 2 + a x d y d x + b y = 0.

{\displaystyle x^{2}{\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}+ax{\frac {dy}{dx}}+by=0.} We assume a trial solution [ 1 ] y = x m .

{\displaystyle y=x^{m}.} Differentiating gives d y d x = m x m − − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=mx^{m-1}} and d 2 y d x 2 = m ( m − − 1 ) x m − − 2 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}=m\left(m-1\right)x^{m-2}.} Substituting into the original equation leads to requiring that x 2 ( m ( m − − 1 ) x m − − 2 ) + a x ( m x m − − 1 ) + b ( x m ) = 0 {\displaystyle x^{2}\left(m\left(m-1\right)x^{m-2}\right)+ax\left(mx^{m-1}\right)+b\left(x^{m}\right)=0} Rearranging and factoring gives the indicial equation m 2 + ( a − − 1 ) m + b = 0.

{\displaystyle m^{2}+\left(a-1\right)m+b=0.} We then solve for m . There are three cases of interest: Case 1 of two distinct roots, m 1 and m 2 ; Case 2 of one real repeated root, m ; Case 3 of complex roots, α ± βi .

In case 1, the solution is y = c 1 x m 1 + c 2 x m 2 {\displaystyle y=c_{1}x^{m_{1}}+c_{2}x^{m_{2}}} In case 2, the solution is y = c 1 x m ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + c 2 x m {\displaystyle y=c_{1}x^{m}\ln(x)+c_{2}x^{m}} To get to this solution, the method of reduction of order must be applied, after having found one solution y = x m .

In case 3, the solution is y = c 1 x α α cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ) + c 2 x α α sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle y=c_{1}x^{\alpha }\cos(\beta \ln(x))+c_{2}x^{\alpha }\sin(\beta \ln(x))} α α = Re ⁡ ⁡ ( m ) {\displaystyle \alpha =\operatorname {Re} (m)} β β = Im ⁡ ⁡ ( m ) {\displaystyle \beta =\operatorname {Im} (m)} For c 1 , c 2 ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2}\in \mathbb {R} } .

This form of the solution is derived by setting x = e t and using Euler's formula .

Second order – solution through change of variables [ edit ] x 2 d 2 y d x 2 + a x d y d x + b y = 0 {\displaystyle x^{2}{\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}+ax{\frac {dy}{dx}}+by=0} We operate the variable substitution defined by t = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle t=\ln(x).} y ( x ) = φ φ ( ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ) = φ φ ( t ) .

{\displaystyle y(x)=\varphi (\ln(x))=\varphi (t).} Differentiating gives d y d x = 1 x d φ φ d t {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {1}{x}}{\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}} d 2 y d x 2 = 1 x 2 ( d 2 φ φ d t 2 − − d φ φ d t ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}={\frac {1}{x^{2}}}\left({\frac {d^{2}\varphi }{dt^{2}}}-{\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\right).} Substituting φ φ ( t ) {\displaystyle \varphi (t)} the differential equation becomes d 2 φ φ d t 2 + ( a − − 1 ) d φ φ d t + b φ φ = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\varphi }{dt^{2}}}+(a-1){\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}+b\varphi =0.} This equation in φ φ ( t ) {\displaystyle \varphi (t)} is solved via its characteristic polynomial λ λ 2 + ( a − − 1 ) λ λ + b = 0.

{\displaystyle \lambda ^{2}+(a-1)\lambda +b=0.} Now let λ λ 1 {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} and λ λ 2 {\displaystyle \lambda _{2}} denote the two roots of this polynomial. We analyze the case in which there are distinct roots and the case in which there is a repeated root: If the roots are distinct, the general solution is φ φ ( t ) = c 1 e λ λ 1 t + c 2 e λ λ 2 t , {\displaystyle \varphi (t)=c_{1}e^{\lambda _{1}t}+c_{2}e^{\lambda _{2}t},} where the exponentials may be complex.

If the roots are equal, the general solution is φ φ ( t ) = c 1 e λ λ 1 t + c 2 t e λ λ 1 t .

{\displaystyle \varphi (t)=c_{1}e^{\lambda _{1}t}+c_{2}te^{\lambda _{1}t}.} In both cases, the solution y ( x ) {\displaystyle y(x)} can be found by setting t = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle t=\ln(x)} .

Hence, in the first case, y ( x ) = c 1 x λ λ 1 + c 2 x λ λ 2 , {\displaystyle y(x)=c_{1}x^{\lambda _{1}}+c_{2}x^{\lambda _{2}},} and in the second case, y ( x ) = c 1 x λ λ 1 + c 2 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x λ λ 1 .

{\displaystyle y(x)=c_{1}x^{\lambda _{1}}+c_{2}\ln(x)x^{\lambda _{1}}.} Second order - solution using differential operators [ edit ] Observe that we can write the second-order Cauchy-Euler equation in terms of a linear differential operator L {\displaystyle L} as L y = ( x 2 D 2 + a x D + b I ) y = 0 , {\displaystyle Ly=(x^{2}D^{2}+axD+bI)y=0,} where D = d d x {\displaystyle D={\frac {d}{dx}}} and I {\displaystyle I} is the identity operator.

We express the above operator as a polynomial in x D {\displaystyle xD} , rather than D {\displaystyle D} . By the product rule , ( x D ) 2 = x D ( x D ) = x ( D + x D 2 ) = x 2 D 2 + x D .

{\displaystyle (xD)^{2}=xD(xD)=x(D+xD^{2})=x^{2}D^{2}+xD.} So, L = ( x D ) 2 + ( a − − 1 ) ( x D ) + b I .

{\displaystyle L=(xD)^{2}+(a-1)(xD)+bI.} We can then use the quadratic formula to factor this operator into linear terms. More specifically, let λ λ 1 , λ λ 2 {\displaystyle \lambda _{1},\lambda _{2}} denote the (possibly equal) values of − − a − − 1 2 ± ± 1 2 ( a − − 1 ) 2 − − 4 b .

{\displaystyle -{\frac {a-1}{2}}\pm {\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {(a-1)^{2}-4b}}.} Then, L = ( x D − − λ λ 1 I ) ( x D − − λ λ 2 I ) .

{\displaystyle L=(xD-\lambda _{1}I)(xD-\lambda _{2}I).} It can be seen that these factors commute, that is ( x D − − λ λ 1 I ) ( x D − − λ λ 2 I ) = ( x D − − λ λ 2 I ) ( x D − − λ λ 1 I ) {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda _{1}I)(xD-\lambda _{2}I)=(xD-\lambda _{2}I)(xD-\lambda _{1}I)} . Hence, if λ λ 1 ≠ ≠ λ λ 2 {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}\neq \lambda _{2}} , the solution to L y = 0 {\displaystyle Ly=0} is a linear combination of the solutions to each of ( x D − − λ λ 1 I ) y = 0 {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda _{1}I)y=0} and ( x D − − λ λ 2 I ) y = 0 {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda _{2}I)y=0} , which can be solved by separation of variables .

Indeed, with i ∈ ∈ { 1 , 2 } {\displaystyle i\in \{1,2\}} , we have ( x D − − λ λ i I ) y = x d y d x − − λ λ i y = 0 {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda _{i}I)y=x{\frac {dy}{dx}}-\lambda _{i}y=0} . So, x d y d x = λ λ i y ∫ ∫ 1 y d y = λ λ i ∫ ∫ 1 x d x ln ⁡ ⁡ y = λ λ i ln ⁡ ⁡ x + C y = c i e λ λ i ln ⁡ ⁡ x = c i x λ λ i .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x{\frac {dy}{dx}}&=\lambda _{i}y\\\int {\frac {1}{y}}\,dy&=\lambda _{i}\int {\frac {1}{x}}\,dx\\\ln y&=\lambda _{i}\ln x+C\\y&=c_{i}e^{\lambda _{i}\ln x}=c_{i}x^{\lambda _{i}}.\end{aligned}}} Thus, the general solution is y = c 1 x λ λ 1 + c 2 x λ λ 2 {\displaystyle y=c_{1}x^{\lambda _{1}}+c_{2}x^{\lambda _{2}}} .

If λ λ = λ λ 1 = λ λ 2 {\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{1}=\lambda _{2}} , then we instead need to consider the solution of ( x D − − λ λ I ) 2 y = 0 {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda I)^{2}y=0} . Let z = ( x D − − λ λ I ) y {\displaystyle z=(xD-\lambda I)y} , so that we can write ( x D − − λ λ I ) 2 y = ( x D − − λ λ I ) z = 0.

{\displaystyle (xD-\lambda I)^{2}y=(xD-\lambda I)z=0.} As before, the solution of ( x D − − λ λ I ) z = 0 {\displaystyle (xD-\lambda I)z=0} is of the form z = c 1 x λ λ {\displaystyle z=c_{1}x^{\lambda }} . So, we are left to solve ( x D − − λ λ I ) y = x d y d x − − λ λ y = c 1 x λ λ .

{\displaystyle (xD-\lambda I)y=x{\frac {dy}{dx}}-\lambda y=c_{1}x^{\lambda }.} We then rewrite the equation as d y d x − − λ λ x y = c 1 x λ λ − − 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}-{\frac {\lambda }{x}}y=c_{1}x^{\lambda -1},} which one can recognize as being amenable to solution via an integrating factor .

Choose M ( x ) = x − − λ λ {\displaystyle M(x)=x^{-\lambda }} as our integrating factor. Multiplying our equation through by M ( x ) {\displaystyle M(x)} and recognizing the left-hand side as the derivative of a product, we then obtain d d x ( x − − λ λ y ) = c 1 x − − 1 x − − λ λ y = ∫ ∫ c 1 x − − 1 d x y = x λ λ ( c 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + c 2 ) = c 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x λ λ + c 2 x λ λ .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d}{dx}}(x^{-\lambda }y)&=c_{1}x^{-1}\\x^{-\lambda }y&=\int c_{1}x^{-1}\,dx\\y&=x^{\lambda }(c_{1}\ln(x)+c_{2})\\&=c_{1}\ln(x)x^{\lambda }+c_{2}x^{\lambda }.\end{aligned}}} Example [ edit ] Given x 2 u ″ − − 3 x u ′ + 3 u = 0 , {\displaystyle x^{2}u''-3xu'+3u=0\,,} we substitute the simple solution x m : x 2 ( m ( m − − 1 ) x m − − 2 ) − − 3 x ( m x m − − 1 ) + 3 x m = m ( m − − 1 ) x m − − 3 m x m + 3 x m = ( m 2 − − 4 m + 3 ) x m = 0 .

{\displaystyle x^{2}\left(m\left(m-1\right)x^{m-2}\right)-3x\left(mx^{m-1}\right)+3x^{m}=m\left(m-1\right)x^{m}-3mx^{m}+3x^{m}=\left(m^{2}-4m+3\right)x^{m}=0\,.} For x m to be a solution, either x = 0 , which gives the trivial solution, or the coefficient of x m is zero. Solving the quadratic equation , we get m = 1, 3 . The general solution is therefore u = c 1 x + c 2 x 3 .

{\displaystyle u=c_{1}x+c_{2}x^{3}\,.} Difference equation analogue [ edit ] There is a difference equation analogue to the Cauchy–Euler equation. For a fixed m > 0 , define the sequence f m ( n ) as f m ( n ) := n ( n + 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( n + m − − 1 ) .

{\displaystyle f_{m}(n):=n(n+1)\cdots (n+m-1).} Applying the difference operator to f m {\displaystyle f_{m}} , we find that D f m ( n ) = f m ( n + 1 ) − − f m ( n ) = m ( n + 1 ) ( n + 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( n + m − − 1 ) = m n f m ( n ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Df_{m}(n)&=f_{m}(n+1)-f_{m}(n)\\&=m(n+1)(n+2)\cdots (n+m-1)={\frac {m}{n}}f_{m}(n).\end{aligned}}} If we do this k times, we find that f m ( k ) ( n ) = m ( m − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( m − − k + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( n + k − − 1 ) f m ( n ) = m ( m − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( m − − k + 1 ) f m ( n ) f k ( n ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f_{m}^{(k)}(n)&={\frac {m(m-1)\cdots (m-k+1)}{n(n+1)\cdots (n+k-1)}}f_{m}(n)\\&=m(m-1)\cdots (m-k+1){\frac {f_{m}(n)}{f_{k}(n)}},\end{aligned}}} where the superscript ( k ) denotes applying the difference operator k times. Comparing this to the fact that the k -th derivative of x m equals m ( m − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( m − − k + 1 ) x m x k {\displaystyle m(m-1)\cdots (m-k+1){\frac {x^{m}}{x^{k}}}} suggests that we can solve the N -th order difference equation f N ( n ) y ( N ) ( n ) + a N − − 1 f N − − 1 ( n ) y ( N − − 1 ) ( n ) + ⋯ ⋯ + a 0 y ( n ) = 0 , {\displaystyle f_{N}(n)y^{(N)}(n)+a_{N-1}f_{N-1}(n)y^{(N-1)}(n)+\cdots +a_{0}y(n)=0,} in a similar manner to the differential equation case. Indeed, substituting the trial solution y ( n ) = f m ( n ) {\displaystyle y(n)=f_{m}(n)} brings us to the same situation as the differential equation case, m ( m − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( m − − N + 1 ) + a N − − 1 m ( m − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( m − − N + 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + a 1 m + a 0 = 0.

{\displaystyle m(m-1)\cdots (m-N+1)+a_{N-1}m(m-1)\cdots (m-N+2)+\dots +a_{1}m+a_{0}=0.} One may now proceed as in the differential equation case, since the general solution of an N -th order linear difference equation is also the linear combination of N linearly independent solutions. Applying reduction of order in case of a multiple root m 1 will yield expressions involving a discrete version of ln , φ φ ( n ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n 1 k − − m 1 .

{\displaystyle \varphi (n)=\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{k-m_{1}}}.} (Compare with: ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x − − m 1 ) = ∫ ∫ 1 + m 1 x d t t − − m 1 .

{\textstyle \ln(x-m_{1})=\int _{1+m_{1}}^{x}{\frac {dt}{t-m_{1}}}.} ) In cases where fractions become involved, one may use f m ( n ) := Γ Γ ( n + m ) Γ Γ ( n ) {\displaystyle f_{m}(n):={\frac {\Gamma (n+m)}{\Gamma (n)}}} instead (or simply use it in all cases), which coincides with the definition before for integer m .
