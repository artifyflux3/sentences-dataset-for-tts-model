The art form is distinguished by the depiction of letters of the alphabet using a genre of painting that contoured shapes of human figures, animals, plants, and other objects called Tipos del País popularized by Damián Domingo . The letters depicted spell out a phrase or a name, usually that of the patron who commissioned the work.

[ 1 ] The paintings were done with watercolor on Manila paper . The earliest example of this art form dates from 1845; the latest existing specimens were completed during the latter portion of the American period in the 1930s during the administration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines .

[ 2 ] In 1995, an album of José Honorato Lozano's paintings were auctioned at Christie’s at the starting bid of £ 300,000.

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] The BALVINO MAURICIO was completed by José Honorato Lozano in November 1864 for its namesake, Balvino Mauricio, a Binondo merchant who was later implicated in the 1872 Cavite mutiny . Measuring 93 cm x 113 cm, this painting depicts a Manila house of that time. This  house is believed to be the same house described by José Rizal in the opening chapter of Noli Me Tángere .

[ 3 ] The IMELDA ROMUALDEZ MARCOS , of unknown provenance. Housed in the Malacañang Museum , it is believed to have been painted for former First Lady Imelda Marcos . It depicts buildings and institutions established by her and Ferdinand Marcos .

[ 4 ] PASKO ( Filipino , "Christmas"), painted by Alvaro Jimenez in 1988 for the Ayala Museum . It was printed as the museum's Christmas card that same year.
