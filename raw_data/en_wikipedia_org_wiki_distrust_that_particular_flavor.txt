Distrust consists of twenty-six pieces written over a period of more than twenty years. The anthology includes a range of formats, including essays, magazine pieces, album reviews, and forewords from other published works.

[ 1 ] The book won the Locus Award for Best Non-fiction in 2013.

[ 2 ] Background [ edit ] Since making a name for himself as a leading figure in the cyberpunk genre with his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson has been primarily known as a writer of science or speculative fiction. However, beginning in the late eighties, he has regularly penned non-fiction pieces for various publications. Gibson credits his agent for the idea of a collection; according to the writer, the book was intended to bridge the gap between Zero History (2010), his then-most recent novel, and his next work of fiction.

[ 1 ] Content [ edit ] The pieces in Distrust That Particular Flavor were written between the late 1980s and 2010.  Some were originally published as magazine articles in Time , Rolling Stone , and Wired .

[ 3 ] Some appeared as forewords to books by other authors.  Several speeches appear in written form for the first time.

In " Disneyland with the Death Penalty ", which originally appeared in a 1993 issue of Wired , Gibson reflects on the state of Singapore .  Criticisms in the article resulted in the Singapore government banning Wired from the country.

[ 4 ] The essay "Rocket Radio", which appeared in Rolling Stone , covers the evolution of communications from the crystal radio to the Internet. Written in the late 1980s, it features Gibson theorizing on the future of the then-nascent Net.

[ 5 ] "Dead Man Sings" takes a more autobiographical note; memories of his childhood are interspersed with an exploration of visual and audio media, and their effect on time.

[ 5 ] The writer delves into psychogeography in his review of Peter Ackroyd 's London: The Biography , entitled "Metrophagy: the Art and Science of Digesting Cities".

[ 4 ] Several pieces cover music and fine arts.  "Any 'Mount of World" is a review of a Steely Dan live album.

[ 4 ] Gibson is a fan of the group.

[ 1 ] "Introduction: The Body" looks at the Australian-Cypriot performance artist Stelarc .

[ 6 ] The collection features Gibson's writings on three of his favourite authors, Jorge Luis Borges , George Orwell and H.G. Wells .

[ 7 ] The writer's various obsessions feature in other pieces, such as vintage watches (pursued through eBay ) [ 8 ] and his interest in classic denim.
