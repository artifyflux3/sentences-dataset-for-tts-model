[ 1 ] The station replaced the BBC Home Service on 30 September 1967 and broadcasts a wide variety of spoken-word programmes , including flagship news programme Today and radio drama The Archers , from the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House , London . Since 2019, the station controller has been Mohit Bakaya .

[ 2 ] He replaced Gwyneth Williams , who had been the station controller since 2010.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Broadcasting throughout the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands on FM , LW and DAB , and on BBC Sounds , [ 4 ] it can also be received in the eastern counties of Ireland , northern France and Northern Europe . It is available on Freeview , Freesat , Sky , and Virgin Media . Radio 4 currently reaches over 9.2 million listeners, making it the UK's second most-popular radio station after BBC Radio 2 .

[ 5 ] BBC Radio 4 broadcasts news programmes such as Today , The World at One and PM heralded on air by the Greenwich Time Signal pips or the chimes of Big Ben .

[ c ] Radio 4 also broadcasts the Shipping Forecast , which is over 150 years old.

[ 6 ] According to RAJAR , the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 9.2 million with a listening share of 11.1% as of December 2023.

[ 7 ] Overview [ edit ] BBC Radio 4 broadcasts a wide variety of speech-related programming, including news, drama, comedy, science and history. Music is broadcast as in documentaries relating to various forms of both popular and classical music, and the long-running music-based Desert Island Discs . Sport is not part of the station's output, apart from during news bulletins, although between 1994 and 2023, the station's longwave frequency was used to broadcast ball-by-ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England. Consequently, for around 70 days a year, listeners had to rely on FM broadcasts or DAB for mainstream Radio 4 broadcasts – the number relying solely on longwave was now a small minority. The cricket broadcasts took precedence over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast , carried since Radio 4's move to longwave in 1978 because longwave can be received clearly at sea.

[ 8 ] The station is available on FM in most of Great Britain, parts of Ireland and the north of France; LW throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe, and the Atlantic north of the Azores to about 20 degrees west; DAB ; Digital TV including Freeview , Freesat , Sky and Virgin Media , and on the Internet. Freesat, Sky and Virgin have a separate channel for Radio 4 LW output in mono, in addition to the FM output.

BBC Radio 4 is the second-most-popular British domestic radio station by total hours, [ 9 ] after Radio 2 . It recorded its highest audience, of 11 million listeners, in May 2011, [ 10 ] and was "UK Radio Station of the Year" at the 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2023 Radio Academy Awards .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] It also won a Peabody Award in 2002 for File on 4:  Export Controls .

[ 13 ] Costing £87 million (2024/5), [ 14 ] it is the BBC's most expensive national radio network and is considered by many to be its flagship [ by whom?

] . There is no comparable British commercial network: Channel 4 abandoned plans to launch its own speech-based digital radio station in October 2008 as part of a £100m cost-cutting review.

[ 15 ] The longwave signal is part of the Royal Navy 's system of letters of last resort . In the event of a suspected catastrophic attack on Britain, submarine captains, in addition to other checks, check for a broadcast signal from Radio 4 on 198 kHz longwave to verify the annihilation of organised society in the United Kingdom.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ failed verification ] History [ edit ] See also: 2LO and BBC Home Service Further information: Timeline of BBC Radio 4 Logo of BBC Radio 4 until 2007 Logo of BBC Radio 4 used from 2007 until 2022 Initially the power was 100 watts on 350 metres (857 kHz ). 2LO was allowed to transmit for seven minutes, after which the "operator" had to listen on the wavelength for three minutes for possible instructions to close down. On 14 November 1922 the station was transferred to the new British Broadcasting Company which in 1923 took up the nearby Savoy Hill for its broadcasting studios. At midnight on New Year's Eve 1923, the twelve chimes of Big Ben were broadcast for the first time to mark the new year.

[ 19 ] The British Broadcasting Company began transmissions in London on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand , which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of six commercial companies which created), but technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or joint programming between transmitters . While it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities.

By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible at least between main transmitters and relay stations , the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts. In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest.

The company became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927. On 9 March 1930, 2LO was replaced by the BBC Regional Programme and the BBC National Programme . The letters LO continued to be used internally as a designation in the BBC for technical operations in the London area (for example, the numbering of all recordings made in London contained LO ). The code LO was changed to LN in the early 1970s.

Main stations [ edit ] Each of these main stations were broadcast at approximately 1 kilowatt (kW): Airdate Station ID City Initial frequency 14 November 1922 2LO London 822 kHz 15 November 1922 5IT Birmingham 626 kHz 2ZY Manchester 794 kHz 24 December 1922 5NO Newcastle upon Tyne 743 kHz 13 February 1923 5WA Cardiff 850 kHz 6 March 1923 5SC Glasgow 711 kHz 10 October 1923 2BD Aberdeen 606 kHz 17 October 1923 6BM Bournemouth 777 kHz 14 September 1924 2BE Belfast 689 kHz Relay stations [ edit ] Each of these relay stations were broadcast at approximately 120 watts (W): Airdate Station ID City Relay of Frequency 16 November 1923 6FL Sheffield 2ZY 980 kHz 28 March 1924 5PY Plymouth 6BM 887 kHz 1 May 1924 2EH Edinburgh 5SC 914 kHz 11 June 1924 6LV Liverpool 2ZY 906 kHz 8 July 1924 2LS Leeds and Bradford 935 kHz 15 August 1924 6KH Kingston upon Hull 896 kHz 16 September 1924 5NG Nottingham 920 kHz 21 October 1924 6ST Stoke-on-Trent 996 kHz 12 November 1924 2DE Dundee 2BD 952 kHz 12 December 1924 5SX Swansea 5WA 622 kHz The BBC Home Service was the predecessor of Radio 4 and broadcast between 1939 and 1967. It had regional variations and was broadcast on medium wave with a network of VHF FM transmitters being added from 1955. Radio 4 replaced it on 30 September 1967, when the BBC restructured and renamed its domestic radio stations, [ 1 ] in response to the challenge of offshore radio . It moved to long wave in November 1978, taking over the 200 kHz frequency (1,500 metres) previously held by Radio 2 - later moved to 198 kHz as a result of international agreements aimed at avoiding interference (all ITU Region 1 MW/LW broadcast frequencies are divisible by 9). At this point, Radio 4 became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio 4 UK, a title that remained until 29 September 1984.

For a time during the 1970s Radio 4 carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday. These were broadcast twice at breakfast, at lunchtime and at 17:55. There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by BBC Local Radio stations. These included Roundabout East Anglia , a VHF opt-out of the Today programme broadcast from BBC East 's studios in Norwich each weekday from 6.45 a.m. to 8.45 a.m.

[ 20 ] Roundabout East Anglia came to an end in August 1980, ahead of the launch of BBC Radio Norfolk .

[ 20 ] All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August 1980, apart from in the southwest as until January 1983 there was no BBC Local Radio in the southwest so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme, Morning Sou'West , continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio 4 medium wave Plymouth relay until 31 December 1982.

The launch of Radio 5 on 27 August 1990 saw the removal of Open University , schools programming, children's programmes and the Study on 4 / Options adult education slot from Radio 4's FM frequencies. Consequently, the full Radio 4 schedule became available on FM for the first time. However, adult educational and Open University programming returned to Radio 4 in 1994 when Radio 5 was closed to make way for the launch of BBC Radio 5 Live and were broadcast until the end of the 1990s on Sunday evenings on longwave only.

Between 17 January 1991 and 2 March 1991 FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the Gulf War , Radio 4 News FM , with the main Radio 4 service transferring to long wave. Before this, Radio 4's FM frequencies had occasionally been used for additional news coverage, generally for live coverage of statements and debates in Parliament.

By the start of the 1990s, Radio 4 had become available on FM in most of the UK - previously FM coverage had been restricted mainly to England and south Wales. This meant that it was possible for the main Radio 4 service to be transferred from LW to FM, and this took place on 16 September 1991 with opt-outs - extra shipping forecasts, Daily Service , Yesterday in Parliament coverage of Prime Ministers Questions and other occasional extra news coverage, joined in 1994 by Test Match Special - transferring to long wave.

[ 21 ] However, 1994 did see the end of the extra news coverage on longwave due to the launch of BBC Radio 5 Live , although occasional broadcasts of services continued with the last being when Pope Benedict XVI visited Britain in 2010 .

On 30 May 2023, the BBC announced that Radio 4 will stop broadcasting opt-outs on long wave [ 22 ] with the last opt-outs airing on 31 March 2024.

[ 23 ] The two displaced programmes, Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament moved to BBC Radio 4 Extra , although the latter was returned to the early morning Radio 4 schedule in April 2025. The daily amount of Shipping Forecasts was reduced to be broadcast 2 times on weekdays and 3 times on weekends.

Test Match Special moved to BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra on 31 July 2023. These end ahead of a planned switch-off of long wave transmissions by 26 September 2026.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] On 15 April 2024 at 12:27 PM BST, Radio 4's medium wave frequencies were switched off. These previously served as relays in areas with a weak longwave signal to provide reception of Radio 4 longwave, such as Northern Ireland and south west England. A continuous closedown loop message was broadcast until 30 April 2024, [ 25 ] informing listeners to retune to other methods of reception.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Programmes and schedules [ edit ] Daily schedule [ edit ] As of April 2025, Radio 4 is on air from 05:00 to 01:00 every Monday to Friday, and 05:30 to 01:00 every Saturday and Sunday. The station simulcasts the BBC World Service during its downtime overnight. An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes.

[ 28 ] Production [ edit ] The station broadcasts a mix of live and pre-recorded programmes. Live programming includes breakfast programme Today , magazine programme Woman's Hour , consumer affairs programme You and Yours , and (often) the music, film, books, arts and culture programme Front Row .

Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the Six O'Clock News and Midnight News , and news programmes such as Today , The World at One and PM , which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at BBC Television Centre in White City .

[ 29 ] The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three.

The Greenwich Time Signal , popularly known as "the pips", is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin, except at midnight and 18:00, and 22:00 on Sunday, when the chimes of Big Ben are played. There is no Greenwich Time Signal at 15:00 on Saturday or 11:00 and 12:00 on Sunday due to the Saturday Afternoon drama and the omnibus edition of The Archers respectively. Only pips broadcast on FM and LW are accurate. On digital platforms there is a delay of between three and five seconds, and up to 23 seconds online.

Programmes [ edit ] Main article: List of BBC Radio 4 programmes Radio 4 programmes cover a wide variety of genre including news and current affairs, history, culture, science, religion, arts, comedy, drama and entertainment. A number of the programmes on Radio 4 take the form of a "magazine" show, featuring numerous small contributions over the course of the programme— Woman's Hour , From Our Own Correspondent , You and Yours . The rise of these magazine shows is primarily due to the work of Tony Whitby , controller of Radio 4 from 1970 to 1975.

[ 30 ] The station hosts a number of long-running programmes, many of which have been broadcast for over 40 years.

Most programmes are available for 30 days or over a year after broadcast as streaming audio from Radio 4's listen again page [ 31 ] and via BBC Sounds . A selection of programmes is also available as podcasts or downloadable audio files.

[ 32 ] Many comedy and drama programmes from the Radio 4 archives are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra .
Due to the capacity limitations of DAB and increasing sport broadcasts on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra , BBC Radio 4 DAB has to reduce its bit rate most evenings, such that after 7 p.m. its DAB output is usually in mono, even though many of its programmes are made in stereo (including its flagship drama "The Archers"), these can be heard in stereo only on FM, Digital TV on Freeview & Freesat (Ch. 704), Sky, Virgin and on line via BBC Sounds. BBC World Service, which uses BBC Radio 4 FM & DAB frequencies between 01:00 and 05:20, is in stereo, but only on Radio 4 FM & DAB and not on its own dedicated DAB channel. BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcasts in mono on DAB, but has always been in stereo on Digital TV (Freeview / Freesat Ch 708), Sky, Virgin and online.

Notable continuity announcers and newsreaders [ edit ] Announcers carry out the following duties from Broadcasting House: Provide links (or junctions) between programmes Read trails for programmes Provide reassurance to listeners during a programme breakdown Read the Shipping Forecast Read the BBC Radio 3 news summaries at 13:00 and 18:00 on weekdays, and 07:00, 08:00 and 13:00 on Saturdays.

Newsreaders read hourly summaries and longer bulletins from New Broadcasting House.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] In 2012 the BBC announced that it would be reducing its main presentation team from 12 to ten.

Conversely, the journalist Mehdi Hasan has criticised the station for an overtly " socially and culturally conservative" approach.

[ 44 ] There has been criticism of Today in particular for a lack of female broadcasters.

[ 45 ] In September 1972, Radio 4 employed the first female continuity announcers—Hylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards. For quite some time, the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners; women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints.

[ 46 ] In addition, there has been long-running criticism by atheist and humanist groups of Thought for the Day , a slot dedicated exclusively to religious discussion during Radio 4's flagship morning news programme.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Radio 4 has been criticised for being "too middle class " and of "little interest" to non-white listeners.

A few days earlier a microphone had been set up on the roof of a nearby building, No. 1 Bridge Street, just opposite the Houses of Parliament. As the time approached midnight the chimes of the Great Clock ringing out the old year were followed on the hour by the twelve deep strokes of Big Ben ringing in the new, and broadcast, by means of a temporary line running to the control room at Savoy Hill, to listeners tuned to 2LO, the BBC's first radio transmitter, then barely a year old.
