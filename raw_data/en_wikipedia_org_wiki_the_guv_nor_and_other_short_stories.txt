These are the final stories about Mr. J. G. Reeder, a detective with "the mind of a criminal".  
They include "The Guv'nor" " The Man Who Passed " ("The Man from Sing Sing") "The Shadow Man" " The Treasure House " In America the book was published as Mr. Reeder Returns ( The Crime Club , Doubleday, Doran, 1932) with the stories in a different order:  
"The Guv'nor", 
"The Man from Sing Sing", 
"The Treasure House", and 
"The Shadow Man".

A later (1965) edition Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns contains only "The Treasure House" and "The Shadow Man". The 1969 imprint was a tie in with the 1969 Thames Television series The Mind of Mr. J.G. Reeder , starring Hugh Burden .
