Historically, literature has been a male-dominated sphere, and any poetry written by a woman could be seen as feminist . Often, feminist poetry refers to that which was composed after the 1960s and the second wave of the feminist movement.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This list focuses on poets who take explicitly feminist approaches to their poetry.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .
