It can be described as the union of a spherical cap and the cone formed by the center of the sphere and the base of the cap. It is the three-dimensional analogue of the sector of a circle .

Volume [ edit ] If the radius of the sphere is denoted by r and the height of the cap by h , the volume of the spherical sector is V = 2 π π r 2 h 3 .

{\displaystyle V={\frac {2\pi r^{2}h}{3}}\,.} This may also be written as V = 2 π π r 3 3 ( 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) , {\displaystyle V={\frac {2\pi r^{3}}{3}}(1-\cos \varphi )\,,} where φ is half the cone aperture angle, i.e., φ is the angle between the rim of the cap and the axis direction to the middle of the cap as seen from the sphere center. The limiting case is for φ approaching 180 degrees, which then describes a complete sphere.

The height, h is given by h = r ( 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) .

{\displaystyle h=r(1-\cos \varphi )\,.} The volume V of the sector is related to the area A of the cap by: V = r A 3 .

{\displaystyle V={\frac {rA}{3}}\,.} Area [ edit ] The curved surface area of the spherical sector (on the surface of the sphere, excluding the cone surface) is A = 2 π π r h .

{\displaystyle A=2\pi rh\,.} It is also A = Ω Ω r 2 {\displaystyle A=\Omega r^{2}} where Ω is the solid angle of the spherical sector in steradians , the SI unit of solid angle. One steradian is defined as the solid angle subtended by a cap area of A = r 2 .

Derivation [ edit ] Further information: double integral and triple integral The volume can be calculated by integrating the differential volume element d V = ρ ρ 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ρ ρ d ϕ ϕ d θ θ {\displaystyle dV=\rho ^{2}\sin \phi \,d\rho \,d\phi \,d\theta } over the volume of the spherical sector, V = ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 φ φ ∫ ∫ 0 r ρ ρ 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ρ ρ d ϕ ϕ d θ θ = ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π d θ θ ∫ ∫ 0 φ φ sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ ∫ ∫ 0 r ρ ρ 2 d ρ ρ = 2 π π r 3 3 ( 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) , {\displaystyle V=\int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{\varphi }\int _{0}^{r}\rho ^{2}\sin \phi \,d\rho \,d\phi \,d\theta =\int _{0}^{2\pi }d\theta \int _{0}^{\varphi }\sin \phi \,d\phi \int _{0}^{r}\rho ^{2}d\rho ={\frac {2\pi r^{3}}{3}}(1-\cos \varphi )\,,} where the integrals have been separated, because the integrand can be separated into a product of functions each with one dummy variable.

The area can be similarly calculated by integrating the differential spherical area element d A = r 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ d θ θ {\displaystyle dA=r^{2}\sin \phi \,d\phi \,d\theta } over the spherical sector, giving A = ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 φ φ r 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ d θ θ = r 2 ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π d θ θ ∫ ∫ 0 φ φ sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ = 2 π π r 2 ( 1 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) , {\displaystyle A=\int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{\varphi }r^{2}\sin \phi \,d\phi \,d\theta =r^{2}\int _{0}^{2\pi }d\theta \int _{0}^{\varphi }\sin \phi \,d\phi =2\pi r^{2}(1-\cos \varphi )\,,} where φ is inclination (or elevation) and θ is azimuth (right). Notice r is a constant. Again, the integrals can be separated.
