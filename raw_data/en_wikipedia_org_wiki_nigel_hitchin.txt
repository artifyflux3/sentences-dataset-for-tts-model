He is a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Oxford .

Academic career [ edit ] Hitchin attended Ecclesbourne School , Duffield , and earned his BA in mathematics from Jesus College, Oxford , in 1968.

[ 2 ] After moving to Wolfson College , he received his D.Phil.

in 1972. From 1971 to 1973 he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and 1973/74 the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University . He then was a research fellow in Oxford and starting in 1979 tutor, lecturer and fellow of St Catherine's College . In 1990 he became a professor at the University of Warwick and in 1994 the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge . In 1997 he was appointed to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford , a position he held until his retirement in 2016.

Amongst his notable discoveries are the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality ; Hitchin's projectively flat connection over Teichmüller space ; the Atiyah–Hitchin monopole metric; the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem ; the ADHM construction of instantons (of Michael Atiyah , Vladimir Drinfeld , Hitchin, and Yuri Manin ); the hyperkähler quotient (of Hitchin, Anders Karlhede, Ulf Lindström and Martin Roček ); Higgs bundles , which arise as solutions to the Hitchin equations, a 2-dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang–Mills equations ; and the Hitchin system , an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system associated to the data of an algebraic curve and a complex reductive group .  He and Shoshichi Kobayashi independently conjectured the Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence .  Higgs bundles, which are also developed in the work of Carlos Simpson , are closely related to the Hitchin system, which has an interpretation as a moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve.

[ 3 ] This moduli space has emerged as a focal point for deep connections between algebraic geometry, differential geometry, hyperkähler geometry , mathematical physics, and representation theory .

In his article [ 4 ] on generalized Calabi–Yau manifolds , he introduced the notion of generalized complex manifolds , providing a single structure that incorporates, as examples, Poisson manifolds , symplectic manifolds and complex manifolds .  These have found wide applications as the geometries of flux compactifications in string theory and also in topological string theory .

In the span of his career, Hitchin has supervised 37 research students, including Simon Donaldson (part-supervised with Atiyah).

Until 2013 Nigel Hitchin served as the managing editor of the journal Mathematische Annalen .

Honours and awards [ edit ] In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society .

[ 5 ] In 2003 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath .

Hitchin was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College in 1998, [ 2 ] and the Senior Berwick Prize (1990), the Sylvester Medal (2000) and the Pólya Prize (2002) have been awarded to him in honour of his far-reaching work.  A conference was held in honour of his 60th birthday, in conjunction with the 2006 International Congress of Mathematicians in Spain.

In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 6 ] In 2014 he was awarded another Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Warwick . In 2016 he received the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences.
