Marble Amable Liñán Martínez (born 1934 in Noceda de Cabrera, Castrillo de Cabrera , León , Spain) is a Spanish aeronautical engineer working in the field of combustion and fluid mechanics.

Biography [ edit ] He holds a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering from the Technical University of Madrid , advised by Gregorio Millán Barbany and Degree of Aeronautical Engineer from the Caltech advised by Frank E. Marble .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He is currently Professor of Fluid Mechanics and professor emeritus at the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (attached to the Department of Motorcycle and Thermofluidodynamics of said school). He has taught at universities in California, Michigan and Princeton University in the United States and in Marseilles in France, among others. Since 1997 he is an adjunct professor at Yale University .

[ 5 ] Research [ edit ] He has focused his research studies on the basic problems of combustion, both reactor and planetary probe dynamics, in the latter case working directly for NASA and the European Space Agency.

The diffusion flame structure in counterflow wa analyzed by him in 1974 through activation-energy asymptotics.

[ 6 ] Publications [ edit ] He is the author of several books and scientific research.

Honors [ edit ] In 1989 he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences. He is also a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering of Spain, France and Mexico. He is also a member of the scientific board of the IMDEA Energy Institute. He is also an elected foreign member of National Academy of Engineering for discoveries using asymptotic analyses in combustion and for contributions to advance engineering science.

[ 7 ] In 2007 he received the "Miguel Catalán" Research Award from the Community of Madrid and was awarded in 1993 with the Prince of Asturias Award [ 8 ] for Scientific and Technical Research.

[ 9 ] A workshop in honor of Liñán's work was conducted in 2004 [ 10 ] and the workshop papers are published in a book titled Simplicity, rigor and relevance in fluid mechanics : a volume in honor of Amable Liñán , CIMNE, (2004).
