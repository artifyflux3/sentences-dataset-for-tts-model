They can be thought of as an underwater version of alluvial fans and can vary dramatically in size, with widths from several kilometres to several thousands of kilometres.

[ 1 ] The largest is the Bengal Fan , followed by the Indus Fan , but major fans are also found at the outlet of the Amazon , Congo , Mississippi and elsewhere.

These currents begin when a geologic activity pushes sediments over the edge of a continental shelf and down the continental slope , creating an underwater landslide.  A dense slurry of muds and sands speeds towards the foot of the slope, until the current slows.  The decreasing current, having a reduced ability to transport sediments, deposits the grains it carries, thus creating a submarine fan.  The slurry continues to slow as it is moved towards the continental rise until it reaches the ocean bed.  Thus results a series of graded sediments of sand, silt and mud, which are known as turbidites , as described by the Bouma sequence .
