An [Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period "Edo period")[Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") bucket used to hold water for fire fighting

A **bucket** is typically a watertight, vertical [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") or [truncated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry) "Truncation (geometry)")[cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry) "Cone (geometry)") or square, with an open top and a flat bottom that is attached to a semicircular carrying [handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_(grip) "Handle (grip)") called the _[bail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail\_handle "Bail handle")_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket#cite_note-2)

A bucket is usually an open-top container. In contrast, a [pail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pail_(container) "Pail (container)") can have a top or lid and is a [shipping container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container "Shipping container"). In non-technical usage, the two terms are often used interchangeably.

A number of bucket types exist, used for a variety of purposes. Though most of these are functional purposes, a number, including those constructed from precious metals, are used for ceremonial purposes. Common types of bucket and their adjoining purposes include:

*   Water buckets used to carry [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water")
*   Household and garden buckets used for carrying liquids and granular products
*   Elaborate ceremonial or ritual buckets constructed of [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze"), [ivory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory "Ivory") or other materials, found in several ancient or medieval cultures, sometimes known by the Latin for bucket, _[situla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situla\_(vessel) "Situla (vessel)")_
*   Large scoops or buckets attached to [loaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(equipment) "Loader (equipment)") and [telehandlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehandler "Telehandler") for landscaping agricultural and purposes
*   Canvas buckets made of woven fabric, developed as a fire-resistant alternative to leather[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket#cite_note-3)
*   [Crusher buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusher#Crusher_bucket "Crusher") attached to excavators used for crushing and recycling material in the construction industry
*   Buckets shaped like [castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_art_and_play "Sand art and play") often used as children's toys to shape and carry sand on a [beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach "Beach") or in a [sandpit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpit "Sandpit")
*   Buckets in special shapes such as cast iron buckets or smelting buckets to hold liquid metal at high temperatures

Though not always bucket shaped, [lunch boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_box "Lunch box") are sometimes known as lunch pails or a lunch bucket. Buckets can be repurposed as seats, tool caddies, hydroponic gardens, chamber pots, "street" drums, or livestock feeders, amongst other uses. Buckets are also repurposed for the use of long term food storage by [survivalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalists "Survivalists").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket#cite_note-4)

Shipping containers
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bucket&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Shipping containers")]

When in reference to a [shipping container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container "Shipping container"), the term "pail" is used as a technical term, specifically referring to a bucket shaped package with a sealed top or lid, which is then used as a transport container for chemicals and industrial products.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket#cite_note-5)
