[ 1 ] He is a prolific book reviewer for the Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society and for the European Mathematical Society . His research concerns approximation theory .

Education and career [ edit ] Bultheel was born in Zwijndrecht, Belgium on December 14, 1948. He earned a licenciate in mathematics in 1970 and another in industrial mathematics in 1971, both from KU Leuven . He remained at KU Leuven for a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a PhD in mathematics in 1979.

[ 1 ] His dissertation, Recursive Rational Approximation , was jointly supervised by Patrick M. Dewilde and Hugo Van de Vel.

[ 2 ] Except for a year of military service, he was employed at KU Leuven for his entire career, retiring as a professor emeritus of computer science in 2009.

[ 1 ] He was president of the Belgian Mathematical Society for 2002–2005.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Books [ edit ] Bultheel is the author of: Laurent Series and their Padé Approximations (Operator Theory: Advances and Applications 27, Birkhäuser, 1987) [ 4 ] Linear Algebra, Rational Approximation and Orthogonal Polynomials (with Marc van Barel, Studies in Computational Mathematics 6, North-Holland, 1997) Orthogonal Rational Functions (with Pablo González-Vera, Erik Hendriksen, and Olav Njåstad, Cambridge Monographs on Applied and Computational Mathematics 5, Cambridge University Press, 1999) [ 5 ] Inleiding tot de numerieke wiskunde (Acco, 2006) [ 6 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c d Curriculum vitae , retrieved 2018-09-12 ^ Adhemar Bultheel at the Mathematics Genealogy Project ^ "News from the BMS" (PDF) , BMS-NCM NEWS: The Newsletter of the Belgian Mathematical Society and the National Committee for Mathematics , 39 : 1– 8, September 15, 2002 .
