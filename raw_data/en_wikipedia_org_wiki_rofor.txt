ROFOR is an abbreviation for "Route Forecast".

[ 1 ] As the name suggests is the weather forecast of the route of any aircraft which will be flying through the route.  ROFOR contains various information regarding date and time of forecast, direction and speed of the wind, aerodrome ICAO code for which the forecast is made, cloud levels and freezing (icing) levels, turbulence and vertical wind shear information.
