The yellow crescent corresponds to σ, whereas the red tube corresponds to τ and the blue plane corresponds to z =1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere).

Bipolar cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system in the
perpendicular z {\displaystyle z} -direction.  The two lines of foci F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} of the projected Apollonian circles are generally taken to be 
defined by x = − − a {\displaystyle x=-a} and x = + a {\displaystyle x=+a} , respectively, (and by y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} ) in the Cartesian coordinate system .

The term "bipolar" is often used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses , hyperbolas , and Cassini ovals .  However, the term bipolar coordinates is never used to describe coordinates associated with those curves, e.g., elliptic coordinates .

Basic definition [ edit ] The most common definition of bipolar cylindrical coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ , z ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau ,z)} is x = a sinh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle x=a\ {\frac {\sinh \tau }{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }}} y = a sin ⁡ ⁡ σ σ cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle y=a\ {\frac {\sin \sigma }{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }}} z = z {\displaystyle z=\ z} where the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } coordinate of a point P {\displaystyle P} equals the angle F 1 P F 2 {\displaystyle F_{1}PF_{2}} and the τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d 1 {\displaystyle d_{1}} and d 2 {\displaystyle d_{2}} to the focal lines τ τ = ln ⁡ ⁡ d 1 d 2 {\displaystyle \tau =\ln {\frac {d_{1}}{d_{2}}}} (Recall that the focal lines F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} are located at x = − − a {\displaystyle x=-a} and x = + a {\displaystyle x=+a} , respectively.) Surfaces of constant σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } correspond to cylinders of different radii x 2 + ( y − − a cot ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 = a 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle x^{2}+\left(y-a\cot \sigma \right)^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{\sin ^{2}\sigma }}} that all pass through the focal lines and are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } are non-intersecting cylinders of different radii y 2 + ( x − − a coth ⁡ ⁡ τ τ ) 2 = a 2 sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ τ τ {\displaystyle y^{2}+\left(x-a\coth \tau \right)^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{\sinh ^{2}\tau }}} that surround the focal lines but again are not concentric.  The focal lines and all these cylinders are parallel to the z {\displaystyle z} -axis (the direction of projection).  In the z = 0 {\displaystyle z=0} plane, the centers of the constant- σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } and constant- τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } cylinders lie on the y {\displaystyle y} and x {\displaystyle x} axes, respectively.

Scale factors [ edit ] The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } and τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } are equal h σ σ = h τ τ = a cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle h_{\sigma }=h_{\tau }={\frac {a}{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }}} whereas the remaining scale factor h z = 1 {\displaystyle h_{z}=1} .  
Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals d V = a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 d σ σ d τ τ d z {\displaystyle dV={\frac {a^{2}}{\left(\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma \right)^{2}}}d\sigma d\tau dz} and the Laplacian is given by ∇ ∇ 2 Φ Φ = 1 a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 ( ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ σ σ 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ τ τ 2 ) + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ z 2 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi ={\frac {1}{a^{2}}}\left(\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma \right)^{2}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \sigma ^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \tau ^{2}}}\right)+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial z^{2}}}} Other differential operators such as ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ F {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} } and ∇ ∇ × × F {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} } can be expressed in the coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in orthogonal coordinates .

Applications [ edit ] The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations , 
e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation , for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables (in 2D).  A typical example would be the electric field surrounding two 
parallel cylindrical conductors.
