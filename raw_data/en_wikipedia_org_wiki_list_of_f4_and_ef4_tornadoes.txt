( October 2022 ) A wedge EF4 tornado impacting the town of Elkhorn, Nebraska .

EF4 damage to a residence from the 2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado The Windsor–Tecumseh Tornado of 1946 F4/EF4 Tornadoes in the United States 1950–2019 This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F4, EF4, IF4, or an equivalent rating. These scales – the Fujita scale , the Enhanced Fujita scale , the International Fujita scale , and the TORRO tornado intensity scale – attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path.

Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in North America and Europe .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale . The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F4 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 207 mph (333 km/h) and 260 mph (420 km/h).

[ 3 ] [ a ] Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999 , engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale .

[ 4 ] With building design and structural integrity taken more into account, winds in an EF4 tornado were estimated to between 166 mph (267 km/h) and 200 mph (320 km/h).

[ 5 ] The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F4/EF4 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T8 to T9 on the T-Scale. Tornadoes rated IF4 on the International Fujita scale are also included on this list.

List of F4/EF4 tornadoes [ edit ] The most recent EF4 tornado occurred on May 16, 2025 , which impacted Somerset and London, Kentucky .

Pre-1950 [ edit ] The National Weather Service in the United States did not rate any tornadoes prior to 1950. Other organizations like the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) on the other hand, did rate tornadoes prior to 1950. The only violent tornado that impacted the United States prior to 1950 and has an official rating is the 1946 Windsor–Tecumseh tornado , which received a rating from ECCC. However, the impact to the United States remains officially unrated.

Tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4 or equivalent Day Year Country Subdivision Location Fatalities Notes Rated by October 23 1091 UK Greater London London 2 London tornado of 1091 — A violent tornado destroyed 600 houses, damaged the Church of St Mary-le-bow, and killed two people. While this tornado did not receive a rating on a tornado intensity scale, a publication in the Journal of Meteorology by M. W. Roe described the tornado as a “violent whirlwind”, so it is believed to have been equivalent to an F4 tornado.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] M. W. Roe September 11 1535 Poland Lower Silesian Oleśnica 5 An F4 tornado that destroyed part of the town. The written account of this tornado was done by Dr. Alfred Wegener, which is in the CLIMDAT archive located at Leipzig University .

"A stone house had all of its wooden roof tiles ripped off and the planks reportedly broken like glass". "Deep ground scouring" occurred in numerous places as well.

[ 8 ] ESSL July 1 1891 Germany North Rhineland Lind, Süchteln, Anrath , Krefeld 3 (100 injuries) This short-lived, extremely fast-moving F4/T9 tornado destroyed the towns of Lind, Süchteln , Anrath , and Krefeld . According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory , this tornado had a path of 20 km (12.43 mi) and only was on the ground for 4 minutes, meaning the forward moving speed of this tornado was about 300.00 kilometres per hour (186.41 mph).

Hail up to 8 cm (3.15 in) occurred with this tornado.

[ 12 ] ESSL September 21 1897 Italy Apulia Oria 55 Houses and stone-walled buildings collapsed. The tornado's maximum width was 850 metres (930 yd) and had a path length of 36 kilometres (22 mi).

The tornado caused a 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) path of destruction and had an approximate width of 150 metres (490 ft).

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] With 28 deaths, it remains Canada's deadliest tornado.

ECCC November 24 1928 Denmark Southern Denmark Hostrup, Esbjerg , Alslev 0 An F4 tornado that impacted Southern Denmark along a path of 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi). Several barns were destroyed near Hostrup and gables on homes were destroyed. A home’s walls were cracked in this area as well. A pump that was “deep into the ground” was ripped up and thrown 10 metres (11 yd). In the area of the pump, a “literal” two-story brick farmhouse was “erased to the ground”, which suggested F4 level intensity.

[ 8 ] ESSL , DMI July 20 1931 Poland Lublin Lublin 6 1931 Lublin tornado — This tornado is officially rated F4; however, the Polish Weather Service estimated winds at 246 to 324 mph (396 to 521 km/h), potentially ranking it as an F5. Numerous structures were "razed to the ground".

The tornado knocked out power to most of Tecumseh as well. This tornado is not officially rated by the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States as NWS did not begin to rate tornadoes until 1950, so the damage done in the United States remains unrated.

( January 2025 ) May 31, 1985, Moshannon State Forest, Pennsylvania; It could have been a possible F5 tornado. It reportedly caused tremors that were measured as well, and the tornado was up to and just over 2 miles in width.

June 1, 1990, Bakersfield Valley, Texas; It could’ve been a possible F5 based on the damage [ 22 ] Ground scouring was seen, and oil tanks were ripped from their moorings, and rolled up a steep hill in an upwards direction. Homes were destroyed at peak intensity. The deaths from this tornado, a total of two, were in vehicles that failed to survive the winds.

June 15, 1990, Stratton, Nebraska: A violent, wedge tornado, which at times was up to 1.5 miles in width, moved across rural areas, passing near Stratton and McCook.

Homes didn't live to tell the tale either, as they were destroyed. One farmhouse was left with nothing but a clean foundation and basement behind.

This list includes tornadoes rated F4/EF4/IF4 or equivalent by government meteorologists, non-government tornado experts (i.e.

Thomas P. Grazulis or Ted Fujita ) or meteorological research institutions (i.e.

European Severe Storms Laboratory ) that rated a tornado differently than the official government organization in charge of the rating. Published academic papers or presentations at academically held meteorological conferences that rate tornadoes as F4/EF4/IF4 or present some evidence to support damage or winds in that category are also ways a tornado can be added to this list.

1870s [ edit ] Tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis gave F4 ratings to 48 tornadoes that occurred in the United States in the 1870s.
