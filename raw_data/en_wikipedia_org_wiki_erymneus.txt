Erymneus succeeded Diodorus of Tyre as scholarch (leader) of the Lyceum . Very little is known about him, and he is known only because he is mentioned by Athenaeus .

[ 1 ] He instructed Athenion , whose identity is obscure, in philosophy.

[ 2 ] He led the school while Apellicon of Teos was a member.  The school had a renewed vitality under Erymneus.
