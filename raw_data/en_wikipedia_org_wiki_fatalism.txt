_Destiny_, painting by [T. C. Gotch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cooper_Gotch "Thomas Cooper Gotch") (1885–1886), [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide "Adelaide"), [Art Gallery of South Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Gallery_of_South_Australia "Art Gallery of South Australia")

**Fatalism** is a [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1) and [philosophical doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Solomon_2003-3) which considers the entire universe as a [deterministic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system_(philosophy) "Deterministic system (philosophy)") and stresses the subjugation of all events, actions, and behaviors to [fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate "Fate") or [destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny "Destiny"), which is commonly associated with the consequent attitude of resignation in the face of future events which are thought to be inevitable and outside of human control.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Solomon_2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4)

The term "fatalism" can refer to any of the following ideas:

*   Broadly, any view according to which [human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_being "Human being") are powerless to do anything other than what they actually do.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Solomon_2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4) Included in this is the belief that all events are decided by fate and are outside human control, hence humans have no power to influence the future or indeed the outcome of their own thoughts and actions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Solomon_2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Taylor_1962-5)

More specifically:

*   Theological fatalism, according to which [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") is incompatible with the existence of an [omniscient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience "Omniscience")[God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God") who has foreknowledge of all future events.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP2-6) This is very similar to [theological determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_determinism "Theological determinism").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-7)
*   Logical fatalism, according to which propositions about the future which we take to currently be either [true or false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_or_false "True or false") can only be true or false if future events are [already determined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predeterminism "Predeterminism").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)
*   [Causal determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_determinism "Causal determinism"), which is usually treated as distinct from fatalism, on the grounds that it requires only the determination of each _successive_ state in a system by that system's prior state, rather than the _final_ state of a system being [predetermined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predeterminism "Predeterminism").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)
*   The view that the appropriate reaction to the inevitability of some future event is acceptance or resignation, rather than resistance. For instance, 19th-century German philosopher [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche") discusses what he calls "Turkish fatalism" (_Türkenfatalismus_) in his essay _[The Wanderer and His Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wanderer\_and\_His\_Shadow "The Wanderer and His Shadow")_ (1880),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4) where he makes no distinction between the terms "fate" and "fatalism".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4) This view is closer to everyday use of the word "fatalism" and parallels [defeatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeatism "Defeatism").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4)

Throughout history, the [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief") that the entire [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") is a [deterministic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system_(philosophy) "Deterministic system (philosophy)") subject to the will of [fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate "Fate") or [destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny "Destiny") has been articulated in both [Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_religions "Eastern religions") and [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_religions "Western religions") religions, philosophy, music, and literature.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Iran._J._Public_Health-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Solomon_2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stambaugh_1994-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Taylor_1962-5)

The ancient Arabs that inhabited the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula")[before the advent of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Islamic_Arabia "Pre-Islamic Arabia") used to profess a widespread belief in fatalism (_ḳadar_) alongside a fearful consideration for [the sky and the stars as divine beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_religion "Astral religion"), which they held to be ultimately responsible for every phenomenon that occurs on Earth and for the destiny of humankind.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Al-Abbasi_2020-8) Accordingly, they shaped their entire lives in accordance with their [interpretations of astral configurations and phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Al-Abbasi_2020-8)

In the _[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\_Ching "I Ching")_ and [philosophical Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Taoism "Philosophical Taoism"), the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (_see_: [Wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")). In the [philosophical schools of the Indian Subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy"), the concept of _[karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma")_ deals with similar philosophical issues to the Western concept of determinism. Karma is understood as a spiritual mechanism which causes the [eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra") (_saṃsāra_).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Bodewitz_2019-9) Karma, either positive or negative, accumulates according to an individual's actions throughout their life, and at their death determines the nature of their next life in the cycle of Saṃsāra.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Bodewitz_2019-9) Most [major religions originating in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_religions "Indian religions") hold this belief to some degree, most notably [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Bodewitz_2019-9)[Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism"), [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism "Sikhism"), and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism").

The views on the interaction of karma and free will are numerous, and diverge from each other greatly. For example, in [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism#Liberation "Sikhism"), god's grace, gained through worship, can erase one's karmic debts, a belief which reconciles the principle of karma with a monotheistic god one must freely choose to worship.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-10)[Jainists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Jainism#Material_theory "Karma in Jainism") believe in a sort of [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism "Compatibilism"), in which the cycle of Saṃsara is a completely mechanistic process, occurring without any divine intervention. The Jains hold an atomic view of reality, in which particles of karma form the fundamental microscopic building material of the universe.

In [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_India "Ancient India"), the [Ājīvika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika "Ājīvika") school of philosophy founded by [Makkhali Gosāla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkhali_Gosala "Makkhali Gosala") (around 500 BCE), otherwise referred to as "Ājīvikism" in [Western scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indology "Indology"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11) upheld the _Niyati_ ("[Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate "Fate")") doctrine of absolute fatalism or [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Leaman_1999-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Basham_1981-13) which negates the existence of [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") and _[karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma")_, and is therefore considered one of the [_nāstika_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika "Āstika and nāstika") or "heterodox" schools of [Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Leaman_1999-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Basham_1981-13) The oldest descriptions of the Ājīvika fatalists and their founder Gosāla can be found both in the [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_texts "Buddhist texts") and [Jaina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_literature "Jain literature") scriptures of ancient India.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Basham_1981-13) The predetermined fate of all sentient beings and the impossibility to achieve [liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha "Moksha") (_mokṣa_) from the [eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra") (_saṃsāra_) was the major distinctive philosophical and [metaphysical doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") of this heterodox school of Indian philosophy,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Leaman_1999-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Basham_1981-13) annoverated among the other _[Śramaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a "Śramaṇa")_ movements that emerged in India during the [Second urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India#Second_urbanisation_(c._600_%E2%80%93_200_BCE) "History of India") (600–200 BCE).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Balcerowicz-11)

[Buddhist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy "Buddhist philosophy") contains several concepts which some scholars describe as deterministic to various levels. However, the direct analysis of Buddhist metaphysics through the lens of determinism is difficult, due to the differences between European and Buddhist traditions of thought.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)

One concept which is argued to support a hard determinism is the doctrine of [dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da "Pratītyasamutpāda") (_pratītyasamutpāda_) in the [early Buddhist texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Buddhist_texts "Early Buddhist texts"), which states that all [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") (_dharma_) are necessarily caused by some other phenomenon, which it can be said to be _dependent_ on, like links in a massive, never-ending chain; the basic principle is that all things (dharmas, phenomena, principles) arise in dependence upon other things, which means that they are [fundamentally "empty" or devoid of any intrinsic, eternal essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81 "Śūnyatā") and therefore [are impermanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence_(Buddhism) "Impermanence (Buddhism)").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stanford_2022-15) In traditional Buddhist philosophy, this concept is used to explain the functioning of the [eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra") (_saṃsāra_); all thoughts and actions exert a [karmic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma") that attaches to the individual's [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), which will manifest through [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism) "Rebirth (Buddhism)") and results in future lives.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14) In other words, righteous or unrighteous actions in one life will necessarily cause good or bad responses in another future life or more lives.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-16) The early Buddhist texts and later [Tibetan Buddhist scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist_canon "Tibetan Buddhist canon") associate dependent arising with the fundamental Buddhist doctrines of [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81 "Śūnyatā") (_śūnyatā_) and [non-self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta "Anatta") (_anattā_).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stanford_2022-15)

Another Buddhist concept which many scholars perceive to be deterministic is the doctrine of [non-self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta "Anatta") (_anattā_).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14) In Buddhism, [attaining enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism "Enlightenment in Buddhism") involves one realizing that neither in [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans "Humans") nor any other [sentient beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_beings_(Buddhism) "Sentient beings (Buddhism)") is there a fundamental core of permanent being, identity, or personality which can be called the "soul", and that all sentient beings (including humans) are instead made of [several, constantly changing factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha "Skandha") which bind them to the [eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra") (_saṃsāra_).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stanford_2022-15) Sentient beings are composed of the [five aggregates of existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha "Skandha") (_skandha_): matter, sensation, perception, [mental formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_factors_(Buddhism) "Mental factors (Buddhism)"), and consciousness.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14) In the _[Saṃyutta Nikāya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83yutta\_Nik%C4%81ya "Saṃyutta Nikāya")_ of the [Pāli Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon "Pali Canon"), the [historical Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha") is recorded as saying that "just as the word 'chariot' exists on the basis of the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available."[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-17) The early Buddhist texts outline different ways in which dependent origination is a middle way between different sets of "extreme" views (such as "[monist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism")" and "[pluralist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(philosophy) "Pluralism (philosophy)")" ontologies or [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") and [dualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism "Mind–body dualism") views of mind-body relation).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-18) In the _[Kaccānagotta Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kacc%C4%81nagotta\_Sutta "Kaccānagotta Sutta")_ of the [Pāli Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon "Pali Canon") ([SN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83yutta_Nik%C4%81ya "Saṃyutta Nikāya") 12.15, parallel at [SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80gama_(Buddhism)#Sa%E1%B9%83yukta_%C4%80gama "Āgama (Buddhism)") 301), the [historical Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha") stated that "this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence" and then explains the right view as follows:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:34-19)

> But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won't have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won't have the notion of existence regarding the world.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:35-20)

Some Western scholars argue that the concept of non-self necessarily disproves the ideas of [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") and [moral responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility "Moral responsibility").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Repetti_2012-21) If there is no autonomous self, in this view, and all events are necessarily and unchangeably caused by others, then no type of autonomy can be said to exist, moral or otherwise.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Repetti_2012-21) However, other scholars disagree, claiming that the [Buddhist conception of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology "Buddhist cosmology") allows for a form of [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism "Compatibilism").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14) Buddhism perceives reality occurring on [two different levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine "Two truths doctrine"): the [ultimate reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana "Nirvana"), which can only be truly understood by the [enlightened ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism "Enlightenment in Buddhism"), and the [illusory or false reality of the material world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Buddhism "Maya (religion)"), which is considered to be "real" or "true" by those who are [ignorant about the nature of metaphysical reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Buddhism) "Avidyā (Buddhism)"); i.e., those who still haven't achieved enlightenment.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stanford_2022-15) Therefore, Buddhism perceives free will as a notion belonging to the [illusory belief in the unchanging self or personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence "Three marks of existence") that pertains to the false reality of the material world, while concepts like non-self and dependent origination belong to the ultimate reality; the transition between the two can be truly understood, Buddhists claim, by one who has attained enlightenment.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Garfield_2014-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Stanford_2022-15)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Repetti_2012-21)

Determinism and predeterminism
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatalism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Determinism and predeterminism")]

While the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, fatalism, [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"), and [predeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predeterminism "Predeterminism") are distinct, as each emphasizes a different aspect of the futility of human will or the foreordination of destiny. However, all these doctrines share common ground.

_Determinists_ generally agree that human actions affect the future but that human action is itself determined by a causal chain of prior events. Their view does not accentuate a "submission" to fate or destiny, whereas _fatalists_ stress an acceptance of future events as inevitable. Determinists believe the future is fixed specifically due to [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"); fatalists and predeterminists believe that some or all aspects of the future are inescapable but, for fatalists, not necessarily due to causality.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-22)

Fatalism is a looser term than determinism. The presence of historical "indeterminisms" or chances, i.e. events that could not be predicted by sole knowledge of other events, is an idea still compatible with fatalism. Necessity (such as a law of nature) will happen just as inevitably as a chance—both can be imagined as sovereign.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2) This idea has roots in Aristotle's work, "De interpretatione".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-23)

Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible foreknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree. If there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no human act is free.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-24) The [early Islamic philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Islamic_philosopher "Early Islamic philosopher"), [Al Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Farabi "Al Farabi"), makes the case that if God does in fact know all human actions and choices, then Aristotle's original solution to this dilemma stands.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-25)

One famous ancient argument regarding fatalism was the so-called [_Idle Argument_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_argument "Lazy argument"). It argues that if something is fated, then it would be pointless or futile to make any effort to bring it about. The Idle Argument was described by [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen "Origen") and [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") and it went like this:

*   If it is [fated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny "Destiny") for you to recover from this illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not.
*   Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so whether you call a doctor or not.
*   But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness, or it is fated that you will not recover.
*   Therefore, it is futile to consult a doctor.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-26)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-27)

The Idle Argument was anticipated by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") in his _[De Interpretatione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Interpretatione "De Interpretatione")_ chapter 9. The [Stoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoics "Stoics") considered it to be a [sophism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism "Sophism") and the Stoic [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus") attempted to refute it by pointing out that consulting the doctor would be as much fated as recovering. He seems to have introduced the idea that in cases like that at issue two events can be _co-fated_, so that one cannot occur without the other.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-28)

Logical fatalism and the argument from bivalence
------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatalism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Logical fatalism and the argument from bivalence")]

Arguments for logical fatalism go back to antiquity. The argument from bivalence depends not on causation or physical circumstances but rather is based on [logical truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth") and [metaphysical necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_necessity "Metaphysical necessity"). There are numerous versions of this argument, including those by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-29) and [Richard Clyde Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Clyde_Taylor "Richard Clyde Taylor").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-Taylor_1962-5)

The key idea of logical fatalism is that there exists necessarily [true or false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value") future describing [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition"), or statements about what is going to happen in the future, and that there is something [metaphysically necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_necessity "Metaphysical necessity") about the truth value of these statements.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2) So, for example, if it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle, then there cannot fail to be a sea battle tomorrow, since otherwise it would not be true today that such a battle will take place tomorrow.

There are two main forms of responses to logical fatalism.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:1-30) The first response is concerned with logical fatalism's reliance on the [principle of bivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence"), which says that a proposition is necessarily either true or false. If one wants to reject logical fatalism, one move to take is to reject that this principle applies to future describing propositions. Aristotle is famously attributed as making this move, though there are views that he does not.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-31) This response works well with an A-theory of time, which says that time is fundamentally tensed, and events can be classified as past, present, and perhaps, future.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-32) A-theory supports views of time that say that the future does not yet exist, like [presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(philosophy_of_time) "Presentism (philosophy of time)"). Relating to logical fatalism, If the future is considered to be undetermined, meaning that the truth value of a statement can only be determined once the event occurs, then the [principle of bivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence") can be rejected.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-33) However, the [B-theory of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time "B-theory of time") sees the past and future as being just as real as the present. On a [B-theory of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time "B-theory of time"), future facts do exist, and therefore the solution to reject the [principle of bivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence") on the grounds of undetermined future propositions does not work.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)

The second response can be attributed to [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham "William of Ockham"), and is often called the _Ockhamist Response_.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:1-30)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:2-34) This response, essentially, challenges the idea that we cannot affect the past truth of future describing propositions.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:1-30) The truth value of propositions describing the future, then, may not be as metaphysically necessary as we think.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-SEP-2)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:2-34)

The argument for logical fatalism and its responses relate closely to the [problem of future contingents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_future_contingents "Problem of future contingents"). There are responses to this problem that allow one to also overcome logical fatalism. The third truth value view says that future contingents can have a third value which is beyond truth or falsity.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:0-35) The all-false view says that all future contingents are false.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-:0-35)

### Semantic equivocation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fatalism&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Semantic equivocation")]

One criticism comes from the novelist [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace "David Foster Wallace"), who in a 1985 paper "Richard Taylor's _Fatalism_ and the Semantics of Physical Modality" suggests that [Richard Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Clyde_Taylor "Richard Clyde Taylor") reached his conclusion of fatalism only because his argument involved two different and inconsistent notions of impossibility.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-nyt-36) Wallace did not reject fatalism _per se_, as he wrote in his closing passage, "if Taylor and the fatalists want to force upon us a metaphysical conclusion, they must do metaphysics, not semantics. And this seems entirely appropriate."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-nyt-36)[Willem deVries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Vries "Willem de Vries") and [Jay Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_L._Garfield "Jay L. Garfield"), both of whom were advisers on Wallace's thesis, expressed regret that Wallace never published his argument.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism#cite_note-nyt-36) In 2010, the thesis was, however, published posthumously as _Time, Fate, and Language: An Essay on Free Will_.

Fatalism is the belief that everything an individual may encounter in his life is determined against his will and that this destiny cannot be changed by effort. In a fatalistic attitude, individuals believe that they cannot control their lives and that there is no point in making choices. Fatalism is a response to overwhelming threats that seem uncontrollable.

Turkish fatalism contains the fundamental error of placing man and fate opposite each other like two separate things: Man, it says, can strive against fate, can try to defeat it, but in the end it always remains the winner, for which reason the smartest thing to do is to give up or live just any way at all. The truth is that every man himself is a piece of fate; when he thinks he is striving against fate in the way described, fate is being realized here, too; the struggle is imaginary, but so is resignation to fate; all these imaginary ideas are included in fate. The fear that most people have of the doctrine of determinism of the will is precisely the fear of this Turkish fatalism. They think man will give up weakly and stand before the future with folded hands because he cannot change anything about it; or else he will give free rein to his total caprice because even this cannot make what is once determined still worse. The follies of man are just as much a part of fate as his cleverness: this fear of the belief in fate is also fate. You yourself, poor frightened man, are the invincible Moira reigning far above the gods; for everything that comes, you are blessing or curse and in any case the bonds in which the strongest man lies. In you the whole future of the human world is predetermined; it will not help you if you are terrified of yourself.

The Ājīvikas' emphasis on fate and determinism was so profound that later sources would consistently refer to them as _niyati-vādins_, or 'the propounders of the doctrine of destiny'.

For example, the Ajivika school argued that fate (_nyati_) governs both the [cycle of birth and rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra"), and also individual lives. Suffering is not attributed to past actions, but just takes place without any cause or rationale, as does relief from suffering. There is nothing we can do to achieve _**[moksha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha "Moksha")**_, we just have to hope that all will go well with us. [...] But the Ajivikas were committed to **[asceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism "Asceticism")**, and they justified this in terms of its practice being just as determined by fate as anything else.

Sin and suffering, attributed by [other sects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika "Āstika and nāstika") to the laws of _[karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma")_, the result of evil committed in the previous lives or in the present one, were declared by Gosāla to be without cause or basis, other, presumably, than the force of destiny. Similarly, the escape from evil, the working off of accumulated evil _karma_, was likewise without cause or basis.
