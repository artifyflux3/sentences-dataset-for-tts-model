^ Some servers will continue to host the preprint even once a published version is available. Others will 'convert' preprints to published articles (where the DOI of the published article is a version the preprint's doi). Sizes of the different repositories are therefore often not comparable.

^ If Created is red, it means that the preprint server is no longer operating.
