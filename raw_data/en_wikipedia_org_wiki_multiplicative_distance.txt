{\displaystyle \mu (AB)>1.\,} AB is congruent to A'B' iff μ μ ( A B ) = μ μ ( A ′ B ′ ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (AB)=\mu (A'B').\,} AB < A'B' iff μ μ ( A B ) < μ μ ( A ′ B ′ ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (AB)<\mu (A'B').\,} μ μ ( A B + C D ) = μ μ ( A B ) μ μ ( C D ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (AB+CD)=\mu (AB)\mu (CD).\,} See also [ edit ] Algebraic geometry Hyperbolic geometry Poincaré disc model Hilbert's arithmetic of ends References [ edit ] ^ Hartshorne, Robin (2000), Geometry: Euclid and beyond , Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics , New York: Springer-Verlag, p. 363, doi : 10.1007/978-0-387-22676-7 , ISBN 0-387-98650-2 , MR 1761093 .
