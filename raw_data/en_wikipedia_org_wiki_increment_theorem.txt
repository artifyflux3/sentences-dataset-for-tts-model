Then Δ Δ y = f ′ ( x ) Δ Δ x + ε ε Δ Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta y=f'(x)\,\Delta x+\varepsilon \,\Delta x} for some infinitesimal ε , where Δ Δ y = f ( x + Δ Δ x ) − − f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \Delta y=f(x+\Delta x)-f(x).} If Δ Δ x ≠ ≠ 0 {\textstyle \Delta x\neq 0} then we may write Δ Δ y Δ Δ x = f ′ ( x ) + ε ε , {\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}=f'(x)+\varepsilon ,} which implies that Δ Δ y Δ Δ x ≈ ≈ f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}\approx f'(x)} , or in other words that Δ Δ y Δ Δ x {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}} is infinitely close to f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle f'(x)} , or f ′ ( x ) {\textstyle f'(x)} is the standard part of Δ Δ y Δ Δ x {\textstyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}} .

A similar theorem exists in standard Calculus.  Again assume that y = f ( x ) is differentiable, but now let Δ x be a nonzero standard real number. Then the same equation Δ Δ y = f ′ ( x ) Δ Δ x + ε ε Δ Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta y=f'(x)\,\Delta x+\varepsilon \,\Delta x} holds with the same definition of Δ y , but instead of ε being infinitesimal, we have lim Δ Δ x → → 0 ε ε = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{\Delta x\to 0}\varepsilon =0} (treating x and f as given so that ε is a function of Δ x alone).
