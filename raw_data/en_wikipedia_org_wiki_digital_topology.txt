Concepts and results of digital topology are used to specify and justify important (low-level) image analysis algorithms, 
including algorithms for thinning , border or surface tracing, counting of components or tunnels, or region-filling.

History [ edit ] Digital topology was first studied in the late 1960s by the computer image analysis researcher Azriel Rosenfeld (1931–2004), whose publications on the subject played a major role in establishing and developing the field. The term "digital topology" was itself invented by Rosenfeld, who used it in a 1973 publication for the first time.

A related work called the grid cell topology , which could be considered as a link to classic combinatorial topology , appeared in the book of Pavel Alexandrov and Heinz Hopf , Topologie I (1935).  Rosenfeld et al.

proposed digital connectivity such as 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity in two dimensions as well as 6-connectivity and 26-connectivity in three dimensions. The labeling method for inferring a connected component was studied in the 1970s. Theodosios Pavlidis (1982) suggested the use of graph-theoretic algorithms such as the depth-first search method for finding connected components.

Vladimir A. Kovalevsky (1989) extended the Alexandrov–Hopf 2D grid cell topology to three and higher dimensions.   He also proposed (2008) a more general axiomatic theory of locally finite topological spaces and abstract cell complexes formerly suggested by Ernst Steinitz (1908). It is the Alexandrov topology . The book from 2008 contains new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of a metric and numerous applications to digital image analysis.

In the early 1980s, digital surfaces were studied. David Morgenthaler and Rosenfeld (1981) gave a mathematical definition of surfaces in three-dimensional digital space. This definition contains a total of nine types of digital surfaces. The digital manifold was studied in the 1990s. A recursive definition of the digital k-manifold was proposed intuitively by Chen and Zhang in 1993.

[ 1 ] Many applications were found in image processing and computer vision.

Basic results [ edit ] A basic (early) result in digital topology says that 2D binary images require the alternative use of 4- or 8-adjacency or " pixel connectivity " (for "object" or "non-object" pixels ) to ensure the basic topological duality of separation and connectedness. This alternative use corresponds to open or closed
sets in the 2D grid cell topology , and the result generalizes to 3D: the alternative use of 6- or 26-adjacency corresponds
to open or closed sets in the 3D grid cell topology . Grid cell topology also applies to multilevel (e.g., color) 2D or 3D images,
for example based on a total order of possible image values and applying a 'maximum-label rule' (see the book by Klette and Rosenfeld, 2004).

Digital topology is highly related to combinatorial topology . The main differences between them are: (1) digital topology mainly studies digital objects that are formed by grid cells (the cells of integer lattices), rather than more general cell complexes , and (2) digital topology also deals with non-Jordan manifolds.

A combinatorial manifold is a kind of manifold which is a discretization of a manifold. It usually means a piecewise linear manifold made by simplicial complexes . A digital manifold is a special kind of combinatorial manifold which is defined in digital space i.e. grid cell space.

A digital form of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem is:  Let M be a closed digital 2D manifold in direct adjacency (i.e., a (6,26)-surface in 3D). 
The formula for genus is g = 1 + ( M 5 + 2 M 6 − − M 3 ) / 8 {\displaystyle g=1+(M_{5}+2M_{6}-M_{3})/8} , where M i {\displaystyle M_{i}} indicates the set of surface-points each of which has i adjacent points on the surface (Chen and Rong, ICPR 2008).
If M is simply connected, i.e., g = 0 {\displaystyle g=0} , then M 3 = 8 + M 5 + 2 M 6 {\displaystyle M_{3}=8+M_{5}+2M_{6}} . (See also Euler characteristic .)
