Multibus I CPU card from a Sun-2 workstation Intel iSBC 386/116 Multibus II Single Board Computer with VLSI A82389 as Multibus Controller Multibus is a computer bus standard used in industrial systems. It was developed by Intel Corporation and was adopted as the IEEE 796 bus.

[ 1 ] The Multibus specification was a robust industry standard with a relatively large form factor, allowing complex devices to be designed on it. Because it was well-defined and well-documented, a Multibus-compatible industry grew around it, with many companies making card cages and enclosures for it. Many others made CPU , memory, and other peripheral boards. In 1982 there were over 100 Multibus board and systems manufacturers.

[ 2 ] This allowed complex systems to be built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and also allowed companies to innovate by designing a proprietary Multibus board, then integrate it with another vendor's hardware to create a complete system.

One example of this was Sun Microsystems with their Sun-1 and Sun-2 workstations. Sun built custom-designed CPU, memory, SCSI , and video display boards, and then added 3Com Ethernet networking boards, Xylogics SMD disk controllers , Ciprico Tapemaster 1/2 inch tape controllers, Sky Floating Point Processor , and Systech 16-port Terminal Interfaces in order to configure the system as a workstation or a file server .

[ 3 ] Other workstation vendors who used Multibus-based designs included HP / Apollo [ 4 ] and Silicon Graphics .

[ 5 ] The Intel Multibus I & II product line was purchased from Intel by RadiSys Corporation , which in 2002 was then purchased by U.S. Technologies, Inc.

Multibus architecture [ edit ] Multibus was an asynchronous bus that accommodated devices with various transfer rates while maintaining a maximum throughput . It had 20 address lines so it could address up to 1 Mb of Multibus memory and 1 Mb of I/O locations. Most Multibus I/O devices only decoded the first 64 Kb of address space.

Multibus supported multi-master functionality that allowed it to share the Multibus with multiple processors and other DMA devices.

[ 6 ] The standard Multibus form factor was a 12-inch-wide (300 mm), 6.75-inch-deep (171 mm) circuit board with two ejection levers on the front edge. The board had two buses: a wider P1 bus with pin assignment defined by the Multibus specification and a second smaller P2 bus was also defined as a private bus.

Multibus standards [ edit ] Multibus includes the following buses: Multibus System Bus — adopted as IEEE 796 iSBX (I/O Expansion Bus) — adopted as IEEE P959 iLBX Local Bus Extension [ 7 ] (Execution Bus) Multichannel I/O Bus Versions [ edit ] Multibus I [ edit ] IEEE-796: Microcomputer System Bus; First released by Intel in 1974. The cards did not use front panels, instead using card edge fingers as the connectors (similar to ISA/PC-AT cards). Companies like Northwest Technical still provide "End of Life" products for Multibus I, which is now considered obsolete.  The following are a list sections relevant to Multibus from the IEC 796 standard: IEC 796-1:1990 Microprocessor system bus—8-bit and 16-bit data (Multibus I) — Part 1: Functional description with electrical and timing specifications IEC 796-2:1990 Microprocessor system bus—8-bit and 16-bit data (Multibus I) — Part 2: Mechanical and pin descriptions for the system bus configuration, with edge connectors (direct) IEC 796-3:1990 Microprocessor system BUS I, 8-bit and 16-bit data (Multibus I) — Part 3: Mechanical and pin descriptions for the Eurocard configuration with pin and socket (indirect) connectors Multibus II [ edit ] IEEE-1296 32-bit/10 MHz bus, at 40 Mbyte/s. Card sizes are 3U x 220 mm, and 6U x 220 mm. These cards are larger than the VME Eurocard sizes, which are 3U/6U x 160mm. It uses TTL ("Fast" series) gates for drivers and the Backplane Connectors are DIN 41612 type C. Multibus II is not yet considered obsolete, but considered mature; however it is not recommended for new designs. IEEE-STD-1296: High-performance synchronous 32-bit bus: Multibus II, released in 1987, and 1994. Also as ISO/IEC 10861.

This was supplied by Westinghouse Rail Systems and commissioned from the mid-1990s. The Central line is an Automatic Train Operation line. The Automatic Train Supervision elements use a mixture of iRMX on Multibus, and Solaris on SPARC computers. Sixteen Multibus-based Local Site Computers are distributed along the line together with six central Multibus-based subsystems in the control centre.

Real time control and communications functions are provided by the Multibus-based processors and Sun workstations provide database functions and the operator consoles in the control room. All subsystem computers are dual redundant . The safety-critical Automatic Train Protection component is provided by trackside and trainborne equipment that does not use Multibus. The system was still in full operation as of 2011 [update] . In the control centre, Westinghouse also provided a cut-down mimic of the system for staff training and software test purposes using much of the same hardware and software as the full ATS system, but connected to a computer (also Multibus-II and Sun based) to simulate train movements and signaling behavior.

Oslo Metro or Oslo Tunnelbane uses a similar (although less complex) Westinghouse-supplied Multibus hardware control system through the central Common Tunnel or Fellestunnelen tracks, but was expected to be decommissioned in 2011.
