The Nigerian-born form one of the fastest-growing migrant groups in Australia.

[ 1 ] Background [ edit ] The Nigerian population in Australia has been increasing rapidly. The 2011 Census noted there are 4,519 Nigerian-born people in Australia.

[ 2 ] The population doubled since the previous census in 2006.

[ 3 ] The vast majority are skilled and educated, with 82.4% of the Nigerian-born aged 15 years and over possessing higher non-school qualifications, compared to 55.9% of the Australian population.

[ 4 ] An NOIPolls survey found that 100% of Nigerians surveyed with relatives or friends living in Australia perceive Nigerians as having better living conditions in foreign countries. The only other continent with a similar response (of 100%) from Nigerians was South America.

[ 5 ] Students [ edit ] Students have become a rapidly growing source of Nigerian migrants to Australia.

[ 6 ] Nigeria is predicted to become one of the top 10 sources of international students for Australian universities.

[ 7 ] Australia’s streamlined visa processing for international students and its post-study work rights scheme have been given some credit for this. Many Nigerians come as engineering students planning to work in their country’s oil industry. Thus universities respected in engineering such as the University of NSW have seen massive growth in their Nigerian student numbers.

[ 8 ] In 2015 it was noted that Nigerians are one of the newer student populations experiencing huge growth in Australia, comparable to student populations from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

Find sources: "Nigerian Australians" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Before the 1980s, the number of Nigerians in Australia was quite small. Australia's immigration policy was heavily based on a "White Australia" approach, which restricted non-European immigration. This meant that the African community, including Nigerians, had little presence in Australia. However, there were some early Nigerian students who came to Australia in the 1960s and 1970s. These students typically came for educational opportunities in fields like medicine, engineering and law. However, their numbers were relatively small, and they were not a significant part of the overall African migrant population.

[ citation needed ] The 1980s and 1990s saw a significant shift in Australia's immigration policy, particularly with the dismantling of the "White Australia" policy and the introduction of a more inclusive, multicultural approach. During this time, Nigerian immigration to Australia began to increase, albeit slowly.

[ citation needed ] In the 2000s, there was a significant increase in Nigerian migration to Australia. Nigerian Australians became more visible in various areas of Australian society, including business, academia and the arts.

[ citation needed ] By the 2010s, Nigerian Australians had established themselves as an important and visible society within Australia. They contributed to the cultural, economic and social fabric of Australian life.

[ citation needed ] Population distribution [ edit ] One third of Nigerians in Australia live in Sydney , and one quarter reside in Melbourne .

[ 10 ] Half of Australia’s Igbo-speakers live in Sydney.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] There are many thousands of speakers of Nigerian languages, particularly Igbo, and Yoruba [ 13 ] Nigerian cuisine can be found in restaurants in the more diverse Australian cities such as Sydney and Melbourne.
