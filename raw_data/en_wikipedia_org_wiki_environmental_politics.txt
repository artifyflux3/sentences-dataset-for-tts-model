( Discuss ) Proposed since February 2025.

Study of politics about the environment This article is about the discipline. For the practice by governments, see Environmental policy . For the journal, see Environmental Politics (journal) .

Environmental politics designate both the politics about the environment [ 1 ] and an academic field of study focused on three core components: [ 2 ] The study of political theories and ideas related to the environment ; The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream political parties and environmental social movements ; and The analysis of public policymaking and implementation affecting the environment, at multiple geo-political levels .

Neil Carter, in his foundational text Politics of the Environment (2009), suggests that environmental politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, "it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world" (page 3); and second, "unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., Greening the Millenium?

, 1997).

[ 2 ] Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular conservationism and preservationism . Contemporary environmental politics "was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity." And "modern environmentalism was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society."
