Like all synthetic elements, it has no stable isotopes . The first isotope to be synthesized was 258 Lr in 1961. There are fourteen known isotopes from 251 Lr to 266 Lr, except 263 Lr and 265 Lr, and seven isomers . The longest-lived known isotope is 266 Lr with a half-life of 11 hours.

Evidence was provided for the formation of 253 Lr in the 2n exit channel. In 2022, two states ( 253 Lr and 253m Lr) were found.

203 Tl( 50 Ti,xn) 253−x Lr (x=2) This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR. In 2022, two states ( 251 Lr and 251m Lr) were found.

208 Pb( 48 Ti,pxn) 255−x Lr (x=1?) This reaction was reported in 1984 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR. The team was able to detect decays of 246 Cf, a descendant of 254 Lr.

208 Pb( 45 Sc,xn) 253−x Lr This reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by Yuri Oganessian and his team at the FLNR. Results are not readily available.

209 Bi( 48 Ca,xn) 257−x Lr (x=2) This reaction has been used to study the spectroscopic properties of 255 Lr. The team at GANIL used the reaction in 2003 and the team at the FLNR used it between 2004–2006 to provide further information for the decay scheme of 255 Lr. The work provided evidence for an isomeric level in 255 Lr.

Hot fusion [ edit ] 243 Am( 18 O,xn) 261−x Lr (x=5) This reaction was first studied in 1965 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect activity with a characteristic decay of 45 seconds, which was assigned to 256 Lr or 257 Lr. Later work suggests an assignment to 256 Lr. Further studies in 1968 produced an 8.35–8.60 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 35 seconds. This activity was also initially assigned to 256 Lr or 257 Lr and later to solely 256 Lr.

243 Am( 16 O,xn) 259−x Lr (x=4) This reaction was studied in 1970 by the team at the FLNR. They were able to detect an 8.38 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of 20 s. This was assigned to 255 Lr.

248 Cm( 15 N,xn) 263−x Lr (x=3,4,5) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL in their large study of lawrencium isotopes. They were able to assign alpha activities to 260 Lr, 259 Lr and 258 Lr from the 3-5n exit channels.

248 Cm( 18 O,pxn) 265−x Lr (x=3,4) This reaction was studied in 1988 at the LBNL [ 9 ] in order to examine the possibility of producing 262 Lr and 261 Lr without using the exotic 254 Es target, and successfully accomplished this. After chemical purification of the Lr from the reaction, they were able to measure fission from 261 Lr with an improved half-life of 44 minutes. The production cross-section was 700 pb; from this a 14% electron capture branch of 261m Rf was calculated if this isotope had been produced via the 5n channel rather than the p4n channel. This is an upper limit, as it was determined that the p4n channel does occur. A lower bombarding energy (93 MeV instead of 97 MeV) was then used to measure the production of 262 Lr in the p3n channel; as it was calculated that any electron capture of 262 Rf should be negligible, the 4n channel was discounted. The isotope was successfully detected and a 240 pb cross-section measured. This detection of the p3n channel supported the p4n assignment for the lighter isotope. For neither was there any attempt to differentiate the SF and EC+SF decay modes.

246 Cm( 14 N,xn) 260−x Lr (x=3?) This reaction was studied briefly in 1958 at the LBNL using an enriched 244 Cm target (5% 246 Cm). They observed a ~9 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of ~0.25 seconds. Later results suggest a tentative assignment to 257 Lr from the 3n channel.

244 Cm( 14 N,xn) 258−x Lr This reaction was studied briefly in 1958 at the LBNL using an enriched 244 Cm target (5% 246 Cm). They observed a ~9 MeV alpha activity with a half-life of ~0.25s. Later results suggest a tentative assignment to 257 Lr from the 3n channel with the 246 Cm component. No activities assigned to reaction with the 244 Cm component have been reported.

249 Bk( 18 O,αxn) 263−x Lr (x=3) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL in their large study of lawrencium isotopes. They were able to detect an activity assigned to 260 Lr. The reaction was further studied in 1988 to study the aqueous chemistry of lawrencium. A total of 23 alpha decays were measured for 260 Lr, with a mean energy of 8.03 MeV and an improved half-life of 2.7 minutes. The calculated cross-section was 8.7 nb.

252 Cf( 11 B,xn) 263−x Lr (x=5,7??) This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% 252 Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 258 Lr, resulting from the 5n exit channel. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 256 Lr. This is most likely from the 33% 250 Cf component in the target rather than from the 7n channel. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium .

252 Cf( 10 B,xn) 262−x Lr (x=4,6) This reaction was first studied in 1961 at the University of California by Albert Ghiorso by using a californium target (52% 252 Cf). They observed three alpha activities of 8.6, 8.4 and 8.2 MeV, with half-lives of about 8 and 15 seconds, respectively. The 8.6 MeV activity was tentatively assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 258 Lr. The 8.4 MeV activity was also assigned to 257 Lr. Later results suggest a reassignment to 256 Lr. The 8.2 MeV was subsequently associated with nobelium .

250 Cf( 14 N,αxn) 260−x Lr (x=3) This reaction was studied in 1971 at the LBNL. They were able to identify a 0.7s alpha activity with two alpha lines at 8.87 and 8.82 MeV. This was assigned to 257 Lr.

249 Cf( 11 B,xn) 260−x Lr (x=4) This reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in an attempt to study the aqueous chemistry of lawrencium. They were able to measure a Lr 3+ activity. The reaction was repeated in 1976 at Oak Ridge and 26s 256 Lr was confirmed by measurement of coincident X-rays.

249 Cf( 12 C,pxn) 260−x Lr (x=2) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL. They were able to detect an activity assigned to 258 Lr from the p2n channel.

249 Cf( 15 N,αxn) 260−x Lr (x=2,3) This reaction was studied in 1971 by the team at the LBNL. They were able to detect an activities assigned to 258 Lr and 257 Lr from the α2n and α3n and channels. The reaction was repeated in 1976 at Oak Ridge and the synthesis of 258 Lr was confirmed.

254 Es + 22 Ne – transfer This reaction was studied in 1987 at the LLNL.

[ 10 ] They were able to detect new spontaneous fission (SF) activities assigned to 261 Lr and 262 Lr, resulting from transfer from the 22 Ne nuclei to the 254 Es target. In addition, a 5 ms SF activity was detected in delayed coincidence with nobelium K-shell X-rays and was assigned to 262 No, resulting from the electron capture of 262 Lr.

251 Lr is the lightest isotope of lawrencium to be produced to date.

Lawrencium-253 isomers [ edit ] A study of the decay properties of 257 Db (see dubnium ) in 2001 by Hessberger et al. at the GSI provided some data for the decay of 253 Lr. Analysis of the data indicated the population of an isomeric level in 253 Lr from the decay of the corresponding isomer in 257 Db. The ground state was assigned spin and parity of 7/2−, decaying by emission of an 8794 keV alpha particle with a half-life of 0.57 s. The isomeric level was assigned spin and parity of 1/2−, decaying by emission of an 8722 keV alpha particle with a half-life of 1.49 s.

Lawrencium-255 isomers [ edit ] Recent work on the spectroscopy of 255 Lr formed in the reaction 209 Bi( 48 Ca,2n) 255 Lr has provided evidence for an isomeric level.
