He was a teacher of Plutarch , who praises his great learning, [ 1 ] and introduces him discoursing on religion and sacred rites.

[ 2 ] Plutarch wrote a biography of him, which is no longer extant, and also mentioned Ammonius master in other works like the De E apud Delphos [ 3 ] [ 4 ] within the collection of treatises known as Moralia . From the information supplied by Plutarch, Ammonius was clearly an expert in the works of Aristotle , but he may have nevertheless been a Platonist philosopher rather than a Peripatetic .

He may be the Ammonius of Lamprae (in Attica ) quoted by Athenaeus [ 5 ] as the author of a book on altars and sacrifices ( Greek : Περὶ βωμῶν καὶ Θυσιῶν ). Athenaeus also mentions a work on Athenian courtesans ( Greek : Περὶ τῶν Ἀθηνσινῆ Ἑταιρίδων ) as written by an Ammonius.
