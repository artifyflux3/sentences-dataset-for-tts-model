of episodes 30 (+ 1 special) Production Running time 45 minutes Production company Flight 33 Productions Original release Network History Release January 21, 2008 ( 2008-01-21 ) – September 15, 2025 ( 2025-09-15 ) Life After People is a television series on which scientists, mechanical engineers , and other experts speculate about what might become of planet Earth if humanity suddenly disappeared . The featured experts also talk about the impact of human absence on the environment and the vestiges of civilization thus left behind. The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008, on the History Channel which served as a de facto pilot for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.

After a 15 year hiatus, History will air a new third season beginning July 14, 2025.

[ 1 ] [ failed verification ] Format [ edit ] The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household pets and livestock that have to fend for themselves. The thought experiment is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and thus, the discontinuation of the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins: What would happen if every human on Earth disappeared?  This isn't the story of how we might vanish...it is the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind.

The series' episodes thematically offer examples of urban and biological decay . The focus is on specific locations such as skyscrapers, religious icons , bridges and dams, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as artifacts, documents and human bodies. The fate of some kinds of flora and fauna are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including ghost towns and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of landmarks around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.

The various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using CGI dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends at various intervals up to one hundred million years into the future.

Beginning with the third season, there is use of map-visualizations and AI generated video which uses an AI tag on the lower-left to identify it.

Snack cakes - including a certain brand known for its longevity - survive at least 25 years thanks to the preservatives inside them, but are outlasted by jars of honey, which can remain edible for millennia.

The subterranean Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico are repopulated by bats, mineral rich water and geothermal heating means the already gigantic gypsum crystals inside the Naica Mine 's Cave of the Crystals grow larger still, and humankind's former geothermal power sites such as the Geysers in northern California relinquish their strength to geologic forces.
