The inflection points of the cross-section are at the surface of the body.

In physics , a force field is a vector field corresponding with a non-contact force acting on a particle at various positions in space . Specifically, a force field is a vector field F {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} } , where F ( r ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )} is the force that a particle would feel if it were at the position r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } .

[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects. A gravitational force field models this influence that a massive body (or more generally, any quantity of energy ) extends into the space around itself.

[ 2 ] In Newtonian gravity , a particle of mass M creates a gravitational field g = − − G M r 2 r ^ ^ {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {-GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}} , where the radial unit vector r ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}} points away from the particle. The gravitational force experienced by a particle of light mass m , close to the surface of Earth is given by F = m g {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {g} } , where g is Earth's gravity .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] An electric field E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } exerts a force on a point charge q , given by F = q E {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {E} } .

[ 5 ] In a magnetic field B {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} } , a point charge moving through it experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the direction of the field, following the relation: F = q v × × B {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} } .

Work [ edit ] Work is dependent on the displacement as well as the force acting on an object. As a particle moves through a force field along a path C , the work done by the force is a line integral : W = ∫ ∫ C F ⋅ ⋅ d r {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} } This value is independent of the velocity /momentum that the particle travels along the path.

Conservative force field [ edit ] For a conservative force field , it is also independent of the path itself, depending only on the starting and ending points. Therefore, the work for an object travelling in a closed path is zero, since its starting and ending points are the same: ∮ ∮ C F ⋅ ⋅ d r = 0 {\displaystyle \oint _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =0} If the field is conservative, the work done can be more easily evaluated by realizing that a conservative vector field can be written as the gradient of some scalar potential function: F = − − ∇ ∇ ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-\nabla \phi } The work done is then simply the difference in the value of this potential in the starting and end points of the path. If these points are given by x = a and x = b , respectively: W = ϕ ϕ ( b ) − − ϕ ϕ ( a ) {\displaystyle W=\phi (b)-\phi (a)} See also [ edit ] Classical mechanics Field line Force Mechanical work References [ edit ] ^ Mathematical methods in chemical engineering, by V.
