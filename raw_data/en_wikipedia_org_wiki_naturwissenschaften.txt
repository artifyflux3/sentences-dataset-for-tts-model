01759509 Links Journal homepage Online access The Science of Nature , formerly Naturwissenschaften , is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Springer Science+Business Media covering all aspects of the natural sciences relating to questions of biological significance. It was founded in 1913 and intended as a German-language equivalent of the English-language journal Nature , at a time when German was still a dominant language of the natural sciences. The journal is now published in English.

History [ edit ] Die Naturwissenschaften was founded in 1913 by Arnold Berliner and published by Julius Springer Verlag.

[ 1 ] Berliner intended to create a German equivalent to the English-language journal Nature . The original subtitle Wochenschrift für die Fortschritte der Naturwissenschaften, der Medizin und der Technik ( Weekly Publication of the Advances in the Natural Sciences, Medicine and Technology ) was later changed to its current The Science of Nature . The journal is published monthly and the articles are exclusively in English, after a gradual transition from German to English during the 1990s.

[ 2 ] In January 2015, the journal changed its name to The Science of Nature .
