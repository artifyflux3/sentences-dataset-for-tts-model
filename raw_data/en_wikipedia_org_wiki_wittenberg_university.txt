History [ edit ] This article is missing information about recent cuts.

Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page .

( September 2024 ) Wittenberg College was founded in 1845 by a group of ministers in the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio, which had previously separated from the recently established German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States . The college was named for the historic University of Wittenberg in Wittenberg , Germany, the town in which Martin Luther famously posted his Ninety-five Theses on the church door on October 31, 1517.

[ 5 ] A German American pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church , the Rev.

Ezra Keller was the principal founder and first president of the college. Its initial focus was to train clergy with the Hamma School of Divinity as its theological department. One of its main missions was to "Americanize" Lutherans by teaching courses in the English language instead of German , unlike the nearby Capital University in Columbus, Ohio .

[ 5 ] The first class originally consisted of eight students at the beginning of the academic year, but grew to seventy-one by the end. With a faculty of one professor and two tutors, classes were held in Springfield, Ohio , in a church on land that was donated. That city was selected for its location on the National Road , running from the eastern cities of Baltimore and Cumberland, Maryland , to the west in the Illinois Country , eventually to the territorial capital of Vandalia , near the Mississippi River .

In 1874, women were admitted to the college, and, the following year, black people were admitted. The college attained university status in 1957 and was renamed accordingly.

[ 5 ] In 1993, the university and its namesake city Wittenberg entered into an official partnership.

In 1995, the American Philosophical Association censured Wittenberg University when the Wittenberg administration overruled the faculty personnel board and denied tenure to Leemon McHenry , a member of the faculty.

[ 6 ] The university was sanctioned in 2021 by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), for discontinuing eight academic programs and firing two tenured faculty members without, in the AAUP's opinion, respecting faculty rights.

[ 7 ] Hamma Divinity School [ edit ] Luther Alexander Gotwald , Professor of Theology in the Hamma Divinity School that served as the theological department of the college, was famously tried for and unanimously acquitted of heresy by the board of directors at Wittenberg on April 4–5, 1893. The trial concerned many key issues that Evangelical Lutherans still debate today.

[ 8 ] For decades, Hamma and Wittenberg were associated with the local English-speaking regional Lutheran synods in the Midwest.

In 1978, Hamma Divinity School merged with the nearby Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (associated with Capital University ) in the Bexley suburb of Columbus, Ohio, to form Trinity Lutheran Seminary .

This project will include the renovation of the university's 1929 Field House, 1982 HPER Center, and include a new indoor practice field, classrooms, and locker rooms. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

[ 22 ] In September 2018, it was announced the facility would be named "The Steemer", after the company Stanley Steemer , whose CEO, Wes Bates, is a graduate of Wittenberg and a major financial sponsor of the project.

[ 23 ] Student organizations [ edit ] The university has over 50 active, registered student organizations, ranging from student-led organizations to Academic and Honor Societies.

Wittenberg's residence halls on campus are Tower Hall, Myers Hall, Firestine Hall, Ferncliff Hall, Woodlawn Hall, New Residence Hall, and Polis House. Each residence hall includes TV-lounges, ping-pong tables, vending machines, cooking appliances, student printers, and laundry facilities. The only residence halls without air conditioning include Woodlawn Hall, Ferncliff Hall, and Myers Hall. Some residence halls include a technology or computer lab within the buildings, including Woodlawn, Myers, and New Hall.

Myers Hall is the oldest, the first campus building when the university opened. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Myers Hall is four-stories tall, but does not include an elevator, as the build was finished in 1851. It has housed the University Honors Program for many years, but was eventually moved to Woodlawn Hall. Myers is currently offline, or unavailable for students to live in for the 2024-2025 academic year.

Right across from the University's President and Provost's residence, holds Ferncliff Hall with 151 students across four-floors. Including a vintage freight elevator, Ferncliff includes various amenities throughout the building and is in close proximity to the WittenBurbs (upperclassmen housing), Commencement Hollow, and Koch Hall.

Being closely located to the residence halls and Benham-Pence Student Center, the air conditioned and co-ed Firestine Hall is home to 220 students. Right outside of Firestine Hall includes recreational sports courts, including basketball and sand volleyball courts.

Another residence hall known for its central location on campus is Woodlawn Hall, a four-floor building with no elevator. Previously known as Beta Theta Pi's fraternity house until 1939, Woodlawn provides various amenities and houses the University Honors Program.

The newest residence hall, New Hall, opened in 2006. It is centrally located on campus and in close proximity to the Benham-Pence Student Center, Thomas Library, and Blair Hall. New Hall is co-ed, includes 3-floors with an elevator, and houses the Ubuntu Themed Living Community. Ubuntu, or "I am because we are," was created for students who seek an inclusive and diverse space of living, in specifically Black and Brown cultures. Students have compared New Hall to that of a hotel, given its interesting amenities. Previously, New Hall contained a higher tuition price than other residence halls on campus, but has since been equalized with the other six residence halls on campus since the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020.

The Polis House was formerly the international residence hall on campus, and is now the Tiger Pride Themed Living Community, beginning in 2021. It is the gender-inclusive residence hall on campus, along with the first floor of Ferncliff Hall. Polis House is the smallest residence hall on campus, housing 30 students across all three floors, and contains no elevator.

Tower Hall includes various amenities and has a lively bottom-floor that includes a ping-pong table, laundry appliances, and a TV-lounge. Tower Hall is connected to, or adjacent with the University Theatre & Dance building, Chakeres Theatre.
