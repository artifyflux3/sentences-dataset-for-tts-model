One of the most familiar additive identities is the number 0 from elementary mathematics , but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in groups and rings .

Elementary examples [ edit ] The additive identity familiar from elementary mathematics is zero, denoted 0 . For example, 5 + 0 = 5 = 0 + 5.

{\displaystyle 5+0=5=0+5.} In the natural numbers ⁠ N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } ⁠ (if 0 is included), the integers ⁠ Z , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ,} ⁠ the rational numbers ⁠ Q , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} ,} ⁠ the real numbers ⁠ R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} ⁠ and the complex numbers ⁠ C , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,} ⁠ the additive identity is 0.  This says that for a number n belonging to any of these sets, n + 0 = n = 0 + n .

{\displaystyle n+0=n=0+n.} Formal definition [ edit ] Let N be a group that is closed under the operation of addition , denoted + . An additive identity for N , denoted e , is an element in N such that for any element n in N , e + n = n = n + e .

{\displaystyle e+n=n=n+e.} Further examples [ edit ] In a group , the additive identity is the identity element of the group, is often denoted 0, and is unique (see below for proof).

A ring or field is a group under the operation of addition and thus these also have a unique additive identity 0. This is defined to be different from the multiplicative identity 1 if the ring (or field) has more than one element. If the additive identity and the multiplicative identity are the same, then the ring is trivial (proved below).

In the ring M m × n ( R ) of m -by- n matrices over a ring R , the additive identity is the zero matrix, [ 1 ] denoted O or 0 , and is the m -by- n matrix whose entries consist entirely of the identity element 0 in R . For example, in the 2×2 matrices over the integers ⁠ M 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( Z ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {M} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} ⁠ the additive identity is 0 = [ 0 0 0 0 ] {\displaystyle 0={\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}}} In the quaternions , 0 is the additive identity.

In the ring of functions from ⁠ R → → R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } ⁠ , the function mapping every number to 0 is the additive identity.

In the additive group of vectors in ⁠ R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} ⁠ the origin or zero vector is the additive identity.

Properties [ edit ] The additive identity is unique in a group [ edit ] Let ( G , +) be a group and let 0 and 0' in G both denote additive identities, so for any g in G , 0 + g = g = g + 0 , 0 ′ + g = g = g + 0 ′ .

{\displaystyle 0+g=g=g+0,\qquad 0'+g=g=g+0'.} It then follows from the above that 0 ′ = 0 ′ + 0 = 0 ′ + 0 = 0 .

{\displaystyle {\color {green}0'}={\color {green}0'}+0=0'+{\color {red}0}={\color {red}0}.} The additive identity annihilates ring elements [ edit ] In a system with a multiplication operation that distributes over addition, the additive identity is a multiplicative absorbing element , meaning that for any s in S , s · 0 = 0 . This follows because: s ⋅ ⋅ 0 = s ⋅ ⋅ ( 0 + 0 ) = s ⋅ ⋅ 0 + s ⋅ ⋅ 0 ⇒ ⇒ s ⋅ ⋅ 0 = s ⋅ ⋅ 0 − − s ⋅ ⋅ 0 ⇒ ⇒ s ⋅ ⋅ 0 = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s\cdot 0&=s\cdot (0+0)=s\cdot 0+s\cdot 0\\\Rightarrow s\cdot 0&=s\cdot 0-s\cdot 0\\\Rightarrow s\cdot 0&=0.\end{aligned}}} The additive and multiplicative identities are different in a non-trivial ring [ edit ] Let R be a ring and suppose that the additive identity 0 and the multiplicative identity 1 are equal, i.e. 0 = 1. Let r be any element of R . Then r = r × × 1 = r × × 0 = 0 {\displaystyle r=r\times 1=r\times 0=0} proving that R is trivial, i.e.

R = {0}.

The contrapositive , that if R is non-trivial then 0 is not equal to 1, is therefore shown.
