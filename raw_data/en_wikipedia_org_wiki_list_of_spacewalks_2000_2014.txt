[ 1 ] Since 1981, NASA has measured spacewalk duration from when the suits went to internal power until the start of airlock re-pressurization.

Roscosmos has always measured spacewalk duration from the time of hatch opening to hatch closure.

[ 1 ] These charts typically follow the agency's measurements of spacewalk duration, because those figures tend to be the most readily available, as they are most often provided by the agency.

2000–2004 spacewalks [ edit ] Spacewalk beginning and ending times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
