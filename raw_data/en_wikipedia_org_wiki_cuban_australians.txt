2,165 Cuban Australians were residing in Australia as of 2024, of whom 1,050 had been born in Cuba , [ 2 ] whereas some other 1,114 people include those who were born in Australia and those who were born elsewhere abroad and claimed either partial or full Cuban ancestry.

The Cuban immigration to Australia goes back to the early 1980s , to a point where millions of Cubans left Cuba during the takeover of Fidel Castro 's regime for many other countries worldwide, of whom many have settled in Oceania , mainly in Australia .

Between 2018 and 2023, the Australian Bureau of Statistics registered 71 new Cuban-born individuals residing in the country, [ 2 ] between 2023 and 2024, 30 new Cuban-born nationals were residing the country, with major concentrations of settlement along the eastern coast of the country.

Most Cuban Australians are concentrated in New South Wales , [ 1 ] from the Greater Sydney area to Campbelltown, New South Wales , [ 1 ] referred to as to the pinpoint gateway of immigration for Cuban migrants in the country, where is hosted the fastest growing population, followed by the states of Queensland and Victoria(state) , with the cities of Brisbane , [ 1 ] Gold Coast, Queensland [ 1 ] and Melbourne [ 1 ] hosting other significant concentrations among all other surrounding areas.

Western Australia is ranked fourth state per Cuban Australian population, where another significant population is on its current growth, due to especially a significant number of Cubans who happen to be enrolled in the medication field and related studies.
