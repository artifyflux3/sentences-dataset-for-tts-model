Open Yale Courses provides free access to a selection of introductory courses, and uses a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial- Share Alike license.

Open Yale Courses launched in December 2007 with seven courses from various departments. The project now includes 40 courses from a broad range of introductory courses taught at Yale college.

[ 1 ] The initiative was funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation , [ 2 ] which has supported other universities' OpenCourseWare projects.

[ 3 ] Users are not required to be enrolled at Yale to take any of these courses, as the courses are available for "all that wish to learn". However, no actual college credits are attainable from these courses.
