Though nominally independent, sister republics were heavily reliant on French protection, making them in effect client states of France. This became particularly evident after the First French Empire was established in 1804, after which France annexed several sister republics and transformed the remainder into monarchies ruled by members of the House of Bonaparte .

History [ edit ] The French Revolution was a period of social and political upheaval in France from 1789 until 1799. The Republicans who overthrew the monarchy were driven by ideas of popular sovereignty , rule of law , and representative democracy . The Republicans borrowed ideas and values from Whiggism and Enlightenment philosophers. The French Republic supported the spread of republican principles in Europe. According to Paul D. Van Wie, most of these sister republics became a means of controlling occupied lands as client regimes through a mix of French and local power.
