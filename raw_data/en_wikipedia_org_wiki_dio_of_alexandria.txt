Along with being an Academic Skeptic, Dio was an avid believer in the Greek gods and Titans, specifically worshipping the personification of time, Chronos . He was sent by his fellow citizens as ambassador to Rome , leading a delegation of a hundred citizens, to complain about the conduct of their king, Ptolemy XII Auletes .  In Rome in 57 BC he was poisoned by the king's secret agents, and the strongest suspicion of the murder fell upon Marcus Caelius .

[ 1 ] The defence of Caelius in April 56 BC, the Pro Caelio , is considered one of Cicero's and indeed Rome's greatest orations.

[ 2 ] His brother was the wrestler Topsius ( Ancient Greek : Τόψιος ).
