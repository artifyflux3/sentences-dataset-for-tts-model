He is also a former cricketer at first-class level: a right-handed batsman for Cambridge University and Lancashire.

[ 1 ] Education and academic career [ edit ] Craig was born in Formby , Lancashire, and educated at Charterhouse . He read philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge (1960–1963), and was Reader in Philosophy at Cambridge from 1992 to 1998. He became Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy in 1998, a chair he held until his retirement in 2006. He is a Fellow of Churchill College. He edited the journal Ratio from 1988 to 1992.

[ 2 ] Cricket career [ edit ] It was while an undergraduate at Cambridge that Craig made his first-class cricket debut for Cambridge University against Surrey at Fenner's . He made sixteen appearances in his debut season for the university and gained his cricket Blue .

[ 3 ] He also made the first of his two appearances for the Gentlemen against the Players in this season, as well as making his first-class debut for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire . He made three further appearances in total that season for Lancashire.

[ 4 ] His debut season was a resounding success, with 1,528 runs at an average of 42.44. He made five centuries and had a high score of 208 not out .

[ 5 ] For Cambridge University alone, he scored 1,342 runs at an average of 47.92, including a score of 105 in The University Match , [ 3 ] and his unbeaten 208 against L.C. Stevens' XI .

[ 6 ] In 1962 , Craig made sixteen first-class appearances for Cambridge University, [ 4 ] scoring 1,158 runs at an average of 44.53.

[ 3 ] He once again appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players in its final fixture, as well as making a further two first-class appearances for Lancashire in that season's County Championship against Essex and Sussex . He appeared six times in first-class cricket for his native county, scoring 214 runs at an average of 21.40, though he only passed fifty once, [ 7 ] making 89 against Nottinghamshire the previous season at the Town Ground, Worksop .

[ 8 ] His overall season first-class record stood at 1,151 runs at an average of 31.97, with a highest score of 151 not out .

[ 5 ] He continued to play for Cambridge University in 1963, making fewer appearances than previous seasons due to examination commitments. He made ten appearances, with his final first-class appearance coming against Oxford University in The University Match at Lord's.

[ 4 ] He performed less consistently than in previous seasons, scoring 424 runs at an average of 30.28, with a highest score of 87, one of three half-centuries.

[ 5 ] In total, Craig made 42 first-class appearances for the university, scoring 2,879 runs at an average of 39.98, with a highest score 208 not out among his seven centuries.

[ 7 ] Ultimately, Craig decided to pursue a career in academia rather than cricket.

Mike Brearley , who played alongside him in the Cambridge University team, described him as "a better scholar and batsman than I was". The cricket writer John Arlott included Craig in a list of players he considered had the potential, had they continued with their cricket careers, to have played Test cricket .

[ 3 ] Despite the end of his professional cricket career, he did appear for Cambridgeshire in a single List A match against Oxfordshire in the 1st round of the 1967 Gillette Cup , [ 9 ] scoring 12 runs before being dismissed by David Laitt . Cambridgeshire won the match by four wickets, [ 10 ] but Craig didn't feature for the county again.
