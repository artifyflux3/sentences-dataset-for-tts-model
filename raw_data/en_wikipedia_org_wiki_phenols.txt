For the molecule alone, see Phenol .

In organic chemistry , phenols , sometimes called phenolics , are a class of chemical compounds consisting of one or more hydroxyl groups (− O H ) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group.

[ 1 ] The simplest is phenol , C 6 H 5 OH . Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule.

Phenol –  the simplest of the phenols Chemical structure of salicylic acid , the active metabolite of aspirin Phenols are both synthesized industrially and produced by plants and microorganisms.

[ 2 ] Properties [ edit ] Acidity [ edit ] Phenols are more acidic than typical alcohols. The acidity of the hydroxyl group in phenols is commonly intermediate between that of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids (their pK a is usually between 10 and 12). Deprotonation of a phenol forms a corresponding negative phenolate ion or phenoxide ion, and the corresponding salts are called phenolates or phenoxides (aryloxides, according to the IUPAC Gold Book).

[ citation needed ] Condensation with aldehydes and ketones [ edit ] Phenols are susceptible to electrophilic aromatic substitutions . Condensation with formaldehyde gives resinous materials, famously Bakelite .

[ citation needed ] Another industrial-scale electrophilic aromatic substitution is the production of bisphenol A , which is produced by the condensation with acetone .

[ 3 ] C-Alkylation with alkenes [ edit ] Phenol is readily alkylated at the ortho positions using alkenes in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium phenoxide : [ citation needed ] CH 2 =CR 2 +  C 6 H 5 OH  →  R 2 CHCH 2 -2-C 6 H 4 OH More than 100,000 tons of tert-butyl phenols are produced annually (year: 2000) in this way, using isobutylene (CH 2 =CMe 2 ) as the alkylating agent. Especially important is 2,6-ditert-butylphenol , a versatile antioxidant .

[ 3 ] Other reactions [ edit ] Phenols undergo esterification . Phenol esters are active esters , being prone to hydrolysis . Phenols are reactive species toward oxidation . Oxidative cleavage, for instance cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to the monomethylester of 2,4-hexadienedioic acid with oxygen, copper chloride in pyridine .

[ 4 ] Oxidative de-aromatization to quinones also known as the Teuber reaction . Oxidizing reagents are Fremy's salt [ 5 ] and oxone .

[ 6 ] In reaction depicted below 3,4,5-trimethylphenol reacts with singlet oxygen generated from oxone / sodium carbonate in an acetonitrile /water mixture to a para-peroxyquinole. This hydroperoxide is reduced to the quinole with sodium thiosulfate .

Phenols are oxidized to hydroquinones in the Elbs persulfate oxidation .

Reaction of naphtols and hydrazines and sodium bisulfite in the Bucherer carbazole synthesis .

Synthesis [ edit ] Many phenols of commercial interest are prepared by elaboration of phenol or cresols . They are typically produced by the alkylation of benzene / toluene with propylene to form cumene then O 2 is added with H 2 SO 4 to form phenol ( Hock process ). In addition to the reactions above, many other more specialized reactions produce phenols: rearrangement of esters in the Fries rearrangement [ 7 ] [ 8 ] rearrangement of N -phenylhydroxylamines in the Bamberger rearrangement [ 9 ] [ 10 ] dealkylation of phenolic ethers reduction of quinones replacement of an aromatic amine by an hydroxyl group with water and sodium bisulfide in the Bucherer reaction [ 11 ] thermal decomposition of aryl diazonium salts, the salts are converted to phenol [ 12 ] by the oxidation of aryl silanes—an aromatic variation of the Fleming-Tamao oxidation [ 13 ] catalytic synthesis from aryl bromides and iodides using nitrous oxide [ 14 ] Classification [ edit ] The best-selling drug in the U.S., Acetaminophen , also known as Paracetamol, is a phenol.

There are various classification schemes.

[ 15 ] : 2 A commonly used scheme is based on the number of carbons and was devised by Jeffrey Harborne and Simmonds in 1964 and published in 1980: [ 15 ] : 2 [ 16 ] Phenol the parent compound, used as a disinfectant and for chemical synthesis Bisphenol A and other bisphenols produced from ketones and phenol / cresol BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) - a fat-soluble antioxidant and food additive 4-Nonylphenol a breakdown product of detergents and nonoxynol-9 Orthophenyl phenol a fungicide used for waxing citrus fruits Picric acid (trinitrophenol) - an explosive material Phenolphthalein pH indicator Xylenol used in antiseptics & disinfectants Drugs and bioactive natural products [ edit ] Main article: Naturally occurring phenols More than 371 drugs approved by the FDA between the years of 1951 and 2020 contain either a phenol or a phenolic ether (a phenol with an alkyl), with nearly every class of small molecule drugs being represented, and natural products making up a large portion of this list.

amoxicillin Top-selling antibiotic estradiol the major female sex hormone Analysis [ edit ] In chemical analysis , phenols can be detected using 2,6‑dibromoquinonechlorimide .

[ 18 ] It reacts with phenols to form indophenols , resulting in a color change.
