It was founded in 1947 by the Order of St. Augustine with an initial goal to educate World War II veterans. It enrolls approximately 5,700 undergraduate and graduate students from 34 states and 36 countries.

[ 6 ] The school has an acceptance rate of 75%.

[ 7 ] History [ edit ] Merrimack College was established in 1947 by the Order of Saint Augustine following an invitation by the Archbishop of Boston , Richard Cushing .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] It is the second Augustinian affiliated college in the United States after Villanova University .

[ 10 ] Church leaders saw a need to create a liberal arts college largely in a commuter school format for veterans returning from World War II .

[ 11 ] Archbishop Cushing tabbed the Rev. Vincent McQuade, O.S.A, to lead the college. McQuade was a native of Lawrence, Massachusetts and longtime friend of Cushing. McQuade joined the effort after working on the faculty at Villanova working with veterans transitioning home from the war. McQuade organized the creation process, including land purchases and zoning, securing a charter from the state, establishing curriculum, and managing the college's campus construction. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to The Augustinian College of the Merrimack Valley in March 1947 and the college officially opened in September of the same year.

[ 8 ] Presidents [ edit ] Merrimack College has had 8 presidents since it was founded in 1947: Vincent A. McQuade, 1947–1968 (founder) John R. Aherne, 1968–1976 John A. Coughlan, 1976–1981 John E.

[ 13 ] The College's five schools include the Girard School of Business, the Winston School of Education and Social Policy, the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Computational Sciences, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences.

[ 14 ] Campus [ edit ] The main campus of Merrimack College is situated on 220 acres (1 km 2 ) of land in North Andover, Massachusetts , a suburb 25 miles north of downtown Boston . The main campus features over 40 buildings, including a 125,000-volume library; several classroom buildings, including the state-of-the-art School of Engineering and Computational Sciences complex; Palmisano Hall; the Sakowich Campus Center; the Rogers Center for the Arts; the Merrimack Athletic Complex; Austin Hall, which houses administrative offices; the Collegiate Church of Christ the Teacher; student apartment buildings and residence halls. Additionally, Merrimack owns several properties outside of the main campus, including the Louis H. Hamel Health Center and Saint Ambrose Friary (located across Elm Street from the bulk of campus). The library is named after McQuade, the college's founder.

[ 15 ] The college’s academic buildings, as well as the church and Austin Hall, are generally fronted towards Route 114 , with the residence halls, athletic facilities and campus center lying further back.

In 2017, the college received a $29.7 million tax-exempt bond from MassDevelopment . Merrimack designated several major projects for the funds, including construction of two academic buildings and three residence halls; renovations to renovate O’Reilly Hall, McQuade Library, and several other campus buildings; and upgrades to athletic facilities.
