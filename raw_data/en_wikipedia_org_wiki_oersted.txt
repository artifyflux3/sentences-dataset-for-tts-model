Gaussian base units 1 cm −1/2 ⋅g 1/2 ⋅s −1 SI units (4π) −1 × 10 3 A/m ≈ 79.57747 A/m The oersted ( / ˈ ɜːr s t ɛ d / , [ 1 ] symbol Oe ) is the coherent derived unit of the auxiliary magnetic field H in the CGS-EMU and Gaussian systems of units.

[ 2 ] It is equivalent to 1 dyne per maxwell .

Difference between Gaussian and SI systems [ edit ] In the Gaussian system, the unit of the H-field is the oersted and the unit of the B-field is the gauss . In the SI, the unit ampere per metre (A/m), which is equivalent to newton per weber , is used for the H-field and the unit tesla is used for the B-field.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The unit was established by the IEC in the 1930s [ 4 ] in honour of Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted . Ørsted discovered the connection between magnetism and electric current when a magnetic field produced by a current-carrying copper bar deflected a magnetised needle during a lecture demonstration.

[ 5 ] Definition [ edit ] Cassette tape label with coercivity (a measure of the external magnetic flux required to magnetize the tape) measured in oersteds The oersted is defined as a dyne per unit pole .

[ clarification needed ] [ 6 ] The oersted corresponds to ⁠ 1000 / 4π ⁠ (≈79.5775) amperes per metre, in terms of SI units .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The H-field strength inside a long solenoid wound with 79.58 turns per metre of a wire carrying 1 A is approximately 1 oersted. The preceding statement is exactly correct if the solenoid considered is infinite in length with the current evenly distributed over its surface.

The oersted is closely related to the gauss (G), the CGS unit of magnetic flux density. In vacuum, if the magnetizing field strength is 1 Oe, then the magnetic field density is 1 G, whereas in a medium having permeability μ r (relative to permeability of vacuum), their relation is B ( G ) = μ μ r H ( Oe ) .

{\displaystyle B({\text{G}})=\mu _{\text{r}}H({\text{Oe}}).} Because oersteds are used to measure magnetizing field strength, they are also related to the magnetomotive force (mmf) of current in a single-winding wire-loop: [ 11 ] 1 Oe = 1000 4 π π A / m .

{\displaystyle 1{\text{ Oe}}={\frac {1000}{4\pi }}~{\text{A}}/{\text{m}}.} Stored energy [ edit ] Main article: maximum energy product The stored energy in a magnet, called magnet performance or maximum energy product [ 12 ] (often abbreviated BH max ), is typically measured in units of megagauss-oersteds (MG⋅Oe).
