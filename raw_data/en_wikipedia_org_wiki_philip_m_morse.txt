**Philip McCord Morse** (August 6, 1903 – 5 September 1985), was an American physicist, administrator and pioneer of [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research") (OR) in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-1) He is considered to be the father of operations research in the U.S.

Morse graduated from the [Case School of Applied Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_School_of_Applied_Science "Case School of Applied Science") in 1926 with a B.S. in physics.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-2) He earned his Ph.D. in physics from [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") in 1929.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-3) In 1930, he was granted an International Fellowship, which he used to do postgraduate study and research at the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich "Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich") under [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") during the winter of 1930 to the spring of 1931.

From the spring through the summer of 1931, he was at [Cambridge University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University "Cambridge University"). Upon return to the United States, he joined the faculty of [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-5)

In 1949 he was named the first research director of the [Weapons Systems Evaluation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_Systems_Evaluation_Group "Weapons Systems Evaluation Group") (WSEG), an organization founded to conduct studies for the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff "Joint Chiefs of Staff"), where he served a year and a half before returning to MIT in the summer of 1950. In 1956 he launched [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT")’s operations research center, directing it until 1968, and awarding the first Ph.D. in operations research in the U.S. to [John Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Little_(academic) "John Little (academic)").

He was a member of a [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council "United States National Research Council") committee dedicated to bringing OR into civilian life, and was a prime mover behind the creation of the [Operations Research Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Society_of_America "Operations Research Society of America") (ORSA) in 1952. He served as president of the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society"), president of the [Acoustical Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustical_Society_of_America "Acoustical Society of America") (ASA), and board chair of the [American Institute of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Physics "American Institute of Physics").

In 1946, he was a recipient of the [Medal for Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_for_Merit "Medal for Merit") from the [U.S. President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._President "U.S. President") for his work during the war. In 1973 the ASA awarded him the [Gold Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_Gold_Medal "ASA Gold Medal"), its highest award, for his work on [vibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration "Vibration").

### Operations research

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_M._Morse&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Operations research")]

Philip Morse made many contributions to the development of operations research (OR). Early in 1942 he organized the [Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Submarine_Warfare_Operations_Research_Group&action=edit&redlink=1 "Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (page does not exist)") (ASWORG), later ORG, for the [U.S. Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy "U.S. Navy"), after the US had entered World War II and was faced with the problem of [Nazi German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_German "Nazi German")[U-boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat "U-boat") attacks on [transatlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") shipping. "That Morse’s group was an important factor in winning the war is fairly obvious to everyone who knows anything about the inside of the war," wrote historian John Burchard.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-6)

Philip Morse co-authored _Methods of Operations Research_, the first OR textbook in the U.S., with [George E. Kimball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Kimball "George E. Kimball") based on the Navy work. His further writings include the influential books _Queues, Inventories, and Maintenance_ and _Library Effectiveness_. He received ORSA's Lanchester Prize in 1968 for the latter book.

Philip Morse gave the opening address at the 1957 organizing meeting of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS). In 1959 he chaired the first [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") advisory panel on OR.

Philip Morse had a distinguished career in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). Amongst his contributions to physics are the textbooks _Quantum Mechanics_ (with [Edward Condon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon "Edward Condon")), _Methods of Theoretical Physics_ (with [Herman Feshbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Feshbach "Herman Feshbach")), _Vibration and Sound_, _Theoretical Acoustics_, and _Thermal Physics_. Morse is also one of the founding editors of _Annals of Physics_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse#cite_note-7) In 1929 he proposed the [Morse potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_potential "Morse potential") function for diatomic molecules which was often used to interpret vibrational spectra, though the standard is now the more modern [Morse/Long-range potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse/Long-range_potential "Morse/Long-range potential").

His administrative talents were applied in roles as co-founder of the MIT Acoustics Laboratory, first director of the [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory "Brookhaven National Laboratory"), founder and first director of the MIT Computation Center, and board member of the [RAND Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation "RAND Corporation") and the [Institute for Defense Analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Defense_Analyses "Institute for Defense Analyses").

He chaired the advisory committee that supervised preparation of _Handbook of Mathematical Functions, with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables_, commonly known as _[Abramowitz and Stegun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abramowitz\_and\_Stegun "Abramowitz and Stegun")_.

Phil published four paper on electron discharges in gases, now known as plasma physics. Compton decided to accept one of Phil's papers as his dissertation (Morse 1928): "A theory of the electric discharge through gases." He received his Ph.D. in 1929.
