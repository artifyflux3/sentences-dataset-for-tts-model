Arturo Álvarez-Buylla Roces Born 1958 (age 66–67) Mexico City , Mexico Education National Autonomous University of Mexico ( BS ) Rockefeller University ( PhD ) Relatives María Elena Álvarez-Buylla Roces (sister) Awards Prince of Asturias Award for Scientific and Technical Research (2011) Scientific career Fields Neuroscience Institutions University of California, San Francisco Arturo Álvarez-Buylla Roces is a professor and endowed chair in neurological surgery , and a researcher in neurobiology at the University of California, San Francisco .

[ 1 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Arturo Álvarez-Buylla was born and raised in Mexico City .

[ 2 ] He earned an undergraduate degree in biomedical research from Autonomous National University before pursuing his Ph.D. in neurobiology from Rockefeller University in New York.

[ 2 ] At Rockefeller University, he researched the process of formation of neurons in adult mammals before moving to UCSF in 2000.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Álvarez-Buylla is a professor and endowed chair in neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco .

[ 1 ] His research as a Principal Investigator at the Brain Tumor Research Center is in the fields of developmental neuroscience and neurobiology”.

[ 1 ] In 2011, Álvarez-Buylla and his lab discovered findings relating to the incorporation of new neurons into adult brains.

[ 1 ] Additionally, Álvarez-Buylla has worked on designing research devices. His designs include devices for laboratory applications such as tissue mounts, mapping systems for tissue sections, and staining techniques.

[ 1 ] Álvarez-Buylla's more recent research is primarily focused on the mechanisms of neurogenesis from neuronal stem cells that occupy different germinal niches.

[ 2 ] Álvarez-Buylla's laboratory found that adult neural stem cells are specialized to produce different neuronal cells based on their location in the ventricle .

[ 2 ] Specifically, he is investigating the possible inhibition of nervous system activity in people with neurological conditions due to embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) cells.

[ 1 ] By analyzing the balance between inhibitory and excitatory signaling in the nervous system from MGE cells, Álvarez-Buylla contributed to the development of treatments for Parkinson's disease , traumatic brain injury , epilepsy , and spinal cord injury .

[ 1 ] Álvarez-Buylla and his lab investigate plasticity and brain repair mechanisms from the introduction of new neurons through transplantation or by natural processes of endogenous stem cells.

[ 2 ] His laboratory is looking into the contribution of new neurons using the strategies his team has developed for transplanting local circuit nerves into the cerebral cortex .

[ 2 ] Álvarez-Buylla is a member for the Royal Academy of Science in Spain, the Academia de Ciencias de America Latina, the Society for Neuroscience , the Society for Biochemistry, the International Brain Research Organization , the National Academy of Sciences , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the International Brain Research Organization .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Álvarez-Buylla has been awarded six grants by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as principal investigator—most recently for “Structure and function of a novel population of regenerating ependymal cells” (2020).
