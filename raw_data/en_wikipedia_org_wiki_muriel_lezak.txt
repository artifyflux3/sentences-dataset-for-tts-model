Her work has centred on the research, assessment, and rehabilitation of brain injury. Lezak was a professor of neurology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine.

She favored the flexible approach to administering neuropsychological batteries.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Lezak was born in Chicago , Illinois in 1927.

[ 2 ] She held bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago , and earned a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Portland in 1960.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] She worked in clinics and taught psychology until 1966.

[ 2 ] In the 1940s, Lezak began work as a clinical psychologist. She became interested in the connection between the brain and an individual's behavior after treating World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War veterans. Through her work, she realized there wasn't a comprehensive book on major disorders caused by brain dysfunction and injury, or the techniques, tests and procedures to evaluate patients. Published first in 1976, her book Neuropsychological Assessment was the first comprehensive text on the subject and touted a flexible approach to treating patients.

[ 2 ] She modified the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test by adding a 45-word list recognition trial. This version is the most widely used by clinicians .

[ 5 ] In 1982, she was the first to express concern for athletes with head injuries, later warning of second-impact syndrome in 1999.

[ 2 ] In 1996, she received the Distinguished Neuropsychologist Award from the US-based National Academy of Neuropsychology. Past recipients include the prominent neuropsychologists George Prigatano, Brenda Milner , Ralph Reitan and Arthur Benton .

[ 6 ] Lezak has three children: Anne, David, and Miriam.

[ 7 ] Her husband Sid, who died in 2006, was a United States Attorney in Oregon for more than twenty years.

[ 8 ] She died on October 6, 2021, in Portland, at the age of 94.
