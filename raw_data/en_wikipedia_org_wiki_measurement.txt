Four measuring devices having metric calibrations

**Measurement** is the [quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(science) "Quantification (science)") of [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_and_attribute_(research) "Variable and attribute (research)") of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-pedhazur-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-bipm-2) In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-Young_and_Freedman_University_Physics-3) The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), measurements do not apply to [nominal properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Nominal_level "Level of measurement") of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the [International Vocabulary of Metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Vocabulary_of_Metrology "International Vocabulary of Metrology") (VIM) published by the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-bipm-2) However, in other fields such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") as well as the [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Sciences "Social Sciences") and [behavioural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences "Behavioural sciences"), measurements can have [multiple levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement "Level of measurement"), which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-pedhazur-1)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-Koch_2008-4)

Measurement is a cornerstone of [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade "Trade"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") and [quantitative research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research "Quantitative research") in many disciplines. Historically, many [measurement systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_measurement "System of measurement") existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology").

Measurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.

The earliest recorded systems of [weights and measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weights_and_measures "Weights and measures") originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-5) Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to [units of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_length "Units of length") used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology"). The discovery and application of [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity") was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units.

The measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria: [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement "Level of measurement"), [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)"), [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement"), and [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] They enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements.

*   The _level_ of measurement is a taxonomy for the methodological character of a comparison. For example, two states of a property may be compared by ratio, difference, or ordinal preference. The type is commonly not explicitly expressed, but implicit in the definition of a measurement procedure.
*   The _magnitude_ is the numerical value of the characterization, usually obtained with a suitably chosen [measuring instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument "Measuring instrument").
*   A _unit_ assigns a mathematical weighting factor to the magnitude that is derived as a ratio to the property of an artifact used as standard or a natural physical quantity.
*   An _uncertainty_ represents the [random and systemic errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error "Observational error") of the measurement procedure; it indicates a confidence level in the measurement. Errors are evaluated by methodically repeating measurements and considering the [accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision") of the measuring instrument.

Standardization of measurement units
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Standardization of measurement units")]

Measurements most commonly use the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) as a comparison framework. The system defines seven [fundamental units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_units "SI base units"): [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram"), [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela"), [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere"), [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"), and [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)"). All of these units are defined without reference to a particular physical object which would serve as a standard. Artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a [physical constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant "Physical constant") or other invariable natural phenomenon, in contrast to reliance on standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/250px-SI_base_unit.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SI_base_unit.svg)

The seven base units in the SI system. Arrows point from units to those that depend on them.

The first proposal to tie an SI base unit to an experimental standard independent of fiat[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] was by [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce") (1839–1914),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-6) who proposed to define the metre in terms of the [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") of a [spectral line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-7) This directly influenced the [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment"); Michelson and Morley cite Peirce, and improve on his method.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-8)

With the exception of a few fundamental [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum") constants, units of measurement are derived from historical agreements. Nothing inherent in nature dictates that an [inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch") has to be a certain length, nor that a [mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile") is a better measure of distance than a [kilometre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre"). Over the course of human history, however, first for convenience and then out of necessity, standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain common benchmarks. Laws regulating measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud in commerce.

[Units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") are generally defined on a scientific basis, overseen by governmental or independent agencies, and established in international treaties, pre-eminent of which is the [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") (CGPM), established in 1875 by the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention"), overseeing the International System of Units (SI). For example, the metre was redefined in 1983 by the CGPM in terms of the speed of light, the kilogram was redefined in 2019 in terms of the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") and the international yard was defined in 1960 by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa as being _exactly_ 0.9144 metres.

In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST")), a division of the [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce"), regulates commercial measurements. In the United Kingdom, the role is performed by the [National Physical Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory_(United_Kingdom) "National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)") (NPL), in Australia by the [National Measurement Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Measurement_Institute,_Australia "National Measurement Institute, Australia"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-9) in South Africa by the [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research "Council for Scientific and Industrial Research") and in India the [National Physical Laboratory of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Physical_Laboratory_of_India "National Physical Laboratory of India").

A unit is a known or standard quantity in terms of which other physical quantities are measured.

### Imperial and US customary systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Imperial and US customary systems")]

Before [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") were widely adopted around the world, the British systems of [English units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_unit "English unit") and later [imperial units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_unit "Imperial unit") were used in Britain, the [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") and the United States. The system came to be known as [U.S. customary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._customary_units "U.S. customary units") in the United States and is still in use there and in a few [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean") countries. These various systems of measurement have at times been called _foot-pound-second_ systems after the Imperial units for length, weight and time even though the tons, hundredweights, gallons, and nautical miles, for example, have different values in the U.S. and imperial systems. Many Imperial units remain in use in Britain, which has officially switched to the SI system, with a few exceptions such as road signs, where road distances are shown in miles (or in yards for short distances) and speed limits are in miles per hour. Draught beer and cider must be sold by the imperial pint, and milk in returnable bottles can be sold by the imperial pint. Many people measure their height in feet and inches and their weight in [stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_(imperial_mass) "Stone (imperial mass)") and pounds, to give just a few examples. Imperial units are used in many other places: for example, in many Commonwealth countries that are considered metricated, land area is measured in acres and floor space in square feet, particularly for commercial transactions (rather than government statistics). Similarly, gasoline is sold by the gallon in many countries that are considered metricated.

The [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system") is a decimal [system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_measurement "System of measurement") based on its units for length, the metre and for mass, the kilogram. It exists in several variations, with different choices of [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement#Base_and_derived_units "Units of measurement"), though these do not affect its day-to-day use. Since the 1960s, the International System of Units (SI) is the internationally recognised metric system. Metric units of mass, length, and electricity are widely used around the world for both everyday and scientific purposes.

#### International System of Units

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: International System of Units")]

The [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (abbreviated as SI from the [French language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") name _Système International d'Unités_) is the modern revision of the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system"). It is the world's most widely used [system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units "System of units"), both in everyday [commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce "Commerce") and in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"). The SI was developed in 1960 from the [metre–kilogram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre%E2%80%93kilogram%E2%80%93second "Metre–kilogram–second") (MKS) system, rather than the [centimetre–gram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second "Centimetre–gram–second") (CGS) system, which, in turn, had many variants. The SI units for the seven base physical quantities are:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-10)

| Base quantity | Base unit | Symbol | Defining constant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") | [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") | s | hyperfine splitting in [caesium-133](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-133 "Caesium-133") |
| [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") | metre | m | [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), _c_ |
| [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") | [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") | kg | [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), _h_ |
| [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") | [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") | A | [elementary charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge"), _e_ |
| [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") | [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") | K | [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"), _k_ |
| [amount of substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance "Amount of substance") | [mol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)") | mol | [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant"), _N_ A |
| [luminous intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_intensity "Luminous intensity") | [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela") | cd | [luminous efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy "Luminous efficacy") of a 540 THz source, _K_ cd |

In the SI, base units are the simple measurements for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity. Derived units are constructed from the base units: for example, the [watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt"), i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the base units as m 2·kg·s−3. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg·m−3.

##### Converting prefixes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Converting prefixes")]

The SI allows easy multiplication when switching among units having the same base but different prefixes. To convert from metres to centimetres it is only necessary to multiply the number of metres by 100, since there are 100 centimetres in a metre. Inversely, to switch from centimetres to metres one multiplies the number of centimetres by 0.01 or divides the number of centimetres by 100.

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/CarpentersRule.png/250px-CarpentersRule.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CarpentersRule.png)

A two-metre carpenter's [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler "Ruler")

A [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler "Ruler") or rule is a tool used in, for example, [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), [technical drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing "Technical drawing"), engineering, and carpentry, to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines. Strictly speaking, the _ruler_ is the instrument used to **rule** straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a _measure_, however common usage calls both instruments _rulers_ and the special name _straightedge_ is used for an unmarked rule. The use of the word _measure_, in the sense of a measuring instrument, only survives in the phrase _tape measure_, an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines. As can be seen in the photographs on this page, a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres, to easily fit in a pocket, and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing.

Main article: [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time")

Time is an abstract measurement of [elemental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elemental "Elemental") changes over a non-spatial continuum. It is denoted by numbers and/or named periods such as [hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour"), [days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day"), [weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week "Week"), [months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") and [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year"). It is an apparently irreversible series of occurrences within this non spatial continuum. It is also used to denote an interval between two relative points on this continuum.

_Mass_ refers to the intrinsic property of all material objects to resist changes in their momentum. _Weight_, on the other hand, refers to the downward force produced when a mass is in a gravitational field. In [free fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall "Free fall") (no net gravitational forces) objects lack weight but retain their mass. The Imperial units of mass include the [ounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce "Ounce"), [pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) "Pound (mass)"), and [ton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton "Ton"). The metric units [gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram") and kilogram are units of mass.

One device for measuring weight or mass is called a weighing scale or, often, simply a "scale". A spring scale measures force but not mass, a balance compares weight; both require a gravitational field to operate. Some of the most accurate instruments for measuring weight or mass are based on load cells with a digital read-out, but require a gravitational field to function and would not work in free fall.

The measures used in economics are physical measures, [nominal price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_price "Nominal price") value measures and [real price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_price "Real price") measures. These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/EMMA_experiment.jpg/250px-EMMA_experiment.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EMMA_experiment.jpg)

Measurement station C of EMMA experiment situated at the depth of 75 meters in the [Pyhäsalmi Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyh%C3%A4salmi_Mine "Pyhäsalmi Mine")

In the field of survey research, measures are taken from individual attitudes, values, and behavior using [questionnaires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire "Questionnaire") as a measurement instrument. As all other measurements, measurement in survey research is also vulnerable to [measurement error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error "Observational error"), i.e. the departure from the true value of the measurement and the value provided using the measurement instrument.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-11) In substantive survey research, measurement error can lead to biased conclusions and wrongly estimated effects. In order to get accurate results, when measurement errors appear, the results need to be [corrected for measurement errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction_for_attenuation "Correction for attenuation").

### Exactness designation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Exactness designation")]

The following rules generally apply for displaying the exactness of measurements:[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-12)

*   All non-0 digits and any 0s appearing between them are significant for the exactness of any number. For example, the number 12000 has two significant digits, and has implied limits of 11500 and 12500.
*   Additional 0s may be added after a [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator") to denote a greater exactness, increasing the number of decimals. For example, 1 has implied limits of 0.5 and 1.5 whereas 1.0 has implied limits 0.95 and 1.05.

Since accurate measurement is essential in many fields, and since all measurements are necessarily approximations, a great deal of effort must be taken to make measurements as accurate as possible. For example, consider the [problem of measuring the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_timekeeping_devices "History of timekeeping devices") it takes an object to fall a distance of one metre (about 39[in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch")). Using physics, it can be shown that, in the gravitational field of the Earth, it should take any object about 0.45 second to fall one metre. However, the following are just some of the sources of [error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty "Measurement uncertainty") that arise:

*   This computation used for the [acceleration of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth "Gravity of Earth") 9.8 metres per second squared (32 ft/s 2). But neither of these two figures is exact, but only precise to two significant digits.
*   The Earth's gravitational field varies slightly depending on height above sea level and other factors.
*   The computation of 0.45 seconds involved extracting a [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root"), a [mathematical operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operation "Mathematical operation") that required rounding off to some number of significant digits, in this case two significant digits.

Additionally, other sources of [experimental error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_error "Experimental error") include:

*   carelessness,
*   determining of the exact time at which the object is released and the exact time it hits the ground,
*   measurement of the height and the measurement of the time both involve some error,
*   [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_resistance "Air resistance"),
*   posture of human participants.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-13)

Scientific experiments must be carried out with great care to eliminate as much error as possible, and to keep error estimates realistic.

Definitions and theories
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Definitions and theories")]

### Classical definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Classical definition")]

In the classical definition, which is standard throughout the physical sciences, _measurement_ is the determination or estimation of ratios of quantities.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-Michell,_J._1999-14) Quantity and measurement are mutually defined: quantitative attributes are those possible to measure, at least in principle. The classical concept of quantity can be traced back to [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), and was foreshadowed in [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-Michell,_J._1999-14)

### Representational theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Measurement&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Representational theory")]

In the representational theory, _measurement_ is defined as "the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-15) The most technically elaborated form of representational theory is also known as [additive conjoint measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_conjoint_measurement "Additive conjoint measurement"). In this form of representational theory, numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems. A property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established. In weaker forms of representational theory, such as that implicit within the work of [Stanley Smith Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens "Stanley Smith Stevens"),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-16) numbers need only be assigned according to a rule.

The concept of measurement is often misunderstood as merely the assignment of a value, but it is possible to assign a value in a way that is not a measurement in terms of the requirements of additive conjoint measurement. One may assign a value to a person's height, but unless it can be established that there is a correlation between measurements of height and empirical relations, it is not a measurement according to additive conjoint measurement theory. Likewise, computing and assigning arbitrary values, like the "book value" of an asset in accounting, is not a measurement because it does not satisfy the necessary criteria.

Three type of representational theory

1.   Empirical relation In science, an _empirical relationship_ is a relationship or correlation based solely on [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation") rather than theory. An empirical relationship requires only confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis.
2.   The rule of mapping The real world is the Domain of mapping, and the mathematical world is the range. when we map the attribute to mathematical system, we have many choice for mapping and the range.
3.   The representation condition of measurement

All data are inexact and statistical in nature. Thus the definition of measurement is: "A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-17) This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") of the measurements. In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value. In this view, unlike the [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist "Positivist") representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement. This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between [estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation") and measurement.

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), a measurement is an action that determines a particular property (such as position, [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), or energy) of a quantum system. Quantum measurements are always statistical samples from a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"); the distribution for many quantum phenomena is discrete, not continuous.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-messiah-18): 197  Quantum measurements alter [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_states "Quantum states") and yet repeated measurements on a quantum state are reproducible. The measurement appears to act as a filter, changing the quantum state into one with the single measured quantum value.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-messiah-18) The unambiguous meaning of the [quantum measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem "Measurement problem") is an unresolved fundamental problem in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"); the most common interpretation is that when a measurement is performed, the [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction") of the quantum system "[collapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction_collapse "Wavefunction collapse")" to a single, definite value.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-19)

In biology, there is generally no well established theory of measurement. However, the importance of the theoretical context is emphasized.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-20) Moreover, the theoretical context stemming from the theory of evolution leads to articulate the theory of measurement and historicity as a fundamental notion.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-21) Among the most developed fields of measurement in biology are the measurement of genetic diversity and species diversity.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#cite_note-22)
