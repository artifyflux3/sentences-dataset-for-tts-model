A **circle** is a [shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape") consisting of all [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") in a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") that are at a given distance from a given point, the [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(geometry) "Centre (geometry)"). The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius"). The length of a line segment connecting two points on the circle and passing through the centre is called the [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"). A circle bounds a region of the plane called a [disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)").

The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles are common, such as the [full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon") or a slice of round fruit. The circle is the basis for the [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), which, with related inventions such as [gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear "Gear"), makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus").

Terminology
-----------

*   [Annulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics) "Annulus (mathematics)"): a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two [concentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric "Concentric") circles.
*   [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc"): any [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a centre allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.
*   [Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(geometry) "Centre (geometry)"): the point equidistant from all points on the circle.
*   [Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)"): a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.
*   [Circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference"): the [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.
*   [Diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"): a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.
*   [Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)"): the region of the plane bounded by a circle. In strict mathematical usage, a circle is only the boundary of the disc (or disk), while in everyday use the term "circle" may also refer to a disc.
*   [Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(geometry) "Lens (geometry)"): the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.
*   [Radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius"): a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter. Usually, the radius is denoted ![Image 2: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) and required to be a positive number. A circle with ![Image 3: {\displaystyle r=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89) is a [degenerate case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics) "Degeneracy (mathematics)") consisting of a single point.
*   [Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector "Circular sector"): a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common centre and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this centre and the endpoints of the radii.
*   [Segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment "Circular segment"): a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term _segment_ is used only for regions not containing the centre of the circle to which their arc belongs.
*   [Secant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line"): an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.
*   [Semicircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle "Semicircle"): one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as centre. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the two-dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one.
*   [Tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent"): a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle ("touches the circle at this point").

All of the specified regions may be considered as _open_, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as _closed_, including their respective boundaries.

Etymology
---------

The word _circle_ derives from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") κίρκος/κύκλος (_kirkos/kuklos_), itself a [metathesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metathesis_(linguistics) "Metathesis (linguistics)") of the [Homeric Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek "Homeric Greek") κρίκος (_krikos_), meaning "hoop" or "ring".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-1) The origins of the words _[circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus "Circus")_ and _[circuit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circuit "wikt:circuit")_ are closely related.

Circles in an old [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic")[astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical "Astronomical") drawing.

Prehistoric people made [stone circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_circle "Stone circle") and [timber circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_circle "Timber circle"), and circular elements are common in [petroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph "Petroglyph") and [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting "Cave painting").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-2) Disc-shaped prehistoric artifacts include the [Nebra sky disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebra_sky_disc "Nebra sky disc") and jade discs called [Bi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_(jade) "Bi (jade)").

The Egyptian [Rhind papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_papyrus "Rhind papyrus"), dated to 1700 BCE, gives a method to find the area of a circle. The result corresponds to ⁠256/81⁠ (3.16049...) as an approximate value of [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-3)

Book 3 of [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") deals with the properties of circles. Euclid's definition of a circle is:

> A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal. The bounding line is called its circumference and the point, its centre.

In [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s [Seventh Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Letter "Seventh Letter") there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation. Early [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), particularly [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and [astrology and astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology_and_astronomy "Astrology and astronomy"), was connected to the divine for most [medieval scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Middle_Ages "History of science in the Middle Ages"), and many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-6)

In 1880 CE, [Ferdinand von Lindemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Lindemann "Ferdinand von Lindemann") proved that π is [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number "Transcendental number"), proving that the millennia-old problem of [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle") cannot be performed with straightedge and compass.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-7)

With the advent of [abstract art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art "Abstract art") in the early 20th century, geometric objects became an artistic subject in their own right. [Wassily Kandinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky "Wassily Kandinsky") in particular often used circles as an element of his compositions.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-9)

### Symbolism and religious use

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/God_the_Geometer.jpg/250px-God_the_Geometer.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:God_the_Geometer.jpg)

 The [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drafting) "Compass (drafting)") in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth"). Notice also the circular shape of the [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(religious_iconography) "Halo (religious iconography)").

From the time of the earliest known civilisations – such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity – the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist's message and to express certain ideas. However, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists' perceptions. While some emphasised the circle's perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.

The circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the [Dharma wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmachakra "Dharmachakra"), a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-10)[Magic circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_circle "Magic circle") are part of some traditions of [Western esotericism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism "Western esotericism").

Analytic results
----------------

### Circumference

The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is π (pi), an [irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number")[constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant "Mathematical constant") approximately equal to 3.141592654. The ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius is 2 π.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-11) Thus the circumference _C_ is related to the radius _r_ and diameter _d_ by: ![Image 7: {\displaystyle C=2\pi r=\pi d.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa9aac4480802cc06bc0acb41c0f61ba0a3ff88f)

### Area enclosed

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Circle_Area.svg/250px-Circle_Area.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_Area.svg)

Area enclosed by a circle = π × area of the shaded square

As proved by [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes"), in his [Measurement of a Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_of_a_Circle "Measurement of a Circle"), the [area enclosed by a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_disk "Area of a disk") is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-12) which comes to π multiplied by the radius squared: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Area} =\pi r^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1ef0cf29b8b7acadd8281c97891b7937f23c447)

Equivalently, denoting diameter by _d_, ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Area} ={\frac {\pi d^{2}}{4}}\approx 0.7854d^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3149c663cd904c664c75336ecce4e482487cfae1) that is, approximately 79% of the [circumscribing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribe "Circumscribe") square (whose side is of length _d_).

The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the [isoperimetric inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality "Isoperimetric inequality").

### Radian

If a circle of radius r is centred at the [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") of an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"), and that angle intercepts an [arc of the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc") with an [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length") of s, then the [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") measure 𝜃 of the angle is the ratio of the arc length to the radius: ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {s}{r}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1217fa85434c2db9527eaf06e0a9f6bced41a571)

The circular arc is said to [subtend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtend "Subtend") the angle, known as the [central angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_angle "Central angle"), at the centre of the circle. One radian is the measure of the central angle subtended by a circular arc whose length is equal to its radius. The angle subtended by a complete circle at its centre is a [complete angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_angle "Complete angle"), which measures 2 π radians, 360 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"), or one [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle) "Turn (angle)").

Using radians, the formula for the arc length s of a circular arc of radius r and subtending a central angle of measure 𝜃 is ![Image 12: {\displaystyle s=\theta r,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82fc3b382cf726c8084ee043cce5e0f7ac469b01)

and the formula for the area A of a [circular sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector "Circular sector") of radius r and with central angle of measure 𝜃 is ![Image 13: {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}\theta r^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85ae83cc06a766866484702e2a52fff8fa087b97)

In the special case 𝜃 = 2 π, these formulae yield the circumference of a complete circle and area of a complete disc, respectively.

### Equations

#### Cartesian coordinates

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Circle_center_a_b_radius_r.svg/250px-Circle_center_a_b_radius_r.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_center_a_b_radius_r.svg)

Circle of radius _r_=1, centre (_a_,_b_) =(1.2,−0.5)

##### Equation of a circle

In an _x_–_y_[Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), the circle with centre [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") (_a_, _b_) and radius _r_ is the set of all points (_x_, _y_) such that ![Image 15: {\displaystyle (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb7aac23138efa42dc2ac60d99cd7b440be36f11)

This [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation"), known as the _equation of the circle_, follows from the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |_x_ − _a_| and |_y_ − _b_|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0,0), then the equation simplifies to ![Image 16: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5ed9d9763124224deaef61d1c3e93b8de55d911)

##### Parametric form

The equation can be written in [parametric form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") using the [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") sine and cosine as ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=a+r\,\cos t,\\y&=b+r\,\sin t,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9840181971dea6e554b582db7b54e4fbd3f84003) where _t_ is a [parametric variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_variable "Parametric variable") in the range 0 to 2 π, interpreted geometrically as the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") that the ray from (_a_,_b_) to (_x_,_y_) makes with the positive _x_ axis.

An alternative parametrisation of the circle is ![Image 29: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=a+r{\frac {1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}},\\y&=b+r{\frac {2t}{1+t^{2}}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e638322f1d06b6f98538225cc5b0e96f6fe7244)

In this parameterisation, the ratio of _t_ to _r_ can be interpreted geometrically as the [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") of the line passing through the centre parallel to the _x_ axis (see [Tangent half-angle substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_half-angle_substitution "Tangent half-angle substitution")). However, this parameterisation works only if _t_ is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.

##### 3-point form

The equation of the circle determined by three points ![Image 30: {\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),(x_{3},y_{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/201df5d993a5f9d4819a624c9d878cf81bac37c9) not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [_3-point form of a circle equation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse#Circles "Ellipse"): ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\frac {({\color {green}x}-x_{1})({\color {green}x}-x_{2})+({\color {red}y}-y_{1})({\color {red}y}-y_{2})}{({\color {red}y}-y_{1})({\color {green}x}-x_{2})-({\color {red}y}-y_{2})({\color {green}x}-x_{1})}}={\frac {(x_{3}-x_{1})(x_{3}-x_{2})+(y_{3}-y_{1})(y_{3}-y_{2})}{(y_{3}-y_{1})(x_{3}-x_{2})-(y_{3}-y_{2})(x_{3}-x_{1})}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6670134ffaccf00af267de7ad6c78983fe975e11)

##### Homogeneous form

In [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates"), each [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") with the equation of a circle has the form ![Image 32: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-2axz-2byz+cz^{2}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0a6e471f2edc1b3f74b9c1449f2a47ea27fe1c1)

It can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [complex projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_plane "Complex projective plane")) the points _I_(1: _i_: 0) and _J_(1:−_i_:0). These points are called the [circular points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_points_at_infinity "Circular points at infinity").

#### Polar coordinates

In [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates"), the equation of a circle is ![Image 33: {\displaystyle r^{2}-2rr_{0}\cos(\theta -\phi )+r_{0}^{2}=a^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1905137531d7f246c5c5a84c931c1d7dc2ed7b95)

where _a_ is the radius of the circle, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle (r,\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed8396fdc359fb06c93722137c959e7496e47ed6) are the polar coordinates of a generic point on the circle, and ![Image 35: {\displaystyle (r_{0},\phi )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b336f1862eef349e2c5acc16e84b8f7ea2ad848d) are the polar coordinates of the centre of the circle (i.e., _r_ 0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and _φ_ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive _x_ axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. _r_ 0 = 0, this reduces to _r_ = _a_. When _r_ 0 = _a_, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes ![Image 36: {\displaystyle r=2a\cos(\theta -\phi ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3197ba78f76fdc04355f8d6b313116cdee6de94)

In the general case, the equation can be solved for _r_, giving ![Image 37: {\displaystyle r=r_{0}\cos(\theta -\phi )\pm {\sqrt {a^{2}-r_{0}^{2}\sin ^{2}(\theta -\phi )}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8bcc4b2b107cbf433eeaa44a8b4f9b1ff6c7c12) Without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.

#### Complex plane

In the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"), a circle with a centre at _c_ and radius _r_ has the equation ![Image 38: {\displaystyle |z-c|=r.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f86aa96090f1028c9f90fcb9d29294a8999e7956)

In parametric form, this can be written as ![Image 39: {\displaystyle z=re^{it}+c.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/180d3a26356d91aa889bcca534f8acebbea29c30)

The slightly generalised equation ![Image 40: {\displaystyle pz{\overline {z}}+gz+{\overline {gz}}=q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/028f215ad8f29eeb316058469a7fe70c4482dc4d)

for real _p_, _q_ and complex _g_ is sometimes called a [generalised circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_circle "Generalised circle"). This becomes the above equation for a circle with ![Image 41: {\displaystyle p=1,\ g=-{\overline {c}},\ q=r^{2}-|c|^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e322c33ee9ecf2c3df4e4e1d36b846a49e5871aa), since ![Image 42: {\displaystyle |z-c|^{2}=z{\overline {z}}-{\overline {c}}z-c{\overline {z}}+c{\overline {c}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2994155cf77d92fba4111d6370a8af0a1b4fccb). Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)").

### Tangent lines

The [tangent line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line "Tangent line") through a point _P_ on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through _P_. If P = (_x_ 1, _y_ 1) and the circle has centre (_a_, _b_) and radius _r_, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (_a_, _b_) to (_x_ 1, _y_ 1), so it has the form (_x_ 1 − _a_)_x_ + (_y_ 1 − _b_)_y_ = _c_. Evaluating at (_x_ 1, _y_ 1) determines the value of _c_, and the result is that the equation of the tangent is ![Image 43: {\displaystyle (x_{1}-a)x+(y_{1}-b)y=(x_{1}-a)x_{1}+(y_{1}-b)y_{1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b87da79769ef2120d4750e7e4a5dc3ba850812f0) or ![Image 44: {\displaystyle (x_{1}-a)(x-a)+(y_{1}-b)(y-b)=r^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6e0410363bb05276475d1cfe3a1a917e6a24f35)

If _y_ 1 ≠ _b_, then the slope of this line is ![Image 45: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\frac {x_{1}-a}{y_{1}-b}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ca37a31033bf89ed061c49ec1273f0b7b40183e)

This can also be found using [implicit differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_differentiation "Implicit differentiation").

When the centre of the circle is at the origin, then the equation of the tangent line becomes ![Image 46: {\displaystyle x_{1}x+y_{1}y=r^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e42f7fab445f44d26e2eeecfba5efdf1b81269f) and its slope is ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\frac {x_{1}}{y_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca3ecb0414f1926d49414ab6333f93282ab346f2)

Properties
----------

*   The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter (see [Isoperimetric inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality "Isoperimetric inequality")).
*   The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [reflection symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry "Reflection symmetry"), and it has [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") around the centre for every angle. Its [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") is the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") O(2,_R_). The group of rotations alone is the [circle group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_group "Circle group")**T**.
*   All circles are [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-13)
    *   A circle circumference and radius are [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)").
    *   The [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_(geometry) "Area (geometry)") enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.
    *   The constants of proportionality are 2 π and π respectively.

*   The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle"). 
    *   Thought of as a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") of the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere"), it becomes the [Riemannian circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_circle "Riemannian circle").

*   Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [circumcircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcircle "Circumcircle").

### Chord

*   Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.
*   The [perpendicular bisector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_bisector "Perpendicular bisector") of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are: 
    *   A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.
    *   The [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") through the centre bisecting a chord is [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to the chord.

*   If a central angle and an [inscribed angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle "Inscribed angle") of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.
*   If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.
*   If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [supplementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles "Supplementary angles"). 
    *   For a [cyclic quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral "Cyclic quadrilateral"), the [exterior angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_angle "Exterior angle") is equal to the interior opposite angle.

*   An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [Thales' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27_theorem "Thales' theorem")).
*   The diameter is the longest chord of the circle. 
    *   Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.

*   If the [intersection of any two chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersecting_chords_theorem "Intersecting chords theorem") divides one chord into lengths _a_ and _b_ and divides the other chord into lengths _c_ and _d_, then _ab_ = _cd_.
*   If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths _a_ and _b_ and divides the other chord into lengths _c_ and _d_, then _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 + _c_ 2 + _d_ 2 equals the square of the diameter.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-14)
*   The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point and is given by 8 _r_ 2 − 4 _p_ 2, where _r_ is the circle radius, and _p_ is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-15)
*   The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-16): p.71 

### Tangent

*   A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.
*   A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.
*   Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.
*   If a tangent at _A_ and a tangent at _B_ intersect at the exterior point _P_, then denoting the centre as _O_, the angles ∠_BOA_ and ∠_BPA_ are supplementary.
*   If _AD_ is tangent to the circle at _A_ and if _AQ_ is a chord of the circle, then ∠_DAQ_ = ⁠1/2⁠arc(_AQ_).

### Theorems

[![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Secant-Secant_Theorem.svg/250px-Secant-Secant_Theorem.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Secant-Secant_Theorem.svg)

Secant–secant theorem

*   The chord theorem states that if two chords, _CD_ and _EB_, intersect at _A_, then _AC_ × _AD_ = _AB_ × _AE_.
*   If two secants, _AE_ and _AD_, also cut the circle at _B_ and _C_ respectively, then _AC_ × _AD_ = _AB_ × _AE_ (corollary of the chord theorem).
*   A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a tangent from an external point _A_ meets the circle at _F_ and a secant from the external point _A_ meets the circle at _C_ and _D_ respectively, then _AF_ 2 = _AC_ × _AD_ (tangent–secant theorem).
*   The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (tangent chord angle).
*   If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90[°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"), then _ℓ_ = _r_ √2, where _ℓ_ is the length of the chord, and _r_ is the radius of the circle.
*   If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle _A_ is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (![Image 49: {\displaystyle {\overset {\frown }{DE}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9ccf660369a3a705bff5c9fd879707b0d404a56) and ![Image 50: {\displaystyle {\overset {\frown }{BC}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7d5cffe92c89482266f356039a49ba3d4333277)). That is, ![Image 51: {\displaystyle 2\angle {CAB}=\angle {DOE}-\angle {BOC}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b56445a07a4e59a22a790a21a2b2fbbb08b2a569), where _O_ is the centre of the circle (secant–secant theorem).

### Inscribed angles

[![Image 52](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Inscribed_angle_theorem.svg/250px-Inscribed_angle_theorem.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inscribed_angle_theorem.svg)

Inscribed-angle theorem

An inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [central angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_angle "Central angle") (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle") (since the central angle is 180°).

### Sagitta

[![Image 53](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Circle_Sagitta.svg/330px-Circle_Sagitta.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_Sagitta.svg)

The sagitta is the vertical segment.

The [sagitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagitta_(geometry) "Sagitta (geometry)") (also known as the [versine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versine "Versine")) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.

Given the length _y_ of a chord and the length _x_ of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines: ![Image 54: {\displaystyle r={\frac {y^{2}}{8x}}+{\frac {x}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd79ddf39cdc709f20f2ce73a0c08747f976af24)

Another proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length _y_ and with sagitta of length _x_, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know that it is a part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the "missing" part of the diameter is (2 _r_ − _x_) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2 _r_ − _x_)_x_ = (_y_ / 2)2. Solving for _r_, we find the required result.

Compass and straightedge constructions
--------------------------------------

There are many [compass-and-straightedge constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction "Compass-and-straightedge construction") resulting in circles.

The simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drawing_tool) "Compass (drawing tool)") on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.

### Construction with given diameter

*   Construct the [midpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint "Midpoint")**M** of the diameter.
*   Construct the circle with centre **M** passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).

[![Image 55](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Circunferencia_10.svg/250px-Circunferencia_10.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circunferencia_10.svg)

Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue). Only two of the three bisectors are needed to find the centre.

### Construction through three noncollinear points

*   Name the points **P**, **Q** and **R**,
*   Construct the [perpendicular bisector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_bisector "Perpendicular bisector") of the segment **PQ**.
*   Construct the [perpendicular bisector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_bisector "Perpendicular bisector") of the segment **PR**.
*   Label the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors **M**. (They meet because the points are not [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear "Collinear")).
*   Construct the circle with centre **M** passing through one of the points **P**, **Q** or **R** (it will also pass through the other two points).

Circle of Apollonius
--------------------

[![Image 56](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Apollonius_circle_definition_labels.svg/250px-Apollonius_circle_definition_labels.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apollonius_circle_definition_labels.svg)

Apollonius' definition of a circle: _d_ 1/_d_ 2 constant

[Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant _ratio_ (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, _A_ and _B_.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-17)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-18) (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment _AB_, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn _about_ two points.

The proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci _A_ and _B_ and a ratio of distances, any point _P_ satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let _C_ be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment _AB_. By the [angle bisector theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem "Angle bisector theorem") the line segment _PC_ will bisect the [interior angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_angle "Interior angle")_APB_, since the segments are similar: ![Image 57: {\displaystyle {\frac {AP}{BP}}={\frac {AC}{BC}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec4508f34276933287249e21f514504bc4e9429f)

Analogously, a line segment _PD_ through some point _D_ on _AB_ extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle _BPQ_ where _Q_ is on _AP_ extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle _CPD_ is exactly 90 degrees; that is, a right angle. The set of points _P_ such that angle _CPD_ is a right angle forms a circle, of which _CD_ is a diameter.

Second, see[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-19): 15  for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.

### Cross-ratios

A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [cross-ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio "Cross-ratio") of points in the complex plane. If _A_, _B_, and _C_ are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points _P_ for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one: ![Image 58: {\displaystyle {\bigl |}[A,B;C,P]{\bigr |}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d29d2d228c14547650d9f23bc20322d363157303)

Stated another way, _P_ is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [_A_, _B_; _C_, _P_] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.

### Generalised circles

If _C_ is the midpoint of the segment _AB_, then the collection of points _P_ satisfying the Apollonius condition ![Image 59: {\displaystyle {\frac {|AP|}{|BP|}}={\frac {|AC|}{|BC|}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e86b9ad901d924803c59778e69fd49c2617bab0) is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if _A_, _B_, and _C_ are given distinct points in the plane, then the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of points _P_ satisfying the above equation is called a "generalised circle." It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.

Inscription in or circumscription about other figures
-----------------------------------------------------

In every [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") a unique circle, called the [incircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle_and_excircles_of_a_triangle "Incircle and excircles of a triangle"), can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-20)

About every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-21)

A [tangential polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_polygon "Tangential polygon"), such as a [tangential quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_quadrilateral "Tangential quadrilateral"), is any [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon") within which a [circle can be inscribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_circle "Inscribed circle") that is tangent to each side of the polygon.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-22) Every [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") and every triangle is a tangential polygon.

A [cyclic polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_polygon "Cyclic polygon") is any convex polygon about which a [circle can be circumscribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcircle "Circumcircle"), passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [bicentric polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentric_polygon "Bicentric polygon").

A [hypocycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid "Hypocycloid") is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.

Limiting case of other figures
------------------------------

The circle can be viewed as a [limiting case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_case_(mathematics) "Limiting case (mathematics)") of various other figures:

*   The series of [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") with _n_ sides has the circle as its limit as _n_ approaches infinity. This fact was applied by [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") to [approximate π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80 "Approximations of π").
*   A [Cartesian oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_oval "Cartesian oval") is a set of points such that a [weighted sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_sum "Weighted sum") of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.
*   A [superellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse "Superellipse") has an equation of the form ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \left|{\frac {x}{a}}\right|^{n}\!+\left|{\frac {y}{b}}\right|^{n}\!=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf7278d088496cad8d362fa0d40d71076bd39d47) for positive _a_, _b_, and _n_. A supercircle has _b_ = _a_. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which _n_ = 2.
*   A [Cassini oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_oval "Cassini oval") is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.
*   A [curve of constant width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_of_constant_width "Curve of constant width") is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.

Locus of constant sum

Consider a finite set of ![Image 61: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) points in the plane. The locus of points such that the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is constant is a circle, whose centre is at the centroid of the given points.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-23) A generalisation for higher powers of distances is obtained if, instead of ![Image 62: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) points, the vertices of the regular polygon ![Image 63: {\displaystyle P_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5949c8b1de44005a1af3a11188361f2a830842d1) are taken.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-Mamuka-24) The locus of points such that the sum of the ![Image 64: {\displaystyle 2m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70e100f32f96dc84bf0591df4f5c5bd40d71189f)-th power of distances ![Image 65: {\displaystyle d_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abe3154db7d4f92fb42dd1f80f52f528c6312e4a) to the vertices of a given regular polygon with circumradius ![Image 66: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33) is constant is a circle, if ![Image 67: {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}d_{i}^{2m}>nR^{2m},\quad {\text{  where }}~m=1,2,\dots ,n-1;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e440f93cf80c77be882ba593f8ce43dba5aa065d) whose centre is the centroid of the ![Image 68: {\displaystyle P_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5949c8b1de44005a1af3a11188361f2a830842d1).

In the case of the [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle"), the loci of the constant sums of the second and fourth powers are circles, whereas for the square, the loci are circles for the constant sums of the second, fourth, and sixth powers. For the [regular pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_pentagon "Regular pentagon") the constant sum of the eighth powers of the distances will be added and so forth.

Squaring the circle
-------------------

Squaring the circle is the problem, proposed by [ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity")[geometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometers "Geometers"), of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [compass and straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge "Compass and straightedge").

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindemann%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem"), which proves that pi (π) is a [transcendental number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number "Transcendental number"), rather than an [algebraic irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number "Algebraic number"); that is, it is not the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of any [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") with [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") coefficients. Despite the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for [pseudomath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomath "Pseudomath") enthusiasts.

Generalisations

### In other _p_-norms

[![Image 69](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Vector-p-Norms_qtl1.svg/250px-Vector-p-Norms_qtl1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector-p-Norms_qtl1.svg)

Illustrations of unit circles (see also [superellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse "Superellipse")) in different _p_-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding _p_).

Defining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [_p_-norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-norm "P-norm"), distance is determined by ![Image 70: {\displaystyle \left\|x\right\|_{p}=\left(\left|x_{1}\right|^{p}+\left|x_{2}\right|^{p}+\dotsb +\left|x_{n}\right|^{p}\right)^{1/p}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43b1c7d79b79edd195edec9623a7e2e3a80df4ce) In Euclidean geometry, _p_ = 2, giving the familiar ![Image 71: {\displaystyle \left\|x\right\|_{2}={\sqrt {\left|x_{1}\right|^{2}+\left|x_{2}\right|^{2}+\dotsb +\left|x_{n}\right|^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/923b8c205fc0561ae767f83ffebd6fcf3695d4b4)

In [taxicab geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry "Taxicab geometry"), _p_ = 1. Taxicab circles are [squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") with sides oriented at a 45° angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length ![Image 72: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d4f35f5d92df4b263980763817a1a89756b413f) using a [Euclidean metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric "Euclidean metric"), where _r_ is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2 _r_. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8 _r_. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a) is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is ![Image 74: {\displaystyle |x|+|y|=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e09db8ee8cbfafa057da38d82c651787ecbef8f4) in Cartesian coordinates and ![Image 75: {\displaystyle r={\frac {1}{\left|\sin \theta \right|+\left|\cos \theta \right|}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b0981b4d405ef1165e94c0cbfac64694a5008e4) in polar coordinates.

A circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [von Neumann neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood "Von Neumann neighborhood") of its centre.

A circle of radius _r_ for the [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance "Chebyshev distance") ([_L_∞ metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space "Lp space")) on a plane is also a square with side length 2 _r_ parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between _L_ 1 and _L_∞ metrics does not generalise to higher dimensions.

### Topological definition

The circle is the [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional "One-dimensional")[hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere") (the 1-sphere).

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), a circle is not limited to the geometric concept, but to all of its [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism"). Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of [**R**3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space") upon itself (known as an [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy")).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle#cite_note-gamelin-25)
