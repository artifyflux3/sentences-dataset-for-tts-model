[ 1 ] [ 2 ] By Cartan–Hadamard theorem all Cartan–Hadamard manifolds are diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Furthermore it follows from the Hopf–Rinow theorem that every pairs of points in a Cartan–Hadamard manifold may be connected by a unique geodesic segment. Thus Cartan–Hadamard manifolds are some of the closest relatives of R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Examples [ edit ] The Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} with its usual metric is a Cartan–Hadamard manifold with constant sectional curvature equal to 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} Standard n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional hyperbolic space H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} is a Cartan–Hadamard manifold with constant sectional curvature equal to − − 1.

{\displaystyle -1.} Properties [ edit ] In Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, the map exp p : T ⁡ ⁡ M p → → M {\displaystyle \exp _{p}:\operatorname {T} M_{p}\to M} is a diffeomorphism for all p ∈ ∈ M .
