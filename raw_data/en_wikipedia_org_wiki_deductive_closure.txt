If ⁠ T {\displaystyle T} ⁠ is a set of formulae, the deductive closure of ⁠ T {\displaystyle T} ⁠ is its smallest superset that is deductively closed.

The deductive closure of a theory ⁠ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠ is often denoted ⁠ Ded ⁡ ⁡ ( T ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ded} ({\mathcal {T}})} ⁠ or ⁠ Th ⁡ ⁡ ( T ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Th} ({\mathcal {T}})} ⁠ .

[ citation needed ] Some authors do not define a theory as deductively closed (thus, a theory is defined as any set of sentences ), but such theories can always be 'extended' to a deductively closed set. A theory may be referred to as a deductively closed theory to emphasize it is defined as a deductively closed set.

[ 1 ] Deductive closure is a special case of the more general mathematical concept of closure — in particular, the deductive closure of ⁠ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠ is exactly the closure of ⁠ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠ with respect to the operation of logical consequence ( ⁠ ⊢ ⊢ {\displaystyle \vdash } ⁠ ).

Examples [ edit ] In propositional logic , the set of all true propositions is deductively closed. This is to say that only true statements are derivable from other true statements.

Epistemic closure [ edit ] Main article: Epistemic closure In epistemology , many philosophers have and continue to debate whether particular subsets of propositions —especially ones ascribing knowledge or justification of a belief to a subject—are closed under deduction.
