Solar System space probes operational as of November 2024 This is a list of active space probes which have escaped Earth orbit . It includes lunar space probes , but does not include space probes orbiting at the Sun–Earth Lagrangian points (for these, see List of objects at Lagrangian points ). A craft is deemed "active" if it is still able to transmit usable data to Earth (regardless of whether it can receive commands).

The craft are further grouped by mission status – "en-route", "mission in progress" or "mission complete" – based on their primary mission. For example, though Voyager 1 is still contactable en-route to the Oort Cloud and has exited the Solar System , it is listed as "mission complete" because its primary task of studying Jupiter and Saturn has been accomplished. Once a probe has reached its first primary target, it is no longer listed as "en route" regardless of whether further travel is involved.
