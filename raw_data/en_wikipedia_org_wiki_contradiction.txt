This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between [categorical propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_proposition "Categorical proposition") in the [square of opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_of_opposition "Square of opposition") of [Aristotelian logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic "Term logic").

In [traditional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_logic "Traditional logic"), a **contradiction** involves a [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") conflicting either with itself or established [fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact "Fact"). It is often used as a tool to detect [disingenuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disingenuous "Disingenuous") beliefs and [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias "Bias"). Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s [law of noncontradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction "Law of noncontradiction") states that "It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-1)

In modern [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic "Formal logic") and [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory"), the term is mainly used instead for a _single_ proposition, often denoted by the [falsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsum "Falsum") symbol [![Image 2: {\displaystyle \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f282c7bc331cc3bfcf1c57f1452cc23c022f58de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type "Bottom type"); a proposition is a contradiction if [false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_(logic) "False (logic)") can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic. It is a proposition that is unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-3) This can be generalized to a collection of propositions, which is then said to "contain" a contradiction.

By creation of a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox "Paradox"), [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s _[Euthydemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthydemus\_(dialogue) "Euthydemus (dialogue)")_ dialogue demonstrates the need for the notion of _contradiction_. In the ensuing dialogue, [Dionysodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysodorus_(sophist) "Dionysodorus (sophist)") denies the existence of "contradiction", all the while that [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") is contradicting him:

> ... I in my astonishment said: What do you mean Dionysodorus? I have often heard, and have been amazed to hear, this thesis of yours, which is maintained and employed by the disciples of Protagoras and others before them, and which to me appears to be quite wonderful, and suicidal as well as destructive, and I think that I am most likely to hear the truth about it from you. The dictum is that there is no such thing as a falsehood; a man must either say what is true or say nothing. Is not that your position?

Indeed, Dionysodorus agrees that "there is no such thing as false opinion ... there is no such thing as ignorance", and demands of Socrates to "Refute me." Socrates responds "But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is impossible?".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-4)

Note: The symbol ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f282c7bc331cc3bfcf1c57f1452cc23c022f58de) ([falsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsum "Falsum")) represents an arbitrary contradiction, with the dual [tee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(symbol) "Tee (symbol)") symbol ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \top }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf12e436fef2365e76fcb1034a51179d8328bb33) used to denote an arbitrary tautology. Contradiction is sometimes symbolized by "O _pq_", and tautology by "V _pq_". The turnstile symbol, ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \vdash }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0c0d30cf8cb7dba179e317fcde9583d842e80f6) is often read as "yields" or "proves".

In classical logic, particularly in [propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") and [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), a proposition ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) is a contradiction [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if")![Image 7: {\displaystyle \varphi \vdash \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb2a11d466849d8b206a4a6c934264fe16835bb8). Since for contradictory ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) it is true that ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \vdash \varphi \rightarrow \psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60875b3cd620fe51bd3d52cde99877beece9a333) for all ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a) (because ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \bot \vdash \psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64ffc2cef9ffd8f84c60c0c55f393d8e5f8df8b4)), one may prove any proposition from a set of axioms which contains contradictions. This is called the "[principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion "Principle of explosion")", or "ex falso quodlibet" ("from falsity, anything follows").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-5)

In a [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic) "Completeness (logic)") logic, a formula is contradictory if and only if it is [unsatisfiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsatisfiable "Unsatisfiable").

### Proof by contradiction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contradiction&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Proof by contradiction")]

For a set of consistent premises ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e) and a proposition ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e), it is true in [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic") that ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \Sigma \vdash \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93affa0a70251d15804ea808eb6b56e135585f50) (i.e., ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e) proves ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e)) if and only if ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \Sigma \cup \{\neg \varphi \}\vdash \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/feae6450e7beacc7aece5f6bc6f09a91a81d14f0) (i.e., ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e) and ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \neg \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6c4b627f483f3efdd7c27e708f6f37c20c63502) leads to a contradiction). Therefore, a [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(logic) "Proof (logic)") that ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \Sigma \cup \{\neg \varphi \}\vdash \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/feae6450e7beacc7aece5f6bc6f09a91a81d14f0) also proves that ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \varphi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee699558d09cf9d653f6351f9fda0b2f4aaa3e) is true under the premises ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e). The use of this fact forms the basis of a [proof technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_techniques "Proof techniques") called [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction"), which mathematicians use extensively to establish the validity of a wide range of theorems. This applies only in a logic where the [law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle "Law of excluded middle")![Image 23: {\displaystyle A\vee \neg A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/323f5c2a8924ef707dcc24cee3bce1b148ec1367) is accepted as an axiom.

Using [minimal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_logic "Minimal logic"), a logic with similar axioms to classical logic but without _ex falso quodlibet_ and proof by contradiction, we can investigate the axiomatic strength and properties of various rules that treat contradiction by considering theorems of classical logic that are not theorems of minimal logic.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-6) Each of these extensions leads to an [intermediate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_logic "Intermediate logic"):

1.   Double-negation elimination (DNE) is the strongest principle, axiomatized ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \neg \neg A\implies A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07f0de4b75feccf724289b9534f5ea9d4796044a), and when it is added to minimal logic yields classical logic.
2.   Ex falso quodlibet (EFQ), axiomatized ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \bot \implies A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0af677ecbf6b939e434be7063a506422653dc7a8), licenses many consequences of negations, but typically does not help to infer propositions that do not involve absurdity from consistent propositions that do. When added to minimal logic, EFQ yields [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic "Intuitionistic logic"). EFQ is equivalent to _ex contradiction quodlibet_, axiomatized ![Image 26: {\displaystyle A\land \neg A\implies B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2de31b9d2e4db9afffe15b8a42f0115d69432625), over minimal logic.
3.   [Peirce's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peirce%27s_law "Peirce's law") (PR) is an axiom ![Image 27: {\displaystyle ((A\implies B)\implies A)\implies A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bec1c55819a500c8b7116934538a37ccf446d466) that captures proof by contradiction without explicitly referring to absurdity. Minimal logic + PR + EFQ yields classical logic.
4.   The Gödel-Dummett (GD) axiom ![Image 28: {\displaystyle A\implies B\vee B\implies A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac78081b0f6e3ec4ca66b38f8e7dd8be18113aa1), whose most simple reading is that there is a linear order on truth values. Minimal logic + GD yields [Gödel-Dummett logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del-Dummett_logic "Gödel-Dummett logic"). Peirce's rule entails but is not entailed by GD over minimal logic.
5.   Law of the excluded middle (LEM), axiomatised ![Image 29: {\displaystyle A\vee \neg A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/323f5c2a8924ef707dcc24cee3bce1b148ec1367), is the most often cited formulation of the [principle of bivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence"), but in the absence of EFQ it does not yield full classical logic. Minimal logic + LEM + EFQ yields classical logic. PR entails but is not entailed by LEM in minimal logic. If the formula B in Peirce's rule is restricted to absurdity, giving the axiom schema ![Image 30: {\displaystyle (\neg A\implies A)\implies A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba03ffc1838513d69ca130c83789c7f7403f1928), the scheme is equivalent to LEM over minimal logic.
6.   Weak law of the excluded middle (WLEM) is axiomatised ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \neg A\vee \neg \neg A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef67eb5aaa11449121671846b3dba54794dde62b) and yields a system where disjunction behaves more like in classical logic than intuitionistic logic, i.e. the [disjunction and existence properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunction_and_existence_properties "Disjunction and existence properties") don't hold, but where use of non-intuitionistic reasoning is marked by occurrences of double-negation in the conclusion. LEM entails but is not entailed by WLEM in minimal logic. WLEM is equivalent to the instance of [De Morgan's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_law "De Morgan's law") that distributes negation over conjunction: ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \neg (A\land B)\iff (\neg A)\vee (\neg B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6266cb8dd6a3528c68da19b03f0ba6e746f9e47).

### Symbolic representation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contradiction&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Symbolic representation")]

In mathematics, the symbol used to represent a contradiction within a proof varies.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-7) Some symbols that may be used to represent a contradiction include ↯, Opq, ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \Rightarrow \Leftarrow }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0910f38ab10fa4e15bb398d89588f6a2147e6d0c), ⊥, ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow \ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0fa602e48c1a1c87ca9ced0a053da531f9c6f5c)/ , and ※; in any symbolism, a contradiction may be substituted for the truth value "[false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_(logic) "False (logic)")", as symbolized, for instance, by "0" (as is common in [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra")). It is not uncommon to see [Q.E.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D. "Q.E.D."), or some of its variants, immediately after a contradiction symbol. In fact, this often occurs in a proof by contradiction to indicate that the original assumption was proved false—and hence that its negation must be true.

### The notion of contradiction in an axiomatic system and a proof of its consistency

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contradiction&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The notion of contradiction in an axiomatic system and a proof of its consistency")]

In general, a [consistency proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_proof "Consistency proof") requires the following two things:

1.   An [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system")
2.   A demonstration that it is _not_ the case that both the formula _p_ and its negation _~p_ can be derived in the system.

But by whatever method one goes about it, all consistency proofs would _seem_ to necessitate the primitive notion of _contradiction._ Moreover, it _seems_ as if this notion would simultaneously have to be "outside" the formal system in the definition of tautology.

When [Emil Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Post "Emil Post"), in his 1921 "Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions", extended his proof of the consistency of the [propositional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus") (i.e. the logic) beyond that of _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia\_Mathematica "Principia Mathematica")_ (PM), he observed that with respect to a _generalized_ set of postulates (i.e. axioms), he would no longer be able to automatically invoke the notion of "contradiction"—such a notion might not be contained in the postulates:

> The prime requisite of a set of postulates is that it be consistent. Since the ordinary notion of consistency involves that of contradiction, which again involves negation, and since this function does not appear in general as a primitive in [the _generalized_ set of postulates] a new definition must be given.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-8)

Post's solution to the problem is described in the demonstration "An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency", offered by [Ernest Nagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Nagel "Ernest Nagel") and [James R. Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Newman "James R. Newman") in their 1958 _[Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del "Gödel")'s Proof_. They too observed a problem with respect to the notion of "contradiction" with its usual "truth values" of "truth" and "falsity". They observed that:

> The property of being a tautology has been defined in notions of truth and falsity. Yet these notions obviously involve a reference to something _outside_ the formula calculus. Therefore, the procedure mentioned in the text in effect offers an _interpretation_ of the calculus, by supplying a model for the system. This being so, the authors have not done what they promised, namely, "**to define a property of formulas in terms of purely structural features of the formulas themselves**". [Indeed] ... proofs of consistency which are based on models, and which argue from the truth of axioms to their consistency, merely shift the problem.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-9)

Given some "primitive formulas" such as PM's primitives S 1 V S 2 [inclusive OR] and ~S (negation), one is forced to define the axioms in terms of these primitive notions. In a thorough manner, Post demonstrates in PM, and defines (as do Nagel and Newman, see below) that the property of _tautologous_ – as yet to be defined – is "inherited": if one begins with a set of tautologous axioms (postulates) and a [deduction system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deduction_system "Deduction system") that contains [substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_(logic) "Substitution (logic)") and [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens "Modus ponens"), then a _consistent_ system will yield only tautologous formulas.

On the topic of the definition of _tautologous_, Nagel and Newman create two [mutually exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_exclusive "Mutually exclusive") and [exhaustive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectively_exhaustive_events "Collectively exhaustive events") classes K 1 and K 2, into which fall (the outcome of) the axioms when their variables (e.g. S 1 and S 2 are assigned from these classes). This also applies to the primitive formulas. For example: "A formula having the form S 1 V S 2 is placed into class K 2, if both S 1 and S 2 are in K 2; otherwise it is placed in K 1", and "A formula having the form ~S is placed in K 2, if S is in K 1; otherwise it is placed in K 1".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-10)

Hence Nagel and Newman can now define the notion of _[tautologous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology\_(logic) "Tautology (logic)")_: "a formula is a tautology if and only if it falls in the class K 1, no matter in which of the two classes its elements are placed".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-11) This way, the property of "being tautologous" is described—without reference to a model or an interpretation.

> For example, given a formula such as ~S 1 V S 2 and an assignment of K 1 to S 1 and K 2 to S 2 one can evaluate the formula and place its outcome in one or the other of the classes. The assignment of K 1 to S 1 places ~S 1 in K 2, and now we can see that our assignment causes the formula to fall into class K 2. Thus by definition our formula is not a tautology.

Post observed that, if the system were inconsistent, a deduction in it (that is, the last formula in a sequence of formulas derived from the tautologies) could ultimately yield S itself. As an assignment to variable S can come from either class K 1 or K 2, the deduction violates the inheritance characteristic of tautology (i.e., the derivation must yield an evaluation of a formula that will fall into class K 1). From this, Post was able to derive the following definition of inconsistency—_without the use of the notion of contradiction_:

> Definition. _A system will be said to be inconsistent if it yields the assertion of the unmodified variable p [S in the Newman and Nagel examples]._

In other words, the notion of "contradiction" can be dispensed when constructing a proof of consistency; what replaces it is the notion of "mutually exclusive and exhaustive" classes. An axiomatic system need not include the notion of "contradiction".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-jstor1921-12): 177

Adherents of the [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") theory of [coherentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherentism "Coherentism") typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief"), that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") of beliefs. Some [dialetheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialetheism "Dialetheism"), including [Graham Priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Priest "Graham Priest"), have argued that coherence may not require consistency.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-13)

### Pragmatic contradictions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contradiction&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Pragmatic contradictions")]

A pragmatic contradiction occurs when the very statement of the argument contradicts the claims it purports. An inconsistency arises, in this case, because the act of utterance, rather than the content of what is said, undermines its conclusion.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-14)

### Dialectical materialism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contradiction&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Dialectical materialism")]

In [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism "Dialectical materialism"): Contradiction—as derived from [Hegelianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegelianism "Hegelianism")—usually refers to an opposition inherently existing within one realm, one unified force or object. This contradiction, as opposed to metaphysical thinking, is not an objectively impossible thing, because these contradicting forces exist in objective reality, not cancelling each other out, but actually defining each other's existence. According to [Marxist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_theory "Marxist theory"), such a contradiction can be found, for example, in the fact that:

*   (a) enormous wealth and productive powers coexist alongside:
*   (b) extreme poverty and misery;
*   (c) the existence of (a) being contrary to the existence of (b).

Hegelian and Marxist theories stipulate that the [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Modern_philosophy "Dialectic") nature of history will lead to the [sublation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben "Aufheben"), or [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis "Thesis, antithesis, synthesis"), of its contradictions. Marx therefore postulated that history would logically make [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") evolve into a [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") society where the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") would equally serve the [working and producing class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") of society, thus resolving the prior contradiction between (a) and (b).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#cite_note-15)

Outside formal logic

[Colloquial usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism "Colloquialism") can label actions or statements as contradicting each other when due (or perceived as due) to [presuppositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presupposition "Presupposition") which are contradictory in the logical sense.

[Proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction") is used in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") to construct [proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof").
