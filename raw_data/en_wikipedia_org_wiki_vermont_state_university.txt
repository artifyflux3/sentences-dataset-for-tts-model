Vermont State University Woodruff Hall in Castleton campus Type Public university Established July 1, 2023 ; 2 years ago ( 2023-07-01 ) Accreditation NECHE President David Bergh (interim) [ 1 ] Students 4,775 Location Castleton , Johnson , Lyndon , Randolph , and Williston , Vermont , United States Campus Multiple sites Colors Amaranth and cyan Website vermontstate.edu Vermont State University ( Vermont State or VTSU ) is a public university in the U.S. state of Vermont formed through the merger of three institutions: Castleton University , Northern Vermont University , and Vermont Technical College . First proposed in December 2020 as a way to consolidate the Vermont State Colleges , the state's public university system , it is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Vermont State University operates residential campuses in five communities: Castleton , Johnson , Lyndon , Randolph , and Williston .

[ 4 ] In addition, VTSU operates nine smaller learning sites around the state as well as out-of-state locations in Alaska , New Hampshire , and Wisconsin .

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Castleton University was chartered as a grammar school in 1787, making it the oldest institution dissolved to create Vermont State University.

[ 6 ] Johnson Academy was founded in 1828, later becoming Johnson State College ; Vermont Technical College was founded in 1806 as Orange County Grammar School; Lyndon State College was founded in 1911 as a normal school . The Vermont General Assembly created the Vermont State Colleges System (VSCS) in 1961, creating a "loose confederation" of colleges that also included the Community College of Vermont after its founding in 1970 (but never included the University of Vermont ).

[ 7 ] Beginning in 1977, the Vermont State Colleges adopted a more centralized model, with its trustees overseeing the operations of all its constituent schools. This began to reverse somewhat beginning in 2000, when the system allowed more autonomy for the schools while still encouraging cooperation, including uniform course numbering so students could take courses from different VSCS institutions.

[ 8 ] By 2020, however, the Vermont State Colleges were in poor financial shape. That year, Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding proposed closing Northern Vermont University, closing Vermont Technical College's Randolph campus, and laying off almost 500 employees.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Even with the proposal, Spaulding told trustees, the system needed an immediate infusion of $25 million to keep operating.

[ 11 ] Spaulding withdrew the proposal amid fierce opposition and the state appropriated additional funds to keep all campuses and colleges operating, but lawmakers asked VSC to come up with a way to fix its financial situation.

[ 12 ] VSCS formed a committee, named the Select Committee on the Future of Public Higher Education, which ultimately recommended a similar proposal to Spaulding's closure plan. Instead of closing campuses, however, the committee recommended merging all three of the system's four-year colleges into a single institution with multiple campuses. While the committee did not recommend including the Community College of Vermont in the merger, it did recommend it focus more toward workforce education and adult learning.

[ 13 ] The proposal was projected to save the system $25 million over five years.

[ 14 ] Two aspects of the original plans to merge proved controversial. First, the libraries were going to remove most of their physical books with most of their holdings only being virtual. Second, there were several planned changes to intercollegiate athletics. In particular, the athletic teams at the Johnson campus (previously part of Northern Vermont University), would leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). Athletic teams at the Randolph campus (previously part of Vermont Technical College) would leave the USCAA and move to a club-only model.

[ 15 ] Students, faculty, and staff protested these planned changes and drew national attention. Vermont state legislators introduced bills to prevent these changes. These changes were both paused in April 2023 when president Parwinder Grewal abruptly resigned.

[ 16 ] The combined institution included the roughly 5,500 students at its three predecessor institutions; however, the 250 academic programs offered between the three schools were reduced to 100.

[ 17 ] Interim President Mike Smith announced an initiative in September 2023 to "examine our list of academic offerings" and consider combining or closing additional degree programs.

[ 18 ] Academics [ edit ] Undergraduate demographics as of Fall 2023 [ 19 ] Race and ethnicity Total White 78% Hispanic 5% Black 4% Unknown 4% International student 3% Two or more races 3% Asian 2% Economic diversity Low-income [ a ] 36% Affluent [ b ] 64% Vermont State University offers associate , bachelor's , and master's degrees. The Castleton, Johnson, and Lyndon campuses offer liberal arts education while the Randolph and Williston locations house technical programs. Students have the option to take online courses as well as hybrid courses from other campuses.

[ 20 ] In 2023, the university announced plans to lay off up to 33 faculty members and the same number of full-time administrative and staff positions.

[ 21 ] Campuses [ edit ] Castleton [ edit ] The 165-acre campus is residential and is located in the heart of Castleton Village .

[ 22 ] The Castleton Medical College Building , built in 1818, is the oldest building on campus.

[ 23 ] Johnson [ edit ] Library and Learning Center at Vermont State University - Johnson campus The Johnson campus is 350 acres and includes the Dibden Center for the Arts and the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery.

[ 24 ] Nearby Babcock Nature Preserve is a 1,000-acre forest owned and maintained by Johnson for scientific and educational study.

[ 25 ] Lyndon [ edit ] The 195-acre Lyndon campus [ 26 ] features the three-story Samuel Read Hall Library .

[ 27 ] Other sites on campus include News 7, a daily live broadcast studio; [ 28 ] the Stannard Gymnasium; [ 29 ] and six residence halls.

[ 26 ] Randolph [ edit ] The campus in Randolph is the largest of the five at 544 acres and hosts engineering labs and an advanced manufacturing center.

[ 5 ] The campus has received United States Department of Defense funding to establish the first advanced manufacturing education, research, and development facility in the state.

[ 30 ] Williston [ edit ] The suburban Williston campus, located just outside Burlington , houses several labs and a small residential building.

[ 5 ] Leadership [ edit ] The Theodore N. Vail Center at the VTSU Lyndon campus Parwinder Grewal was appointed as the university's first president in 2022.

[ 31 ] Grewal was previously an administrator at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley .

[ 32 ] However, Grewal resigned abruptly in April 2023 before the university officially opened. His resignation was preceded by a vote of no confidence by the faculty, who also voted no confidence in the Vermont State College's chancellor, chief administrative officer , and its entire board of trustees.

[ 33 ] Grewal was replaced by Mike Smith, who previously served as interim president at Burlington College and was the state's Secretary of Human Services during the COVID-19 pandemic .

[ 34 ] On September 22, 2023, David Bergh, a former administrator at Johnson State College and the final president at the former Cazenovia College in New York, was selected as the college's next interim president.

[ 35 ] Immediately after Bergh's rise to the interim president position at the beginning of November 2023, the student government associations at the Castleton, Randolph, Johnson, and Lyndon campuses submitted a vote of no confidence regarding staff and faculty terminations proposed by the university's administrators.

[ 36 ] List of presidents [ edit ] Parwinder Grewal (July 2022 – April 2023; prior to establishment) [ 37 ] Mike Smith (April 2023 – October 2023; interim) [ 38 ] David Bergh (November 2023 – June 30, 2026) [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Athletics [ edit ] Vermont State University has the former Northern Vermont University ( Johnson Badgers and Lyndon Hornets ), Castleton University , and Vermont Technical College athletics teams. Owing to the university's unique composition from a series of formerly independent colleges, four of its five campuses have their own athletics programs. Students are able to participate in athletics based on their campus, with some of the campuses competing against each other in athletic conferences.

[ 41 ] The original merger plans were that, starting in the 2024–25 academic year, athletics at the Johnson campus would become sanctioned by the USCAA, and athletics at the Randolph campus will move to a club-only model.

[ 15 ] These plans were placed on hold in mid-April 2023 when the university president resigned.

[ 16 ] Castetlon Spartans [ edit ] Main article: Castleton Spartans The Castleton campus offers a wide variety of sports, including football , alpine skiing, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling.
