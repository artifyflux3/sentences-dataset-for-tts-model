[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is associated with antispeciesism , anti-racism , feminism , and transhumanism .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Antinaturalist philosophy is closely linked to the French animal rights movement and materialist feminism .

[ 1 ] It is also supported by xenofeminists , who advocate for a form of feminism holding that if nature is unjust, it should be changed.

[ 5 ] Notable advocates include David Olivier and Yves Bonnardel .

[ 6 ] Views [ edit ] Antinaturalists defend the inherent and absolute moral permissibility of abortion , birth control , body modification , sex reassignment surgery , and other means by which they believe human beings can assume control of their own bodies and their own environments.

[ 5 ] Antinaturalism stands in contrast to some radical environmentalist movements, which state that nature itself is sacred and should be preserved for its own sake; instead it advances the idea that all human acts are natural and that ecological preservation is important inasmuch as it is necessary for the well-being of sentient beings , not because of some inherently sacred attribute of nature as a whole.

[ 7 ] Yves Bonnardel argues that naturalist ideology "goes hand in hand with and legitimises speciesist oppression of non-human sentient beings", [ 1 ] and that using natural law to justify the reintroduction of predatory animals to control populations of other animals is a form of speciesism .
