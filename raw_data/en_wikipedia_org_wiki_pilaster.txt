Two decorative Corinthian pilasters in the Church of Saint-Sulpice (Paris) In architecture , a pilaster is both a load-bearing section of thickened wall or column integrated into a wall, and a purely decorative element in classical architecture which gives the appearance of a supporting column and articulates an extent of wall. As an ornament it consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface, usually treated as though it were a column, with a capital at the top, plinth (base) at the bottom, and the various other column elements. In contrast to a Classical pilaster, an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above.

In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] A pilaster is foremost a load-bearing architectural element used widely throughout the world and its history where a structural load is carried by a thickened section of wall or column integrated into a wall.

It is also a purely ornamental element used in Classical architecture . As such it may be defined as a flattened column which has lost its three-dimensional and tactile value.".

[ 2 ] In Classical architecture [ edit ] In discussing Leon Battista Alberti 's use of pilasters, which Alberti reintroduced into wall-architecture, Rudolf Wittkower wrote: "The pilaster is the logical transformation of the column for the decoration of a wall.

A pilaster appears with a capital .

[ 3 ] and entablature , also in "low- relief " or flattened against the wall. Generally, a pilaster often repeats all parts and proportions of an order column; however, unlike it, a pilaster is usually devoid of entasis .

Pilasters often appear on the sides of a door frame or window opening on the facade of a building, and are sometimes paired with columns or pillars set directly in front of them at some distance away from the wall, which support a roof structure above, such as a portico . These vertical elements can also be used to support a recessed archivolt around a doorway. The pilaster can be replaced by ornamental brackets supporting the entablature or a balcony over a doorway.

When a pilaster appears at the corner intersection of two walls it is known as a canton .

[ 4 ] As with a column, a pilaster can have a plain or fluted surface to its profile and can be represented in the mode of numerous architectural styles. During the Renaissance and Baroque architects used a range of pilaster forms.

[ 5 ] In the giant order pilasters appear as two storeys tall, linking floors in a single unit.

The fashion of using this decorative element from ancient Greek and Roman architecture was adopted in the Italian Renaissance , gained wide popularity with Greek Revival architecture , and continues to be seen in some modern architecture.
