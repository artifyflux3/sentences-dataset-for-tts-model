The journal is one of the flagship journals of the Society. It is sponsored by its division, the ASCE Structural Engineering Institute.

Scope [ edit ] This journal shares knowledge and advances in the field of structural engineering . Topics that are covered include structural modeling and design; analytical, computational and experimental simulation techniques; and discuss methods for maintaining, rehabilitating monitoring existing structures, sustainable structures, resilient infrastructure, and state-of-the-art / state-of-practice content.

History [ edit ] Originally, the journals was part of the proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, first published in 1873 [ 1 ] The Journal started publishing separately in 1956 as part of the ASCE Journal of the Structural Division ( ISSN 0044-8001 ). In 1983, the title was changed to the Journal of Structural Engineering ( ISSN 0733-9445 ).
