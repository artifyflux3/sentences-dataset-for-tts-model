It had a population of 238,005 at the 2020 census , making it the third-most populous city in Virginia and 100th-most populous city in the United States.

[ 4 ] The city holds a strategic position as the historical, urban, financial, and cultural center of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area (sometimes called " Tidewater "), which has more than 1.8 million inhabitants and is the 37th-largest metropolitan area in the U.S.

[ 5 ] Norfolk was established in 1682 as a colonial seaport. Strategically located at the confluence of the Elizabeth River and Chesapeake Bay , it quickly developed into a major center for trade and shipbuilding. During the American Revolution and War of 1812 , its port and naval facilities made it a critical military target. Norfolk's prominence grew in the 20th century with the expansion of the U.S. Navy , particularly through the establishment of Naval Station Norfolk in 1917, which remains the world's largest naval base.

Norfolk is an important contributor to the Port of Virginia and houses one of NATO 's two Strategic Command headquarters . It is home to Maersk Line, Limited , which manages the world's largest fleet of US-flag vessels . The city has numerous cultural institutions including the Nauticus maritime museum, Chrysler Museum of Art , and Virginia Zoo . Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront areas, including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. Its low-lying coastal infrastructure is vulnerable to sea level rise , with water levels expected to rise by more than 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) by the end of the 21st century.

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Norfolk, Virginia and Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia This section needs additional citations for verification .

( October 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Before 1607 [ edit ] In the late sixteenth century, the area that is now Norfolk was inhabited by the Chesepian people, who referred to the land as "K'che-sepi-ack." According to historical accounts from William Strachy, the Chesepian settlements were destroyed by the Powhatan shortly before the establishment of Jamestown in 1607.

[ citation needed ] Colonial era [ edit ] Norfolk's lands were some of the first to draw settlers from the Virginia Colony , although Norfolk would not be incorporated as a town until the 1700s. When the establishment of the House of Burgesses introduced representative government to the colony in 1619, governor Sir George Yeardley divided the developed portion of the colony into four incorporated jurisdictions, termed citties.

The land on which Norfolk now sits fell under Elizabeth Cittie incorporation.

[ citation needed ] In 1634 King Charles I reorganized the colony into a system of shires , and Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire . Elizabeth City Shire (now the city of Hampton) included all land that today comprises the cities of Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Suffolk.  After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, Adam Thoroughgood (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King's Lynn , Norfolk , England ) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the Lynnhaven River in 1636.

[ citation needed ] When the South Hampton Roads portion of the shire was separated, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed New Norfolk County . One year later, it was divided into two counties, Upper Norfolk and Lower Norfolk (the latter now incorporated into the City of Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgood's recommendation.

[ 6 ] This area of Virginia became known as the place of entrepreneurs, including men of the Virginia Company of London .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Norfolk developed in the late-seventeenth century as a "Half Moone" fort was constructed and 50 acres (200,000 m 2 ) were acquired from local natives of the Powhatan Confederacy in exchange for 10,000 pounds of tobacco. The House of Burgesses established the "Towne of Lower Norfolk County" in 1680.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 1691, a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County split to form Norfolk County (included in present-day cities of Norfolk, Chesapeake , and parts of Portsmouth ) and Princess Anne County (present-day Virginia Beach ).

[ citation needed ] Norfolk was incorporated in 1705. In 1730, a tobacco inspection site was located here. According to the Tobacco Inspection Act , the inspection was "At Norfolk Town, upon the fort land, in the County of Norfolk; and Kemp's Landing , in Princess Anne, under one inspection." In 1736 George II granted it a royal charter as a borough.

[ 11 ] It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond.

[ citation needed ] A cannonball lodged in the wall of St. Paul's Episcopal Church , fired by Lord Dunmore 's fleet during the Revolutionary War Mercantile ties with the British Empire bolstered Norfolk's base of Loyalist support during the early part of the American Revolution but were insufficient to allow the Royal Governor of Virginia John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore to make Norfolk his new capital after fleeing Williamsburg in 1775. On New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for more than eight hours. The gunfire, combined with fires started by the British and spread by the Patriots, destroyed more than 800 buildings, constituting nearly two-thirds of the city. Patriot forces destroyed the remaining buildings for strategic reasons the following month. Ultimately, Colonel Woodford drove Dunmore into exile, ending more than 168 years of British rule in Virginia.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Only the walls of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church survived the bombardment and subsequent fires. A cannonball from the bombardment (fired by the Liverpool ) remains within the wall of Saint Paul's.

[ 14 ] Nineteenth century [ edit ] Norfolk, from Gosport, Virginia , New York Public Library Following recovery from the Revolutionary War's burning, Norfolk and its citizens struggled to rebuild. In 1804, another serious fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback. In the War of 1812 between America and Great Britain, Norfolk saw action between American militia led by Richard Lawson and the British navy. On July 13, 1813. A British landing party of 8 marines and 16 sailors landed at the beaches of Norfolk to construct a well and gather water. Richard Lawson concealed his company of militia behind a benign looking sandhill. Richard Lawson and his militia sprang their ambush by opening fire from their concealment behind the Sandhills. The British landing party who suffered three marines killed surrendered. Richard Lawson, who suffered none killed, had his militia destroy the British boat, take all provisions, and take the brass cannon. The American militia under Lawson returned to town with their prisoners.

[ 15 ] During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the American South suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the Piedmont , or further into Kentucky and Tennessee . This migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to tobacco cultivation in the Tidewater, where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations.

[ citation needed ] Virginia made some attempts to phase out slavery and manumissions increased in the two decades following the war.

Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state. However, by that time the increased demand from the settlement of the lower South states had created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the cotton gin in the late-eighteenth century had made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely practiced.

[ citation needed ] Joseph Jenkins Roberts , born and raised in Norfolk, became the first president of Liberia The American Colonization Society proposed to " repatriate " free blacks and freed slaves to Africa by establishing the new colony of Liberia and paying for transportation. But most African Americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the United States and achieve freedom and rights there. For a period, many emigrants to Liberia from Virginia and North Carolina embarked from the port of Norfolk.

Joseph Jenkins Roberts , a free person of color native to Norfolk, emigrated via the American Colonization Society and later was elected as the first president of Liberia , establishing a powerful family.

[ 16 ] In 1845, Norfolk was incorporated as a city.

[ 17 ] On June 7, 1855, the 183-foot vessel Benjamin Franklin put into Hampton Roads for repairs. The ship had just sailed from the West Indies , where there had been an outbreak of yellow fever . The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so it was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth.

[ 18 ] As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead.

[ 19 ] It took the city some time to recover.

Battle of Hampton Roads between the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia On April 4, 1861, Norfolk city delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention , George Blow, voted against secession. Following the Battle of Fort Sumter , another vote occurred on April 17, where Blow voted for secession, the vote passed and Virginia seceded from the Union . In the spring of 1862, the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city's Sewell's Point Peninsula , marking the first fight between two ironclads , the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia . The battle ended in a stalemate but changed the course of naval warfare; from then on, warships were fortified with metal.

[ 20 ] In May 1862, Norfolk Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city to Union General John E. Wool and his forces. They held the city under martial law for the duration of the Civil War. Thousands of slaves from the region escaped to Union lines to gain freedom; they quickly set up schools in Norfolk to start learning how to read and write, years before the end of the war.

[ 21 ] 20th century to present [ edit ] Granby Street from corner of City Hall Avenue, 1915 1907 brought both the Virginian Railway and the Jamestown Exposition to Sewell's Point . The large Naval Review at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location and laid the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Southern Democrats in Congress gained its location here. Commemorating the tricentennial anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition featured many prominent officials, including President Theodore Roosevelt , members of Congress , and diplomats from twenty-one countries. By 1917, as the US prepared to enter World War I , the Naval Air Station Hampton Roads had been constructed on the former exposition grounds.

[ 22 ] In the first half of the twentieth century, the city of Norfolk expanded its borders through annexation. In 1906, the city annexed the incorporated town of Berkley , making the city cross the Elizabeth River .

[ 23 ] In 1923, the city expanded to include Sewell's Point, Willoughby Spit , the town of Campostella, and the Ocean View area. The city included the Navy Base and miles of beach property fronting on Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay .

[ 24 ] After a smaller annexation in 1959, and a 1988 land swap with Virginia Beach , the city assumed its current boundaries.

[ 25 ] The establishment of the Interstate Highway System following World War II brought new highways to the region. A series of bridges and tunnels, constructed during fifteen years, linked Norfolk with the Peninsula , Portsmouth , and Virginia Beach . In 1952, the Downtown Tunnel opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. The highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs, leading to the population spreading out. Additional bridges and tunnels included the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1957, [ 26 ] the Midtown Tunnel in 1962, [ 27 ] and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway ( Interstate 264 and State Route 44 ) in 1967.

[ 28 ] In 1991, the new Downtown Tunnel / Berkley Bridge complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.

[ 29 ] In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional , as the public system was supported by all taxpayers. It ordered integration , but Virginia pursued a policy of " massive resistance ". (At this time, most black citizens were still disfranchised under the state's turn-of-the-century constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration and elections.) The Virginia General Assembly prohibited state funding for integrated public schools.

[ citation needed ] In 1958, United States district courts in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, Governor J. Lindsay Almond ordered the schools closed. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals declared the state law to be in conflict with the state constitution and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. About ten days later, Almond capitulated and asked the General Assembly to rescind several "massive resistance" laws.

[ 30 ] In February 1959, seventeen black children entered six previously segregated Norfolk public schools.

[ 31 ] Virginian-Pilot editor Lenoir Chambers editorialized against massive resistance and earned the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing .

[ 32 ] With new suburban developments beckoning, many white middle-class residents moved out of the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.

[ 33 ] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has been based in Norfolk since 1996.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Norfolk's city leaders began a long push to revive its urban core . While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline have been erected. In 1983, the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.

[ 36 ] Waterside was redeveloped in 2017. Additionally, the waterfront area hosts the Nauticus maritime museum and science center , Hampton Roads Naval Museum , Half-Moone Cruise and Celebration Center , and the USS Wisconsin . Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park baseball stadium, home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team. In 1995, the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America .

[ 37 ] Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.

[ 38 ] Geography [ edit ] Newport News , Hampton , Isle of Wight County , Suffolk , Chesapeake , Portsmouth and Norfolk, from space, July 1996. Norfolk is located in the upper-right quadrant; east is at the top.

The city is located at the southeastern corner of Virginia at the junction of the Elizabeth River and the Chesapeake Bay . The Hampton Roads Metropolitan Statistical Area (officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA ) is the 37th largest in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,716,624 in 2014.

[ citation needed ] The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach , Chesapeake , Hampton , Newport News , Poquoson , Portsmouth , Suffolk , Williamsburg , and the counties of Gloucester , Isle of Wight , James City , Mathews , and York , as well as the North Carolina counties of Currituck and Gates . The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and Williamsburg are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb. Additionally, Norfolk is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC Combined Statistical Area , which includes the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA, the Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area , and the Kill Devil Hills, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area. The CSA is the 32nd largest in the nation with an estimated population in 2013 of 1,810,266.

[ citation needed ] In addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the Willoughby Spit and Ocean View communities.

[ citation needed ] Sea level rise and subsidence [ edit ] Population density and elevation above sea level around the Chesapeake Bay . Norfolk is especially vulnerable to sea level rise .

Being low-lying and largely surrounded by water, Norfolk is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change .

[ 39 ] In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding . Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how to address the issue in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the end of this century.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Cityscape [ edit ] See also: List of tallest buildings in Norfolk, Virginia Downtown Norfolk When Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and frame construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide chimneys and thatch roofs . Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style , which was popular in the South at the time, was used.

Brick was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond . This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes . By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.

[ citation needed ] Norfolk was burned down during the Revolutionary War . After the Revolution , Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like New World homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.

[ citation needed ] In the early nineteenth century, Neoclassical architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as ionic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.

[ citation needed ] Greek-style homes gave way to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which emphasized pointed arches , steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival.

Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas , verandas , ornamental brickwork , or corner quoins . Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.

[ citation needed ] High-rise buildings were first built in the late nineteenth century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the twentieth century.

Bungalows and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.

[ citation needed ] As the Great Depression wore on, Art Deco emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta , and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles .

[ citation needed ] Neighborhoods [ edit ] See also: List of neighborhoods in Norfolk, Virginia Taylor-Whittle House (c. 1790), now occupied by the Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach and the Norfolk Historical Society [ 42 ] Norfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods, notably Freemason and West Freemason. Some neighborhoods, such as Berkley , were formerly cities and towns. Others, including Willoughby Spit and Ocean View , have a long history tied to the Chesapeake Bay . The city's revitalization in recent decades has transformed neighborhoods such as Downtown , Ghent and Fairmount Park . Popular residential neighborhoods include Ghent, Colonial Place, Larchmont, North Shore, Edgewater, and Lafayette Shores.

[ 43 ] Climate [ edit ] Narrative below is based on climate data from the 1991–2020 period. Norfolk has a humid subtropical climate , typical of the Southern United States , and its USDA Hardiness Zone is 8a. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summers are consistently warm and humid, but the nearby Atlantic Ocean often exercises a slight cooling effect on daytime high temperatures, but a slight warming effect on nighttime low temperatures (compared to areas farther inland). As such, temperatures reach 90 °F (32 °C) or higher on an average 35 days annually, [ 44 ] and 100 °F (37.8 °C) are uncommon, occurring in fewer than one-third of all years.

[ 45 ] On average, July is the warmest month, with a normal mean temperature of 81.1 °F (27.3 °C).

[ 44 ] On average, July and August are the wettest months, due to frequent summer thunderstorm activity. In August and September, rainfall remains high, due to rising frequency of tropical activity (hurricanes and tropical storms), which can bring high winds and heavy rains. These usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally make landfalls in the area; the highest-risk period is mid-August to the end of September.

Fall is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights. Winter is usually mild in Norfolk, with average winter days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s (8 to 13 °C).

[ 56 ] 2010 census [ edit ] Population age distribution for Norfolk As of the census [ 57 ] of 2010, there were 242,803 people, 86,210 households, and 51,898 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,362.8 people per square mile (1,684.5 people/km 2 ). There were 94,416 dwelling units at an average density of 1,757.3 per square mile (678.5/km 2 ).

[ 64 ] Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Norfolk, Virginia 1888 advertisement for the Market Square A&P Since Norfolk serves as the commercial and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it can be difficult to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole.

[ citation needed ] The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region play an important part in the local economy. As a strategic location at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay , its protected deep-water channels serve as a major trade artery for the import and export of goods from across the Mid-Atlantic , Mid-West , and internationally.

[ citation needed ] Nauticus and USS Wisconsin In addition to commercial activities, Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the United States Navy , and Norfolk serves as the home for Naval Station Norfolk , the world's largest naval installation. Located on Sewell's Point Peninsula , in the northwest corner of the city, the station is the headquarters of the United States Fleet Forces Command (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), which compromises over 62,000 active-duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft. The base also serves as the headquarters to NATO 's Allied Command Transformation .

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] The region also plays an important role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair , General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth . Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.

[ 67 ] After the military, the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and is home to the world's largest and fastest container cranes.

[ 68 ] Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.

[ 69 ] In addition to NIT, Norfolk is home to the Lambert's Point docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, [ citation needed ] with an annual capacity of approximately 48,000,000 tons.

[ 70 ] Bituminous coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia , and Kentucky . The coal is loaded onto trains and sent to the port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.

[ citation needed ] Between 1925 and 2007, Ford Motor Company operated Norfolk Assembly , a manufacturing plant located on the Elizabeth River that had produced the Model-T, sedans and station wagons before building F-150 pick-up trucks.

[ 71 ] Before it closed, the plant employed more than 2,600 people at the 2,800,000 sq ft (260,000 m 2 ) facility.

[ 71 ] The Norfolk World Trade Center Most major shipping lines have a permanent presence in the region with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk. In addition, many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters. These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center office park . The French firm CMA CGM , the Israeli firm Zim Integrated Shipping Services , and Maersk Line Limited , a subsidiary of the world's largest shipping line, A. P. Moller-Maersk Group , have their North American headquarters in Norfolk.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Major companies headquartered in Norfolk include Norfolk Southern , [ 75 ] Landmark Communications , [ 76 ] Dominion Enterprises , [ 77 ] FHC Health Systems (parent company of ValueOptions ), [ 78 ] Portfolio Recovery Associates, [ 79 ] and BlackHawk Products Group.

[ 80 ] Half Moone Cruise & Celebration Center Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier.

[ 81 ] Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.

[ 82 ] Hampton Roads is home to four Fortune 500 companies. Representing the food industry, transportation, retail and shipbuilding, these four companies are located in Smithfield , Norfolk, Chesapeake and Newport News .

2013 Fortune 500 Corporations [ 83 ] 213 Smithfield Foods 247 Norfolk Southern 346 Dollar Tree 380 Huntington Ingalls Industries 26% of the 130,000 people working in Norfolk live in the city, while 74% commute in. 37% of those come from Virginia Beach and 20% come from Chesapeake. An additional 51,575 people commute outside for work, with 35% going to Virginia Beach and 20% going to Chesapeake.

Museums and galleries [ edit ] The nationally acclaimed Chrysler Museum of Art , the area's most comprehensive art museum, has its campus at the intersection of the Ghent district , the Freemason neighborhood, and the NEON district.

[ 85 ] Since opening in 1933, the museum's main building has been expanded six times to allow for larger glass galleries, generous space for Impressionist and Baroque works, and more. Major improvements were completed in 2014, and today the museum features more than 50 galleries, a restaurant, and catering facilities, as well as galleries for traveling exhibits.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Of particular note are the American neoclassical marble sculptures, the extensive glass collection, and the Glass Studio, which has live demonstrations daily.

[ 88 ] The Chrysler Museum of Art also administers the 1792 Moses Myers House Museum in the Freemason District, next to MacArthur Mall. This museum interprets Norfolk's history and the lives and legacy of Norfolk's first Jewish family. Seventy percent of the objects in the home are original to the Myers in the early nineteenth century.

[ 89 ] The museum offers weekend tours and special monthly programming. In October 2022, the council of City of Norfolk, which owns the property, voted to proceed with the possibility of selling it, conjecturing the entirety of the property—the main house, the attached dwelling of the Myers’ enslaved servants, and the historic garden—could be sold as part of a package to developers, perhaps to operate as a bed and breakfast.

[ 90 ] Multiple entities, including the Norfolk Historical Society, have expressed distress and outrage.

The Hermitage Foundation Museum , located in an early 20th-century Tudor-style home on a 12-acre (49,000 m 2 ) estate fronting the Lafayette River , is found in the Lochaven neighborhood near the northern terminus of the Elizabeth River Trail that connects many of the city's sites of cultural interest.
