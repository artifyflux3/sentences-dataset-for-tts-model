Biography [ edit ] Ignazio Ciufolini graduated magna cum laude in 1980 at Sapienza University of Rome, and received a PhD in physics in 1984 at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Richard Matzner .

[ 1 ] From 1982 to 1988, he worked at University of Texas at Austin as a teaching assistant, lecturer and research associate. As of 2014, he is an associate professor of general physics at University of Salento (Italy), [ 2 ] tenured since 1999, and a member of Centro Fermi, Rome.

[ 3 ] He collaborated with John Archibald Wheeler in 1995 to write Gravitation and Inertia , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] for which they won the PROSE Award for the best professional and scholar book in physics and astronomy.

[ 6 ] He works mainly in the field of General Relativity and Gravitational Physics, proposing a method to measure the effects of gravitomagnetism using the data from the laser ranged satellites LAGEOS and LAGEOS-2.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] He was featured on the cover of the 6 September 2007, issue of Nature , dedicated to his review paper on Dragging of Inertial Frames and General Relativity.

[ 7 ] He is the Principal Investigator for the Italian Space Agency (ASI) on the Laser Relativity Satellite ( LARES ) mission, a space mission aimed to improve the accuracy of the measurement of frame-dragging .

[ citation needed ] In 2010, he won the Giuseppe Occhialini Medal and Prize , jointly awarded by the Italian Physical Society and the Institute of Physics .

[ 10 ] In 2014, Ciufolini was accused of publishing papers on the scientific pre-print archive arXiv.org under pseudonyms, such as G. Felici [ 11 ] and G. Forst, [ 12 ] which is a violation of the arXiv terms, but the accusation was later retracted.
