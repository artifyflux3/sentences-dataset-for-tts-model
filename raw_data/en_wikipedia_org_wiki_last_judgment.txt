The final judgment of sinners by [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"); carving on the central portal of [Amiens Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiens_Cathedral "Amiens Cathedral"), France.

The **Last Judgment**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-1)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-2) is a concept found across the [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions "Abrahamic religions") and the _[Frashokereti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frashokereti "Frashokereti")_ of [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism").

[Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") considers the [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") of [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus") to entail the final judgment by [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Abrahamic_religions "God in Abrahamic religions") of all people who have ever lived,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-3) resulting in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") of a few and the [damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") of many. Some Christian denominations believe [most people will be saved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_universalism "Christian universalism"), some believe [most people will be damned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Calvinism "Predestination in Calvinism"), and some believe [the number of the saved and of the damned is unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Catholicism "Predestination in Catholicism"). The concept of the Last Judgment is found in all the [canonical gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_gospels "Canonical gospels"), particularly in the [Gospel of Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"). The Christian tradition is also followed by [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam"), where it is mentioned in many chapters of the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran"), according to some interpretations.

The Last Judgment has inspired numerous artistic depictions, including painting, sculpture and evangelical work.

In [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism"), beliefs vary. [Rosh HaShanah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_HaShanah "Rosh HaShanah") is sometimes referred to as a 'day of judgement', but it is not conceptualized as _the_ Day of Judgement. Some rabbis hold that there will be a future day following the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead#Judaism "Resurrection of the dead"). Others hold that the final accounting and judgment happens when one dies.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Still others hold that the Last Judgment applies to only the [gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentiles "Gentiles"), not the [Jewish People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_People "Jewish People").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-4) The [Babylonian Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Talmud "Babylonian Talmud") has a lengthy passage describing the future Judgement Day.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-5)

The [doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_doctrine "Christian doctrine") and [iconographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_iconography "Christian iconography") depiction of the Last Judgment are drawn from many passages from the [apocalyptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature "Apocalyptic literature") sections of the Bible, but most notably from Jesus' teaching of the [narrow gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_7:13 "Matthew 7:13") in the [Gospel of Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") and in the [Gospel of Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke").

#### Salvation and damnation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Last_Judgment&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Salvation and damnation")]

In Christianity, there are three main beliefs about who will be saved (go to heaven) and who will be damned (go to hell) on Judgment Day. All three beliefs are based on biblical interpretation and Christian tradition.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-7)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-8)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-9)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-10)

Some Christians who believe in universal salvation say most people and angels will go to heaven on Judgment Day.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-11) Some Christians who believe in double predestination say most people and angels will go to hell on Judgment Day.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-12) Other Christians who disbelieve in universal salvation and double predestination say the number of the saved and of the damned on Judgment Day is unknown.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-13)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-14)

#### Anglicanism and Methodism

_Article IV – Of the Resurrection of Christ_ in Anglicanism's [Articles of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Nine_Articles "Thirty-Nine Articles") and _Article III – Of the Resurrection of Christ_ of Methodism's [Articles of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Religion_(Methodist) "Articles of Religion (Methodist)") state that:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-AnglicanArticles-15)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-MethodistArticles-16)

> Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to judge all Men at the last day.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-AnglicanArticles-15)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-MethodistArticles-16)

[Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_doctrine "Anglican doctrine") and [Methodist theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_theology "Methodist theology") holds that "there is an [intermediate state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_state_(Christianity) "Intermediate state (Christianity)") between death and the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead"), in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-17)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-18) This space, termed [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_in_Christianity "Hades in Christianity"), is divided into [Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise "Paradise") (the [Bosom of Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosom_of_Abraham "Bosom of Abraham")) and [Gehenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") "but with an impassable gulf between the two".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Cook1883-19)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-20)[Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_in_the_Bible "Soul in the Bible") remain in Hades until the Last Judgment and "Christians may also improve in holiness after death during the middle state before the final judgment".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Shields2009-21)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Crowther1813-22)

Anglican and Methodist theology holds that at the time of the [Last Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology "Eschatology"), "Jesus [will return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") and that He will 'judge both the quick [the living] and the dead',"[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Campbell2011-23) and "all [will] be bodily resurrected and stand before Christ as our Judge. After the Judgment, the Righteous will go to their eternal reward in [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(Christianity) "Heaven (Christianity)"), and the Accursed will depart to [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_hell "Christian views on hell") (see [Matthew 25](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Matthew#25:1 "s:Bible (King James)/Matthew"))."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-24) The "issue of this judgment shall be a permanent separation of the evil and the good, the righteous and the wicked" (see [The Sheep and the Goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats "The Sheep and the Goats")).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-25)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-StuartChappell1922-26) Moreover, in "the final judgment every one of our thoughts, words, and deeds will be known and judged," and individuals will be [justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(theology) "Justification (theology)") on the basis of their [faith in Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_again_(Christianity)#Methodism_and_other_Evangelicals "Born again (Christianity)"). However, "[our works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide#Methodist_view "Sola fide") will not escape God's examination."[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Campbell2011-23)

_[The Last Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Last\_Judgment\_(Michelangelo) "The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)")_, [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel "Sistine Chapel") by [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo") (1536–1541)

Belief in the Last Judgment (often linked with the [general judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_judgment "General judgment")) is held firmly in [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). Immediately upon death, each person undergoes the [particular judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular_judgment "Particular judgment"), and depending upon one's behavior on earth, goes to [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven"), [purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory"), or [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell"). Those in purgatory will always reach heaven, but those in hell will be there eternally.

The Last Judgment will occur after the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead"), and "our 'mortal body' will come to life again."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-27) The Catholic Church teaches that at the time of the Last Judgment [Christ will come in His glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming_of_Christ "Second Coming of Christ"), and all the [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels "Angels") with him, and in his presence the truth of each one's deeds will be laid bare. Each person who has ever lived will be judged with perfect justice. The believers who are deemed worthy as well as those ignorant of Christ's teaching who followed the dictates of conscience[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-28) will go to everlasting bliss; those who are judged unworthy will go to everlasting condemnation.

A decisive factor in the Last Judgment will be the question, were the corporal [works of mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_of_mercy "Works of mercy") practiced or not during one's lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 25:31–46), the conjunction of the Last Judgment and the [works of mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_of_mercy "Works of mercy") is frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-29)

Before the Last Judgment, all will be resurrected. Those who were in purgatory will have already been purged, meaning they would have already been released into heaven, and so like those in heaven and hell will resurrect with their bodies, followed by the Last Judgment.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-30)

According to the [Catechism of the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church "Catechism of the Catholic Church"):

> 1038 The resurrection of all the dead, "of both the just and the unjust" (Acts 24:15), will precede the Last Judgment. This will be "the hour when all who are in the tombs will hear [the Son of man's] voice and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment" (Jn 5:28–29) Then Christ will come "in his glory, and all the angels with him... . Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left... . And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Mt 25:31, 32, 46).
> 
> 
> 1039 In the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of each man's relationship with God will be laid bare (Cf. Jn 12:49). The Last Judgment will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life.
> 
> 
> 1040 The Last Judgment will come when Christ returns in glory. Only the Father knows the day and the hour; only he determines the moment of its coming. Then through his Son Jesus Christ he will pronounce the final word on all history. We shall know the ultimate meaning of the whole work of creation and of the entire economy of salvation and understand the marvelous ways by which his Providence led everything towards its final end. The Last Judgment will reveal that God's justice triumphs over all the injustices committed by his creatures and that God's love is stronger than death. (Cf. Song 8:6)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-31)

— Catechism of the Catholic Church

The Eastern Orthodox and Catholic teachings of the Last Judgment differ only on the exact nature of the in-between state of [purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory")/[Abraham's Bosom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%27s_Bosom "Abraham's Bosom"). These differences may only be apparent and not actual due to differing theological terminology and evolving tradition.

The [Eastern Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") teaches that there are two judgments: the first, or particular judgment, is that experienced by each individual at the time of his or her death, at which time God will decide where[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-32) one is to spend the time until the [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Christ (see [Hades in Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_in_Christianity "Hades in Christianity")). This judgment is generally believed to occur on the fortieth day after death. The second, [General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_judgment "General judgment") or Final Judgment will occur after the Second Coming.

Although in modern times some have attempted to introduce the concept of [soul sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_sleep "Soul sleep") into Orthodox thought about life after death, it has never been a part of traditional Orthodox teaching, and it contradicts the Orthodox understanding of the [intercession of the Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercession_of_saints "Intercession of saints").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that salvation is bestowed by God as a free gift of [divine grace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_grace "Divine grace"), which cannot be earned, and by which forgiveness of sins is available to all. However, the deeds done by each person are believed to affect how he will be judged, following the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats. How forgiveness is to be balanced against behavior is not well-defined in scripture, judgment in the matter being solely Christ's.

Similarly, although Orthodoxy teaches that sole salvation is obtained only through Christ and his Church, the fate of those outside the Church at the Last Judgment is left to the [mercy of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_of_God "Mercy of God") and is not declared.

[Viktor Vasnetsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Vasnetsov "Viktor Vasnetsov")'s _The Last Judgment_, 1904

The theme of the Last Judgment is important in Orthodoxy. Traditionally, an Orthodox church will have a [fresco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco "Fresco") or [mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic "Mosaic") of the Last Judgment on the back (western) wall so that the faithful, as they leave the services, are reminded that they will be judged by what they do during earthly life.

The [icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon "Icon") of the Last Judgment traditionally depicts [Christ Pantokrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Pantokrator "Christ Pantokrator"), enthroned in glory on a white throne, surrounded by the [Theotokos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theotokos "Theotokos") (Virgin Mary), [John the Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist"), the [Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles_in_the_New_Testament "Apostles in the New Testament"), [saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint "Saint") and [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel "Angel"). Beneath the throne the scene is divided in half with the "mansions of the righteous" ([John 14:2](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John#14:2 "s:Bible (King James)/John")), i.e., those who have been [saved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation "Salvation"), to Jesus' right (the viewer's left), and the torments of those who have been [damned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation "Damnation") to his left. Separating the two is the [river of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire "Lake of fire") which proceeds from Jesus' left foot. For more detail, see below.

The theme of the Last Judgement is found in the [funeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral "Funeral") and [memorial hymnody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannikhida "Pannikhida") of the Church, and is a major theme in the services during [Great Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lent "Great Lent"). The second Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent is dedicated to the Last Judgement. It is also found in the hymns of the [Octoechos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octoechos_(liturgy) "Octoechos (liturgy)") used on Saturdays throughout the year.

There were many renditions of the Last Judgment completed by Greek painters living in Crete which was held by the Venetian Empire. Most of the works of art were influenced by Venetian painting but were considered to be painted in the [Maniera Greca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Byzantine "Italo-Byzantine").

[Georgios Klontzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Klontzas "Georgios Klontzas") painted many triptychs featuring the Last Judgment some include _[The Last Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Last\_Judgment\_(Klontzas) "The Last Judgment (Klontzas)")_, _[The Last Judgement Triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Last\_Judgement\_Triptych\_(Klontzas) "The Last Judgement Triptych (Klontzas)")_, and _[The Triptych of the Last Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych\_of\_the\_Last\_Judgement\_(Klontzas) "Triptych of the Last Judgement (Klontzas)")_. Klontzas was the forerunner of a new painting style.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-core-33)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHatzidakisDrakopoulou199789%E2%80%9391-34)

Other Greek painters followed the precedent set by Klontzas. [Theodore Poulakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Poulakis "Theodore Poulakis") added the last judgment to his rendition of Klontzas' _[In Thee Rejoiceth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_Thee\_Rejoiceth\_(Poulakis) "In Thee Rejoiceth (Poulakis)")_. The painter incorporated the Last Judgement into one of Klontzas' earlier works entitled _[In Thee Rejoiceth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_Thee\_Rejoiceth\_(Klontzas) "In Thee Rejoiceth (Klontzas)")_. Poulakis paid homage to the father of the Last Judgement style.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHatzidakisDrakopoulou1997304%E2%80%93317-35)[Leos Moskos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Moskos "Leos Moskos") and [Francheskos Kavertzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franghias_Kavertzas "Franghias Kavertzas") also followed the outline for the stylistic representation of the Last Judgement set by Klontzas.

### Esoteric Christian traditions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Last_Judgment&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Esoteric Christian traditions")]

Although the Last Judgment is believed by a great part of Christian mainstream churches; some members of [Esoteric Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_Christianity "Esoteric Christianity") traditions like the [Rosicrucians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian "Rosicrucian"), the [Spiritualist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(religious_movement) "Spiritualism (religious movement)"), and some [liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_theism "Liberal theism") instead believe in a form of [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism "Universalism")[salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation "Salvation").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Max Heindel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Heindel "Max Heindel"), a Danish-American astrologer and mystic, taught that when the [Day of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming_of_Christ "Second Coming of Christ") comes, marking the end of the current fifth or Aryan epoch, the human race will have to pass a final examination or last judgment, where, as in the _Days of Noah_,[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-58) the chosen ones or pioneers, the _sheep_, will be separated from the _goats_ or stragglers,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-59) by being carried forward into the next evolutionary period, inheriting the [ethereal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheric_plane "Etheric plane") conditions of the [New Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Galilee_(Sixth_Epoch) "New Galilee (Sixth Epoch)") in the making. Nevertheless, it is emphasized that all beings of the human [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_evolution "Spiritual evolution") will ultimately be saved in a distant future as they acquire a superior grade of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") and [altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism "Altruism"). At the present period, the process of human evolution is conducted by means of successive [rebirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation") in the physical world[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-60) and the salvation is seen as being mentioned in [Revelation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_3 "Revelation 3"):12 ([KJV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KJV "KJV")), which states "Him that overcometh will I make a _pillar_ in the temple of my God and _he shall go no more out_". However, this western esoteric tradition states – like those who have had a [near-death experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience "Near-death experience") – that after the [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death "Death") of the physical body, at the end of each physical lifetime and after the [life review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_review "Life review") period (which occurs before the [silver cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_cord "Silver cord") is broken), a judgment occurs, more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one's [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life"), where the life of the subject is fully evaluated and scrutinized.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-61) This judgment is seen as being mentioned in [Hebrews 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews_9 "Hebrews 9"):27, which states that "it is appointed unto men once to die, but _after this the judgment_".

[Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg "Emanuel Swedenborg") (1688–1772) had a revelation that the church has gone through a series of Last Judgments. First, during Noah's Flood, then Moses on Mount Sinai, Jesus' crucifixion, and finally in 1757, which is the final Last Judgment. These occur in a realm outside earth and heaven, and are spiritual in nature.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-62)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-63)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-64)

### The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Last_Judgment&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints")]

[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints") (LDS Church) teaches that the last judgment for each individual occurs after that individual has been resurrected.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] People will be judged by Jesus Christ.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-gp-65) Jesus' [twelve apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_apostles "Twelve apostles") will help judge the [twelve tribes of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_tribes_of_Israel "Twelve tribes of Israel") and the twelve [Nephite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephite "Nephite") disciples from the [Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon "Book of Mormon") will help to judge the Nephite and [Lamanite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite "Lamanite") people.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-gp-65)

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that people will be judged by their words, their works, their thoughts, and the intents of their hearts.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-gp-65) Records that have been kept in heaven and on earth will also be used to judge people.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-gp-65) Jesus Christ will act as the advocate for people who had faith in him and such people will enter God's presence based on Jesus' merits as opposed to their own.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-66)

After the final judgment, an individual is assigned to one of the [three degrees of glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_degrees_of_glory "Three degrees of glory").

Armenian manuscript depicts the Last Judgment, 1679.

In art, the Last Judgment is a common theme in medieval and renaissance religious iconography. Like most early iconographic innovations, its origins stem from [Byzantine art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_art "Byzantine art"), although it was a less common subject than in the West during the Middle Ages.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-67) In Western Christianity, it is often the subject depicted in medieval cathedrals and churches, either outside on the central [tympanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment "Pediment") of the entrance or inside on the (rear) west wall, so that the congregation attending church saw the image on either entering or leaving.

In the 15th century it also appeared as the central section of a [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych "Triptych") on [altarpieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altarpiece "Altarpiece"), with the side panels showing heaven and hell, as in the [Beaune Altarpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaune_Altarpiece "Beaune Altarpiece") or a [triptych by Hans Memling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Judgment_(Memling) "The Last Judgment (Memling)"). The usual composition has Christ seated high in the centre, flanked by angels, the [Virgin Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Mary "Virgin Mary"), and [John the Evangelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Evangelist "John the Evangelist") who are supplicating on behalf of those being judged (in what is called a [Deesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deesis "Deesis") group in Orthodoxy). [Saint Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michael "Saint Michael") is often shown, either weighing the deceased on scales or directing matters, and there might be a large crowd of saints, angels, and the saved around the central group.

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Second_Coming_by_G.Klontzas_%2816th_c.%29.jpg/330px-Second_Coming_by_G.Klontzas_%2816th_c.%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Second_Coming_by_G.Klontzas_(16th_c.).jpg)

_[The Last Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Last\_Judgment\_(Klontzas) "The Last Judgment (Klontzas)")_ by [Georgios Klontzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Klontzas "Georgios Klontzas") late 1500s

At the bottom of the composition a crowd of the deceased are shown, often with some rising from their graves. These are being sorted and directed by angels into the saved and the damned. Almost always the saved are on the viewer's left (so on the right hand of Christ), and the damned on the right. The saved are led up to [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven"), often shown as a [fortified gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortified_gateway "Fortified gateway"), while the damned are handed over to devils who herd them down into [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") on the right; the composition therefore has a circular pattern of movement. Often the damned disappear into a [Hellmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellmouth "Hellmouth"), the mouth of a huge monster, an image of [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_art "Anglo-Saxon art") origin. The damned often include figures of high rank, wearing crowns, mitres, and often the [Papal tiara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_tiara "Papal tiara") during the lengthy periods when there were [antipopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipopes "Antipopes"), or in Protestant depictions. There may be detailed depictions of the torments of the damned.

Last Judgment (Russia, 18th century)

The most famous Renaissance depiction is [Michelangelo Buonarroti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Buonarroti "Michelangelo Buonarroti")'s [_The Last Judgment_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Judgment_(Michelangelo) "The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)") in the [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel "Sistine Chapel"). Included in this fresco is his self-portrait, as [St. Bartholomew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew "Bartholomew")'s [flayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaying "Flaying") skin.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-68)

The image in [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")[icons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon "Icon") has a similar composition, but usually less space is devoted to hell, and there are often a larger number of scenes; the Orthodox readiness to label figures with inscriptions often allows more complex compositions. There is more often a large group of saints around Christ (which may include animals), and the [hetoimasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetoimasia "Hetoimasia") or "empty throne", containing a cross, is usually shown below Christ, often guarded by archangels; figures representing [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve "Adam and Eve") may kneel below it or below Christ. A distinctive feature of the Orthodox composition, especially in Russian icons, is a large band leading like a chute from the feet of Christ down to hell; this may resemble a striped snake or be a "river of Fire" coloured flame red. If it is shown as a snake, it attempts to bite Adam on the heel but, as he is protected by Christ, is unsuccessful.

Belief in Judgment Day ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): یوم القيامة, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"):_Yawm al-qiyāmah_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'Day of Resurrection' or [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): یوم الدین, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"):_Yawm ad-din_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'Day of Judgement') is considered a fundamental tenet of faith by all Muslims. It is one of the [six articles of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_six_articles_of_Islamic_faith "The six articles of Islamic faith"). The trials and tribulations associated with it are detailed in both the Quran and the [hadith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith "Hadith"), (sayings of [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad")), from whence they are elaborated on in the creeds, Quranic commentaries ([tafsịrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir "Tafsir")), and theological writing,[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-JISYYHIU1981:vii-69) eschatological manuals, whose authors include [al-Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali "Al-Ghazali"), [Ibn Kathir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Kathir "Ibn Kathir"), [Ibn Majah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Majah "Ibn Majah"), [Muhammad al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari "Muhammad al-Bukhari"), and [Ibn Khuzaymah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khuzaymah "Ibn Khuzaymah").

According to some Islamic teachings, there are two categories of heaven: those who go directly to it and those who enter it after enduring some torment in hell; Also, the people of hell are of two categories: those who stay there temporarily and those who stay there forever.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Similarities to the Judgement Day of Christianity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Last_Judgment&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Similarities to the Judgement Day of Christianity")]

Like Christianity, [Islamic eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology "Islamic eschatology") has a time of tribulation preceding Judgement Day where strange and terrible events will serve as portents; there will be a second coming of [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam "Jesus in Islam") (but in different roles); battles with an [AntiChrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AntiChrist "AntiChrist") (Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, literally "Deceitful Messiah"[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Farhang_Dajjal_2017-71)) and struggles with [Gog and Magog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog "Gog and Magog"); and a [Rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture")-like removal of all righteous believers before the end. A "[Day of Resurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Resurrection "Day of Resurrection")" of the dead (_yawm al-qiyāmah_), will be announced by a trumpet blast.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Amini-trumpet-72) Resurrection will be followed by a "Day of Judgment" (_yawm ad-din_) where all human beings who have ever lived will be held accountable for their deeds by being judged by God. Depending on the verdict of the judgement, they will be sent for eternity to either the reward of paradise (_[Jannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah "Jannah")_) or the punishment of hell (_[Jahannam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahannam "Jahannam")_).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Ahmed-73)

### Salvation and damnation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Last_Judgment&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Salvation and damnation")]

In this process, the souls will traverse over hellfire[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-74) via the bridge of [sirat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Sir%C4%81t "As-Sirāt"). For sinners, the bridge will be thinner than hair and sharper than the sharpest sword, impossible to walk on without falling below to arrive at their fiery destination,[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Leviton-75) while the righteous will proceed across the bridge to paradise (_[Jannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah "Jannah")_).

Not everyone consigned to hell will remain there. Somewhat like the Catholic concept of [purgatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory "Purgatory"), sinful Muslims will stay in hell until purified of their sins. According to the scholar Al-Subki (and others), "God will take out of the Fire everyone who has said the testimony" (i.e. the _shāhada_ testimony made by all Muslims, "There is no deity but The God") "and none will remain to save those who rejected or worshipped other than God."[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-76)

Literal or figurative interpretation
While early Muslims debated whether scripture on Judgement day should be interpreted literally or figuratively, the school of thought that prevailed ([Ashʿarī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash%27ari "Ash'ari")) "affirmed that such things as the individual records of deeds (including the paper, pen, and ink with which they are inscribed), the bridge, the balance, and the pond are realities to be understood in a concrete and literal sense."[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-JISYYHIU1981:65-77)

In [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism"), there is no day of judgement as such. Jains believe, however, that as the 5th era comes to an end, evil will increase and the religion and good will decrease. Only four [Jains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jains "Jains") will remain in the world: a monk, a female monk, a [shravak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravak "Shravak") and a shravika. A deity from the heavens will descend upon the earth and gather them, and ask them to take "Anshan", or vow to fast (without any food or water) until death.

_Frashokereti_ is the [Zoroastrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrian "Zoroastrian") doctrine of a final renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God ([Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda")).

The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this." Thus, each human bears responsibility for their own fate, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-Boyce-78)

In [Yarsanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarsanism "Yarsanism") is a belief that people [reincarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation") until the Day of Resurrection when the last reincarnation occurs and pious people will be separated from sinful. God will forgive sins of pious souls and they will be rewarded with two paradises to which they will be sent according to what they look for. If they look for worldly pleasures, they will be sent to a mortal paradise, where they will perish one day. If they look for the [mystical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") joy, then they will be sent to the immortal paradise, where they will live in the presence of God. Sinners will go to hell.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-:0-79)

In English, _crack of doom_ is an old term used for the Day of Judgment, referring in particular to the blast of trumpets signalling the end of the world in Chapter 8 of the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"). A "crack" had the sense of any loud noise, preserved in the phrase "crack of thunder",[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment#cite_note-80) and "doom" was a term for the Last Judgment, as [Eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology "Eschatology") still is.

The phrase is famously used by [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") in _[Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth "Macbeth")_, where on the heath the [Three Witches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Witches "Three Witches") show [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_(character) "Macbeth (character)") the line of kings that will issue from [Banquo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquo "Banquo"):

"Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more." (Act 4, scene 1, 112–117)
The meaning was that Banquo's line will endure until the Judgment Day, flattery for King [James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England "James I of England"), who claimed descent from Banquo.

To it the prophets of the Old Testament refer when they speak of the '[Day of the Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Lord "Day of the Lord")' ([Joel 2:31](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Joel%202:31&version=nrsv); [Ezekiel 13:5](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel%2013:5&version=nrsv); 93-231700-6 register Holy BIBLE service name number Jermaine Thomas McCoy 93-231700-6 [Isaiah 2:12](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah%202:12&version=nrsv)), in which the nations will be summoned to judgment by the Fathers. In the New Testament the [Parousia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parousia "Parousia"), or coming of Christ as Judge of the world, is an oft-repeated doctrine. The Saviour Himself not only foretells the event but graphically portrays its circumstances ([Matthew 24:27](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2024:27&version=nrsv) sqq.; SGT john 1:18 Parish all world threw Justice hall Dean Jermaine Thomas McCoy [25:31](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2025:31&version=nrsv) sqq.). The Apostles Malachi peter phophet labour give a most prominent place to this doctrine in their preaching ([Acts 10:42](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Acts%2010:42&version=nrsv); [17:31](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Acts%2017:31&version=nrsv)) and writings ([Romans 2:5–16](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Romans%202:5%E2%80%9316&version=nrsv); [14:10](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Romans%2014:10&version=nrsv); [1 Corinthians 4:5](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Corinthians%204:5&version=nrsv); [2 Corinthians 5:10](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Corinthians%205:10&version=nrsv); [2 Timothy 4:1](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Timothy%204:1&version=nrsv); [2 Thessalonians 1:5](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Thessalonians%201:5&version=nrsv); [James 5:7](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=James%205:7&version=nrsv)). Besides the name Parusia (parousia), or Advent ([1 Corinthians 15:23](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Corinthians%2015:23&version=nrsv); [2 Thessalonians 2:19](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Thessalonians%202:19&version=nrsv)), the Second Coming is also called Epiphany, epiphaneia, or Appearance ([2 Thessalonians 2:8](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Thessalonians%202:8&version=nrsv); [1 Timothy 6:14](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Timothy%206:14&version=nrsv); [2 Timothy 4:1](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Timothy%204:1&version=nrsv); [Titus 2:13](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Titus%202:13&version=nrsv)), and [Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse "Apocalypse") (apokalypsis), or Revelation ([2 Thessalonians 2:7](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Thessalonians%202:7&version=nrsv); [1 Peter 4:13](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Peter%204:13&version=nrsv)). The time of the Second Coming is spoken of as "that Day" ([2 Timothy 4:8](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Timothy%204:8&version=nrsv)), "the day of the Lord" ([1 Thessalonians 5:2](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Thessalonians%205:2&version=nrsv)), "the day of Christ" ([Philemon 1:6](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Philemon%201:6&version=nrsv)), "the day of the Son of Man" ([Luke 17:30](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke%2017:30&version=nrsv)), "the last day" ([John 6:39–40](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=John%206:39%E2%80%9340&version=nrsv)). Belief in the [general judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_judgment "General judgment") has prevailed at all times and in all places within the Church. It is contained as an article of faith in all the ancient creeds: "He ascended into heaven. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead" ([Apostles' Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed "Apostles' Creed")). "The two shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead" ([Nicene Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")). "From thence they shall come to judge the living and the dead, at whose coming all men must rise with their bodies and are to render an account of their deeds" ([Athanasian Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed")). Relying on the authority of [Papias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis "Papias of Hierapolis"), several [Fathers of the church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers "Church Fathers") of the first four centuries advanced the theory of a [thousand years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium "Millennium")' terrestrial reign of Christ with the saints to precede the end of the World. Although this idea is interwoven with the [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_eschatology "Christian eschatology") teachings of those writers, it in no way detracted from their belief in a universal world-judgment. Patristic testimony to this dogma is clear and unanimous."

Daniel Hitt and Thomas Ware. p.[195](https://archive.org/details/atrueandcomplet00crowgoog/page/n209). The Methodists believe in a state of separate spirits after death, a general resurrection, a day of judgment, and a state of eternal happiness and eternal misery. They believe in a state of separate spirits. The bodies of men, after death, return to dust and see corruption; but their souls neither die nor sleep, but have an immortal subsistence, and immediately 'return to God who gave them'. The souls of the righteous, being made perfect, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ in unspeakable felicity, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies.

The third Article of Religion affirms that Christ 'ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until he return to judge all men at the last day.' This statement is consistent with the Apostles' Creed ('from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead') and the Nicene Creed ('He shall come again in glory to judge the living and the dead'). In the end, Christ will be our judge. Wesley's _Sermons_ maintain that at the final judgment every one of our thoughts, words, and deeds will be known and judged. Our justification on 'the last day' will again be by faith in Christ but our works will not escape God's examination.
