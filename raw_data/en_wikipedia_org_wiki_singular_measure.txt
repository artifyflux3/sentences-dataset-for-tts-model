{\displaystyle A.} This is denoted by Œº Œº ‚ä• ‚ä• ŒΩ ŒΩ .

{\displaystyle \mu \perp \nu .} A refined form of Lebesgue's decomposition theorem decomposes a singular measure into a singular continuous measure and a discrete measure . See below for examples.

Examples on R n [ edit ] As a particular case, a measure defined on the Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is called singular , if it is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on this space. For example, the Dirac delta function is a singular measure.

Example.

A discrete measure .

The Heaviside step function on the real line , H ( x ) = d e f { 0 , x < 0 ; 1 , x ‚â• ‚â• 0 ; {\displaystyle H(x)\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}{\begin{cases}0,&x<0;\\1,&x\geq 0;\end{cases}}} has the Dirac delta distribution Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 {\displaystyle \delta _{0}} as its distributional derivative . This is a measure on the real line, a " point mass " at 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} However, the Dirac measure Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 {\displaystyle \delta _{0}} is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure Œª Œª , {\displaystyle \lambda ,} nor is Œª Œª {\displaystyle \lambda } absolutely continuous with respect to Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 : {\displaystyle \delta _{0}:} Œª Œª ( { 0 } ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (\{0\})=0} but Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 ( { 0 } ) = 1 ; {\displaystyle \delta _{0}(\{0\})=1;} if U {\displaystyle U} is any non-empty open set not containing 0, then Œª Œª ( U ) > 0 {\displaystyle \lambda (U)>0} but Œ¥ Œ¥ 0 ( U ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \delta _{0}(U)=0.} Example.

A singular continuous measure.

The Cantor distribution has a cumulative distribution function that is continuous but not absolutely continuous , and indeed its absolutely continuous part is zero: it is singular continuous.

Example.

A singular continuous measure on R 2 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.} The upper and lower Fr√©chet‚ÄìHoeffding bounds are singular distributions in two dimensions.
