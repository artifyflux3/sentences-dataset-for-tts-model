The sum of any triacontagon's interior angles is 5040 degrees.

Regular triacontagon [ edit ] The regular triacontagon is a constructible polygon , by an edge- bisection of a regular pentadecagon , and can also be constructed as a truncated pentadecagon , t{15}. A truncated triacontagon, t{30}, is a hexacontagon , {60}.

One interior angle in a regular triacontagon is 168 degrees, meaning that one exterior angle would be 12°. The triacontagon is the largest regular polygon whose interior angle is the sum of the interior angles of smaller polygons : 168° is the sum of the interior angles of the equilateral triangle (60°) and the regular pentagon (108°).

The area of a regular triacontagon is (with t = edge length ) [ 1 ] A = 15 2 t 2 cot ⁡ ⁡ π π 30 = 15 4 t 2 ( 15 + 3 3 + 2 25 + 11 5 ) {\displaystyle A={\frac {15}{2}}t^{2}\cot {\frac {\pi }{30}}={\frac {15}{4}}t^{2}\left({\sqrt {15}}+3{\sqrt {3}}+{\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {25+11{\sqrt {5}}}}\right)} The inradius of a regular triacontagon is r = 1 2 t cot ⁡ ⁡ π π 30 = 1 4 t ( 15 + 3 3 + 2 25 + 11 5 ) {\displaystyle r={\frac {1}{2}}t\cot {\frac {\pi }{30}}={\frac {1}{4}}t\left({\sqrt {15}}+3{\sqrt {3}}+{\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {25+11{\sqrt {5}}}}\right)} The circumradius of a regular triacontagon is R = 1 2 t csc ⁡ ⁡ π π 30 = 1 2 t ( 2 + 5 + 15 + 6 5 ) {\displaystyle R={\frac {1}{2}}t\csc {\frac {\pi }{30}}={\frac {1}{2}}t\left(2+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {15+6{\sqrt {5}}}}\right)} Construction [ edit ] Regular triacontagon with given circumcircle. D is the midpoint of AM, DC = DF, and CF, which is the side length of the regular pentagon , is E 25 E 1 .  Since 1/30 = 1/5 - 1/6, the difference between the arcs subtended by the sides of a regular pentagon and hexagon (E 25 E 1 and E 25 A) is that of the regular triacontagon, AE 1 .

As 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 , a regular triacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge .

[ 2 ] Symmetry [ edit ] The symmetries of a regular triacontagon as shown with colors on edges and vertices. Lines of reflections are blue through vertices, and purple through edges. Gyrations are given as numbers in the center. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. Subgroup symmetries are connected by colored lines, index 2, 3, and 5.

The regular triacontagon has Dih 30 dihedral symmetry , order 60, represented by 30 lines of reflection. Dih 30 has 7 dihedral subgroups: Dih 15 , (Dih 10 , Dih 5 ), (Dih 6 , Dih 3 ), and (Dih 2 , Dih 1 ). It also has eight more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z 30 , Z 15 ), (Z 10 , Z 5 ), (Z 6 , Z 3 ), and (Z 2 , Z 1 ), with Z n representing π/ n radian rotational symmetry.

John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.

[ 3 ] He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry.

a1 labels no symmetry.

These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular triacontagons. Only the g30 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges .

Dissection [ edit ] 30-gon with 420 rhombs Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2 m -gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m ( m -1)/2 parallelograms.

[ 4 ] In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi.  For the regular triacontagon , m =15, it can be divided into 105: 7 sets of 15 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 15-cube .

Examples Triacontagram [ edit ] A triacontagram is a 30-sided star polygon (though the word is extremely rare). There are 3 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {30/7}, {30/11}, and {30/13}, and 11 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration .

Other truncations form double coverings: t{15/14}={30/14}=2{15/7}, t{15/8}={30/8}=2{15/4}, t{15/4}={30/4}=2{15/4}, and t{15/2}={30/2}=2{15}.
