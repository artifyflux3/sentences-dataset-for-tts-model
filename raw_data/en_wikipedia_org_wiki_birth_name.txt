The term may be applied to the surname , the given name or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person's legal name .

[ 1 ] The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth (or perhaps from baptism or brit milah ) will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairs—either throughout life or until marriage. Some possible changes concern middle names , diminutive forms, changes relating to parental status (due to one's parents' divorce or adoption by different parents), and changes related to gender transition . Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life.

Maiden and married names [ edit ] "De domo" redirects here. For other uses, see De domo (disambiguation) .

The terms née (feminine) and né (masculine; both pronounced / n eɪ / ⓘ ; from French né[e] ' born ' ), adopted into English from French, have been used to indicate a pre-marital or maiden name, or an original birth name that was later changed.

[ 2 ] The term née , having feminine grammatical gender , can be used to denote a woman's surname at birth that has been replaced or changed. In most English-speaking cultures, it is specifically applied to a woman's maiden name after her surname has changed due to marriage .

[ 3 ] The term né , having masculine grammatical gender , can be used to denote a man's surname at birth which has subsequently been replaced or changed.

[ 4 ] The diacritic marks (the acute accent ) are considered significant to its spelling, and ultimately its meaning, but are sometimes omitted.

[ 4 ] According to Oxford University 's Dictionary of Modern English Usage , the terms are typically placed after the current surname (e.g. 'Ann Smith, née Jones' or 'Adam Smith, né Jones').

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] Because they are terms adopted into English from French, they do not have to be italicized , but often are.

[ 5 ] In Polish tradition , the term z domu (in Polish) or de domo (literally meaning "of house" in Latin) may be used, with rare  exceptions meaning the same as née .

[ a ] See also [ edit ] Deadnaming Notes [ edit ] ^ In historical contexts "de domo" may refer to a Polish heraldic clan , e.g., "Paulus de Glownia nobilis de domo Godzamba " (Paul of Glownia noble family, of Godziemba coat of arms ). See also De domo (disambiguation) .

Laws have existed since the French Revolution stating that 'no citizen can use a first name or surname other than that written on their birth certificate' – but many official organisations address both partners by the husband's surname.
