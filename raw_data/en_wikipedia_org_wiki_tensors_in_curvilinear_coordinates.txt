Curvilinear coordinates can be formulated in tensor calculus, with important applications in physics and engineering, particularly for describing transportation of physical quantities and deformation of matter in fluid mechanics and continuum mechanics.

Vector and tensor algebra in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates[edit]
Note: the Einstein summation convention of summing on repeated indices is used below.

Elementary vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates is used in some of the older scientific literature in mechanics and physics and can be indispensable to understanding work from the early and mid 1900s, for example the text by Green and Zerna.[1] Some useful relations in the algebra of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section. The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,[2] Naghdi,[3] Simmonds,[4] Green and Zerna,[1] Basar and Weichert,[5] and Ciarlet.[6]

Coordinate transformations[edit]

Consider two coordinate systems with coordinate variables 
(
𝑍
1
,
𝑍
2
,
𝑍
3
)
 and 
(
𝑍
1
´
,
𝑍
2
´
,
𝑍
3
´
)
, which we shall represent in short as just 
𝑍
𝑖
 and 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 respectively and always assume our index 
𝑖
 runs from 1 through 3. We shall assume that these coordinates systems are embedded in the three-dimensional euclidean space. Coordinates 
𝑍
𝑖
 and 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 may be used to explain each other, because as we move along the coordinate line in one coordinate system we can use the other to describe our position. In this way Coordinates 
𝑍
𝑖
 and 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 are functions of each other

𝑍
𝑖
=
𝑓
𝑖
(
𝑍
1
´
,
𝑍
2
´
,
𝑍
3
´
)
for 
𝑖
=
1
,
2
,
3

which can be written as

𝑍
𝑖
=
𝑍
𝑖
(
𝑍
1
´
,
𝑍
2
´
,
𝑍
3
´
)
=
𝑍
𝑖
(
𝑍
𝑖
´
)
for 
𝑖
´
,
𝑖
=
1
,
2
,
3

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 to 
𝑍
𝑖
. Let us denote this transformation by 
𝑇
. We will therefore represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 to the coordinate system with coordinates 
𝑍
𝑖
 as:

𝑍
=
𝑇
(
𝑧
´
)

Similarly we can represent 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 as a function of 
𝑍
𝑖
 as follows:

𝑍
𝑖
´
=
𝑔
𝑖
´
(
𝑍
1
,
𝑍
2
,
𝑍
3
)
for 
𝑖
´
=
1
,
2
,
3

and we can write the free equations more compactly as

𝑍
𝑖
´
=
𝑍
𝑖
´
(
𝑍
1
,
𝑍
2
,
𝑍
3
)
=
𝑍
𝑖
´
(
𝑍
𝑖
)
for 
𝑖
´
,
𝑖
=
1
,
2
,
3

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from 
𝑍
𝑖
 to 
𝑍
𝑖
´
. Let us denote this transformation by 
𝑆
. We will represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables 
𝑍
𝑖
 to the coordinate system with coordinates 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 as:

𝑧
´
=
𝑆
(
𝑧
)

If the transformation 
𝑇
 is bijective then we call the image of the transformation, namely 
𝑍
𝑖
, a set of admissible coordinates for 
𝑍
𝑖
´
. If 
𝑇
 is linear the coordinate system 
𝑍
𝑖
 will be called an affine coordinate system, otherwise 
𝑍
𝑖
 is called a curvilinear coordinate system.

The Jacobian[edit]

As we now see that the Coordinates 
𝑍
𝑖
 and 
𝑍
𝑖
´
 are functions of each other, we can take the derivative of the coordinate variable 
𝑍
𝑖
 with respect to the coordinate variable 
𝑍
𝑖
´
.

Consider

∂
𝑍
𝑖
∂
𝑍
𝑖
´
=
d
e
f
𝐽
𝑖
´
𝑖
for 
𝑖
´
,
𝑖
=
1
,
2
,
3
, these derivatives can be arranged in a matrix, say 
𝐽
, in which 
𝐽
𝑖
´
𝑖
 is the element in the 
𝑖
-th row and 
𝑖
´
-th column

𝐽
=
(
𝐽

The resultant matrix is called the Jacobian matrix.

Vectors in curvilinear coordinates[edit]

Let 
(
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,
𝑏
3
)
 be an arbitrary basis for three-dimensional Euclidean space. In general, the basis vectors are neither unit vectors nor mutually orthogonal. However, they are required to be linearly independent. Then a vector 
𝑣
 can be expressed as[4]: 27 
𝑣
=
𝑣
𝑘
𝑏
𝑘
The components 
𝑣
𝑘
 are the contravariant components of the vector 
𝑣
.

The reciprocal basis 
(
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,
𝑏
3
)
 is defined by the relation [4]: 28–29 
𝑏
𝑖
⋅
𝑏
𝑗
=
𝛿
𝑗
𝑖
where 
𝛿
𝑗
𝑖
 is the Kronecker delta.

The vector 
𝑣
 can also be expressed in terms of the reciprocal basis:
𝑣
=
𝑣
𝑘
 
𝑏
𝑘
The components 
𝑣
𝑘
 are the covariant components of the vector 
𝑣
.

𝑏

The components 
𝑆
𝑖
𝑗
 are called the contravariant components, 
𝑆
 
𝑗
𝑖
 the mixed right-covariant components, 
𝑆
𝑖
 
𝑗
 the mixed left-covariant components, and 
𝑆
𝑖
𝑗
 the covariant components of the second-order tensor.

where

Determinant of a second-order tensor[edit]

If 
𝑆
 is a second-order tensor, then the determinant is defined by the relation

[
𝑆
𝑢
,
𝑆
𝑣
,
𝑆
𝑤
]
=
det
𝑆
[
𝑢
,
𝑣
,
𝑤
]

where 
𝑢
,
𝑣
,
𝑤
 are arbitrary vectors and

[
𝑢
,
𝑣
,
𝑤
]
:=
𝑢
⋅
(

.

Relations between curvilinear and Cartesian basis vectors[edit]

Let 
(
𝑒
1
,
𝑒
2
,
𝑒
3
)
 be the usual Cartesian basis vectors for the Euclidean space of interest and let
𝑏
𝑖
=
𝐹
𝑒
𝑖
where 
𝐹
 is a second-order transformation tensor that maps 
𝑒
𝑖
 to 
𝑏
𝑖
. Then,
𝑏
𝑖
⊗
𝑒
𝑖
=
(
𝐹
𝑒
𝑖
)
⊗
𝑒
𝑖
=
𝐹
(
𝑒
𝑖
⊗
𝑒
𝑖
)
=
𝐹
 
.
From this relation we can show that
𝑏
𝑖
=
𝐹
−
T
𝑒
𝑖
 
;
 
 
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
=
[
𝐹
−
1
𝐹
−
T
]
𝑖
𝑗
 
;
 
 
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
=
[
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
]
−
1
=
[
𝐹
T
𝐹
]
𝑖
𝑗
Let 
𝐽
:=
det
𝐹
 be the Jacobian of the transformation. Then, from the definition of the determinant,
[
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,
𝑏
3
]
=
det
𝐹
[
𝑒
1
,
𝑒
2
,
𝑒
3
]
 
.
Since
[
𝑒
1
,
𝑒
2
,
𝑒
3
]
=
1
we have
𝐽
=
det
𝐹
=
[
𝑏
1
,
𝑏
2
,
𝑏
3
]
=
𝑏
1
⋅
(
𝑏
2
×
𝑏
3
)
A number of interesting results can be derived using the above relations.

First, consider
𝑔
:=
det
[
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
]
Then
𝑔
=
det
[
𝐹
T
]
⋅
det
[
𝐹
]
=
𝐽
⋅
𝐽
=
𝐽
2
Similarly, we can show that
det
[
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
]
=
1
𝐽
2
Therefore, using the fact that 
[
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
]
=
[
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
]
−
1
,
∂
𝑔
∂
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
=
2
 
𝐽
 
∂
𝐽
∂
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
=

𝑔
𝑖
𝑗

Another interesting relation is derived below. Recall that
𝑏
𝑖
⋅
𝑏
𝑗
=
𝛿
𝑗
𝑖
⇒
𝑏

⋅
𝑏
1
=

,
 
𝑏

⋅
𝑏
2
=
𝑏
1
⋅
𝑏
3
=
0
⇒
𝑏
1
=
𝐴
 
(
𝑏
2
×
𝑏
3
)
where 
𝐴
 is a, yet undetermined, constant. Then
𝑏
1
⋅
𝑏
1
=
𝐴
 
𝑏
1
⋅
(
𝑏
2
×
𝑏

)
=

𝐽

⇒
𝐴

Vector and tensor calculus in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates[edit]
Note: the Einstein summation convention of summing on repeated indices is used below.

Simmonds,[4] in his book on tensor analysis, quotes Albert Einstein saying[7]

The magic of this theory will hardly fail to impose itself on anybody who has truly understood it; it represents a genuine triumph of the method of absolute differential calculus, founded by Gauss, Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.

Vector and tensor calculus in general curvilinear coordinates is used in tensor analysis on four-dimensional curvilinear manifolds in general relativity,[8] in the mechanics of curved shells,[6] in examining the invariance properties of Maxwell's equations which has been of interest in metamaterials[9][10] and in many other fields.

Some useful relations in the calculus of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section. The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,[2] Simmonds,[4] Green and Zerna,[1] Basar and Weichert,[5] and Ciarlet.[6]

Basic definitions[edit]

Let the position of a point in space be characterized by three coordinate variables 
(
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,
𝑞
3
)
.

The coordinate curve 
𝑞
1
 represents a curve on which 
𝑞
2
 and 
𝑞
3
 are constant. Let 
𝑥
 be the position vector of the point relative to some origin. Then, assuming that such a mapping and its inverse exist and are continuous, we can write [2]: 55 
𝑥
=
𝜑
(
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,
𝑞
3
)
 
;
 
 
𝑞
𝑖
=
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
=
[
𝜑
−
1
(
𝑥
)
]
𝑖
The fields 
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
 are called the curvilinear coordinate functions of the curvilinear coordinate system 
𝜓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝜑
−
1
(
𝑥
)
.

The 
𝑞
𝑖
 coordinate curves are defined by the one-parameter family of functions given by
𝑥
𝑖
(
𝛼
)
=
𝜑
(
𝛼
,
𝑞
𝑗
,
𝑞
𝑘
)
 
,
 
 
𝑖
≠
𝑗
≠
𝑘
with 
𝑞
𝑗
, 
𝑞
𝑘
 fixed.

Tangent vector to coordinate curves[edit]

The tangent vector to the curve 
𝑥
𝑖
 at the point 
𝑥
𝑖
(
𝛼
)
 (or to the coordinate curve 
𝑞
𝑖
 at the point 
𝑥
) is
d
𝑥

Gradient[edit]
Scalar field[edit]

Let 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
 be a scalar field in space. Then
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑓
[
𝜑
(
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,
𝑞
3
)
]
=
𝑓
𝜑
(
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,
𝑞
3
)
The gradient of the field 
𝑓
 is defined by
[
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
]
⋅
𝑐
=
d
d
𝛼
𝑓
(
𝑥
+
𝛼
𝑐
)
|
𝛼
=
0
where 
𝑐
 is an arbitrary constant vector. If we define the components 
𝑐
𝑖
 of 
𝑐
 are such that
𝑞
𝑖
+
𝛼
 
𝑐
𝑖
=
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
+
𝛼
 
𝑐
)
then
[
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
]
⋅
𝑐
=
d
d
𝛼
𝑓
𝜑
(
𝑞
1
+
𝛼
 
𝑐
1
,
𝑞
2
+
𝛼
 
𝑐
2
,
𝑞
3
+
𝛼
 
𝑐
3
)
|
𝛼
=
0
=
∂
𝑓
𝜑
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑐
𝑖
=
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑐
𝑖

If we set 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
, then since 
𝑞
𝑖
=
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
, we have
[
𝛻
𝜓
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
]
⋅
𝑐
=
∂
𝜓
𝑖
∂
𝑞
𝑗
 
𝑐
𝑗
=
𝑐
𝑖
which provides a means of extracting the contravariant component of a vector 
𝑐
.

If 
𝑏
𝑖
 is the covariant (or natural) basis at a point, and if 
𝑏
𝑖
 is the contravariant (or reciprocal) basis at that point, then
[
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
]
⋅
𝑐
=
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑐
𝑖
=
(
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑏
𝑖
)
(
𝑐
𝑖
 
𝑏
𝑖
)
⇒
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑏
𝑖
A brief rationale for this choice of basis is given in the next section.

Vector field[edit]

A similar process can be used to arrive at the gradient of a vector field 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
. The gradient is given by
[
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
]
⋅
𝑐
=
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑐
𝑖
If we consider the gradient of the position vector field 
𝑟
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
, then we can show that
𝑐
=
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
 
𝑐
𝑖
=
𝑏
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
 
𝑐
𝑖
 
;
 
 
𝑏
𝑖
(
𝑥
)
:=
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
The vector field 
𝑏
𝑖
 is tangent to the 
𝑞
𝑖
 coordinate curve and forms a natural basis at each point on the curve. This basis, as discussed at the beginning of this article, is also called the covariant curvilinear basis. We can also define a reciprocal basis, or contravariant curvilinear basis, 
𝑏
𝑖
. All the algebraic relations between the basis vectors, as discussed in the section on tensor algebra, apply for the natural basis and its reciprocal at each point 
𝑥
.

Since 
𝑐
 is arbitrary, we can write
𝛻
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑞
𝑖
⊗
𝑏
𝑖

Note that the contravariant basis vector 
𝑏
𝑖
 is perpendicular to the surface of constant 
𝜓
𝑖
 and is given by
𝑏
𝑖
=
𝛻
𝜓
𝑖

Christoffel symbols of the first kind[edit]

The Christoffel symbols of the first kind are defined as
𝑏

 we note that

Since

=

 we have 
Γ

=
Γ

. Using these to rearrange the above relations gives

Christoffel symbols of the second kind[edit]

The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are defined as
Γ
𝑖
𝑗
𝑘
=

𝑖
𝑘
in which

∂
𝑏

∂
𝑞

𝑏

This implies that
Γ

∂
𝑞

⋅
𝑏
𝑘
=

Other relations that follow are

Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates[edit]

Assume, for the purposes of this section, that the curvilinear coordinate system is orthogonal, i.e.,
𝑏
𝑖
⋅
𝑏
𝑗
=
{
𝑔
𝑖
𝑖
	
if 
𝑖
=
𝑗


0
	
if 
𝑖

,
or equivalently,
𝑏

⋅
𝑏
𝑗
=
{
𝑔
𝑖
𝑖
	
if 
𝑖
=

0
	
if 
𝑖
≠
𝑗
,
where 
𝑔
𝑖
𝑖
=
𝑔
𝑖
𝑖
−
1
. As before, 
𝑏
𝑖
,
𝑏
𝑗
 are covariant basis vectors and 
𝑏
𝑖
, 
𝑏
𝑗
 are contravariant basis vectors. Also, let 
(
𝑒
1
,
𝑒
2
,
𝑒

)
 be a background, fixed, Cartesian basis. A list of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is given below.

Metric tensor in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates[edit]
Main article: Metric tensor

Let 
𝑟
(
𝑥
)
 be the position vector of the point 
𝑥
 with respect to the origin of the coordinate system. The notation can be simplified by noting that 
𝑥
 = 
𝑟
(
𝑥
)
. At each point we can construct a small line element 
d
𝑥
. The square of the length of the line element is the scalar product 
d
𝑥
⋅
d
𝑥
 and is called the metric of the space. Recall that the space of interest is assumed to be Euclidean when we talk of curvilinear coordinates. Let us express the position vector in terms of the background, fixed, Cartesian basis, i.e.,
𝑥
=
∑
𝑖
=
1
3
𝑥
𝑖
 
𝑒
𝑖

Using the chain rule, we can then express 
d
𝑥
 in terms of three-dimensional orthogonal curvilinear coordinates 
(
𝑞
1
,
𝑞
2
,
𝑞
3
)
 as
d

where

we get a relation between the fundamental tensor and the Lamé coefficients.

Example: Polar coordinates[edit]

If we consider polar coordinates for 
𝑅
2
, note that
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
(
𝑟
cos
⁡
𝜃
,
𝑟
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
(
𝑟
,
𝜃
)
 are the curvilinear coordinates, and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation 
(
𝑟
,
𝜃
)
→
(
𝑟
cos
⁡
𝜃
,
𝑟
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
 is 
𝑟
.

The orthogonal basis vectors are 
𝑏
𝑟
=
(
cos
⁡
𝜃
,
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
, 
𝑏
𝜃
=
(
−
𝑟
sin
⁡
𝜃
,
𝑟
cos
⁡
𝜃
)
. The normalized basis vectors are 
𝑒
𝑟
=
(
cos
⁡
𝜃
,
sin
⁡
𝜃
)
, 
𝑒
𝜃
=
(
−
sin
⁡
𝜃
,
cos
⁡
𝜃
)
 and the scale factors are 
ℎ
𝑟
=
1
 and 
ℎ
𝜃
=
𝑟
. The fundamental tensor is 
𝑔
11
=
1
, 
𝑔
22
=
𝑟
2
, 
𝑔
12
=
𝑔
21
=

.

Line and surface integrals[edit]

If we wish to use curvilinear coordinates for vector calculus calculations, adjustments need to be made in the calculation of line, surface and volume integrals. For simplicity, we again restrict the discussion to three dimensions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. However, the same arguments apply for 
𝑛
-dimensional problems though there are some additional terms in the expressions when the coordinate system is not orthogonal.

Line integrals[edit]

Normally in the calculation of line integrals we are interested in calculating
∫
𝐶
𝑓
𝑑
𝑠
=
∫
𝑎
𝑏
𝑓
(
𝑥
(
𝑡
)
)
|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
𝑑
𝑡
where 
𝑥
(
𝑡
)
 parametrizes 
𝐶
 in Cartesian coordinates. In curvilinear coordinates, the term

|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
=
|
∑
𝑖
=
1
3
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂

|

by the chain rule. And from the definition of the Lamé coefficients,

∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
=
∑
𝑘
ℎ
𝑘
𝑖
 
𝑒
𝑘

and thus

|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
	
=
|
∑
𝑘
(
∑
𝑖
ℎ
𝑘
𝑖
 
∂

)
𝑒

=
∑

∑

∑

∑
𝑗
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
 
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑡
∂
𝑞
𝑗
∂
𝑡

Now, since 
𝑔
𝑖
𝑗
=
0
 when 
𝑖
≠
𝑗
, we have
|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
=
∑
𝑖
𝑔
𝑖
𝑖
 
(
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂

)
2
=
∑
𝑖
ℎ
𝑖
2
 
(
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑡
)
2
and we can proceed normally.

Surface integrals[edit]

Likewise, if we are interested in a surface integral, the relevant calculation, with the parameterization of the surface in Cartesian coordinates is:
∫
𝑆
𝑓
𝑑
𝑆
=
∬
𝑇
𝑓
(
𝑥
(
𝑠
,
𝑡
)
)
|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑠
×
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
𝑑
𝑠
𝑑
𝑡
Again, in curvilinear coordinates, we have
|
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑠
×
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑡
|
=
|
(
∑
𝑖
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑠
)
×
(
∑
𝑗
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑗
∂
𝑞
𝑗
∂
𝑡
)
|
and we make use of the definition of curvilinear coordinates again to yield
∂
𝑥
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑞
𝑖
∂
𝑠
=
∑
𝑘
(
∑
𝑖

∂
𝑞

∂

)
𝑒

∂
𝑞

∂

)
𝑒

Therefore,

∂

∂

|
	
=

∑
𝑘
∑

Divergence of a second-order tensor field[edit]

The divergence of a second-order tensor field in cylindrical polar coordinates can be obtained from the expression for the gradient by collecting terms where the scalar product of the two outer vectors in the dyadic products is nonzero. Therefore,
