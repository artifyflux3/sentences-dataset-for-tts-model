For the 1964 book on intensive farming, see Animal Machines .

René Descartes , whose mechanistic philosophy proposed that animals are automata lacking minds or consciousness.

Animal machine ( French : bête-machine ), also known as animal automatism , is a philosophical concept most closely associated with 17th-century philosopher René Descartes , who argued that nonhuman animals are automata —complex, self-moving biological machines devoid of thought, reason, consciousness, or immaterial souls. As part of his philosophy of mind–body dualism , Descartes drew a sharp metaphysical boundary between humans, who he saw as possessing immaterial minds capable of rational thought and language, and animals, whose behaviors he attributed entirely to mechanical processes. These included the arrangement of physical organs, the flow of animal spirits , and responses to external stimuli, all governed by the same laws of motion that apply to inanimate matter.

Developed in opposition to the prevailing Aristotelian and Scholastic view that living beings possess souls and act for final causes , the concept of the animal machine represented a radical mechanization of life. It became central to Descartes' natural philosophy, shaping his explanations of sensation, movement, and bodily functions in both animals and humans. The doctrine provoked widespread criticism and debate, particularly regarding the apparent intelligence , adaptability, and suffering of animals . Nevertheless, it laid the groundwork for later philosophical discussions on animal cognition , consciousness , artificial intelligence , and the mechanistic interpretation of nature in early modern science.

Historical context [ edit ] In contrast to the prevailing Aristotelian and Scholastic belief that the soul was the principle of life and that living beings acted for the sake of ends or purposes, Descartes introduced a radically mechanistic account of biology. He rejected the idea that nature unfolds according to final causes , maintaining instead that all phenomena, including life and behavior, could be explained in terms of the motion and interaction of material corpuscles .

[ 1 ] The doctrine of animal automatism, which Descartes developed from as early as 1619, was controversial from the outset. Critics found it difficult to accept that animals could exhibit complex, seemingly purposive behavior without thought or feeling. Descartes defended the view throughout his life, notably in his correspondence with Henry More in the late 1640s.

[ 1 ] Mechanical explanation of animal behavior [ edit ] Parrot ( c.

1600s ) by Tommaso Salini . Descartes used parrots as examples of animals that can mimic human speech without understanding, to argue that animals lack true language and reason.

In Descartes' view, animals are akin to hydraulic automata —like the animated statues found in the gardens at Saint-Germain-en-Laye —which react to environmental stimuli through intricate but purely physical mechanisms. He described animal bodies in terms of nerves acting like pipes, muscles like springs, and animal spirits like the water that drives the machinery. All behaviors, including sensory responses and motor actions, were to be explained through these mechanisms, without invoking consciousness or reason.

[ 1 ] To support his position, Descartes proposed two key tests for intelligence: the language test, which requires the capacity to generate novel, meaningful speech, and the action test, which involves flexible behavior across varied contexts. Animals, he argued, failed both tests. Even if they could mimic speech, like parrots, they could not demonstrate true linguistic competence or understanding. Likewise, their behavior lacked the adaptability characteristic of human reason.

[ 1 ] Theological and metaphysical implications [ edit ] Descartes maintained that only humans possess immortal, immaterial souls created directly by God.

Animal souls , if they could be said to exist at all, were reducible to the arrangement of matter and the flow of animal spirits. This position led to a sharp divide between humans and all other animals, with significant implications for questions of morality, theology, and human–animal relations.

[ 1 ] Nonetheless, Descartes acknowledged that animal bodies share many structural similarities with human bodies, including the same organs and physiological processes. He also admitted that animals can exhibit learned behaviors and possess a degree of plasticity in their responses. Still, he interpreted these phenomena as mechanical rather than cognitive, involving changes in the structure and flow of animal spirits within the brain and nerves, without any intervening thought.

[ 1 ] Criticism and legacy [ edit ] Title page of Julien Offray de La Mettrie 's L'Homme Machine (1747), which extended the animal-machine analogy to humans.

Early criticism [ edit ] Descartes' mechanistic view of animals was subject to criticism during his lifetime and in subsequent philosophical discourse. Early critics included Pierre Gassendi , Nicolas Malebranche , and members of the Cambridge Platonists , who objected to what they regarded as an overly reductive view of life.

[ 1 ] Among these, Ralph Cudworth proposed that animals possess a form of soul characterised by internal self-activity and sensibility, distinguishing them from inanimate matter. Although based on metaphysical assumptions that are not widely held today, his framework allowed for a moral distinction between living beings and lifeless objects.

[ 2 ] Historical practices such as animal trials in premodern Europe, in which animals were subjected to legal proceedings and punishments, have also been cited as evidence that animals were often regarded as capable of moral agency. These practices stand in contrast to Descartes' mechanistic interpretation and suggest that his account did not fully reflect prevailing cultural attitudes.

[ 1 ] Moral objections to the animal machine doctrine were also voiced outside academic philosophy. A 1760 sermon entitled Universal Charity explicitly rejected the concept, stating: [ 3 ] I take it for granted, that Brutes are capable of Pleasure and Pain; perhaps, some of them in some Respects are more sensible of both than Men are. — As for that Notion, that they are mere Machines and Pieces of Clock-work, without Sense, Perception, or Consciousness, it is so idle and extravagant, that it does not deserve a serious Confutation.

Enlightenment materialism [ edit ] In the eighteenth century, Julien Offray de La Mettrie extended Descartes' analogy by arguing that humans, like animals, are biological machines governed entirely by material processes. In his 1747 work L'Homme Machine , La Mettrie rejected Cartesian dualism and proposed that thought and consciousness arise from bodily organisation. His materialist position challenged religious and philosophical orthodoxy but has since been noted for its relevance to later developments in evolutionary biology and neuroscience.

[ 4 ] Animal rights perspectives [ edit ] In modern animal ethics , Descartes has often been portrayed as a controversial figure due to his denial of animal consciousness . His legacy has been criticised by philosophers such as Peter Singer , who in Animal Liberation (1975) described Descartes' position as the "absolute nadir" of Western thought on animals.

Tom Regan likewise devoted a chapter in The Case for Animal Rights (1983) to critiquing Descartes account, suggesting it is "tempting" to view his views as extreme. In 1982, a member of the Animal Liberation Front defaced a portrait of Descartes at the Royal Society in protest, reflecting continued opposition to his influence on the justification of animal experimentation.

[ 5 ] Scholarly reassessment [ edit ] Writing in the 1970s, philosopher John Cottingham challenged the widespread interpretation that Descartes believed animals were entirely devoid of feeling or awareness. While acknowledging that Descartes denied animals the capacity for reason and self-conscious thought, Cottingham argued that Descartes did not clearly exclude the possibility of sensation. He noted passages where Descartes referred to animals expressing impulses such as fear, hunger, or anger, and drew attention to Descartes' distinction between cogitatio (thought) and sensus (sensation), suggesting the latter may not have been wholly denied. Cottingham concluded that Descartes dualism created unresolved tensions regarding animal sentience , and that Descartes' position may have been more complex than often assumed.

[ 6 ] Continuing influence [ edit ] In contemporary philosophy, Descartes' account is often viewed as a precursor to eliminative materialism and to debates surrounding artificial intelligence and functionalism . While Descartes himself remained committed to mind–body dualism , the concept of the animal machine has continued to influence discussions on animal consciousness , the moral status of animals , and the nature of cognition.
