' main island ' ) , historically known as Akitsushima ( 秋津島 ; lit.

' dragonfly island ' ) , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] is the largest of the four main islands of Japan .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] It lies between the Pacific Ocean (east) and the Sea of Japan (west). It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Honshu had a population of 104 million as of 2017 [update] , constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan, [ 11 ] and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain . As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power, [ 12 ] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto , Nara , and Kamakura . Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt , a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.

[ 12 ] Honshu also contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji , and its largest lake, Lake Biwa .

[ 13 ] Most of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya , Kyōto , Osaka , Kobe , and Hiroshima .

[ 12 ] [ 14 ] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having four seasons with largely varying temperatures while the south experiences long, hot summers and cool to mild winters.

[ 15 ] Etymology [ edit ] The name of the island, Honshū ( 本州 ) , stems from Middle Chinese . It directly translates to "main province" or "home land" in English.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] History [ edit ] See also: History of Japan Early history [ edit ] Humans first arrived in Honshu at least approximately 37,000 years ago. The first humans to arrive in Honshu were Stone Age hunter-gatherers from Northeast Asia, likely following the migration of ice age megafauna . Surviving artifacts from this period include finely crafted stone blades, similar to those found in Siberia .

[ 19 ] After the initial arrival of hunter-gatherers, the island saw the emergence of the Jōmon period (c. 14,000–300 BCE), one of the earliest known eras of prehistoric Japanese culture. The Jōmon people were known for their distinctive cord-marked pottery and dogū clay figurines, many of which have been excavated at archaeological sites across Honshu. These artifacts reflect a complex spiritual life and early forms of sedentary communities, particularly along the coasts and river valleys.

Meiji Restoration [ edit ] The Meiji Restoration, in Japanese history, is the political revolution in 1868 that brought the final demise of the Tokugawa shogunate (which is a military government). It ended the Edo (Tokugawa) Period (1603–1867) and at least nominally returned control of the country to direct imperial rule under Mutsuhito (the Emperor Meiji ). One of the main leaders of the restoration (who were mostly young samurai ) was Chōshū in far western Honshu, which was one of the feudal, hostile to Tokugawa authority domains.

Geography [ edit ] Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.

The island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km 2 (88,020 sq mi).

[ 1 ] It is slightly larger than Britain . Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary . Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.

[ 7 ] Mountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (such as the Great Kantō earthquake , which heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923; and the earthquake of March 2011 , which moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft) [ 20 ] [ 21 ] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island . There are many rivers, including the Shinano River , Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. Western Japan experiences a temperate climate with hot summers and cool to mild winters.
In addition to the general climate patterns, central Honshu, particularly the regions surrounding the Japanese Alps, experiences heavy snowfall in winter. Areas such as Niigata, Toyama, and Nagano prefectures are renowned for their snow accumulation, making them popular destinations for skiing and winter sports. These regions are among the snowiest inhabited places in the world, due to the humid air masses from the Sea of Japan colliding with the mountainous terrain.

Population [ edit ] Honshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.

[ 11 ] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129), [ 22 ] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area , the most populous metropolitan area in the world.

Extreme points [ edit ] Bridges and tunnels [ edit ] Honshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaido , Kyushu and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku ( Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge ; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge , Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge , Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge , and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge ; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge , Hitsuishijima Bridge , Iwakurojima Bridge , Yoshima Bridge , Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge , and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge ), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaido, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connect Honshu with Kyushu.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant , leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster .

[ 28 ] The Tōhoku region , spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.

Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island, [ 34 ] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture , though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu .

[ 35 ] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata , and Akita Prefectures.
