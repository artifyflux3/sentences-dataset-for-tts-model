Hilbert (1926 , p. 170), in a lecture given in Münster to Mathematical Society of Westphalia on 4 June 1925 Cantor's paradise is an expression used by David Hilbert ( 1926 , page 170) in describing set theory and infinite cardinal numbers developed by Georg Cantor . The context of Hilbert's comment was his opposition to what he saw as L. E. J. Brouwer 's reductive attempts to circumscribe what kind of mathematics is acceptable; see Brouwer–Hilbert controversy .
