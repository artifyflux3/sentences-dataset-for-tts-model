"Message from space" is a type of " first contact " theme in science fiction . Stories of this type involve receiving an interstellar message which reveals the existence of other intelligent life in the universe.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] An early short story, A Message from Space ( Joseph Schlossel , Weird Tales , March 1926) tells of an amateur who builds a ham TV set and suddenly sees an alien on the screen. The alien realises it is being watched and tells its soap opera story. The verdict of Everett Franklin Bleiler : "original ideas, but clumsy handling".

[ 2 ] While the use of this trope does predate [ 1 ] the scientific Search for extraterrestrial intelligence ("SETI"), initiated with Project Ozma in 1960, the use of this as a plot element in science fiction greatly increased with the publicity given by various SETI projects. Classic examples of this trope include the 1961 television script and a novel A for Andromeda by Fred Hoyle and John Elliot , the 1968 novel His Master's Voice by Stanislaw Lem , The Listeners by James E. Gunn , and Carl Sagan 's novel and subsequent film Contact .
