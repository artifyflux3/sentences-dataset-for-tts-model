For other uses, see List of things named after Leonhard Euler § Theorems .

In number theory , Euler's theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem or Euler's totient theorem ) states that, if n and a are coprime positive integers, then a φ φ ( n ) {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}} is congruent to 1 {\displaystyle 1} modulo n , where φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } denotes Euler's totient function ; that is a φ φ ( n ) ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod n ) .

{\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}\equiv 1{\pmod {n}}.} In 1736, Leonhard Euler published a proof of Fermat's little theorem [ 1 ] (stated by Fermat without proof), which is the restriction of Euler's theorem to the case where n is a prime number.  Subsequently, Euler presented other proofs of the theorem, culminating with his paper of 1763, in which he proved a generalization to the case where n is not prime.

[ 2 ] The converse of Euler's theorem is also true: if the above congruence is true, then a {\displaystyle a} and n {\displaystyle n} must be coprime.

The theorem  is further generalized by some of Carmichael's theorems .

The theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo n {\displaystyle n} . For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of 7 222 {\displaystyle 7^{222}} , i.e.

7 222 ( mod 10 ) {\displaystyle 7^{222}{\pmod {10}}} . The integers 7 and 10 are coprime, and φ φ ( 10 ) = 4 {\displaystyle \varphi (10)=4} . So Euler's theorem yields 7 4 ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod 10 ) {\displaystyle 7^{4}\equiv 1{\pmod {10}}} , and we get 7 222 ≡ ≡ 7 4 × × 55 + 2 ≡ ≡ ( 7 4 ) 55 × × 7 2 ≡ ≡ 1 55 × × 7 2 ≡ ≡ 49 ≡ ≡ 9 ( mod 10 ) {\displaystyle 7^{222}\equiv 7^{4\times 55+2}\equiv (7^{4})^{55}\times 7^{2}\equiv 1^{55}\times 7^{2}\equiv 49\equiv 9{\pmod {10}}} .

In general, when reducing a power of a {\displaystyle a} modulo n {\displaystyle n} (where a {\displaystyle a} and n {\displaystyle n} are coprime), one needs to work modulo φ φ ( n ) {\displaystyle \varphi (n)} in the exponent of a {\displaystyle a} : if x ≡ ≡ y ( mod φ φ ( n ) ) {\displaystyle x\equiv y{\pmod {\varphi (n)}}} , then a x ≡ ≡ a y ( mod n ) {\displaystyle a^{x}\equiv a^{y}{\pmod {n}}} .

Euler's theorem underlies the RSA cryptosystem , which is widely used in Internet communications. In this cryptosystem, Euler's theorem is used with n being a product of two large prime numbers , and the security of the system is based on the difficulty of factoring such an integer.

Proofs [ edit ] 1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups : [ 3 ] The residue classes modulo n that are coprime to n form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n for details). The order of that group is φ ( n ) .

Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case φ ( n ) . If a is any number coprime to n then a is in one of these residue classes, and its powers a , a 2 , ... , a k modulo n form a subgroup of the group of residue classes, with a k ≡ 1 (mod n ) . Lagrange's theorem says k must divide φ ( n ) , i.e. there is an integer M such that kM = φ ( n ) . This then implies, a φ φ ( n ) = a k M = ( a k ) M ≡ ≡ 1 M = 1 ( mod n ) .

{\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}=a^{kM}=(a^{k})^{M}\equiv 1^{M}=1{\pmod {n}}.} 2. There is also a direct proof: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Let R = { x 1 , x 2 , ... , x φ ( n ) } be a reduced residue system ( mod n ) and let a be any integer coprime to n . The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by a permutes the x i : in other words if ax j ≡ ax k (mod n ) then j = k . (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n .

[ 6 ] ) That is, the sets R and aR = { ax 1 , ax 2 , ... , ax φ ( n ) } , considered as sets of congruence classes ( mod n ), are identical (as sets—they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in R is congruent ( mod n ) to the product of all the numbers in aR : ∏ ∏ i = 1 φ φ ( n ) x i ≡ ≡ ∏ ∏ i = 1 φ φ ( n ) a x i = a φ φ ( n ) ∏ ∏ i = 1 φ φ ( n ) x i ( mod n ) , {\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}x_{i}\equiv \prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}ax_{i}=a^{\varphi (n)}\prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}x_{i}{\pmod {n}},} and using the cancellation law to cancel each x i gives Euler's theorem: a φ φ ( n ) ≡ ≡ 1 ( mod n ) .
