In topology , puncturing a manifold is removing a finite set of points from that manifold.

[ 1 ] The set of points can be small as a single point. In this case, the manifold is known as once-punctured . With the removal of a second point, it becomes twice-punctured , and so on.

Examples of punctured manifolds include the open disk (which is a sphere with a single puncture), the cylinder (which is a sphere with two punctures), [ 1 ] and the Möbius strip (which is a projective plane with a single puncture).
