[Astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut") and other [spaceflight participants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_participant "Spaceflight participant") have observed their religions while in space; sometimes publicly, sometimes privately. Religious adherence in outer space may pose unique challenges and opportunities for practitioners. Space travelers have reported profound changes in the way they view their faith related to the [overview effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect "Overview effect"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-1) while some secular groups have criticized the use of government spacecraft for religious activities by astronauts.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-2)

The Apollo 8 Genesis reading.

On Christmas Eve, 1968 astronauts [Bill Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders "Bill Anders"), [Jim Lovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lovell "Jim Lovell"), and [Frank Borman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Borman "Frank Borman") read from the [Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis") as [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") orbited the Moon.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-3) A lawsuit by [American Atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Atheists "American Atheists") founder [Madalyn Murray O'Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madalyn_Murray_O%27Hair "Madalyn Murray O'Hair") alleged that the observance amounted to a government endorsement of religion in violation of the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-aldrin-4) but the case was dismissed.

[Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") astronaut [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin"), a [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian "Presbyterian"), performed a [communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist "Eucharist") service for himself using a kit provided by his church. Aldrin had told flight director [Chris Kraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kraft "Chris Kraft") of his plans and intended to broadcast the service back to Earth but opted not to at the request of [Deke Slayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deke_Slayton "Deke Slayton"), due to the continuing controversy over Apollo 8's reading.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-5)

A microfilm [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") brought to the surface of the Moon by Apollo 14 astronaut [Ed Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell "Edgar Mitchell") was auctioned off in 2011.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-nicola-6) It was a [King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version "King James Version") created after three astronauts lost their lives in the [Apollo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1") fire.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-nicola-6)[Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut) "Ed White (astronaut)"), one of the astronauts who perished, had wanted to take a Bible to the Moon.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-nicola-6)

On the 2009 [STS-128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-128 "STS-128") flight to the International Space Station, astronaut [Patrick Forrester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Forrester "Patrick Forrester") brought a fragment of a [Missionary Aviation Fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_Aviation_Fellowship "Missionary Aviation Fellowship") aircraft which had been used by the [Operation Auca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Auca "Operation Auca") martyrs in Ecuador in 1956.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-7)

Several members of the crew of the Space Shuttle _Challenger_ tragedy mission [STS-51-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-L "STS-51-L") were people of faith. Among them were Commander [Dick Scobee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Scobee "Dick Scobee") and Pilot [Michael J. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Smith "Michael J. Smith"). Scobee was a [Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist "Baptist") who met his wife June at a church social event. After the tragedy, she would go on to write an article in [Guidepost Magazine](https://guideposts.org/positive-living/health-and-wellness/life-advice/managing-life-changes/finding-strength-after-challenger-tragedy/) about how their faith helped her through the tragic time. Smith and his family attended a non-denominational Christian church in a community close to their home near Houston's NASA JSC Space Center.

[Rick Husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Husband "Rick Husband"), the Commander of the ill-fated [STS-107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-107 "STS-107")_Columbia_ tragedy mission, was also a devout Christian. On the last-request forms that astronauts fill out before every flight, he left his pastor a personal note: "Tell them about Jesus; he's real to me." Later his wife Evelyn wrote a book about their life with him as an astronaut and the importance of their Christian faith entitled _High Calling: The Courageous Life and Faith of Space Shuttle Columbia Commander Rick Husband_. Likewise, his STS-107 crewmate [Michael P. Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_P._Anderson "Michael P. Anderson") was also a devout Christian and when not on a mission for NASA, was an active member of the [Grace Community Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Community_Church "Grace Community Church") choir.

A signed message from [Pope Paul VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI "Pope Paul VI") was included among statements from dozens of other world leaders left on the Moon on a silicon disk during the [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") mission.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-8) Following the mission, [William Donald Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Donald_Borders "William Donald Borders"), Bishop of the [Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Orlando "Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando"), told the Pope that the [1917 Code of Canon Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Code_of_Canon_Law "1917 Code of Canon Law") placed the Moon within his diocese, as the first explorers had departed from Cape Kennedy which was under his jurisdiction. The claim was neither confirmed nor denied by the Pope, and the Moon is not recognized as part of the diocese in any official capacity.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-11)

Following Buzz Aldrin's communion on the Moon, other astronauts have done the same in Earth orbit. Three [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") astronauts on Space Shuttle mission [STS-59](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-59 "STS-59") received [Holy Communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist_in_the_Catholic_Church "Eucharist in the Catholic Church") on 17 April 1994.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-12) NASA astronaut [Michael S. Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hopkins "Michael S. Hopkins") took a supply of six consecrated hosts to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") in September 2013, allowing him to receive the Eucharist weekly during his 24-week mission.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-13)

In May 2011, [Pope Benedict XVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI "Pope Benedict XVI") of the Catholic Church talked to the crew of the [Space Shuttle _Endeavour_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour "Space Shuttle Endeavour") while it was in Earth orbit.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-thom-14)

In Russia, spaceflight crews are blessed by [Russian Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church") priests before launch, and their Soyuz rockets are also blessed on the launch pad. Cosmonaut [Aleksandr Viktorenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Viktorenko "Aleksandr Viktorenko") initiated the crew blessing tradition when he requested one for the launch of [Soyuz TM-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-20 "Soyuz TM-20") in 1994.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-16)

Russian Orthodox Christmas was celebrated on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), on January 7, 2011.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-:0-17) Cosmonauts had the day off, but one of the other crew posted on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), "Merry Christmas to all Russia."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-:0-17) The whole crew also celebrated on December 25, two weeks prior.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-:0-17)

Cosmonauts sometimes at the request of Russian Orthodox church carry religious icons to space, which upon return to Earth are distributed to churches.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-18)

Muslims in space struggle with fulfilling their religious obligations including kneeling and facing Mecca to pray in microgravity traveling at several kilometres per second. The issue first came up when [Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_bin_Salman_bin_Abdulaziz_Al_Saud "Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud"), a [Saudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud "House of Saud") prince, flew aboard [STS-51-G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-G "STS-51-G") and again when [Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") flew as a tourist to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-19) In preparation for Malaysian [Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Muszaphar_Shukor "Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor")'s trip to the ISS in 2007, the [National Fatwa Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fatwa_Council "National Fatwa Council") created "Muslim Obligations in the International Space Station" outlining permissible modifications to rituals such as kneeling when praying (not required in space), facing Mecca (or just Earth)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-f766-20) when praying (left to the astronaut's best abilities at the start of prayer), and washing (a wet towel will suffice).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-21)

In February 2014, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE) from Saudi Arabia issued a [fatwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa "Fatwa") forbidding devout Muslims from participating as crew members in [Mars One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_One "Mars One")'s proposed one-way mission to [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-22) Speaking for the clerical group, Farooq Hamada explained that, "Protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the Holy Quran: Do not kill yourselves or one another. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful."[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_space#cite_note-23)
