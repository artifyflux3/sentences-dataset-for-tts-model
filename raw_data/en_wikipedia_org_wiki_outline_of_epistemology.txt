[ 1 ] The term was introduced into English by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier (1808–1864).

[ 2 ] Epistemology asks questions such as: "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", and "What do people know?" Core topics of epistemology [ edit ] Main article: Epistemology Knowledge Sources of knowledge ( Pramana in Sanskrit) Perception Memory Introspection Inference Testimony Types of knowledge Descriptive knowledge – "Knowledge that" Procedural knowledge – "Knowledge how" Knowledge by acquaintance A priori and a posteriori Analytic–synthetic distinction Gettier problem Justification Regress argument Münchhausen trilemma Theories of justification Foundationalism – Basic beliefs justify other, non-basic beliefs.

Coherentism – Beliefs are justified if they cohere with other beliefs a person holds, each belief is justified if it coheres with the overall system of beliefs.

Infinitism – Beliefs are justified by infinite chains of reasons.

Foundherentism – Both fallible foundations and coherence are components of justification—proposed by Susan Haack .

Internalism and externalism – The believer must be able to justify a belief through internal knowledge (internalism), or outside sources of knowledge can be used to justify a belief (externalism).

Innatism – The mind is born with knowledge.

Reformed epistemology – Beliefs are warranted by proper cognitive function—proposed by Alvin Plantinga .

Evidentialism – Beliefs depend solely on the evidence for them.

Reliabilism – A belief is justified if it is the result of a reliable process.

Infallibilism – Knowledge is incompatible with the possibility of being wrong.

Fallibilism – Claims can be accepted even though they cannot be conclusively proven or justified.

Non-justificationism – Knowledge is produced by attacking claims and refuting them instead of justifying them.
