This event was much more common before the modern era (i.e. the turn of the 20th century); there have been only 40 inside-the-park grand slams since 1950.

^ As of 9 September 2023.

^ This may seem impossible. However, a sacrifice fly can be awarded without an out being recorded, if the fielder in question commits an error.

^ This may seem impossible. However, by definition a perfect game requires more than simply retiring the first 27 batters in order; it also requires that the pitcher's team wins, and that the pitcher completes the entire game. See perfect game for more details.

^ These six events may be the only times in the history of baseball when a team has deliberately and with premeditation allowed a run to score by the opposing team for strategic purposes. It is true that there are cases where a particular choice of defensive alignment may make scoring more likely, and there are cases where decisions made in the moment of play allow a run to score in exchange for other strategic purposes, but intentionally walking in a run is clearly in a different class of strategic maneuver. This may also have occurred when a pitcher was instructed to deliberately hit a batter with the bases loaded, but in this case, intention is not provable.

^ Baseball Reference lists 6, but Hideki Okajima surrendered a home run on his first pitch April 2, 2007.

^ a b This is possible when a batter who has been struck out reaches first base safely under a dropped third strike . That is, if strike three is recorded on the batter but the catcher does not catch the ball to complete the putout (likely because of a wild pitch or passed ball) and first base is unoccupied, the batter may advance to first; the pitcher is credited with a strikeout, but no out is recorded.

^ The Baseball Almanac states that 17 pitchers have accomplished this feat. Of these, all but Chuck Finley have only once struck out 4 batters in a single inning (consecutively or otherwise). Finley however did it 3 times, but the Baseball Almanac does not state how many of those were consecutive strikeouts (i.e., whether it was once, twice, or all 3 times).

^ Some sources do not include the two perfect games thrown in the 19th century, because of differences in the rules of play, and thus list only twenty-one perfect games.

^ Baseball Reference lists 64, but Russ Johnson took Shane Komine deep in Komine's 2nd pitch on July 30, 2006. As well, Brandon Phillips hit one off of Steven Matz on his 5th pitch June 28, 2015.
