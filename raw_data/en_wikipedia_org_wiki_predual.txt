Find sources: "Predual" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , the predual of an object D is an object P whose dual space is D .

For example, the predual of the space of bounded operators is the space of trace class operators, and the predual of the space L ∞ ( R ) of essentially bounded functions on R is the Banach space L 1 ( R ) of integrable functions.
