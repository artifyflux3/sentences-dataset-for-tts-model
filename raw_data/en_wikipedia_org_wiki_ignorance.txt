Ignorance is a lack of knowledge or understanding .  Deliberate ignorance is a culturally-induced phenomenon, the study of which is called agnotology .

The word "ignorant" is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being unaware , or even cognitive dissonance and other cognitive relation, and can describe individuals who are unaware of important information or facts . Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).

[ 1 ] Consequences [ edit ] Ignorance can have negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions.

[ 2 ] Though this can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind.

[ citation needed ] Studies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment.

[ 3 ] The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives.

[ citation needed ] In 1984, author Thomas Pynchon observed: We are often unaware of the scope and structure of our ignorance. Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for ruining a good story.

[ 4 ] Another effect of ignorance is characterized by the Dunning-Kruger effect , named after the scientists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999. This theory centralizes the behavior of subjects regarding their intellectual capabilities and social behaviors. The limited information or competence of people who possess the Dunning-Kruger translates into a feeling of intellectual superiority.
