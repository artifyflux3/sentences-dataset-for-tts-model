04359563 Links Journal homepage Online access Online archive The Journal of Natural Products is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering all aspects of research on the chemistry and/or biochemistry of naturally occurring compounds . It is co-published by the American Society of Pharmacognosy and the American Chemical Society . The editor-in-chief is Philip J. Proteau ( Oregon State University ).

History [ edit ] The journal was established in 1938 as Lloydia , published by the Lloyd Library and Museum , [ 1 ] and obtained its present title in 1979.

[ 2 ] It has been the official journal of the American Society of Pharmacognosy since 1961. Originally a quarterly publication, it became a bimonthly journal in 1975, and has appeared monthly since 1992. The American Society of Pharmacognosy began to co-publish the journal with the American Chemical Society in 1996. In 2008, the journal was hijacked by a low-quality open access journal using the same title. As of January 2016 [update] , this counterfeit journal was still active.

[ 3 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in: Biological Abstracts [ 4 ] BIOSIS Previews [ 5 ] Chemical Abstracts Service [ 6 ] Current Contents /Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences [ 5 ] Current Contents/Life Sciences [ 5 ] EBSCO databases Index Medicus / MEDLINE / PubMed [ 7 ] Science Citation Index [ 5 ] Scopus [ 8 ] The Zoological Record [ 5 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 5.1.
