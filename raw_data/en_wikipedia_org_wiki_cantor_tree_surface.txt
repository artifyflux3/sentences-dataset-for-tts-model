Drilling a hole through the tree at each branch point would produce a blooming Cantor tree.

An Alexander horned sphere . Its non-singular points form a Cantor tree surface.

In dynamical systems , the Cantor tree is an infinite- genus surface homeomorphic to a sphere with a Cantor set removed. The blooming Cantor tree is a Cantor tree with an infinite number of handles added in such a way that every end is a limit of handles.
