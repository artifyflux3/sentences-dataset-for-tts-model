The theory  was first systematically studied by Eichler & Zagier (1985) .

Definition [ edit ] A Jacobi form of level 1, weight k and index m is a function ϕ ϕ ( τ τ , z ) {\displaystyle \phi (\tau ,z)} of two complex variables (with τ in the upper half plane) such that ϕ ϕ ( a τ τ + b c τ τ + d , z c τ τ + d ) = ( c τ τ + d ) k e 2 π π i m c z 2 c τ τ + d ϕ ϕ ( τ τ , z ) for ( a b c d ) ∈ ∈ S L 2 ( Z ) {\displaystyle \phi \left({\frac {a\tau +b}{c\tau +d}},{\frac {z}{c\tau +d}}\right)=(c\tau +d)^{k}e^{\frac {2\pi imcz^{2}}{c\tau +d}}\phi (\tau ,z){\text{ for }}{a\ b \choose c\ d}\in \mathrm {SL} _{2}(\mathbb {Z} )} ϕ ϕ ( τ τ , z + λ λ τ τ + μ μ ) = e − − 2 π π i m ( λ λ 2 τ τ + 2 λ λ z ) ϕ ϕ ( τ τ , z ) {\displaystyle \phi (\tau ,z+\lambda \tau +\mu )=e^{-2\pi im(\lambda ^{2}\tau +2\lambda z)}\phi (\tau ,z)} for all integers λ, μ.

ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } has a Fourier expansion ϕ ϕ ( τ τ , z ) = ∑ ∑ n ≥ ≥ 0 ∑ ∑ r 2 ≤ ≤ 4 m n C ( n , r ) e 2 π π i ( n τ τ + r z ) .

{\displaystyle \phi (\tau ,z)=\sum _{n\geq 0}\sum _{r^{2}\leq 4mn}C(n,r)e^{2\pi i(n\tau +rz)}.} Examples [ edit ] Examples in two variables include Jacobi theta functions , the Weierstrass ℘ function , and Fourier–Jacobi coefficients of Siegel modular forms of genus 2. Examples with more than two variables include characters of some irreducible highest-weight representations of affine Kac–Moody algebras . Meromorphic Jacobi forms appear in the theory of Mock modular forms .
