The eight schools compete annually in men's basketball.

The following is a list of past conference champions and a list of notable players. At the conclusion of the regular season the team with the best league record is crowned league champion. If two or more teams are tied for first place at the end of the season the league title is shared. Prior to 2017, the league champion received the league's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament .

In the event of a shared title a playoff would be held to determine the league's automatic bid. Beginning in 2017 a tournament consisting of the top four teams in the standings is held to determine the recipient of the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. However, the league championship is still based on regular season standings. The Ivy League was the last Division I conference without a tournament following the regular season.
