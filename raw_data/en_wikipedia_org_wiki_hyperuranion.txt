[ 5 ] As a perfect realm of Forms , [ 3 ] the hyperuranion is within Plato's view that the idea of a phenomenon is beyond the realm of real phenomena and that everything we experience in our lives is merely a copy of a perfect model.

[ 6 ] It is described as higher than the gods since their divinity depended on the knowledge of the hyperuranion beings.

[ 4 ] The hyperuranion doctrine is also a later medieval concept that claims God within the Empyrean exists outside of heaven and controls it as the prime mover from there for heaven even to be a part of the moved .

[ 1 ] The French alchemist Jean d'Espagnet rejected the idea of hyperuranion in his work Enchiridion , where he maintained that nature is not divided into conceptual categories but exists in unity.
