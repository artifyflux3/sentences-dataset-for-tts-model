Australians of English birth or descent Ethnic group English Australians Total population 8,385,928 (by ancestry, 2021 ) [ 1 ] ( 33% of the Australian population ) 927,490 (by birth, 2021 ) Regions with significant populations All states and territories of Australia Languages English Religion Christianity Anglicanism Catholicism Irreligion [ 2 ] Related ethnic groups Anglo-Celtic Australians , Scottish Australians , Irish Australians , Welsh Australians , Cornish Australians Part of a series on English people Culture Music Language Cuisine Dance Religion People Diaspora United States Canada Australia Argentina Chile Paraguay Nicaragua New Zealand v t e English Australians , also known as Anglo-Australians , [ 3 ] are Australians whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England . In the 2021 census , 8,385,928 people, or 33% of the Australian population, stated that they had English ancestry (whether sole or partial).

[ 1 ] It is the largest self-identified ancestry in Australia.

[ 1 ] People of ethnic English origin have been the largest group to migrate to Australia since the establishment of the Colony of New South Wales in 1788.

[ 4 ] English Australians are a subset of Anglo-Celtic Australians , who are themselves a subset of European Australians . Other subsets of Anglo-Celtic Australians (that is, Australians with ancestry originating in the British Isles ) include Irish Australians , Scottish Australians and Welsh Australians . There is a tendency to refer to these ancestries collectively due to their long history in Australia and the high degree of intermixture which has occurred over centuries. In light of this history, there is a tendency for Australians with English or other Anglo-Celtic ancestries to simply identify their ancestry as ' Australian '.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( May 2025 ) 18th and 19th centuries [ edit ] Population born in England New South Wales 1846-1891 Year Population Ref(s) 1851 51,122 [ 6 ] 1861 84,152 [ 6 ] 1871 87,334 [ 6 ] 1881 107,574 [ 6 ] 1891 149,232 [ 6 ] New South Wales was established in 1788 by the British government as a penal colony.

[ 7 ] Visitors described the English character of Sydney for at least the first 50 years after 1788, noting the traditional English appearance of the churches overlooking the convict barracks. First-generation colonial Sydney residents were predominantly English. 160,000 convicts came to Australia between 1788 and 1850.

[ 8 ] Between 1788 and 1840, 80,000 English convicts were transported to New South Wales, with the greatest numbers coming between 1825 and 1835. The New South Wales Census of 1846 accounted for 57,349 born in England, 47,547 born in Ireland and 14,406 born in Scotland.

[ 9 ] Until 1859, 2.2 million (73%) of the free settlers who immigrated were British in origin.

[ 10 ] Many more English people immigrated to Victoria by the gold rush of the 1850s. By 1854 there were 97,943 English-born people in Victoria. Immigration policies and assistance schemes helped maintain high levels of immigration from England. Of the 1 million immigrants who arrived between 1860 and 1900, just over half came from England.

[ 11 ] Between 1840 and 1870 there were more Irish than English assisted migrants which did not change until the 1870s, when there were more English.

[ 9 ] At least 75 per cent of all overseas-born people in Australia during the 19th century were from the British Isles . The proportion who had been born in England or Wales remained quite stable (at about 47 per cent) from 1861 to 1911, as did the proportion born in Scotland (about 12 per cent).

[ 12 ] English settlers more often came from the South than the North of England .

[ 13 ] Post-Federation English immigration [ edit ] Population born in England, 1911–present Year Population Ref(s) 1911 346,030 [ 14 ] 1921 446,124 [ 15 ] 1933 486,831 [ 16 ] 1947 381,592 [ 17 ] 1954 478,411 [ 18 ] 1961 556,478 [ 18 ] 1971 842,032 [ 19 ] 1981 889,124 [ 20 ] 1991 896,336 [ 21 ] 2001 847,365 [ 22 ] 2011 911,593 [ 23 ] 2021 927,490 [ 24 ] 2021 [ 25 ] No Religion (46.4%) Anglicanism (29.9%) Catholicism (10.4%) Not stated (2.50%) Uniting Church (1.70%) Other Christian (9.00%) Australians of English ancestry made up more than 50 per cent of the population at the time of Federation (1901).

[ 26 ] From 1922 the Empire Settlement Act assisted thousands of migrants from England. After the Second World War, even as immigration from other countries expanded dramatically, English citizens had almost unrestricted entry into Australia. Arthur Calwell, Minister for Immigration, wanted nine out of ten new immigrants to be UK-born.

[ 11 ] The majority of England-born migrants received assisted passages until the scheme was abolished in 1982.

[ citation needed ] Among the notable English-born were politicians such as Henry Parkes , and Joseph Cook ; in retailing and media: John Norton , Anthony Hordern and John Fairfax .

[ 9 ] Surges of English immigration in the 1910s, 1920s, 1950s and 1960s sustained the English-born as the largest single immigrant group throughout the 20th century.

[ 9 ] In 1978 Australians of predominantly English ancestry made up over 45 per cent of the population.

[ 27 ] English ancestry was reported by 6.6 million people (46%) in 1986, and 6.4 million (37%) in 2001.

[ 28 ] While the English-born continue to be well-represented among immigrants to Australia, the overall decline of English immigration to Australia since the 1980s has meant that the English-born are declining as a proportion of immigrants to Australia. Regardless, Australian society continues to be influenced by its strong English heritage.

[ 4 ] Demographics [ edit ] English Total Responses as a fraction of total persons, in Inner Sydney, Australia, according to the 2011 census results.

In the 2021 census , 8,385,928 people, or 33% of the Australian population, stated that they had English ancestry (whether wholly or partial).

[ 29 ] Year Population % Population change % change Ref(s) 1986 6,607,228 42.3 [ 30 ] 2001 6,358,880 33.9 248,348 [ 31 ] 2006 6,283,647 31.6 75,233 [ 32 ] 2011 7,238,533 33.7 954,886 [ 33 ] 2016 7,852,224 36.1 613,691 [ 34 ] 2021 8,385,928 33.0 533,704 [ 24 ] Cultural influence [ edit ] People of English descent were by far the single most influential ethnic group in colonial Australia.

[ 35 ] The founding of Australia by English people is still evident in place names, Australia's common law legal system, popular dishes such as fish and chips and Sunday Roast and English as Australia's national language.

[ citation needed ] In Sydney, at least 50 suburban names are derived directly from 20 English counties , of which the largest numbers are from Kent , Surrey and London . Among the best known are Surry Hills , Croydon , Hornsby , Epping , Chipping Norton , Brighton-le-Sands , Bexley , Canterbury , Ryde , Kensington , Lewisham and Penshurst .
