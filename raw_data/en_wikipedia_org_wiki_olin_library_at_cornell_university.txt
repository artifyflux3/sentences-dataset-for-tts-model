[ 3 ] Olin Library was built on the site of Boardman Hall, which was torn down in 1958-9.

[ 4 ] Charles H. Warner of Warner, Burns, Toan & Lunde designed the building as a massive seven story edifice, with open research spaces on the first floor and private work areas and cavernous stacks on the upper floors.

[ 5 ] Stone pillars and retaining walls flank the exterior of the first floor.
