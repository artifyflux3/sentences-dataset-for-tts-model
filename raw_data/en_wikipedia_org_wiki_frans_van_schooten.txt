**Frans van Schooten Jr.** also rendered as **Franciscus van Schooten** (15 May 1615 – 29 May 1660) was a Dutch [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") who is most known for popularizing the [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") of [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"). He translated [La Géométrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie "La Géométrie") in Latin and wrote commentaries and explanations to it.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten#cite_note-1) Because most contemporary scientists and mathematicians in Europe knew the invention of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") through Van Schooten's edition, with its extensive commentaries by [Johannes Hudde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hudde "Johannes Hudde"), [Johan de Witt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_de_Witt "Johan de Witt"), and [Hendrik van Heuraet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_van_Heuraet "Hendrik van Heuraet"), he had a significant influence on the science and mathematics of Europe at the time; especially on the invention of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") by [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton").

Van Schooten's father, [Frans van Schooten Senior](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frans_van_Schooten_Senior&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frans van Schooten Senior (page does not exist)")[[nl](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten_Sr. "nl:Frans van Schooten Sr.")] was a professor of mathematics at the [University of Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leiden "University of Leiden"), having [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), [Johann van Waveren Hudde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_van_Waveren_Hudde "Johann van Waveren Hudde"), and [René de Sluze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_de_Sluze "René de Sluze") as students.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten#cite_note-2)

Van Schooten met Descartes in 1632 and read his _Géométrie_ (an appendix to his _Discours de la méthode_) while it was still unpublished.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten#cite_note-3) Finding it hard to understand, he went to France to study the works of other important mathematicians of his time, such as [François Viète](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Vi%C3%A8te "François Viète") and [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat"). Frans van Schooten returned home to [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden "Leiden") in 1643 to assist his father and, two years later, inherited his father's position as professor at Leiden's Engineering School. One of his most important pupils at this time was Huygens.

The pendant marriage portraits of him and his wife Margrieta Wijnants were painted by [Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt "Rembrandt") and are kept in the [National Gallery of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art "National Gallery of Art"):[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten#cite_note-4)

_Exercitationum mathematicarum libri_, 1656-1657

Van Schooten's 1649 Latin translation of and commentary on Descartes' _Géométrie_ was valuable in that it made the work comprehensible to the broader mathematical community, and thus was responsible for the spread of analytic geometry to the world.

Over the next decade he enlisted the aid of other mathematicians of the time, [de Beaune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florimond_de_Beaune "Florimond de Beaune"), [Hudde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hudde "Johannes Hudde"), [Heuraet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_van_Heuraet "Hendrik van Heuraet"), [de Witt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_de_Witt "Johan de Witt") and expanded the commentaries to two volumes, published in 1659 and 1661. This edition and its extensive commentaries was far more influential than the 1649 edition. It was this edition that [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") knew.

Van Schooten was one of the first to suggest, in exercises published in 1657, that these ideas be extended to three-dimensional space. Van Schooten's efforts also made Leiden the centre of the mathematical community for a short period in the middle of the seventeenth century.

In elementary geometry [Van Schooten's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schooten%27s_theorem "Van Schooten's theorem") is named after him.
