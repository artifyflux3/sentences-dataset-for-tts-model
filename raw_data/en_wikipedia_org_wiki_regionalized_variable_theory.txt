Find sources: "Regionalized variable theory" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Regionalized variable theory ( RVT ) is a geostatistical method used for interpolation in space.

[ 1 ] The concept of the theory is that interpolation from points in space should not be based on a smooth continuous object. It should be, however, based on a stochastic model that takes into consideration the various trends in the original set of points. The theory considers that within any dataset, three types of relationships can be detected: Structural part, which is also called the trend.

Correlated variation.

Uncorrelated variation, or noise.

After defining the above three relationships, RVT then applies the first law of geography , in order to predict the unknown values of points. The major application of this theory is the Kriging method for interpolation.
