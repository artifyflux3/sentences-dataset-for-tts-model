Formally, given a group G under a binary operation ∗, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation ∗. More precisely, H is a subgroup of G if the restriction of ∗ to H × H is a group operation on H . This is often denoted H ≤ G , read as " H is a subgroup of G ".

The trivial subgroup of any group is the subgroup { e } consisting of just the identity element.

[ 1 ] A proper subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H which is a proper subset of G (that is, H ≠ G ). This is often represented notationally by H < G , read as " H is a proper subgroup of G ". Some authors also exclude the trivial group from being proper (that is, H ≠ { e }​ ).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] If H is a subgroup of G , then G is sometimes called an overgroup of H .

The same definitions apply more generally when G is an arbitrary semigroup , but this article will only deal with subgroups of groups.

Subgroup tests [ edit ] Suppose that G is a group, and H is a subset of G .  For now, assume that the group operation of G is written multiplicatively, denoted by juxtaposition.

Then H is a subgroup of G if and only if H is nonempty and closed under products and inverses.

Closed under products means that for every a and b in H , the product ab is in H .

Closed under inverses means that for every a in H , the inverse a −1 is in H . These two conditions can be combined into one, that for every a and b in H , the element ab −1 is in H , but it is more natural and usually just as easy to test the two closure conditions separately.

[ 4 ] When H is finite , the test can be simplified: H is a subgroup if and only if it is nonempty and closed under products. These conditions alone imply that every element a of H generates a finite cyclic subgroup of H , say of order n , and then the inverse of a is a n −1 .

[ 4 ] If the group operation is instead denoted by addition, then closed under products should be replaced by closed under addition , which is the condition that for every a and b in H , the sum a + b is in H , and closed under inverses should be edited to say that for every a in H , the inverse − a is in H .

Basic properties of subgroups [ edit ] The identity of a subgroup is the identity of the group: if G is a group with identity e G , and H is a subgroup of G with identity e H , then e H = e G .

The inverse of an element in a subgroup is the inverse of the element in the group: if H is a subgroup of a group G , and a and b are elements of H such that ab = ba = e H , then ab = ba = e G .

If H is a subgroup of G , then the inclusion map H → G sending each element a of H to itself is a homomorphism .

The intersection of subgroups A and B of G is again a subgroup of G .

[ 5 ] For example, the intersection of the x -axis and y -axis in ⁠ R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} ⁠ under addition is the trivial subgroup.  More generally, the intersection of an arbitrary collection of subgroups of G is a subgroup of G .

The union of subgroups A and B is a subgroup if and only if A ⊆ B or B ⊆ A .  A non-example: ⁠ 2 Z ∪ ∪ 3 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} \cup 3\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ is not a subgroup of ⁠ Z , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ,} ⁠ because 2 and 3 are elements of this subset whose sum, 5, is not in the subset.   Similarly, the union of the x -axis and the y -axis in ⁠ R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} ⁠ is not a subgroup of ⁠ R 2 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.} ⁠ If S is a subset of G , then there exists a smallest subgroup containing S , namely the intersection of all of subgroups containing S ; it is denoted by ⟨ S ⟩ and is called the subgroup generated by S . An element of G is in ⟨ S ⟩ if and only if it is a finite product of elements of S and their inverses, possibly repeated.

[ 6 ] Every element a of a group G generates a cyclic subgroup ⟨ a ⟩ . If ⟨ a ⟩ is isomorphic to ⁠ Z / n Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ ( the integers mod n ) for some positive integer n , then n is the smallest positive integer for which a n = e , and n is called the order of a . If ⟨ a ⟩ is isomorphic to ⁠ Z , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ,} ⁠ then a is said to have infinite order .

The subgroups of any given group form a complete lattice under inclusion, called the lattice of subgroups . (While the infimum here is the usual set-theoretic intersection, the supremum of a set of subgroups is the subgroup generated by the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If e is the identity of G , then the trivial group { e } is the minimum subgroup of G , while the maximum subgroup is the group G itself.

G is the group Z / 8 Z , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /8\mathbb {Z} ,} the integers mod 8 under addition. The subgroup H contains only 0 and 4, and is isomorphic to Z / 2 Z .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} .} There are four left cosets of H : H itself, 1 + H , 2 + H , and 3 + H (written using additive notation since this is an additive group ). Together they partition the entire group G into equal-size, non-overlapping sets. The index [ G : H ] is 4.

Cosets and Lagrange's theorem [ edit ] Main articles: Coset and Lagrange's theorem (group theory) Given a subgroup H and some a in G , we define the left coset aH = { ah : h in H }.

Because a is invertible, the map φ : H → aH given by φ( h ) = ah is a bijection . Furthermore, every element of G is contained in precisely one left coset of H ; the left cosets are the equivalence classes corresponding to the equivalence relation a 1 ~ a 2 if and only if ⁠ a 1 − − 1 a 2 {\displaystyle a_{1}^{-1}a_{2}} ⁠ is in H . The number of left cosets of H is called the index of H in G and is denoted by [ G : H ] .

Lagrange's theorem states that for a finite group G and a subgroup H , [ G : H ] = | G | | H | {\displaystyle [G:H]={|G| \over |H|}} where | G | and | H | denote the orders of G and H , respectively. In particular, the order of every subgroup of G (and the order of every element of G ) must be a divisor of | G | .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Right cosets are defined analogously: Ha = { ha : h in H }.

They are also the equivalence classes for a suitable equivalence relation and their number is equal to [ G : H ] .

If aH = Ha for every a in G , then H is said to be a normal subgroup . Every subgroup of index 2 is normal: the left cosets, and also the right cosets, are simply the subgroup and its complement. More generally, if p is the lowest prime dividing the order of a finite group G , then any subgroup of index p (if such exists) is normal.

Example: Subgroups of Z 8 [ edit ] Let G be the cyclic group Z 8 whose elements are G = { 0 , 4 , 2 , 6 , 1 , 5 , 3 , 7 } {\displaystyle G=\left\{0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7\right\}} and whose group operation is addition modulo 8 . Its Cayley table is + 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 0 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 4 4 0 6 2 5 1 7 3 2 2 6 4 0 3 7 5 1 6 6 2 0 4 7 3 1 5 1 1 5 3 7 2 6 4 0 5 5 1 7 3 6 2 0 4 3 3 7 5 1 4 0 6 2 7 7 3 1 5 0 4 2 6 This group has two nontrivial subgroups: ■ J = {0, 4} and ■ H = {0, 4, 2, 6} , where J is also a subgroup of H .  The Cayley table for H is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for G ; The Cayley table for J is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for H .  The group G is cyclic , and so are its subgroups.  In general, subgroups of cyclic groups are also cyclic.

[ 9 ] Example: Subgroups of S 4 [ edit ] S 4 is the symmetric group whose elements correspond to the permutations of 4 elements.

Below are all its subgroups, ordered by cardinality.

Each group (except those of cardinality 1 and 2) is represented by its Cayley table .

24 elements [ edit ] Like each group, S 4 is a subgroup of itself.

Symmetric group S 4 All 30 subgroups Simplified Hasse diagrams of the lattice of subgroups of S 4 12 elements [ edit ] The alternating group contains only the even permutations .

It is one of the two nontrivial proper normal subgroups of S 4 .

(The other one is its Klein subgroup.)

Other examples [ edit ] The even integers form a subgroup ⁠ 2 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ of the integer ring ⁠ Z : {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} :} ⁠ the sum of two even integers is even, and the negative of an even integer is even.

An ideal in a ring R is a subgroup of the additive group of R .

A linear subspace of a vector space is a subgroup of the additive group of vectors.

In an abelian group , the elements of finite order form a subgroup called the torsion subgroup .
