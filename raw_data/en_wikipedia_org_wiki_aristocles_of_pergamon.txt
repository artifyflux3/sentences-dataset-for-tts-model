Aristocles of Pergamon ( / ə ˈ r ɪ s t ə ˌ k l iː z / ; Ancient Greek : Ἀριστοκλῆς ὁ ἐκ τοῦ Περγάμου ) was a sophist and rhetorician who lived in the time of the Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian . He spent the early part of his life on the study of Peripatetic philosophy , and during this period he completely neglected his outward appearance. But afterwards he was seized by the desire of becoming a rhetorician, and went to Rome, where he enrolled himself among the pupils of Herodes Atticus . After his return to Pergamus, he made a complete change in his mode of life, and appears to have enjoyed a great reputation as a teacher of rhetoric. His declamations are praised for their perspicacity and for the purity of the Attic Greek; but they were wanting in passion and animation, and resembled philosophical discussions. In the Suda , it is ascribed to him a work on rhetoric ( Ancient Greek : τέχνη ῥητορική ), letters, declamations, and other subjects.
