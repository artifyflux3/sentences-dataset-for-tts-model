In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") field of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), a **singular point** of an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety")_V_ is a point _P_ that is 'special' (so, singular), in the geometric sense that at this point the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at the variety may not be regularly defined. In case of varieties defined over the [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), this notion generalizes the notion of [local non-flatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_flatness "Local flatness"). A point of an algebraic variety that is not singular is said to be **regular**. An algebraic variety that has no singular point is said to be **non-singular** or **smooth**. The concept is generalized to [smooth schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_scheme "Smooth scheme") in the modern language of [scheme theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_theory "Scheme theory").

The [plane algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_algebraic_curve "Plane algebraic curve") (a [cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve")) of equation _y_ 2 − _x_ 2(_x_ + 1) = 0 crosses itself at the origin (0, 0). The origin is a [double point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_point "Double point") of this curve. It is _singular_ because a single [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") may not be correctly defined there.

A [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") defined by an [implicit equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation")

where _F_ is a [smooth function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") is said to be _singular_ at a point if the [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") of _F_ has [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series#Order_of_a_power_series "Power series") at least 2 at this point.

The reason for this is that, in [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus"), the tangent at the point (_x_ 0, _y_ 0) of such a curve is defined by the equation

![Image 3: {\displaystyle (x-x_{0})F'_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})+(y-y_{0})F'_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29799a483262c56628d4cedb6b623591703f91e2)
whose left-hand side is the term of degree one of the Taylor expansion. Thus, if this term is zero, the tangent may not be defined in the standard way, either because it does not exist or a special definition must be provided.

In general for a [hypersurface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface "Hypersurface")

![Image 4: {\displaystyle F(x,y,z,\ldots )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee790efac11d03d6783b45a08b12e2b3276dfbb9)
the **singular points** are those at which all the [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") simultaneously vanish. A general [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety")_V_ being defined as the common zeros of several [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), the condition on a point _P_ of _V_ to be a singular point is that the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix "Jacobian matrix") of the first-order partial derivatives of the polynomials has a [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_matrix "Rank of a matrix") at _P_ that is lower than the rank at other points of the variety.

Points of _V_ that are not singular are called **non-singular** or **regular**. It is always true that almost all points are non-singular, in the sense that the non-singular points form a set that is both [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") and [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set "Dense set") in the variety (for the [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology"), as well as for the usual topology, in the case of varieties defined over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-1)

In case of a real variety (that is the set of the points with real coordinates of a variety defined by polynomials with real coefficients), the variety is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") near every regular point. But it is important to note that a real variety may be a manifold and have singular points. For example the equation _y_ 3 + 2 _x_ 2 _y_ − _x_ 4 = 0 defines a real [analytic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_manifold "Analytic manifold") but has a singular point at the origin.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-2) This may be explained by saying that the curve has two [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate "Complex conjugate")[branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(complex_analysis) "Branch (complex analysis)") that cut the real branch at the origin.

Singular points of smooth mappings
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Singular points of smooth mappings")]

As the notion of singular points is a purely local property, the above definition can be extended to cover the wider class of [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") mappings (functions from _M_ to **R**_n_ where all derivatives exist). Analysis of these singular points can be reduced to the algebraic variety case by considering the [jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics) "Jet (mathematics)") of the mapping. The _k_ th jet is the [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") of the mapping truncated at degree _k_ and deleting the [constant term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term "Constant term").

In [classical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_classical_algebraic_geometry "Glossary of classical algebraic geometry"), certain special singular points were also called **nodes**. A node is a singular point where the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix "Hessian matrix") is non-singular; this implies that the singular point has multiplicity two and the [tangent cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_cone "Tangent cone") is not singular outside its vertex.
