Given frequency ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } in Hz and radiative flux density S ν ν {\displaystyle S_{\nu }} in Jy , the spectral index α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is given implicitly by S ν ν ∝ ∝ ν ν α α .

{\displaystyle S_{\nu }\propto \nu ^{\alpha }.} Note that if flux does not follow a power law in frequency, the spectral index itself is a function of frequency. Rearranging the above, we see that the spectral index is given by α α ( ν ν ) = ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ S ν ν ( ν ν ) ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ ν ν .

{\displaystyle \alpha \!\left(\nu \right)={\frac {\partial \log S_{\nu }\!\left(\nu \right)}{\partial \log \nu }}.} Clearly the power law can only apply over a certain range of frequency because otherwise the integral over all frequencies would be infinite.

Spectral index is also sometimes defined in terms of wavelength λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } . In this case, the spectral index α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is given implicitly by S λ λ ∝ ∝ λ λ α α , {\displaystyle S_{\lambda }\propto \lambda ^{\alpha },} and at a given frequency, spectral index may be calculated by taking the derivative α α ( λ λ ) = ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ S λ λ ( λ λ ) ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ λ λ .

{\displaystyle \alpha \!\left(\lambda \right)={\frac {\partial \log S_{\lambda }\!\left(\lambda \right)}{\partial \log \lambda }}.} The spectral index using the S ν ν {\displaystyle S_{\nu }} , which we may call α α ν ν , {\displaystyle \alpha _{\nu },} differs from the index α α λ λ {\displaystyle \alpha _{\lambda }} defined using S λ λ .

{\displaystyle S_{\lambda }.} The total flux between two frequencies or wavelengths is S = C 1 ( ν ν 2 α α ν ν + 1 − − ν ν 1 α α ν ν + 1 ) = C 2 ( λ λ 2 α α λ λ + 1 − − λ λ 1 α α λ λ + 1 ) = c α α λ λ + 1 C 2 ( ν ν 2 − − α α λ λ − − 1 − − ν ν 1 − − α α λ λ − − 1 ) {\displaystyle S=C_{1}\left(\nu _{2}^{\alpha _{\nu }+1}-\nu _{1}^{\alpha _{\nu }+1}\right)=C_{2}\left(\lambda _{2}^{\alpha _{\lambda }+1}-\lambda _{1}^{\alpha _{\lambda }+1}\right)=c^{\alpha _{\lambda }+1}C_{2}\left(\nu _{2}^{-\alpha _{\lambda }-1}-\nu _{1}^{-\alpha _{\lambda }-1}\right)} which implies that α α λ λ = − − α α ν ν − − 2.

{\displaystyle \alpha _{\lambda }=-\alpha _{\nu }-2.} The opposite sign convention is sometimes employed, [ 1 ] in which the spectral index is given by S ν ν ∝ ∝ ν ν − − α α .

{\displaystyle S_{\nu }\propto \nu ^{-\alpha }.} The spectral index of a source can hint at its properties. For example, using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of the emission from an optically thin thermal plasma is -0.1, whereas for an optically thick plasma it is 2. Therefore, a spectral index of -0.1 to 2 at radio frequencies often indicates thermal emission , while a steep negative spectral index typically indicates synchrotron emission . The observed emission can be affected by several absorption processes that affect the low-frequency emission the most; the reduction in the observed emission at low frequencies might result in a positive spectral index even if the intrinsic emission has a negative index. Therefore, it is not straightforward to associate positive spectral indices with thermal emission.

Spectral index of thermal emission [ edit ] At radio frequencies (i.e. in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit), where the Rayleigh–Jeans law is a good approximation to the spectrum of thermal radiation , intensity is given by B ν ν ( T ) ≃ ≃ 2 ν ν 2 k T c 2 .

{\displaystyle B_{\nu }(T)\simeq {\frac {2\nu ^{2}kT}{c^{2}}}.} Taking the logarithm of each side and taking the partial derivative with respect to log ν ν {\displaystyle \log \,\nu } yields ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ B ν ν ( T ) ∂ ∂ log ⁡ ⁡ ν ν ≃ ≃ 2.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \log B_{\nu }(T)}{\partial \log \nu }}\simeq 2.} Using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of thermal radiation is thus α α ≃ ≃ 2 {\displaystyle \alpha \simeq 2} in the Rayleigh–Jeans regime. The spectral index departs from this value at shorter wavelengths, for which the Rayleigh–Jeans law becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation, tending towards zero as intensity reaches a peak at a frequency given by Wien's displacement law . Because of the simple temperature-dependence of radiative flux in the Rayleigh–Jeans regime, the radio spectral index is defined implicitly by [ 2 ] S ∝ ∝ ν ν α α T .
