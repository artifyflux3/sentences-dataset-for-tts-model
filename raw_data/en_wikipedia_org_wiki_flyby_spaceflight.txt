[ 1 ] Spacecraft which are specifically designed for this purpose are known as flyby spacecraft, although the term has also been used in regard to asteroid flybys of Earth for example.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Important parameters are the time and distance of closest approach.

[ 4 ] Spacecraft flyby [ edit ] See also: List of planetary flybys Flyby maneuvers can be conducted with a planet , a natural satellite or a non-planetary object such as a small Solar System body .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Planetary flybys have occurred with Mars or Earth for example: List of Earth flybys Mars flyby An example of a comet flyby is when International Cometary Explorer (formerly ISEE-3) passed about 4,800 miles (7,700 km) from the nucleus of Comet Giacobini-Zinner in September 1985.

[ 7 ] Another application of the flyby is of Earth's Moon, usually called a lunar flyby .

[ 8 ] The Apollo 13 spacecraft had an exploded oxygen tank, and therefore had to flyby around the Moon.

[ 9 ] The Artemis 2 [ 10 ] will include a lunar flyby.

Mars [ edit ] Illustration of the MarCO 6U cubesat relay flyby probes and technology demonstrators for the Mars InSight lander; the flybys provided bent pipe communication support during the landing in 2018 In regards to Mars flybys, a related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where a spacecraft does not enter orbit but rendezvous before or after a flyby of the planet with another spacecraft.

[ 11 ] Mars flyby rendezvous was evaluated at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in the 1960s.

[ 11 ] At that time NASA developed designs for a combination of a Mars lander, short-stay surface habitat, and ascent vehicle called a Mars Excursion Module (MEM); the ascent stage performed the rendezvous with a different spacecraft that did a flyby of Mars without entering orbit or landing.

[ 11 ] Compared to MOR, a flyby rendezvous means one spacecraft does not have to orbit Mars, so the resources needed on a return journey to Earth are not taken in and out of Mars orbit for example.

[ 11 ] (See also Mars cycler ) Mariner IV flyby of Mars in July 1965 returned more accurate atmospheric data about Mars and much closer views of its surface then previously.

[ 12 ] Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 flyby of Mars in 1969 caused another breakthrough in knowledge about the planet.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Mariner 6 & 7 infrared radiometer results from the flyby showed that the atmosphere of Mars was composed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and they were also able to detect trace amounts of water on the surface of Mars .

[ 15 ] Rosetta , [ 16 ] swung by around Mars at a distance of 250 km [ 17 ] and performed a gravity assist. This is the closest flyby of Mars.

In 2018, the twin Mars Cube One performed a flyby to relay communication for InSight lander EDL (they were launched towards Mars with the cruise stage carrying the InSight lander).

[ 18 ] Both MarCOs reached Mars and successfully relayed data during the Entry, Descent, and Landing phase of Insight on November 26, 2018.

[ 19 ] Meanwhile, Tianwen-1 Deployable Camera , imaged Tianwen-1 in on its transit to Mars, in September 2020 and made a flyby of Mars around 10 February, 2021 according to its trajectory thought for Mars, before entering the deep space or a solar orbit.

Kuiper belt [ edit ] On the night of December 31, 2018 to the morning of January 1, 2019 New Horizons performed the most distant flyby to date, of the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth.

[ 20 ] New Horizons previously did a flyby of Pluto in July 2015, and that was at about 32.9 AU ( astronomical units ) from the Sun, while the New Year's Day 2019 flyby of the Kuiper object Arrokoth was at 43.6 AU.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Diagram of the trajectory of New Horizons during its flyby of Pluto Cassini [ edit ] Animation of Cassini 's trajectory around Saturn from 1 May 2004 to 15 September 2017 Cassini · Saturn · Enceladus · Titan · Iapetus Cassini-Huygens (launched 1997), which orbited Saturn (from 2004–2017) performed flybys of many of Saturn's moons including Titan .

[ 23 ] Cassini-Huygen ' s had its first flyby of Titan in October 2004.

[ 24 ] For further examples of Cassini flybys of Saturn's moons see Timeline of Cassini-Huygens .

Cassini conducted many flybys at various distances of the moons of Saturn .

[ 25 ] It achieved 126 flybys of Titan, and its final close flyby was on April 22, 2017 prior to its retirement.

[ 26 ] An animation of the Cassini spacecraft trajectory around Saturn over 10 years, during which it passed closely by many moons of Saturn , is at right.

Comets [ edit ] Further information: List of minor planets and comets visited by spacecraft § List of comets visited by spacecraft Flyby of comet Hartley 2 on Nov. 4, 2010 ( EPOXI mission) International Cometary Explorer ( ISEE-3 ) passed through the plasma tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner doing a flyby of the distance of 7,800 km (4,800 mi) of the nucleus on September 11, 1985.

[ 27 ] In 2010, the Deep Impact spacecraft, on the EPOXI mission did a flyby of comet Hartley 2.

[ 28 ] Natural flyby [ edit ] During an asteroid flyby of Earth, sometimes they are imaged by radar. Animation of 2014 JO 25 , which had an Earth flyby in 2017 Flyby is also sometimes loosely used to describe when, for example, an asteroid approaches and coasts by the Earth.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] This was also the term for when a comet did a flyby of Mars in 2014.

[ 31 ] P/2016 BA14 was radar imaged at distance of 2.2 million miles (3,500,000 km) from Earth in 2016, during its flyby.

[ 32 ] This enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to about 3,300 feet (1 km) in diameter.

[ 33 ] On December 16, 2018 the short period comet 46P/Wirtanen had its closest approach of Earth, coming within  7.1 million miles or 11.4 million kilometres (one of its closest approaches to Earth).
