A high altitude platform can provide observation or communication services.

A **high-altitude platform station** (**HAPS**, which can also mean **high-altitude pseudo-satellite** or **high-altitude platform systems**), also known as **atmospheric satellite**, is a long [endurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_(aeronautics) "Endurance (aeronautics)"), high altitude [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft") able to offer observation or communication services similarly to [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite"). Mostly [unmanned aerial vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle "Unmanned aerial vehicle") (UAVs), they remain aloft through atmospheric lift, either [aerodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_lift "Aerodynamic lift") like [airplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane"), or [aerostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat "Aerostat") like [airships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship") or [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aeronautics) "Balloon (aeronautics)"). High-altitude long endurance (HALE) [military drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_drone "Military drone") can fly above 60,000 ft (18,000 m) over 32 hours, while civil HAPS are [radio stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_station "Radio station") at an altitude of 20 to 50 km above waypoints, for weeks.

High-altitude, long endurance flight has been studied since at least 1983, and demonstrator programs since 1994. [Hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_aircraft "Hydrogen aircraft") and [solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power "Solar power") have been proposed as alternatives to conventional engines. Above commercial air transport and wind turbulence, at high altitudes, drag as well as lift are reduced. HAPS could be used for [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") monitoring, as a [radio relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_relay "Radio relay"), for [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography") or [earth imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_imaging "Earth imaging"), for [border security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_security "Border security"), [maritime patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_patrol "Maritime patrol") and anti-[piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy "Piracy") operations, [disaster response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_response "Disaster response"), or [agricultural observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture "Precision agriculture").

While [reconnaissance aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_aircraft "Reconnaissance aircraft") have been capable of reaching high altitudes since the 1950s, their endurance is limited. One of the few operational HALE aircraft is the [Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk "Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk"). There are many solar powered, lightweight prototypes like the [NASA Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Pathfinder "NASA Pathfinder")/[Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Helios "NASA Helios"), or the [Airbus Zephyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Zephyr "Airbus Zephyr") that can fly for 64 days; few are as advanced as these. Conventional [aviation fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_fuel "Aviation fuel") have been used in prototypes since 1970 and can fly for 60 hours like the [Boeing Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Condor "Boeing Condor"). [Hydrogen aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_aircraft "Hydrogen aircraft") can fly even longer, a week or longer, like the [AeroVironment Global Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment_Global_Observer "AeroVironment Global Observer").

Stratospheric airships are often presented as a competing technology. However few prototypes have been built and none are operational. Among balloons specifically, the most well known high-endurance project was [Google Loon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loon_LLC "Loon LLC"), using helium-filled high-altitude balloons to reach the stratosphere. Loon was ended in 2021.

High-altitude long endurance (HALE)High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) aircraft are non-weaponized [military drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_drone "Military drone") capable of flying at 60,000 ft (18,000 m) over 32 hours, like the USAF [RQ-4 Global Hawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RQ-4_Global_Hawk "RQ-4 Global Hawk") or its variants used for [ISR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence,_surveillance_and_reconnaissance "Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-defenseone27may2015-1) This is above and longer than [Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-Altitude,_Long-Endurance "Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance") (MALE) aircraft flying between 25,000 and 50,000 ft (7,600 and 15,200 m) during 24 hours, more vulnerable to [anti-aircraft defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_defense "Anti-aircraft defense"), like the [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF "USAF") ISR/strike [MQ-9 Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ-9_Reaper "MQ-9 Reaper") or its variants.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-defenseone27may2015-1)High-altitude platform station (HAPS)defined by the [International Telecommunication Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union") (ITU) as "_a [station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio\_station "Radio station") on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth_" in its [ITU Radio Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations "ITU Radio Regulations") (RR).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-2) HAPS can also be the abbreviation for **high-altitude pseudo-satellite**.

In 1983, [Lockheed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation "Lockheed Corporation") produced _A Preliminary Study of [solar powered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_powered\_aircraft "Solar powered aircraft") and Associated Power Trains_ for the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"), as long endurance flight could be compared to [suborbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suborbital "Suborbital") spacecraft.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-3) In 1984 was published the _Design of Long Endurance Unmanned Airplanes Incorporating Solar and [fuel cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel\_cell "Fuel cell") propulsion_ report.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-Nasa1jan2007-4) In 1989, the _Design and experimental results for a high-altitude, long-endurance airfoil_ report proposed applications as a [radio relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_relay "Radio relay"), for [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") monitoring or cruise [missile targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_guidance "Missile guidance").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-5)

The [NASA ERAST Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_ERAST_Program "NASA ERAST Program") (Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology) was started in September 1994 to study high-altitude UAVs, and was terminated in 2003.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-vectorsite1Mar2010-6) In July 1996, the USAF _Strikestar 2025_ report forecast HALE UAVs maintaining air occupation with 24 hours flights.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-USAFaug1996-7) The [Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Airborne_Reconnaissance_Office "Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office") made demonstrations of long-endurance UAV craft.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-USAFaug1996-7) In September 1996, [Israel Aircraft Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Aircraft_Industries "Israel Aircraft Industries") detailed the design of a HALE UAV.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-8)

In 2002, _Preliminary reliability design of a solar-powered high-altitude very long endurance unmanned air vehicle_ was published. The European Union [CAPECON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPECON "CAPECON") project aimed to develop HALE vehicles, while the [Polish Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Academy_of_Sciences "Polish Academy of Sciences") proposed its PW-114 concept that would fly at 20 km (66,000 ft) for 40 hours.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-9)[Luminati Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luminati_Aerospace&action=edit&redlink=1 "Luminati Aerospace (page does not exist)") proposed its Substrata solar-powered aircraft that would [fly in formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_flight "Formation flight") like migratory [geese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geese "Geese") to reduce the power required for the trailing aircraft by 79%, allowing smaller [airframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe") to remain aloft indefinitely up to a latitude of 50°.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-10)

Wind profile variation with altitude from NASA, showing minimum wind speeds between 17 and 22 km (56,000 and 72,000 ft). Although absolute values will vary, the trends shown are similar for most locations.

Power Power is required for continuous operation, limiting [endurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_(aeronautics) "Endurance (aeronautics)") by the need for refueling. Persistent [solar-powered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-powered_aircraft "Solar-powered aircraft") need to [store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage "Energy storage") daylight energy for the night, in [electric batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_batteries "Electric batteries"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-Fortune20130823-11) or in [fuel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell "Fuel cell").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-NASAheliosFact-12)Altitude selection Drag is reduced in the [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause") thin air, well above the 40–160 kn (74–296 km/h) high winds and [air traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic "Air traffic") of the high [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") between 20,000 to 35,000 ft (6,100 to 10,700 m).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-DefenseUpdate20feb2007-13) Maintaining a position facing variable winds is a challenge.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-TozerJune2001-14) Relatively mild wind and [turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-air_turbulence "Clear-air turbulence") above the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream") is found in most locations in the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") between 17 and 22 km (56,000 and 72,000 ft), although this is variable with the latitude and season.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-TozerJune2001-14) Altitudes above 55,000 ft (17,000 m) are also above [commercial air transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_air_transport "Commercial air transport").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-TozerJune2001-14) Flying in the [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause") at 65,000 ft (20,000 m) is above clouds and turbulence with winds below 5 kn (9 km/h), and above FAA-regulated [Class A airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_airspace "Class A airspace") ending at 60,000 ft (18,000 m).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-Fortune20130823-11)Comparison to satellites A lower altitude covers more effectively a small region, implies a lower telecommunications [link budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_budget "Link budget") (a 34 dB advantage over a [LEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"), 66 dB over [GEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit")), a lower power consumption, and a smaller [round-trip delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay "Round-trip delay").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-SkyLARC2001-15) Satellites are more expensive, take longer to deploy, and cannot be reasonably accessed for maintenance.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-SkyLARC2001-15) A [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") in the vacuum of space [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit") due to its high speed generating a centrifugal force matching the gravity.

Thales Alenia Stratobus[Thales Alenia Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Alenia_Space "Thales Alenia Space") develops the Stratobus unmanned, solar-powered stratospheric [airship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship"), 377 ft (115 m) long and weighting 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) including a 550 lb (250 kg) payload, it is designed for a five-year mission with annual servicing and a prototype was planned for late 2020.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-AvWeek12jan2018-27)H-Aero[H-Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-Aero "H-Aero") LTA-based launch systems for Mars exploration,[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-81) with development taking place via terrestrial high-altitude platforms. The first systems were tested by 2021.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-82)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]Stratoship SZ-155 The SZ-155 was designed and manufactured by Stratoship in Australia. The SZ-155 flew two low altitude test flights in 2022 and 2024 before reaching the stratosphere on its first high altitude flight on May 5th, 2025. It flew for 11 hours and 12 minutes in total, and spent over 8 hours in the stratosphere. The SZ-155 is 25 meters long and was designed for flights of up to 7 days endurance. It can carry up to 10kg of payload to the stratosphere. Stratoship is currently designing a future model for multi-month flights.[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Google_Loon_-_Launch_Event.jpg/250px-Google_Loon_-_Launch_Event.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Google_Loon_-_Launch_Event.jpg)

A **geostationary balloon satellite** (GBS) flies in the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") (60,000 to 70,000 ft (18 to 21 km) above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth's surface. At that altitude the air has 1/10 of its [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_density "Air density") is at [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level"). A GBS could be used to provide [broadband Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access "Broadband Internet access") over a large area.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-83) One prior project was the [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google")'s [Project Loon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Loon "Project Loon"), which envisioned using helium-filled [high-altitude balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloon "High-altitude balloon").

Boeing A160 Hummingbird The [Boeing A160 Hummingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_A160_Hummingbird "Boeing A160 Hummingbird") is a rotorcraft produced by Boeing.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_platform_station#cite_note-84) First flown in 2002, the program had goals of a 24-hour endurance, and 30,000 ft (9,100 m) altitude, but was abandoned in December 2012.
