"Atmospheric satellite" redirects here; not to be confused with Weather satellite .

A high altitude platform can provide observation or communication services.

A high-altitude platform station ( HAPS , which can also mean high-altitude pseudo-satellite or high-altitude platform systems ), also known as atmospheric satellite , is a long endurance , high altitude aircraft able to offer observation or communication services similarly to artificial satellites . Mostly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they remain aloft through atmospheric lift, either aerodynamic like airplanes , or aerostatic like airships or balloons .
High-altitude long endurance (HALE) military drones can fly above 60,000 ft (18,000 m) over 32 hours, while civil HAPS are radio stations at an altitude of 20 to 50 km above waypoints, for weeks.

High-altitude, long endurance flight has been studied since at least 1983, and demonstrator programs since  1994.

Hydrogen and solar power have been proposed as alternatives to conventional engines. 
Above commercial air transport and wind turbulence, at high altitudes, drag as well as lift are reduced.
HAPS could be used for weather monitoring, as a radio relay , for oceanography or earth imaging , for border security , maritime patrol and anti- piracy operations, disaster response , or agricultural observation .

While reconnaissance aircraft have been capable of reaching high altitudes since the 1950s, their endurance is limited.
One of the few operational HALE aircraft is the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk .
There are many solar powered, lightweight prototypes like the NASA Pathfinder / Helios , or the Airbus Zephyr that can fly for 64 days; few are as advanced as these.
Conventional aviation fuels have been used in prototypes since 1970 and can fly for 60 hours like the Boeing Condor .

Hydrogen aircraft can fly even longer, a week or longer, like the AeroVironment Global Observer .

Stratospheric airships are often presented as a competing technology. However few prototypes have been built and none are operational.
Among balloons specifically, the most well known high-endurance project was Google Loon , using helium-filled high-altitude balloons to reach the stratosphere. Loon was ended in 2021.

Definitions [ edit ] High-altitude long endurance (HALE) High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) aircraft are non-weaponized military drones capable of flying at 60,000 ft (18,000 m) over 32 hours, like the USAF RQ-4 Global Hawk or its variants used for ISR .

[ 1 ] This is above and longer than Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) aircraft flying between 25,000 and 50,000 ft (7,600 and 15,200 m) during 24 hours, more vulnerable to anti-aircraft defense , like the USAF ISR/strike MQ-9 Reaper or its variants.

[ 1 ] High-altitude platform station (HAPS) defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as " a station on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth " in its ITU Radio Regulations (RR).

[ 2 ] HAPS can also be the abbreviation for high-altitude pseudo-satellite .

See also: Radio station , Radiocommunication service , and Airship Studies [ edit ] Video of NASA Helios in flight In 1983, Lockheed produced A Preliminary Study of solar powered aircraft and Associated Power Trains for the NASA , as long endurance flight could be compared to suborbital spacecraft.

[ 3 ] In 1984 was published the Design of Long Endurance Unmanned Airplanes Incorporating Solar and fuel cell propulsion report.

[ 4 ] In 1989, the Design and experimental results for a high-altitude, long-endurance airfoil report proposed applications as a radio relay , for weather monitoring or cruise missile targeting .

[ 5 ] The NASA ERAST Program (Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology) was started in September 1994 to study high-altitude UAVs, and was terminated in 2003.

[ 6 ] In July 1996, the USAF Strikestar 2025 report forecast HALE UAVs maintaining air occupation with 24 hours flights.

[ 7 ] The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office made demonstrations of long-endurance UAV craft.

[ 7 ] In September 1996, Israel Aircraft Industries detailed the design of a HALE UAV.

[ 8 ] In 2002, Preliminary reliability design of a solar-powered high-altitude very long endurance unmanned air vehicle was published.
The European Union CAPECON project aimed to develop HALE vehicles, while the Polish Academy of Sciences proposed its PW-114 concept that would fly at 20 km (66,000 ft) for 40 hours.

[ 9 ] Luminati Aerospace proposed its Substrata solar-powered aircraft that would fly in formation like migratory geese to reduce the power required for the trailing aircraft by 79%, allowing smaller airframes to remain aloft indefinitely up to a latitude of 50°.

[ 10 ] Design [ edit ] Wind profile variation with altitude from NASA, showing minimum wind speeds between 17 and 22 km (56,000 and 72,000 ft). Although absolute values will vary, the trends shown are similar for most locations.

Power Power is required for continuous operation, limiting endurance by the need for refueling. Persistent solar-powered aircraft need to store daylight energy for the night, in electric batteries , [ 11 ] or in fuel cells .

[ 12 ] Altitude selection Drag is reduced in the tropopause thin air, well above the 40–160 kn (74–296 km/h) high winds and air traffic of the high troposphere between 20,000 to 35,000 ft (6,100 to 10,700 m).

[ 13 ] Maintaining a position facing variable winds is a challenge.

[ 14 ] Relatively mild wind and turbulence above the jet stream is found in most locations in the stratosphere between 17 and 22 km (56,000 and 72,000 ft), although this is variable with the latitude and season.

[ 14 ] Altitudes above 55,000 ft (17,000 m) are also above commercial air transport .

[ 14 ] Flying in the tropopause at 65,000 ft (20,000 m) is above clouds and turbulence with winds below 5 kn (9 km/h), and above FAA-regulated Class A airspace ending at 60,000 ft (18,000 m).

[ 11 ] Comparison to satellites A lower altitude covers more effectively a small region, implies a lower telecommunications link budget (a 34 dB advantage over a LEO , 66 dB over GEO ), a lower power consumption, and a smaller round-trip delay .

[ 15 ] Satellites are more expensive, take longer to deploy, and cannot be reasonably accessed for maintenance.

[ 15 ] A satellite in the vacuum of space orbits due to its high speed generating a centrifugal force matching the gravity. Changing a satellite orbit requires expending its extremely limited fuel supply.

Further information on Satellites: Satellite Applications [ edit ] Atmospheric satellites could be used for weather monitoring, as a radio relay , for oceanography or earth imaging like an orbital satellite for a fraction of the cost.

[ 11 ] Other uses include border security , maritime patrol and anti- piracy operations, disaster response , or agricultural observation .

[ 11 ] They could bring internet connectivity to the 5 billion people lacking it, either with 11,000 airplane UAVs or with balloons like Google's Project Loon .

[ 16 ] Radiocommunication services HAPS can deliver radio connectivity to users, as an altitude above 12,500 m (41,000 ft) enable line-of-sight propagation of at least 400 km (220 nmi). HAPS could deliver bandwidth and capacity similar to a broadband wireless access network, like WiMAX , over a coverage area similar to that of a satellite. Military communications can be improved in remote areas like in Afghanistan, where mountainous terrain interferes with communications signals.

[ 17 ] Surveillance and intelligence The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV is used by the US Air Force for surveillance and security. It carries a radar , optical, and infrared imagers ; and is able to transmit its data in realtime.

[ 18 ] Real-time monitoring An area could be monitored for flood detection, seismic monitoring, remote sensing and disaster management .

[ 19 ] Weather and environmental monitoring For environment and weather monitoring, high-altitude balloons can deploy scientific equipment to measure environmental changes or to keep track of weather. In partnership with The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA has started using Global Hawk UAVs to study Earth's atmosphere.

[ 20 ] Rocket launch More than 90% of atmospheric matter is below the high-altitude platform, reducing atmospheric drag for starting rockets: "As a rough estimate, a rocket that reaches an altitude of 20 km (66,000 ft) when launched from the ground will reach 100 km (54 nmi) if launched at an altitude of 20 km (66,000 ft) from a balloon." [ 21 ] Mass drivers have been proposed for launching to orbit.

[ 22 ] [ page needed ] Further information: Rockoon Airplanes [ edit ] Reconnaissance aircraft like the late 1950s Lockheed U-2 could fly above 70,000 ft (21,000 m) and the 1964 SR-71 above 80,000 ft (24,000 m).

[ 13 ] The twin-turbofan powered Myasishchev M-55 reached an altitude of 21,360 m (70,080 ft) in 1993, a variant of the M-17 first flown in 1982, which reached 21,830 m (71,620 ft) in 1990.

[ 66 ] Airships [ edit ] Unmanned stratospheric airships are designed to operate at very high 60,000 to 75,000 feet (18.3 to 22.9 km) altitudes during weeks, months or years.

[ 67 ] Subjected to ultraviolet damage , ozone corrosion and challenging station keeping, they can be solar-powered with energy storage for the night.

[ 67 ] The first stratospheric powered airship flight took place in 1969, reaching 70,000 feet (21 km) for 2 hours with a 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) payload.

[ 68 ] By August 2002, US company Worldwide Aeros was building a stratospheric demonstrator for the Korea Aerospace Research Institute , as a part the South Korean HAA development program.

[ 69 ] By April 2004, stratospheric airships were being developed in USA, UK, Canada, Korea and Japan.

[ 70 ] In May 2004, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency shown its test airship in Taiki, Hokkaido , a part of its Stratosphere Platform Project.

[ 71 ] SwRI HiSentinel On December 4, 2005, a team led by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), sponsored by the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (ASMDC), successfully demonstrated powered flight of the HiSentinel stratospheric airship at an altitude of 74,000 feet (23 km).

[ 72 ] USAF Integrated Sensor Is Structure project Integrated Sensor Is Structure The USAF Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) airship would have stayed for up to ten years at 70,000 ft (21,000 m), providing a persistent early warning against cruise missiles at up to 600 km (320 nmi) or enemy combatants at up to 300 km (160 nmi).

[ 13 ] Lockheed-Martin HAA The United States Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency contracted Lockheed Martin to build an unmanned High-Altitude Airship (HAA) for its Ballistic Missile Defense System .

[ 73 ] In January 2006, Lockheed won a $149M Contract to build it and demonstrate its technical feasibility and military utility.

[ 74 ] It would operate above 60,000 ft (18,000 m) in a quasi-geostationary position to deliver persistent orbital station keeping as a surveillance aircraft platform, telecommunications relay, or a  weather observer. Launch was originally proposed in 2008, the production aircraft would be 500 ft (150 m) long and 150 ft (46 m) in diameter. Powered by solar cells, it would stay in the air for up to one month and was intended to survey a 600 mi (970 km) diameter of land.

Lockheed-Martin HALE-D On July 27, 2011, the " High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator " (HALE-D) subscale demonstrator was launched on a test flight.

[ 75 ] HALE-D had a 500,000 cu ft (14,000 m 3 ) volume, was 240 ft (73 m) long and 70 ft (21 m) wide, had 15 kW (20 hp) solar cells charging 40 kWh Li-ion batteries and 2 kW (2.7 hp) electric motors to cruise at 20 kn (37 km/h) TAS at 60,000 ft (18,000 m) with a 50 lb (23 kg) payload during 15 days.

[ 76 ] At 32,000 ft (9,800 m) a problem with the helium levels prevented it and the flight was terminated.

[ 77 ] It descended and crashed in a Pittsburgh area forest.

[ 78 ] Two days after, it was destroyed by a fire before its recovery.

[ 79 ] Lindstrand HALE airship Lindstrand Technologies designed a Helium -filled non-rigid airship covered with solar cells. The 14 t (31,000 lb) aircraft could carry a 500 kg (1,100 lb) payload during 3 to 5 years as helium loss would be minimal at high altitudes. For energy storage, a 180kW electrolyser would fill H2 and O2 tanks, to be converted back to water by a 150kW fuel cell . An 80 kW (110 hp) motor would allow a 24 m/s (47 kn) maximum speed.

[ 80 ] Stratobus airship Thales Alenia Stratobus Thales Alenia Space develops the Stratobus unmanned, solar-powered stratospheric airship , 377 ft (115 m) long and weighting 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) including a 550 lb (250 kg) payload, it is designed for a five-year mission with annual servicing and a prototype was planned for late 2020.
