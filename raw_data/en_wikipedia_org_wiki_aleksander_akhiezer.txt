[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was the brother of the mathematician Naum Akhiezer .

Biography [ edit ] Akhiezer was born in Cherykaw , Russian Empire in what is now Mogilev Region , Belarus . He studied radio engineering at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 1929–34. From 1934, he worked at the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology in Kharkiv . With Isaak Pomeranchuk and under the supervision of Lev Landau , he studied light-light scattering and was awarded a Ph.D.

in 1936. A treatise on wave absorption in modulated quasiparticles gave him a habilitation degree in 1941 and title of full professor .

When Lev Landau left Kharkiv in 1937, Akhiezer became head of the department of Theoretical Physics at Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology , which was renamed Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology shortly afterwards. He held this post for over 60 years until his death.

With Cyril Sinelnikov and Anton K. Valter he founded the faculty of physics and technology at University of Kharkiv . With Isaak Pomeranchuk he studied neutron scattering and plasma physics at the Kurchatov nuclear physics institute in Moscow (1944–52).
