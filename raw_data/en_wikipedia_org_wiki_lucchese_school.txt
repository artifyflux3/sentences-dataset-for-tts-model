( February 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 'Madonna and Child', tempera and gold on wood panel by an anonymous painter of the Lucchese school, ca. 1200, El Paso Museum of Art The Lucchese school , also known as the school of Lucca and as the Pisan-Lucchese school , was a school of painting and sculpture that flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries in Pisa and Lucca in Tuscany with affinities to painters in Volterra .  The art is mostly anonymous.  Although not as elegant or delicate as the Florentine school , Lucchese works are remarkable for their monumentality.
