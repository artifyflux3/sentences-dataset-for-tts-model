There are n sections if n is odd and 2 n if n is even.

It is the polar or circle inversion of the rose curve.

In astronomy the epispiral is related to the equations that explain planets' orbits.

Alternative definition [ edit ] There is another definition of the epispiral that has to do with tangents to circles: [ 1 ] Begin with a circle.

Rotate some single point on the circle around the circle by some angle θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and at the same time by an angle in constant proportion to θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } , say c θ θ {\displaystyle c\theta } for some constant c {\displaystyle c} .

The intersections of the tangent lines to the circle at these new points rotated from that single point for every θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } would trace out an epispiral.

The polar equation can be derived through simple geometry as follows: To determine the polar coordinates ( ρ ρ , ϕ ϕ ) {\displaystyle (\rho ,\phi )} of the intersection of the tangent lines in question for some θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and − − 1 < c < 1 {\displaystyle -1<c<1} , note that ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is halfway between θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and c θ θ {\displaystyle c\theta } by congruence of triangles, so it is ( c + 1 ) θ θ 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {(c+1)\theta }{2}}} . Moreover, if the radius of the circle generating the curve is r {\displaystyle r} , then since there is a right-angled triangle (it's right-angled as a tangent to a circle meets the radius at a right angle at the point of tangency) with hypotenuse ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } and an angle ( 1 − − c ) θ θ 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {(1-c)\theta }{2}}} to which the adjacent leg of the triangle is r {\displaystyle r} , the radius ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } at the intersection point of the relevant tangents is r sec ⁡ ⁡ ( ( 1 − − c ) θ θ 2 ) {\displaystyle r\sec({\frac {(1-c)\theta }{2}})} . This gives the polar equation of the curve, ρ ρ = r sec ⁡ ⁡ ( ( 1 − − c ) ϕ ϕ c + 1 ) {\displaystyle \rho =r\sec({\frac {(1-c)\phi }{c+1}})} for all points ( ρ ρ , ϕ ϕ ) {\displaystyle (\rho ,\phi )} on it.
