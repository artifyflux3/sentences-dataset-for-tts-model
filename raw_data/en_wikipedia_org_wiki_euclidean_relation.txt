Definition [ edit ] Right Euclidean property: solid and dashed arrows indicate antecedents and consequents, respectively.

A binary relation R on a set X is Euclidean (sometimes called right Euclidean ) if it satisfies the following: for every a , b , c in X , if a is related to b and c , then b is related to c .

[ 1 ] To write this in predicate logic : ∀ ∀ a , b , c ∈ ∈ X ( a R b ∧ ∧ a R c → → b R c ) .

{\displaystyle \forall a,b,c\in X\,(a\,R\,b\land a\,R\,c\to b\,R\,c).} Dually, a relation R on X is left Euclidean if for every a , b , c in X , if b is related to a and c is related to a , then b is related to c : ∀ ∀ a , b , c ∈ ∈ X ( b R a ∧ ∧ c R a → → b R c ) .

{\displaystyle \forall a,b,c\in X\,(b\,R\,a\land c\,R\,a\to b\,R\,c).} Properties [ edit ] Schematized right Euclidean relation according to property 10. Deeply-colored squares indicate the equivalence classes of R ′ . Pale-colored rectangles indicate possible relationships of elements in X \ran( R ). In these rectangles, relationships may, or may not, hold.

Due to the commutativity of ∧ in the definition's antecedent, aRb ∧ aRc even implies bRc ∧ cRb when R is right Euclidean. Similarly, bRa ∧ cRa implies bRc ∧ cRb when R is left Euclidean.

The property of being Euclidean is different from transitivity . For example, ≤ is transitive, but not right Euclidean, [ 2 ] while xRy defined by 0 ≤ x ≤ y + 1 ≤ 2 is not transitive, [ 3 ] but right Euclidean on natural numbers .

For symmetric relations , transitivity, right Euclideanness, and left Euclideanness all coincide. However, a non-symmetric relation can also be both transitive and right Euclidean, for example, xRy defined by y =0.

A relation that is both right Euclidean and reflexive is also symmetric and therefore an equivalence relation .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Similarly, each left Euclidean and reflexive relation is an equivalence.

The range of a right Euclidean relation is always a subset [ 5 ] of its domain . The restriction of a right Euclidean relation to its range is always reflexive, [ 6 ] and therefore an equivalence. Similarly, the domain of a left Euclidean relation is a subset of its range, and the restriction of a left Euclidean relation to its domain is an equivalence. Therefore, a right Euclidean relation on X that is also right total (respectively a left Euclidean relation on X that is also left total ) is an equivalence, since its range (respectively its domain) is X .

[ 7 ] A relation R is both left and right Euclidean, if, and only if, the domain and the range set of R agree, and R is an equivalence relation on that set.

[ 8 ] A right Euclidean relation is always quasitransitive , [ 9 ] as is a left Euclidean relation.

[ 10 ] A connected right Euclidean relation is always transitive; [ 11 ] and so is a connected left Euclidean relation.

[ 12 ] If X has at least 3 elements, a connected right Euclidean relation R on X cannot be antisymmetric , [ 13 ] and neither can a connected left Euclidean relation on X .

[ 14 ] On the 2-element set X = { 0, 1 }, e.g. the relation xRy defined by y =1 is connected, right Euclidean, and antisymmetric, and xRy defined by x =1 is connected, left Euclidean, and antisymmetric.

A relation R on a set X is right Euclidean if, and only if, the restriction R ′ := R | ran( R ) is an equivalence and for each x in X \ran( R ), all elements to which x is related under R are equivalent under R ′ .

[ 15 ] Similarly, R on X is left Euclidean if, and only if, R ′ := R | dom( R ) is an equivalence and for each x in X \dom( R ), all elements that are related to x under R are equivalent under R ′ .

A left Euclidean relation is left-unique if, and only if, it is antisymmetric . Similarly, a right Euclidean relation is right unique if, and only if, it is anti-symmetric.

A left Euclidean and left unique relation is vacuously transitive, and so is a right Euclidean and right unique relation.

A left Euclidean relation is left quasi-reflexive . For left-unique relations, the converse also holds. Dually, each right Euclidean relation is right quasi-reflexive, and each right unique and right quasi-reflexive relation is right Euclidean.

^ Equality of domain and range isn't necessary: the relation xRy defined by y =min{ x ,2} is right Euclidean on the natural numbers, and its range, {0,1,2}, is a proper subset of its domain of the natural numbers.

^ If y is in the range of R , then xRy ∧ xRy implies yRy , for some suitable x . This also proves that y is in the domain of R .

^ The only if direction follows from the previous paragraph. — For the if direction, assume aRb and aRc , then a , b , c are members of the domain and range of R , hence bRc by symmetry and transitivity; left Euclideanness of R follows similarly.

^ If xRy ∧ ¬ yRx ∧ yRz ∧ ¬ zRy holds, then both y and z are in the range of R . Since R is an equivalence on that set, yRz implies zRy . Hence the antecedent of the quasi-transitivity definition formula cannot be satisfied.

^ A similar argument applies, observing that x , y are in the domain of R .

^ If xRy ∧ yRz holds, then y and z are in the range of R . Since R is connected, xRz or zRx or x = z holds. In case 1, nothing remains to be shown. In cases 2 and 3, also x is in the range. Hence, xRz follows from the symmetry and reflexivity of R on its range, respectively.

^ Similar, using that x , y are in the domain of R .

^ Since R is connected, at least two distinct elements x , y are in its range , and xRy ∨ yRx holds. Since R is symmetric on its range, even xRy ∧ yRx holds. This contradicts the antisymmetry property.

^ By a similar argument, using the domain of R .

^ Only if: R ′ is an equivalence as shown above. If x ∈ X \ran( R ) and xR ′ y 1 and xR ′ y 2 , then y 1 Ry 2 by right Euclideaness, hence y 1 R ′ y 2 . — If : if xRy ∧ xRz holds, then y , z ∈ran( R ). In case also x ∈ran( R ), even xR ′ y ∧ xR ′ z holds, hence yR ′ z by symmetry and transitivity of R ′ , hence yRz . In case x ∈ X \ran( R ), the elements y and z must be equivalent under R ′ by assumption, hence also yRz .
