[ 2 ] The prize is intended not only for mathematicians, but also for physicists, chemists, biologists, physicians, and other scientists who have made important applications of mathematics . The purpose of the prize is to recognize outstanding achievement in applied mathematics and "to enable the public and the academic community to become aware of the contribution that mathematics is making to present-day thinking and to modern civilization." The prize winner gives a lecture, which is subsequently published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society .
