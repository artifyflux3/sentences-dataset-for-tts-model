Surveys have been conducted to construct historical rankings of individuals who have served as prime minister of Canada. These ranking systems are usually based on surveys of academic historians , economists and political scientists . The rankings focus on the achievements, leadership qualities, failures and faults in office.

Scholar survey results [ edit ] Canadian custom is to count by the individuals who were prime minister, not by terms.

[ 1 ] Since Confederation, 24 prime ministers have been "called upon" by the governor general to form 30 Canadian ministries .
