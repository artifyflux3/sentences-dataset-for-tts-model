Infobox references Chemical compound Methylidynephosphane ( phosphaethyne ) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H C ≡ P . It was the first phosphaalkyne compound discovered, containing the unusual C≡P carbon - phosphorus triple bond . Although isolated samples of methylidynephosphane are impractical, other derivatives have been well studied such as tert -butylphosphaacetylene .  The conjugate base of methylidynephosphane is cyaphide .

Description [ edit ] Methylidynephosphane is the phosphorus analogue of hydrogen cyanide , with the nitrile nitrogen replaced by phosphorus. Methylidynephosphane can be synthesized via the reaction of phosphine with carbon, [ 1 ] but it is extremely reactive and polymerises readily at temperatures above −120 °C. However, several types of derivatives, with bulky groups, such as tert -butyl or trimethylsilyl , substituted for the hydrogen atom, are much more stable, and are useful reagents for the synthesis of various organophosphorus compounds .

[ 2 ] The [OCP] − (cyaphate) and [SCP] − (thiocyaphate) anions are also known.

[ 3 ] HCP has been detected in the interstellar medium .

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] While the existence of the molecule had been discussed, [ 5 ] and early attempts had been made to prepare it, methylidynephosphane was first successfully synthesised in 1961, by T.E. Gier of E. I. duPont de Nemours, Inc.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] Earlier reports of preparing its sodium salt were reported as unreproducible by Gier. Methylidynephosphane may have contributed to an explosion that killed Vera Bogdanovskaia , an early chemist pursuing it, one of the first female chemists in Russia, [ 7 ] and perhaps the first woman to die from her own research.
