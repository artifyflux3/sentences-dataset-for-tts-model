An extremely destructive and deadly outbreak of 55 tornadoes caused major damage from the Southern Plains to the Midwest . The main outbreak was the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak , which started in the afternoon of April 11 and continued through the overnight hours of April 12. The second-biggest tornado outbreak on record at the time, this deadly series of 48 twisters inflicted a swath of destruction from Cedar County, Iowa , to Cuyahoga County, Ohio , and a swath 450 miles long (724 km) from Kent County, Michigan , to Montgomery County, Indiana . The outbreak lasted 16 hours and 35 minutes and is among the most intense outbreaks, in terms of number, strength, width, path, and length of tornadoes, ever recorded, including at least four "double/twin funnel" tornadoes. In addition, 18 tornadoes were rated F4, the second-largest number of violent twisters in one outbreak, second only to the 1974 Super Outbreak .
