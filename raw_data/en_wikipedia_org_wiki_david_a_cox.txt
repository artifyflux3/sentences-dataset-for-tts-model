Cox David A. Cox, Oberwolfach 2007 Born David Archibald Cox ( 1948-09-23 ) September 23, 1948 (age 76) Washington, D.C., US [ 1 ] Alma mater Rice University Princeton University Occupation(s) Mathematician, professor David Archibald Cox (born September 23, 1948) is a retired [ 2 ] American mathematician, working in algebraic geometry .

Cox graduated from Rice University with a bachelor's degree in 1970 and his Ph.D. in 1975 at Princeton University , under the supervision of Eric Friedlander ( Tubular Neighborhoods in the Etale Topology ).

[ 3 ] From 1974 to 1975, he was assistant professor at Haverford College and at Rutgers University from 1975 to 1979. In 1979, he became assistant professor and in 1988 professor at Amherst College .

He studies, among other things, étale homotopy theory , elliptic surfaces , computer-based algebraic geometry (such as Gröbner basis ), Torelli sets and toric varieties , and history of mathematics . He is also known for several textbooks. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 4 ] From 1987 to 1988 he was a guest professor at Oklahoma State University . In 2012, he received the Lester Randolph Ford Award for Why Eisenstein Proved the Eisenstein Criterion and Why Schönemann Discovered It First .
