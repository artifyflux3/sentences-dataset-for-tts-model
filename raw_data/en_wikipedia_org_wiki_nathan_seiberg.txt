He is currently a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

Honors and awards [ edit ] He was recipient of a 1996 MacArthur Fellowship [ 1 ] and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1998.

[ 2 ] In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics , the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner .

[ 3 ] In 2016, he was awarded the Dirac Medal of the ICTP .  He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences .

Research [ edit ] His contributions include: Ian Affleck , Michael Dine , and Seiberg explored nonperturbative effects in supersymmetric field theories.

[ 4 ] This work demonstrated, for the first time, that nonperturbative effects in four-dimensional field theories do not respect the supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems .  This understanding led them to find four-dimensional models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking .

In a series of papers, Michael Dine and Seiberg explored various aspects of string theory.  In particular, Dine, Ryan Rohm , Seiberg, and Edward Witten proposed a supersymmetry breaking mechanism based on gluino condensation, [ 5 ] Dine, Seiberg, and Witten showed that terms similar to Fayet–Iliopoulos D-terms arise in string theory, [ 6 ] and Dine, Seiberg, X. G. Wen , and Witten studied instantons on the string worldsheet .

[ 7 ] Gregory Moore and Seiberg studied Rational Conformal Field Theories .  In the course of doing it, they invented modular tensor categories and described many of their properties.

[ 8 ] They also explored the relation between Chern–Simons theory and the corresponding Rational Conformal Field Theory.

[ 9 ] This body of work was later used in mathematics and in the study of topological phases of matter .

In the 90’s, Seiberg realized the significance of holomorphy as the underlying reason for the perturbative supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems [ 10 ] and initiated a program to use it to find exact results in complicated field theories including several N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimension. These theories exhibit unexpected rich phenomena like confinement with and without chiral symmetry breaking and a new kind of electric-magnetic duality – Seiberg duality .

[ 11 ] Kenneth Intriligator and Seiberg studied many more models and summarized the subject in lecture notes.

[ 12 ] Later, Intriligator, Seiberg and David Shih used this understanding of the dynamics to present four-dimensional models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking in a metastable vacuum.

[ 13 ] Seiberg and Witten studied the dynamics of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories – Seiberg–Witten theory .  They found exact expressions for several quantities of interest.  These shed new light on interesting phenomena like confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and electric-magnetic duality.

[ 14 ] This insight was used by Witten to derive the Seiberg–Witten invariants . Later, Seiberg and Witten extended their work to the four-dimensional N=2 theory compactified to three dimensions.

[ 15 ] Intriligator and Seiberg found a new kind of duality in three-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric theories, which is reminiscent of the well-known 2D mirror symmetry – 3D mirror symmetry .

[ 16 ] In a series of papers with various collaborators, Seiberg studied many supersymmetric theories in three, four, five, and six dimensions.  The three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories [ 17 ] and their dualities were shown to be related to the four-dimensional N=1 theories.

[ 18 ] And surprising five-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetries were discovered [ 19 ] and analyzed.

[ 20 ] As part of his work on the BFSS matrix model , Seiberg discovered little string theories .

[ 21 ] These are limits of string theory without gravity that are not local quantum field theories.

Seiberg and Witten identified a particular low-energy limit (Seiberg–Witten limit) of theories containing open strings in which the dynamics becomes that of noncommutative quantum field theory – a field theory on a non-commutative geometry .  They also presented a map ( Seiberg–Witten map ) between standard gauge theories and gauge theories on a noncommutative space.

[ 22 ] Shiraz Minwalla , Mark Van Raamsdonk and Seiberg uncovered a surprising mixing between short-distance and long-distance phenomena in these field theories on a noncommutative space.  Such mixing violates the standard picture of the renormalization group.  They referred to this phenomenon as UV/IR mixing.

[ 23 ] Davide Gaiotto , Anton Kapustin , Seiberg, and Brian Willett introduced the notion of higher-form global symmetries and studied some of their properties and applications.
