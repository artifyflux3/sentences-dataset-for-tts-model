Infobox references Chemical compound Hypofluorous acid , chemical formula H O F , is the only known oxyacid of fluorine and the only known oxoacid in which the main atom gains electrons from oxygen to create a negative oxidation state. The oxidation state of the oxygen in this acid (and in the hypofluorite ion OF − and in its salts called hypofluorites) is 0, while its valence is 2. It is also the only hypohalous acid that can be isolated as a solid . HOF is an intermediate in the oxidation of water by fluorine , which produces hydrogen fluoride , oxygen difluoride , hydrogen peroxide , ozone and oxygen . HOF is explosive at room temperature, forming HF and O 2 : [ 1 ] 2 HOF → 2 HF + O 2 This reaction is catalyzed by water.

[ 2 ] It was isolated in the pure form by passing F 2 gas over ice at −40 °C, rapidly collecting the HOF gas away from the ice, and condensing it: [ 2 ] F 2 + H 2 O → HOF + HF The compound has been characterized in the solid phase by X-ray crystallography [ 1 ] as a bent molecule with an angle of 101°. The O–F and O–H bond lengths are 144.2 and 96.4 picometres , respectively. The solid framework consists of chains with O–H···O linkages. The structure has also been analyzed in the gas phase, a state in which the H–O–F bond angle is slightly narrower (97.2°).

Chemists commonly call a solution of hypofluorous acid in acetonitrile (generated in situ by passing gaseous fluorine through water in acetonitrile) Rozen's reagent.

[ 3 ] Difference from other hypohalous acids [ edit ] The formal oxidation state of oxygen in hypofluorous acid and hypofluorite is 0; the same oxidation state found in molecular oxygen . In most oxygen compounds, including the other hypohalous acids, oxygen takes on a state of −2. The oxygen (0) atom is the root of hypofluorous acid's strength as an oxidizer, in contrast to the halogen (+1) atom in other hypohalic acids.

This alters the acid's chemistry. Where reduction of a general hypohalous acid reduces the halogen atom and yields the corresponding elemental halogen gas, 2 HOX + 2 H + + 2 e − →  2 H 2 O + X 2 reduction of hypofluorous acid instead reduces the oxygen atom and yields fluoride directly.

HOF + H + + 2 e − →  H 2 O + F − Unlike other hypohalous acids, HOF is a weaker oxidant than elemental fluorine.

Hypofluorites [ edit ] Hypofluorites are formally derivatives of OF − , which is the conjugate base of hypofluorous acid. One example is trifluoromethyl hypofluorite ( CF 3 OF ), which is a trifluoromethyl ester of hypofluorous acid. The conjugate base is known in salts such as lithium hypofluorite .

See also [ edit ] Hypochlorous acid , a related compound that is more technologically important but has not been obtained in pure form.
