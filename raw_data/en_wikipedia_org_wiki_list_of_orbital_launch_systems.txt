In ORE, a scaled up wing body will be taken to an orbit by an ascent vehicle derived from existing GSLV and it stays in orbit for a stipulated period, re-enter and lands on a runway autonomously. The ascent vehicle has first two stages of GSLV viz S139+4L40S & GS2 and a third stage with modified PS4 propulsion system. The winged body which is a scaled up version of the RLV in RLV-TD HEX-01 mission is the fourth stage and this is called Orbital Re-entry Vehicle (ORV). This has a deployable Landing Gear System.
