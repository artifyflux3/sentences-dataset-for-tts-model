{\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y).} The smallest such value of k is called the Lipschitz constant of f .  Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps .  If the above condition is instead satisfied for k ≤ 1, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map .

More generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if ( M , d ) and ( N , d' ) are two metric spaces, then f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\rightarrow N} is a contractive mapping if there is a constant 0 ≤ ≤ k < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq k<1} such that d ′ ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) ≤ ≤ k d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d'(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y)} for all x and y in M .

Every contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant k is no longer necessarily less than 1).

A contraction mapping has at most one fixed point . Moreover, the Banach fixed-point theorem states that every contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any x in M the iterated function sequence x , f ( x ), f ( f ( x )), f ( f ( f ( x ))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for iterated function systems where contraction mappings are often used . Banach's fixed-point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations , and is used in one proof of the inverse function theorem .

[ 1 ] Contraction mappings play an important role in dynamic programming problems.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Firmly non-expansive mapping [ edit ] A non-expansive mapping with k = 1 {\displaystyle k=1} can be generalized to a firmly non-expansive mapping in a Hilbert space H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} if the following holds for all x and y in H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} : ‖ ‖ f ( x ) − − f ( y ) ‖ ‖ 2 ≤ ≤ ⟨ ⟨ x − − y , f ( x ) − − f ( y ) ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \|f(x)-f(y)\|^{2}\leq \,\langle x-y,f(x)-f(y)\rangle ,} where d ( x , y ) = ‖ ‖ x − − y ‖ ‖ .

{\displaystyle d(x,y)=\|x-y\|.} This is a special case of α α {\displaystyle \alpha } averaged nonexpansive operators with α α = 1 / 2 {\displaystyle \alpha =1/2} .

[ 4 ] A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality .

The class of firmly non-expansive maps is closed under convex combinations , but not compositions.

[ 5 ] This class includes proximal mappings of proper, convex, lower-semicontinuous functions, hence it also includes orthogonal projections onto non-empty closed convex sets . The class of firmly nonexpansive operators is equal to the set of resolvents of maximally monotone operators .

[ 6 ] Surprisingly, while iterating non-expansive maps has no guarantee to find a fixed point (e.g. multiplication by -1), firm non-expansiveness is sufficient to guarantee global convergence to a fixed point, provided a fixed point exists. More precisely, if Fix ⁡ ⁡ f := { x ∈ ∈ H | f ( x ) = x } ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Fix} f:=\{x\in {\mathcal {H}}\ |\ f(x)=x\}\neq \varnothing ,} then for any initial point x 0 ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle x_{0}\in {\mathcal {H}}} , iterating x n + 1 = f ( x n ) , ∀ ∀ n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle x_{n+1}=f(x_{n}),\quad \forall n\in \mathbb {N} } yields convergence to a fixed point x n → → z ∈ ∈ Fix ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle x_{n}\to z\in \operatorname {Fix} f} . This convergence might be weak in an infinite-dimensional setting.

[ 5 ] Subcontraction map [ edit ] A subcontraction map or subcontractor is a map f on a metric space ( M , d ) such that d ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , y ) ; {\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))\leq d(x,y);} d ( f ( f ( x ) ) , f ( x ) ) < d ( f ( x ) , x ) unless x = f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle d(f(f(x)),f(x))<d(f(x),x)\quad {\text{unless}}\quad x=f(x).} If the image of a subcontractor f is compact , then f has a fixed point.

[ 7 ] Locally convex spaces [ edit ] In a locally convex space ( E , P ) with topology given by a set P of seminorms , one can define for any p ∈ P a p -contraction as a map f such that there is some k p < 1 such that p ( f ( x ) − f ( y )) ≤ k p p ( x − y ) . If f is a p -contraction for all p ∈ P and ( E , P ) is sequentially complete, then f has a fixed point, given as limit of any sequence x n +1 = f ( x n ), and if ( E , P ) is Hausdorff , then the fixed point is unique.
