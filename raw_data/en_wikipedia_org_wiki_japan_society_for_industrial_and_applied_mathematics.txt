JSIAM is not a branch but a Japanese counterpart of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) based in the United States .

Activities [ edit ] As same as SIAM, JSIAM publishes academic journals in Japanese and English, hold academic conferences, [ 1 ] and give awards to applied mathematicians with JSIAM membership.

English Journals and Publications from JSIAM [ edit ] SIAM Online Magazine JJIAM (Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics) [ 2 ] JSIAM Letters [ 3 ] Finance [ edit ] The finance of JSIAM is based on membership fee and support from their corporate sponsors. Their sponsors include Canon , Nissan , NEC , NTT , Hitachi , Fujitsu and Ricoh .
