In complex analysis , the Hardy spaces (or Hardy classes ) H p {\displaystyle H^{p}} are spaces of holomorphic functions on the unit disk or upper half plane . They were introduced by Frigyes Riesz ( Riesz 1923 ), who named them after G. H. Hardy , because of the paper ( Hardy 1915 ). In real analysis Hardy spaces are spaces of distributions on the real n -space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , defined (in the sense of distributions) as boundary values of the holomorphic functions. Hardy spaces are related to the L p spaces .

[ 1 ] For 1 ≤ ≤ p < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1\leq p<\infty } these Hardy spaces are subsets of L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces , while for 0 < p < 1 {\displaystyle 0<p<1} the L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces have some undesirable properties, and the Hardy spaces are much better behaved. Hence, H p {\displaystyle H^{p}} spaces can be considered extensions of L p {\displaystyle L^{p}} spaces.

[ 2 ] Hardy spaces have a number of applications, both in mathematical analysis itself as well as in interdisciplinary areas such as control theory (e.g.

H ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle H^{\infty }} methods ) and scattering theory .

Definition [ edit ] On the unit disk [ edit ] The Hardy space H p {\displaystyle H^{p}} for 0 < p < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 0<p<\infty } is the class of holomorphic functions f {\displaystyle f} on the open unit disk D = { z ∈ ∈ C : | z | < 1 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} =\{z\in \mathbb {C} :|z|<1\}} satisfying sup 0 ⩽ ⩽ r < 1 ( 1 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π | f ( r e i θ θ ) | p d θ θ ) 1 p < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \sup _{0\leqslant r<1}\left({\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{0}^{2\pi }\left|f\left(re^{i\theta }\right)\right|^{p}\;\mathrm {d} \theta \right)^{\frac {1}{p}}<\infty .} If p ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle p\geq 1} then the equation coincides with the definition of the Hardy space p -norm, denoted by ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ H p .

{\displaystyle \|f\|_{H^{p}}.} The space H ∞ is defined as the vector space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disk, with the norm ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ H ∞ ∞ = sup | z | < 1 | f ( z ) | .

{\displaystyle {\|f\|}_{H^{\infty }}=\sup _{|z|<1}\left|f(z)\right|.} For 0 < p ≤ q ≤ ∞, the class H q is  a subset of H p , and the H p -norm is increasing with p (it is a consequence of Hölder's inequality that the L p -norm is increasing for probability measures , i.e.

measures with total mass 1) ( Rudin 1987 , Def 17.7).

H 2 {\displaystyle H^{2}} is a Hilbert space , and it is unitarily equivalent to ℓ ℓ 2 ( N ) {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}(\mathbb {N} )} via the unitary map ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ a n z n ↔ ↔ ( a n ) n = 0 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}z^{n}\leftrightarrow (a_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty }} .

[ 3 ] On the unit circle [ edit ] The Hardy spaces can also be viewed as closed vector subspaces of the complex L p spaces on the unit circle T = { z ∈ ∈ C : | z | = 1 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {T} =\{z\in \mathbb {C} :|z|=1\}} . This connection is provided by the following theorem ( Katznelson 1976 , Thm 3.8):  Given f ∈ ∈ H p {\displaystyle f\in H^{p}} with p ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle p\geq 1} , then the radial limit f ~ ~ ( e i θ θ ) = lim r → → 1 f ( r e i θ θ ) , {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}\left(e^{i\theta }\right)=\lim _{r\to 1}f\left(re^{i\theta }\right),} exists for almost every θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } and f ~ ~ ∈ ∈ L p ( T ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}\in L^{p}(\mathbb {T} )} such that [ clarification needed ] ‖ ‖ f ~ ~ ‖ ‖ L p = ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ H p .

{\displaystyle {\|{\tilde {f}}\|}_{L^{p}}={\|f\|}_{H^{p}}.} Denote by H p ( T ) the vector subspace of L p ( T ) consisting of all limit functions f ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}} , when f varies in H p , one then has that for p ≥ 1,( Katznelson 1976 ) g ∈ ∈ H p ( T ) if and only if g ∈ ∈ L p ( T ) and g ^ ^ n = 0 for all n < 0 , {\displaystyle g\in H^{p}\left(\mathbb {T} \right){\text{ if and only if }}g\in L^{p}\left(\mathbb {T} \right){\text{ and }}{\hat {g}}_{n}=0{\text{ for all }}n<0,} where the g ^ ^ n {\displaystyle {\hat {g}}_{n}} are the Fourier coefficients defined as g ^ ^ n = 1 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π g ( e i ϕ ϕ ) e − − i n ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ , ∀ ∀ n ∈ ∈ Z .

{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}_{n}={\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{0}^{2\pi }g\left(e^{i\phi }\right)e^{-in\phi }\,\mathrm {d} \phi ,\quad \forall n\in \mathbb {Z} .} The space H p ( T ) is a closed subspace of L p ( T ). Since L p ( T ) is a Banach space (for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞), so is H p ( T ).

The above can be turned around.  Given a function f ~ ~ ∈ ∈ L p ( T ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}\in L^{p}(\mathbf {T} )} , with p ≥ 1, one can regain a ( harmonic ) function f on the unit disk by means of the Poisson kernel P r : f ( r e i θ θ ) = 1 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π P r ( θ θ − − ϕ ϕ ) f ~ ~ ( e i ϕ ϕ ) d ϕ ϕ , r < 1 , {\displaystyle f\left(re^{i\theta }\right)={\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{0}^{2\pi }P_{r}(\theta -\phi ){\tilde {f}}\left(e^{i\phi }\right)\,\mathrm {d} \phi ,\quad r<1,} and f belongs to H p exactly when f ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}} is in H p ( T ). Supposing that f ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}} is in H p ( T ), i.e., f ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}} has Fourier coefficients ( a n ) n ∈ Z with a n = 0 for every n < 0, then the associated holomorphic function f of H p is given by f ( z ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ a n z n , | z | < 1.

{\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}z^{n},\ \ \ |z|<1.} In applications, those functions with vanishing negative Fourier coefficients are commonly interpreted as the causal solutions. For example, the Hardy space H 2 consists of functions whose mean square value remains bounded as r → → 1 {\displaystyle r\to 1} from below.
Thus, the space H 2 is seen to sit naturally inside L 2 space , and is represented by infinite sequences indexed by N ; whereas L 2 consists of bi-infinite sequences indexed by Z .

On the upper half plane [ edit ] The Hardy space on the upper half-plane H = { x + i y ∣ ∣ y > 0 ; x , y ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} =\{x+iy\mid y>0;\ x,y\in \mathbb {R} \}} is defined to be the space of holomorphic functions f {\displaystyle f} on H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } with bounded norm, given by ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ H p = sup y > 0 ( ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ | f ( x + i y ) | p d x ) 1 p .

{\displaystyle \|f\|_{H^{p}}=\sup _{y>0}\left(\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }|f(x+iy)|^{p}\,\mathrm {d} x\right)^{\frac {1}{p}}.} The corresponding H ∞ ∞ ( H ) {\displaystyle H^{\infty }(\mathbb {H} )} is defined as functions of bounded norm, with the norm given by ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ H ∞ ∞ = sup z ∈ ∈ H | f ( z ) | .

{\displaystyle \|f\|_{H^{\infty }}=\sup _{z\in \mathbb {H} }|f(z)|.} The unit disk is isomorphic to the upper half-plane by means of a Möbius transformation . For example, let m : D → → H {\displaystyle m:\mathbb {D} \rightarrow \mathbb {H} } denote the Möbius transformation m ( z ) = i 1 + z 1 − − z .

{\displaystyle m(z)=i{\frac {1+z}{1-z}}.} Then the linear operator M : H 2 ( H ) → → H 2 ( D ) {\displaystyle M:H^{2}(\mathbb {H} )\rightarrow H^{2}(\mathbb {D} )} defined by ( M f ) ( z ) := π π 1 − − z f ( m ( z ) ) , {\displaystyle (Mf)(z):={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{1-z}}f(m(z)),} is an isometric isomorphism of Hardy spaces.

A similar approach applies to, e.g., the right half-plane.

On the real vector space [ edit ] In analysis on the real vector space R n , the Hardy space H p (for 0 < p ≤ ∞) consists of tempered distributions f such that for some Schwartz function Φ with ∫Φ = 1, the maximal function ( M Φ Φ f ) ( x ) = sup t > 0 | ( f ∗ ∗ Φ Φ t ) ( x ) | {\displaystyle (M_{\Phi }f)(x)=\sup _{t>0}|(f*\Phi _{t})(x)|} is in L p ( R n ), where ∗ is convolution and Φ t ( x ) = t − n Φ( x / t ) . The H p - quasinorm || f || Hp of a distribution f of H p is defined to be the L p norm of M Φ f (this depends on the choice of Φ, but different choices of Schwartz functions Φ give equivalent norms).  The H p -quasinorm is a norm when p ≥ 1, but not when p < 1.

If 1 < p < ∞, the Hardy space H p is the same vector space as L p , with equivalent norm. When p = 1, the Hardy space H 1 is a proper subspace of L 1 .  One can find sequences in H 1 that are bounded in L 1 but unbounded in H 1 , for example on the line f k ( x ) = 1 [ 0 , 1 ] ( x − − k ) − − 1 [ 0 , 1 ] ( x + k ) , k > 0.

{\displaystyle f_{k}(x)=\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x-k)-\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x+k),\ \ \ k>0.} The L 1 and H 1 norms are not equivalent on H 1 , and H 1 is not closed in L 1 .  The dual of H 1 is the space BMO of functions of bounded mean oscillation .  The space BMO contains unbounded functions (proving again that H 1 is not closed in L 1 ).

If p < 1 then the Hardy space H p has elements that are not functions, and its dual is the homogeneous Lipschitz space of order n (1/ p − 1). When p < 1, the H p -quasinorm is not  a norm, as it is not subadditive. The p th power || f || Hp p is subadditive for p < 1 and so defines a metric on the Hardy space H p , which defines the topology and makes H p into a complete metric space.

Atomic decomposition [ edit ] When 0 < p ≤ 1, a bounded measurable function f of compact support is in the Hardy space H p if and only if all its moments ∫ ∫ R n f ( x ) x 1 i 1 … … x n i n d x , {\displaystyle \int _{\mathbf {R} ^{n}}f(x)x_{1}^{i_{1}}\ldots x_{n}^{i_{n}}\,\mathrm {d} x,} whose order i 1 + ... + i n is at most n (1/ p − 1), vanish. For example, the integral of f must vanish in order that f ∈ H p , 0 < p ≤ 1, and as long as p > n / ( n +1) this is also sufficient.

If in addition f has support in some ball B and is bounded by | B | −1/ p then f is called an H p -atom (here | B | denotes the Euclidean volume of B in R n ).  The H p -quasinorm of an arbitrary H p -atom is bounded by a constant depending only on p and on the Schwartz function Φ.

When 0 < p ≤ 1, any element f of H p has an atomic decomposition as a convergent infinite combination of H p -atoms, f = ∑ ∑ c j a j , ∑ ∑ | c j | p < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle f=\sum c_{j}a_{j},\ \ \ \sum |c_{j}|^{p}<\infty } where the a j are H p -atoms and the c j are scalars.

On the line for example, the difference of Dirac distributions f = δ 1 −δ 0 can be represented as a series of Haar functions , convergent in H p -quasinorm when 1/2 < p < 1 (on the circle, the corresponding representation is valid for 0 < p < 1, but on the line, Haar functions do not belong to H p when p ≤ 1/2 because their maximal function is equivalent at infinity to a x −2 for some a ≠ 0).

Link between real- and complex-variable Hardy spaces [ edit ] Real-variable techniques, mainly associated to the study of real Hardy spaces defined on R n , are also used in the simpler framework of the circle. It is a common practice to allow for complex functions (or distributions) in these "real" spaces.  The definition that follows does not distinguish between real or complex case.

Let P r denote the Poisson kernel on the unit circle T . For a distribution f on the unit circle, set ( M f ) ( e i θ θ ) = sup 0 < r < 1 | ( f ∗ ∗ P r ) ( e i θ θ ) | , {\displaystyle (Mf)(e^{i\theta })=\sup _{0<r<1}\left|(f*P_{r})\left(e^{i\theta }\right)\right|,} where the star indicates convolution between the distribution f and the function e iθ → P r (θ) on the circle.  Namely, ( f ∗ P r )(e iθ ) is the result of the action of f on the C ∞ -function defined on the unit circle by e i φ φ → → P r ( θ θ − − φ φ ) .

{\displaystyle e^{i\varphi }\rightarrow P_{r}(\theta -\varphi ).} For 0 < p < ∞, the real Hardy space H p ( T ) consists of distributions f such that M f is in L p ( T ).

The function F defined on the unit disk by F ( re iθ ) = ( f ∗ P r )(e iθ ) is harmonic, and M f is the radial maximal function of F . When M f belongs to L p ( T ) and p ≥ 1, the distribution f " is " a function in L p ( T ), namely the boundary value of F . For p ≥ 1, the real Hardy space H p ( T ) is a subset of L p ( T ).

Conjugate function [ edit ] To every real trigonometric polynomial u on the unit circle, one associates the real conjugate polynomial v such that u + i v extends to a holomorphic function in the unit disk, u ( e i θ θ ) = a 0 2 + ∑ ∑ k ⩾ ⩾ 1 a k cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k θ θ ) + b k sin ⁡ ⁡ ( k θ θ ) ⟶ ⟶ v ( e i θ θ ) = ∑ ∑ k ⩾ ⩾ 1 a k sin ⁡ ⁡ ( k θ θ ) − − b k cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k θ θ ) .

{\displaystyle u(e^{i\theta })={\frac {a_{0}}{2}}+\sum _{k\geqslant 1}a_{k}\cos(k\theta )+b_{k}\sin(k\theta )\longrightarrow v(e^{i\theta })=\sum _{k\geqslant 1}a_{k}\sin(k\theta )-b_{k}\cos(k\theta ).} This mapping u → v extends to a bounded linear operator H on L p ( T ), when 1 < p < ∞ (up to a scalar multiple, it is the Hilbert transform on the unit circle), and H also maps L 1 ( T ) to weak- L 1 ( T ) . When 1 ≤ p < ∞, the following are equivalent for a real valued integrable function f on the unit circle: the function f is the real part of some function g ∈ H p ( T ) the function f and its conjugate H(f) belong to L p ( T ) the radial maximal function M f belongs to L p ( T ).

When 1 < p < ∞, H(f) belongs to L p ( T ) when f ∈ L p ( T ), hence the real Hardy space H p ( T ) coincides with L p ( T ) in this case. For p = 1,  the real Hardy space H 1 ( T ) is a proper subspace of L 1 ( T ).

The case of p = ∞ was excluded from the definition of real Hardy spaces, because the maximal function M f of an L ∞ function is always bounded, and because it is not desirable that real- H ∞ be equal to L ∞ . However, the two following properties are equivalent for a real valued function f the function f is the real part of some function g ∈ H ∞ ( T ) the function f and its conjugate H(f) belong to L ∞ ( T ).

For 0 < p < 1 [ edit ] When 0 < p < 1, a function F in H p cannot be reconstructed from the real part of its boundary limit function on the circle, because of the lack of convexity of L p in this case.  Convexity fails but a kind of " complex convexity " remains, namely the fact that z → | z | q is subharmonic for every q > 0. As a consequence, if F ( z ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 + ∞ ∞ c n z n , | z | < 1 {\displaystyle F(z)=\sum _{n=0}^{+\infty }c_{n}z^{n},\quad |z|<1} is in H p , it can be shown that c n = O( n 1/ p –1 ). It follows that the Fourier series ∑ ∑ n = 0 + ∞ ∞ c n e i n θ θ {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{+\infty }c_{n}e^{in\theta }} converges in the sense of distributions to a distribution f on the unit circle, and F ( re iθ ) =( f ∗ P r )(θ).  The function F ∈ H p can be reconstructed from the real distribution Re( f ) on the circle, because the Taylor coefficients c n of F can be computed from the Fourier coefficients of Re( f ).

Distributions on the circle are general enough for handling Hardy spaces when p < 1. Distributions that are not functions do occur, as is seen with functions F ( z ) = (1− z ) − N (for | z | < 1), that belong to H p when 0 < N p < 1 (and N an integer ≥ 1).

A real distribution on the circle belongs to real- H p ( T ) iff it is the boundary value of the real part of some F ∈ H p . A Dirac distribution δ x , at any point x of the unit circle, belongs to real- H p ( T ) for every p < 1; derivatives δ′ x belong when p < 1/2, second derivatives δ′′ x when p < 1/3, and so on.

Beurling factorization [ edit ] For 0 < p ≤ ∞, every non-zero function f in H p can be written as the product f = Gh where G is an outer function and h is an inner function , as defined below ( Rudin 1987 , Thm 17.17). This " Beurling factorization" allows the Hardy space to be completely characterized by the spaces of inner and outer functions.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] One says that G ( z ) [ clarification needed ] is an outer (exterior) function if it takes the form G ( z ) = c exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 2 π π ∫ ∫ − − π π π π e i θ θ + z e i θ θ − − z log ( φ φ ( e i θ θ ) ) d θ θ ) {\displaystyle G(z)=c\,\exp \left({\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int _{-\pi }^{\pi }{\frac {e^{i\theta }+z}{e^{i\theta }-z}}\log \!\left(\varphi \!\left(e^{i\theta }\right)\right)\,\mathrm {d} \theta \right)} for some complex number c with | c | = 1, and some positive measurable function φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } on the unit circle such that log ⁡ ⁡ ( φ φ ) {\displaystyle \log(\varphi )} is integrable on the circle.  In particular, when φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is integrable on the circle, G is in H 1 because the above takes the form of the Poisson kernel ( Rudin 1987 , Thm 17.16).  This implies that lim r → → 1 − − | G ( r e i θ θ ) | = φ φ ( e i θ θ ) {\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 1^{-}}\left|G\left(re^{i\theta }\right)\right|=\varphi \left(e^{i\theta }\right)} for almost every θ.

One says that h is an inner (interior) function if and only if | h | ≤ 1 on the unit disk and the limit lim r → → 1 − − h ( r e i θ θ ) {\displaystyle \lim _{r\to 1^{-}}h(re^{i\theta })} exists for almost all θ and its modulus is equal to 1 a.e.  In particular, h is in H ∞ .

[ clarification needed ] The inner function can be further factored into a form involving a Blaschke product .

The function f , decomposed as f = Gh , [ clarification needed ] is in H p if and only if φ belongs to L p ( T ), where φ is the positive function in the representation of the outer function G .

Let G be an outer function represented as above from a function φ on the circle. Replacing φ by φ α , α > 0, a family ( G α ) of outer functions is obtained, with the properties: G 1 = G , G α+β = G α G β and | G α | = | G | α almost everywhere on the circle.

It follows that whenever 0 < p , q , r < ∞ and 1/ r = 1/ p + 1/ q , every function f in H r can be expressed as the product of a function in H p and a function in H q . For example: every function in H 1 is the product of two functions in H 2 ; every function in H p , p < 1, can be expressed as product of several functions in some H q , q > 1.

Martingale H p [ edit ] Let ( M n ) n ≥0 be a martingale on some probability space (Ω, Σ, P ), with respect to an increasing sequence of σ-fields (Σ n ) n ≥0 . Assume for simplicity that Σ is equal to the σ-field generated by the sequence (Σ n ) n ≥0 . The maximal function of the martingale is defined by M ∗ ∗ = sup n ≥ ≥ 0 | M n | .

{\displaystyle M^{*}=\sup _{n\geq 0}\,|M_{n}|.} Let 1 ≤ p < ∞. The martingale ( M n ) n ≥0 belongs to martingale - H p when M* ∈ L p .

If M* ∈ L p , the martingale ( M n ) n ≥0 is bounded in L p ; hence it converges almost surely to some function f by the martingale convergence theorem . Moreover, M n converges to f in L p -norm by the dominated convergence theorem ; hence M n can be expressed as conditional expectation of f on Σ n . It is thus possible to identify martingale- H p with the subspace of L p (Ω, Σ, P ) consisting of those f such that the martingale M n = E ⁡ ⁡ ( f | Σ Σ n ) {\displaystyle M_{n}=\operatorname {E} {\bigl (}f|\Sigma _{n}{\bigr )}} belongs to martingale- H p .

Doob's maximal inequality implies that martingale- H p coincides with L p (Ω, Σ, P ) when 1 < p < ∞.  The interesting space is martingale- H 1 , whose dual is martingale-BMO ( Garsia 1973 ).

The Burkholder–Gundy inequalities (when p > 1) and the Burgess Davis inequality (when p = 1) relate the L p -norm of the maximal function to that of the square function of the martingale S ( f ) = ( | M 0 | 2 + ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ | M n + 1 − − M n | 2 ) 1 2 .

{\displaystyle S(f)=\left(|M_{0}|^{2}+\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }|M_{n+1}-M_{n}|^{2}\right)^{\frac {1}{2}}.} Martingale- H p can be defined by saying that S ( f )∈ L p ( Garsia 1973 ).

Martingales with continuous time parameter can also be considered. A direct link with the classical theory is obtained via the complex Brownian motion ( B t ) in the complex plane, starting from the point z = 0 at time t = 0. Let τ denote the hitting time of the unit circle. For every holomorphic function F in the unit disk, M t = F ( B t ∧ ∧ τ τ ) {\displaystyle M_{t}=F(B_{t\wedge \tau })} is a martingale, that belongs to martingale- H p iff F ∈ H p ( Burkholder, Gundy & Silverstein 1971 ).

Example [ edit ] In this example, Ω = [0, 1] and Σ n is the finite field generated by the dyadic partition of [0, 1] into 2 n intervals of length 2 − n ,  for every n ≥ 0. If a function f on [0, 1] is represented by its expansion on the Haar system ( h k ) f = ∑ ∑ c k h k , {\displaystyle f=\sum c_{k}h_{k},} then the martingale- H 1 norm of f can be defined by the L 1 norm of the square function ∫ ∫ 0 1 ( ∑ ∑ | c k h k ( x ) | 2 ) 1 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\Bigl (}\sum |c_{k}h_{k}(x)|^{2}{\Bigr )}^{\frac {1}{2}}\,\mathrm {d} x.} This space, sometimes denoted by H 1 (δ), is isomorphic to the classical real H 1 space on the circle ( Müller 2005 ).  The Haar system is an unconditional basis for H 1 (δ).
