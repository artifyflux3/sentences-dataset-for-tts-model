GST is sufficient for all mathematics not requiring infinite sets , and is the weakest known set theory whose theorems include the Peano axioms .

Ontology [ edit ] The ontology of GST is identical to that of ZFC , and hence is thoroughly canonical. GST features a single primitive ontological notion, that of set , and a single ontological assumption, namely that all individuals in the universe of discourse (hence all mathematical objects ) are sets. There is a single primitive binary relation , set membership ; that set a is a member of set b is written a ∈ b (usually read " a is an element of b ").

Axioms [ edit ] The  symbolic axioms below are from Boolos (1998: 196), and govern how sets behave and interact. 
As with Z , the background logic for GST is first order logic with identity . Indeed, GST is the fragment of Z obtained by omitting the axioms Union , Power Set , Elementary Sets (essentially Pairing ) and Infinity and then taking a theorem of Z, Adjunction, as an axiom. 
The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition.

1) Axiom of Extensionality : The sets x and y are the same set if they have the same members.

∀ ∀ x ∀ ∀ y [ ∀ ∀ z [ z ∈ ∈ x ↔ ↔ z ∈ ∈ y ] → → x = y ] .

{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z[z\in x\leftrightarrow z\in y]\rightarrow x=y].} The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality.

2) Axiom Schema of Specification (or Separation or Restricted Comprehension ):  If z is a set and ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is any property which may be satisfied by all, some, or no elements of z , then there exists a subset y of z containing just those elements x in z which satisfy the property ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } . The restriction to z is necessary to avoid Russell's paradox and its variants. More formally, let ϕ ϕ ( x ) {\displaystyle \phi (x)} be any formula in the language of GST in which x may occur freely and y does not. Then all instances of the following schema are axioms: ∀ ∀ z ∃ ∃ y ∀ ∀ x [ x ∈ ∈ y ↔ ↔ ( x ∈ ∈ z ∧ ∧ ϕ ϕ ( x ) ) ] .

{\displaystyle \forall z\exists y\forall x[x\in y\leftrightarrow (x\in z\land \phi (x))].} 3) Axiom of Adjunction : If x and y are sets, then there exists a set w , the adjunction of x and y , whose members are just y and the members of x .

[ 1 ] ∀ ∀ x ∀ ∀ y ∃ ∃ w ∀ ∀ z [ z ∈ ∈ w ↔ ↔ ( z ∈ ∈ x ∨ ∨ z = y ) ] .

{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y\exists w\forall z[z\in w\leftrightarrow (z\in x\lor z=y)].} Adjunction refers to an elementary operation on two sets, and has no bearing on the use of that term elsewhere in mathematics, including in category theory .

ST is GST with the axiom  schema of specification replaced by the axiom of empty set : ∃ ∃ x ∀ ∀ y [ y ∉ ∉ x ] .

{\displaystyle \exists x\forall y[y\notin x].} Discussion [ edit ] Metamathematics [ edit ] Note that Specification is an axiom schema. The theory given by these axioms is not finitely axiomatizable . Montague (1961) showed that ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, and his argument carries over to GST. Hence any axiomatization of GST must include at least one axiom schema . 
With its simple axioms, GST is also immune to the three great antinomies of naïve set theory : Russell's , Burali-Forti's , and Cantor's .

GST is Interpretable in relation algebra because no part of any GST axiom lies in the scope of more than three quantifiers . This is the necessary and sufficient condition given in Tarski and Givant (1987).

Peano arithmetic [ edit ] Setting φ( x ) in Separation to x ≠ x , and assuming that the domain is nonempty, assures the existence of the empty set .

Adjunction implies that if x is a set, then so is S ( x ) = x ∪ ∪ { x } {\displaystyle S(x)=x\cup \{x\}} . Given Adjunction , the usual construction of the successor ordinals from the empty set can proceed, one in which the natural numbers are defined as ∅ ∅ , S ( ∅ ∅ ) , S ( S ( ∅ ∅ ) ) , … … , {\displaystyle \varnothing ,\,S(\varnothing ),\,S(S(\varnothing )),\,\ldots ,} . See Peano's axioms . 
GST is mutually interpretable with Peano arithmetic (thus it has the same proof-theoretic strength as PA).

The most remarkable fact about ST (and hence GST), is that these tiny fragments of set theory give rise to such rich metamathematics. While ST is a small fragment of the well-known canonical set theories ZFC and NBG , ST interprets Robinson arithmetic (Q), so that ST inherits the nontrivial metamathematics of Q. For example, ST is essentially undecidable because Q is, and every consistent theory whose theorems include the ST axioms is also essentially undecidable.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] This includes GST and every axiomatic set theory worth thinking about, assuming these are consistent. In fact, the undecidability of ST implies the undecidability of first-order logic with a single binary predicate letter.

[ 4 ] Q is also incomplete in the sense of Gödel's incompleteness theorem . Any axiomatizable theory, such as ST and GST, whose theorems include the Q axioms is likewise incomplete. Moreover, the consistency of GST cannot be proved within GST itself, unless GST is in fact inconsistent.

Infinite sets [ edit ] Given any model M of ZFC, the collection of hereditarily finite sets in M will satisfy the GST axioms. Therefore, GST cannot prove the existence of even a countable infinite set , that is, of a set whose cardinality is ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} . Even if GST did afford a countably infinite set, GST could not prove the existence of a set whose cardinality is ℵ ℵ 1 {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}} , because GST lacks the axiom of power set . Hence GST cannot ground analysis and geometry , and is too weak to serve as a foundation for mathematics .

History [ edit ] Boolos was interested in GST only as a fragment of Z that is just powerful enough to interpret Peano arithmetic . He never lingered over GST, only mentioning it briefly in several papers discussing the systems of Frege 's Grundlagen and Grundgesetze , and how they could be modified to eliminate Russell's paradox . The system Aξ' [δ 0 ] in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223) is essentially GST with an axiom schema of induction replacing Specification , and with the existence of an empty set explicitly assumed.

GST is called STZ in Burgess (2005), p. 223.

[ 5 ] Burgess's theory ST [ 6 ] is GST with Empty Set replacing the axiom schema of specification . That the letters "ST" also appear in "GST" is a coincidence.

^ The Empty Set axiom in STZ is redundant, because the existence of the empty set is derivable from the axiom schema of Specification.
