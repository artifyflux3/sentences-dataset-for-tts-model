The position of a rigid body is determined by the position of its center of mass and by its [attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(geometry) "Attitude (geometry)") (at least six parameters in total).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-Sciavicco-1)

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **rigid body**, also known as a **rigid object**,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-2) is a [solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid")[body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") in which [deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(physics) "Deformation (physics)") is zero or negligible, when a deforming pressure or deforming force is applied on it. The [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") between any two given [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") or [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(physics) "Moment (physics)") exerted on it. A rigid body is usually considered as a [continuous distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics") of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"). **[Mechanics of rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body_dynamics "Rigid body dynamics")** is a field within mechanics where motions and forces of objects are studied without considering effects that can cause deformation (as opposed to [mechanics of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials "Strength of materials"), where deformable objects are considered).

In the study of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), a perfectly rigid body does not exist; and objects can only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), where the mass is infinitely large. In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of [point masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle"). For instance, [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules") (consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies (see [classification of molecules as rigid rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_spectroscopy#Classification_of_molecular_rotors "Rotational spectroscopy")).

### Linear and angular position

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Linear and angular position")]

The position of a rigid body is the [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system#Examples "Coordinate system") of all the particles of which it is composed. To simplify the description of this position, we exploit the property that the body is rigid, namely that all its particles maintain the same distance relative to each other. If the body is rigid, it is sufficient to describe the position of at least three non-[collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear "Collinear") particles. This makes it possible to reconstruct the position of all the other particles, provided that their [time-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-invariant "Time-invariant") position relative to the three selected particles is known. However, typically a different, mathematically more convenient, but equivalent approach is used. The position of the whole body is represented by:

1.   the _linear position_ or _[position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position\_(geometry) "Position (geometry)")_ of the body, namely the position of one of the particles of the body, specifically chosen as a reference point (typically coinciding with the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") or [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid "Centroid") of the body), together with
2.   the _[angular position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_position "Angular position")_ (also known as _orientation_, or _attitude_) of the body.

Thus, the position of a rigid body has two components: _linear_ and _angular_, respectively.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-3) The same is true for other [kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") quantities describing the motion of a rigid body, such as linear and angular [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration"), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), [impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics) "Impulse (physics)"), and [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-4)

The linear [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system#Examples "Coordinate system") can be represented by a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_vector "Position vector") with its tail at an arbitrary reference point in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space#Classical_mechanics "Space") (the origin of a chosen [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system")) and its tip at an arbitrary point of interest on the rigid body, typically coinciding with its [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") or [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid "Centroid"). This reference point may define the origin of a [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") fixed to the body.

There are several ways to numerically describe the [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of a rigid body, including a set of three [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"), a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"), or a [direction cosine matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_cosines#Cartesian_coordinates "Direction cosines") (also referred to as a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix")). All these methods actually define the orientation of a [basis set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") (or [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system")) which has a fixed orientation relative to the body (i.e. rotates together with the body), relative to another basis set (or coordinate system), from which the motion of the rigid body is observed. For instance, a basis set with fixed orientation relative to an airplane can be defined as a set of three orthogonal [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector")_b_ 1, _b_ 2, _b_ 3, such that _b_ 1 is parallel to the chord line of the wing and directed forward, _b_ 2 is normal to the plane of symmetry and directed rightward, and _b_ 3 is given by the cross product ![Image 2: {\displaystyle b_{3}=b_{1}\times b_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49332dd17bb5713a0e83bf8fecaf2dbedc6dd58a).

In general, when a rigid body moves, both its position and orientation vary with time. In the kinematic sense, these changes are referred to as _[translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\_(physics) "Translation (physics)")_ and _[rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation")_, respectively. Indeed, the position of a rigid body can be viewed as a hypothetic translation and rotation (roto-translation) of the body starting from a hypothetic reference position (not necessarily coinciding with a position actually taken by the body during its motion).

### Linear and angular velocity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Linear and angular velocity")]

_[Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")_ (also called _linear velocity_) and _[angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_velocity "Angular velocity")_ are measured with respect to a [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference").

The linear velocity of a rigid body is a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") quantity, equal to the [time rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative") of its linear position. Thus, it is the velocity of a reference point fixed to the body. During purely translational motion (motion with no rotation), all points on a rigid body move with the same [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"). However, when [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") involves rotation, the instantaneous velocity of any two points on the body will generally not be the same. Two points of a rotating body will have the same instantaneous velocity only if they happen to lie on an axis parallel to the instantaneous [axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation").

_[Angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_velocity "Angular velocity")_ is a vector quantity that describes the [angular speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_speed "Angular speed") at which the orientation of the rigid body is changing and the instantaneous [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation") about which it is rotating (the existence of this instantaneous axis is guaranteed by the [Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem")). All points on a rigid body experience the same [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") at all times. During purely rotational motion, all points on the body change position except for those lying on the instantaneous [axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation"). The relationship between orientation and angular velocity is not directly analogous to the relationship between position and velocity. Angular velocity is not the [time rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative") of orientation, because there is no such concept as an orientation vector that can be [differentiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") to obtain the angular velocity.

### Addition theorem for angular velocity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Addition theorem for angular velocity")]

The [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") of a rigid body B in a reference frame N is equal to the sum of the angular velocity of a rigid body D in N and the angular velocity of B with respect to D:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-5)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {D} }+{}^{\mathrm {D} }\!{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6edef6ecaa0f3bd8b92efbabcf125694a05c76ce)
In this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.

### Addition theorem for position

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Addition theorem for position")]

For any set of three points P, Q, and R, the position vector from P to R is the sum of the position vector from P to Q and the position vector from Q to R:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PR} }=\mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }+\mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {QR} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad8012942fc0be4ff4767fd8f03809e611f5fc8a)
The norm of a position vector is the spatial distance. Here the coordinates of all three vectors must be expressed in coordinate frames with the same orientation.

### Mathematical definition of velocity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Mathematical definition of velocity")]

The velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative") in N of the position vector from O to P:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od26-6)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {P} }={\frac {{}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}(\mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {OP} })}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/231f2c74d4b2b7f9701a6cee998f5782a561815d)
where O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/d _t_ operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N. The result is independent of the selection of O so long as O is fixed in N.

### Mathematical definition of acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Mathematical definition of acceleration")]

The acceleration of point P in reference frame N is defined as the [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative") in N of its velocity:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od26-6)

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {P} }={\frac {^{\mathrm {N} }\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}({}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {P} }).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e8767e50bbb2c3ae7770cbc60f08cbf4414b5ae)

### Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body")]

For two points P and Q that are fixed on a rigid body B, where B has an angular velocity ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8381724d296878d07741286f1ce9f3d0a62941a) in the reference frame N, the velocity of Q in N can be expressed as a function of the velocity of P in N:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od27-7)

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {Q} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\!\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {P} }+{}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6ac3ac136b38fc95fb06968a5f00622c915c266)
where ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6c72617e0e1f1e6eb37e962074816fa3509a2b8) is the position vector from P to Q.,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od27-7) with coordinates expressed in N (or a frame with the same orientation as N.) This relation can be derived from the temporal invariance of the norm distance between P and Q.

### Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body")]

By [differentiating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Differentiation "Cross product") the equation for the **Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body** in N with respect to time, the acceleration in reference frame N of a point Q fixed on a rigid body B can be expressed as

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {Q} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {P} }+{}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times \left({}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }\right)+{}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/438ae89a51bdb6914b9eda38761707103843262e)
where ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {{}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}^{\mathrm {B} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9478fbc9bca98f09cb9b6eddabb396f08fc8b842) is the [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration") of B in the reference frame N.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od27-7)

### Angular velocity and acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Angular velocity and acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body")]

As mentioned [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#Linear_and_angular_velocity), all points on a rigid body B have the same angular velocity ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f057f4cc9f11e5d61de0df11c79c4cc2098399b) in a fixed reference frame N, and thus the same angular acceleration ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}^{\mathrm {B} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58fbad8c76571cda6fc8b2294dd97510bf58acff)

### Velocity of one point moving on a rigid body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Velocity of one point moving on a rigid body")]

If the point R is moving in the rigid body B while B moves in reference frame N, then the velocity of R in N is

![Image 14: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {Q} }+{}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49ab48fc0559db31d9c231ff6891bf9dce3a884b)
where Q is the point fixed in B that is instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od28-8) This relation is often combined with the relation for the **Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body**.

### Acceleration of one point moving on a rigid body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigid_body&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Acceleration of one point moving on a rigid body")]

The acceleration in reference frame N of the point R moving in body B while B is moving in frame N is given by

![Image 15: {\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {R} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {Q} }+{}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {R} }+2{}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times {}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb4e5305cec9096a86c7de9e48275cf584f587bc)
where Q is the point fixed in B that instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_note-od28-8) This equation is often combined with **Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body**.

If _C_ is the origin of a local [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system")_L_, attached to the body, the **spatial** or **[twist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory#Twist "Screw theory")****acceleration** of a rigid body is defined as the [spatial acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_acceleration "Spatial acceleration") of _C_ (as opposed to material acceleration above): ![Image 16: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}(t,\mathbf {r} _{0})=\mathbf {a} (t,\mathbf {r} _{0})-{\boldsymbol {\omega }}(t)\times \mathbf {v} (t,\mathbf {r} _{0})={\boldsymbol {\psi }}_{c}(t)+{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}(t)\times A(t)\mathbf {r} _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44ee4aa649f107ccfa1a362df2846d48c27d3412) where

In 2D, the angular velocity is a scalar, and matrix A(t) simply represents a rotation in the _xy_-plane by an angle which is the integral of the angular velocity over time.

[Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle"), walking people, etc., usually rotate according to changes in the direction of the velocity: they move forward with respect to their own orientation. Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360°. This integer is the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number "Winding number") with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the [amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Angles "Polygon").

Any point that is rigidly connected to the body can be used as reference point (origin of coordinate system _L_) to describe the linear motion of the body (the linear position, velocity and acceleration vectors depend on the choice).

However, depending on the application, a convenient choice may be:

*   the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of the whole system, which generally has the simplest motion for a body moving freely in space;
*   a point such that the translational motion is zero or simplified, e.g. on an [axle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle "Axle") or [hinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge "Hinge"), at the center of a [ball and socket joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_and_socket_joint "Ball and socket joint"), etc.

When the center of mass is used as reference point:

*   The (linear) [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") is independent of the rotational motion. At any time it is equal to the total mass of the rigid body times the translational velocity.
*   The [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") with respect to the center of mass is the same as without translation: at any time it is equal to the [inertia tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia") times the angular velocity. When the angular velocity is expressed with respect to a coordinate system coinciding with the [principal axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia#Inertia_tensor "Moment of inertia") of the body, each component of the angular momentum is a product of a moment of inertia (a principal value of the inertia tensor) times the corresponding component of the angular velocity; the [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque") is the inertia tensor times the [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration").
*   Possible motions in the absence of external forces are translation with constant velocity, steady rotation about a fixed principal axis, and also torque-free [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession").
*   The net external force on the rigid body is always equal to the total mass times the translational acceleration (i.e., [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") holds for the translational motion, even when the net external torque is nonzero, and/or the body rotates).
*   The total [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") is simply the sum of translational and [rotational energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_energy "Rotational energy").

Two rigid bodies are said to be [different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(objects) "Equality (objects)") (not copies) if there is no [proper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_rotation "Proper rotation") from one to the other. A rigid body is called [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(mathematics) "Chirality (mathematics)") if its [mirror image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_image "Mirror image") is different in that sense, i.e., if it has either no [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") or its [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") contains only proper rotations. In the opposite case an object is called achiral: the mirror image is a copy, not a different object. Such an object may have a symmetry plane, but not necessarily: there may also be a plane of reflection with respect to which the image of the object is a rotated version. The latter applies for [_S 2n_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_groups_in_three_dimensions "Point groups in three dimensions"), of which the case _n_ = 1 is inversion symmetry.

For a (rigid) rectangular transparent sheet, inversion symmetry corresponds to having on one side an image without rotational symmetry and on the other side an image such that what shines through is the image at the top side, upside down. We can distinguish two cases:

*   the sheet surface with the image is not symmetric - in this case the two sides are different, but the mirror image of the object is the same, after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.
*   the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - in this case the two sides are the same, and the mirror image of the object is also the same, again after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.

A sheet with a through and through image is achiral. We can distinguish again two cases:

*   the sheet surface with the image has no symmetry axis - the two sides are different
*   the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - the two sides are the same

The [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") of a rigid body with one point fixed (i.e., a body with zero translational motion) is given by the underlying [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of the [rotation group SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group_SO(3) "Rotation group SO(3)"). The configuration space of a nonfixed (with non-zero translational motion) rigid body is [_E_+(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group#Direct_and_indirect_isometries "Euclidean group"), the subgroup of [direct isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group#Direct_and_indirect_isometries "Euclidean group") of the [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group "Euclidean group") in three dimensions (combinations of [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") and [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation")).

3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_ref-3)**In general, the position of a point or particle is also known, in physics, as _linear position_, as opposed to the _angular position_ of a line, or line segment (e.g., in [circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion"), the "radius" joining the rotating point with the center of rotation), or [basis set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)"), or [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system").
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body#cite_ref-4)**In [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), _linear_ means "along a straight or curved line" (the path of the particle in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(physics) "Space (physics)")). In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), however, [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear "Linear") has a different meaning. In both contexts, the word "linear" is related to the word "line". In mathematics, a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") is often defined as a straight [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"). For those who adopt this definition, a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") can be straight, and curved lines are not supposed to exist. In [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), the term _line_ is used as a synonym of the term _trajectory_, or _path_ (namely, it has the same non-restricted meaning as that given, in mathematics, to the word _curve_). In short, both straight and curved lines are supposed to exist. In kinematics and [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(physics) "Dynamics (physics)"), the following words refer to the same non-restricted meaning of the term "line": 
    *   "linear" (= along a straight or curved line),
    *   "rectilinear" (= along a straight line, from Latin _rectus_ = straight, and _linere_ = spread),
    *   "curvilinear" (=along a curved line, from Latin _curvus_ = curved, and _linere_ = spread).

 In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), the term "line" has the same meaning; namely, a [contour line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line "Contour line") is a curve.

This reference effectively combines [screw theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory "Screw theory") with rigid body [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(physics) "Dynamics (physics)") for robotic applications. The author also chooses to use [spatial accelerations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_acceleration "Spatial acceleration") extensively in place of material accelerations as they simplify the equations and allow for compact notation.
