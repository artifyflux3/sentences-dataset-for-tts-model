A Logarex system Darmstadt slide rule with 7 and 6 on A and B scales, and square roots of 6 and of 7 on C and D scales, which can be read as slightly less than 2.45 and somewhat more than 2.64, respectively The square root of 7 is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the prime number 7 .

It is an irrational algebraic number .  The first sixty significant digits of its decimal expansion are: 2.64575 13110 64590 59050 16157 53639 26042 57102 59183 08245 01803 6833...

[ 1 ] which can be rounded up to 2.646 to within about 99.99% accuracy (about 1 part in 10000).

More than a million decimal digits of the square root of seven have been published.

[ 2 ] Rational approximations [ edit ] Explanation of how to extract the square root of 7 to 7 places and more, from Hawney, 1797 The extraction of decimal-fraction approximations to square roots by various methods has used the square root of 7 as an example or exercise in textbooks, for hundreds of years.  Different numbers of digits after the decimal point are shown: 5 in 1773 [ 3 ] and 1852, [ 4 ] 3 in 1835, [ 5 ] 6 in 1808, [ 6 ] and 7 in 1797.

[ 7 ] An extraction by Newton's method (approximately) was illustrated in 1922, concluding that it is 2.646 "to the nearest thousandth".

[ 8 ] Geometry [ edit ] Root rectangles illustrate a construction of the square root of 7 (the diagonal of the root-6 rectangle).

In plane geometry , the square root of 7 can be constructed via a sequence of dynamic rectangles , that is, as the largest diagonal of those rectangles illustrated here.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The minimal enclosing rectangle of an equilateral triangle of edge length 2 has a diagonal of the square root of 7.

[ 12 ] Due to the Pythagorean theorem and Legendre's three-square theorem , 7 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}} is the smallest square root of a natural number that cannot be the distance between any two points of a cubic integer lattice (or equivalently, the length of the space diagonal of a rectangular cuboid with integer side lengths).

15 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}} is the next smallest such number.

[ 13 ] Outside of mathematics [ edit ] Scan of US dollar bill reverse with root 7 rectangle annotation On the reverse of the current US one-dollar bill , the "large inner box" has a length-to-width ratio of 7 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}} , and a diagonal of 6.0 inches, to within measurement accuracy.
