† Ophiacodontidae † Edaphosauridae † Palaeohatteriidae † Sphenacodontidae Cladistically included but traditionally excluded taxa Therapsida Pelycosaur ( / ˈ p ɛ l ɪ k ə ˌ s ɔːr / PEL -ih-kə-sor ) [ 1 ] is an older term for basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsids , excluding the therapsids and their descendants. Previously, the term mammal-like reptile was used, [ 2 ] and Pelycosauria was considered an order , but this is now thought to be incorrect and outdated.

Because it excludes the advanced synapsid group Therapsida , the term is paraphyletic and contrary to modern formal naming practice.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Thus the name pelycosaurs , similar to the term mammal-like reptiles , fell out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The terms stem mammals , protomammals , and basal or primitive synapsids are instead used where needed.

Etymology [ edit ] The modern word was created from Greek pélyx meaning 'basin' and saûros meaning 'lizard'.

[ 7 ] The term pelycosaur has been fairly well abandoned by paleontologists because it no longer matches the features that distinguish a clade.

[ 6 ] Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the therapsids . For that reason, the term is sometimes avoided by proponents of a strict cladistic approach.

Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most pelycosaurs, along with the Therapsida and Mammalia. In contrast to "pelycosaurs", Eupelycosauria is a proper monophyletic group.

Caseasauria is a pelycosaur side-branch, or clade, that did not leave any descendants.

[ citation needed ] Evolutionary history [ edit ] See also: Evolution of mammals Comparison of "pelycosaurian" skulls: 1 sphenacodont, 2 ophiacodont, 3 caseid. The quadratojugale is green, squamosale is red, jugale is blue.

The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of synapsids that have direct ancestral links with the mammals , having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate. The pelycosaurs appeared during the Late Carboniferous and reached their apex in the early part of the Permian , remaining the dominant land animals for some 40 million years. A few continued into the Capitanian , but they experienced a sharp decline in diversity in the late Kungurian .

[ 8 ] They were succeeded by the therapsids .

Description [ edit ] Cotylorhynchus (background), Ophiacodon and Varanops Some species were quite large, growing to a length of 3 metres (10 ft) or more, although most species were much smaller. Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon , Sphenacodon , Edaphosaurus , and Ophiacodon .

[ 9 ] Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America , although some small, late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa .

Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles, pelycosaurs might have lacked reptilian epidermal scales .

[ disputed – discuss ] Fossil evidence from some varanopids shows that parts of the skin were covered in rows of osteoderms , presumably overlain by horny scutes .

[ 5 ] The belly was covered in rectangular scutes, looking like those present in crocodiles .

[ 10 ] Parts of the skin not covered in scutes might have had naked, glandular skin like that found in some mammals. Dermal scutes are also found in a diverse number of extant mammals with conservative body types, such as in the tails of some rodents , sengis , moonrats , the opossums , and other marsupials , and as regular dermal armour with underlying bone in the armadillo .

At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail , consisting of elongated vertebral spines: the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids . In life, this may have been covered by skin, and likely functioned as a thermoregulatory device [ 11 ] or as a mating display .

Taxonomy [ edit ] Eothyris Dimetrodon – a sphenacodontid In phylogenetic nomenclature, "Pelycosauria" is not used formally, since it does not constitute a group of all organisms descended from some common ancestor (a clade ), because the group specifically excludes the therapsids which are descended from pelycosaurs. Instead, it represents a paraphyletic "grade" of basal synapsids leading up to the clade Therapsida.

[ 12 ] In 1940, the group was reviewed in detail, and every species known at the time described, with many illustrated, in an important monograph by Alfred Sherwood Romer and Llewellyn Price .

[ 13 ] In traditional classification, the order Pelycosauria is paraphyletic in that the therapsids (the "higher" synapsids) have emerged from them. That means Pelycosauria is a grouping of animals that does not contain all descendants of its common ancestor, as is often required by phylogenetic nomenclature . In evolutionary taxonomy , Therapsida is a separated order from Pelycosauria, and mammals (having evolved from therapsids) are separated from both as their own class. This use has not been recommended by a majority of systematists since the 1990s, [ 6 ] but several paleontologists nevertheless continue using this word.

[ 14 ] [ 12 ] The following classification was presented by Benton in 2004.
