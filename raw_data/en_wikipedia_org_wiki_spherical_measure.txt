Spherical measure is often normalized so that it is a probability measure on the sphere, i.e. so that σ n ( S n ) = 1.

Definition of spherical measure [ edit ] There are several ways to define spherical measure.  One way is to use the usual "round" or " arclength " metric ρ n on S n ;  that is, for points x and y in S n , ρ n ( x , y ) is defined to be the (Euclidean) angle that they subtend at the centre of the sphere (the origin of R n +1 ).  Now construct n -dimensional Hausdorff measure H n on the metric space ( S n , ρ n ) and define σ σ n = 1 H n ( S n ) H n .

{\displaystyle \sigma ^{n}={\frac {1}{H^{n}(\mathbf {S} ^{n})}}H^{n}.} One could also have given S n the metric that it inherits as a subspace of the Euclidean space R n +1 ;  the same spherical measure results from this choice of metric.

Another method uses Lebesgue measure λ n +1 on the ambient Euclidean space R n +1 :  for any measurable subset A of S n , define σ n ( A ) to be the ( n + 1)-dimensional volume of the "wedge" in the ball B n +1 that it subtends at the origin.  That is, σ σ n ( A ) := 1 α α ( n + 1 ) λ λ n + 1 ( { t x ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ A , t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] } ) , {\displaystyle \sigma ^{n}(A):={\frac {1}{\alpha (n+1)}}\lambda ^{n+1}(\{tx\mid x\in A,t\in [0,1]\}),} where α α ( m ) := λ λ m ( B 1 m ( 0 ) ) ( B 1 m ( 0 ) is the ball of radius 1 centered at the origin in {\displaystyle \alpha (m):=\lambda ^{m}(\mathbf {B} _{1}^{m}(0)){\text{ }}(\mathbf {B} _{1}^{m}(0){\text{ is the ball of radius 1 centered at the origin in }}} R n +1 ).

The fact that all these methods define the same measure on S n follows from an elegant result of Christensen:  all these measures are obviously uniformly distributed on S n , and any two uniformly distributed Borel regular measures on a separable metric space must be constant (positive) multiples of one another.  Since all our candidate σ n 's have been normalized to be probability measures, they are all the same measure.

Relationship with other measures [ edit ] The relationship of spherical measure to Hausdorff measure on the sphere and Lebesgue measure on the ambient space has already been discussed.

Spherical measure has a nice relationship to Haar measure on the orthogonal group .  Let O( n ) denote the orthogonal group acting on R n and let θ n denote its normalized Haar measure (so that θ n (O( n )) = 1).  The orthogonal group also acts on the sphere S n −1 .  Then, for any x ∈ S n −1 and any A ⊆ S n −1 , θ θ n ( { g ∈ ∈ O ( n ) ∣ ∣ g ( x ) ∈ ∈ A } ) = σ σ n − − 1 ( A ) .

{\displaystyle \theta ^{n}(\{g\in \mathrm {O} (n)\mid g(x)\in A\})=\sigma ^{n-1}(A).} In the case that S n is a topological group (that is, when n is 0, 1 or 3), spherical measure σ n coincides with (normalized) Haar measure on S n .

Isoperimetric inequality [ edit ] There is an isoperimetric inequality for the sphere with its usual metric and spherical measure (see Ledoux & Talagrand, chapter 1): If A ⊆ S n −1 is any Borel set and B ⊆ S n −1 is a ρ n -ball with the same σ n -measure as A , then, for any r > 0, σ σ n ( A r ) ≥ ≥ σ σ n ( B r ) , {\displaystyle \sigma ^{n}(A_{r})\geq \sigma ^{n}(B_{r}),} where A r denotes the "inflation" of A by r , i.e.

A r := { x ∈ ∈ S n ∣ ∣ ρ ρ n ( x , A ) ≤ ≤ r } .

{\displaystyle A_{r}:=\{x\in \mathbf {S} ^{n}\mid \rho _{n}(x,A)\leq r\}.} In particular, if σ n ( A ) ≥ ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ and n ≥ 2, then σ σ n ( A r ) ≥ ≥ 1 − − π π 8 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ( n − − 1 ) r 2 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \sigma ^{n}(A_{r})\geq 1-{\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{8}}}\,\exp \left(-{\frac {(n-1)r^{2}}{2}}\right).} References [ edit ] Christensen, Jens Peter Reus (1970). "On some measures analogous to Haar measure".
