It was founded in 2018 as a result of a merger between TheBlaze and CRTV LLC. The company's leadership consists of CEO Tyler Cardon and president Gaston Mooney.

[ 1 ] It is based in Irving, Texas , where it has studios and offices, as well as in Washington, D.C.

TheBlaze was a pay television network founded by Glenn Beck . Originally, it was called Glenn Beck TV, created after Beck's departure from Fox in 2011. In 2012, the network took the name of Beck's popular website, TheBlaze. From 2014 to 2017, the company had four different CEOs, followed by Beck himself. Months after Beck took the position, the company laid off over a fourth of its staff. CRTV LLC, which operated the Conservative Review and CRTV (Conservative Review Television), was an online subscription network.

History [ edit ] On August 31, 2010, three days after his Restoring Honor rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

, conservative political commentator Glenn Beck launched the TheBlaze website, describing it as an alternative to "mainstream media outlets".

[ 3 ] TheBlaze headquarters are located in Irving, Texas , at the Mercury Studios (formerly the Studios at Las Colinas).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Beck announced the creation of an online-only network replacing Insider Extreme as a result of his Fox News departure on June 7, 2011. On September 12, 2011, Beck launched GBTV (Glenn Beck TV) as an exclusive internet streaming network, produced and operated by Mercury Radio Arts. GBTV would air a television adaptation of his radio show , his television show , and other original programming, including Real News from TheBlaze , a nightly news program hosted by former CNN personality Amy Holmes .

[ 6 ] On June 18, 2012, Mercury Radio Arts announced the consolidation of all of its outlets under the "TheBlaze" brand, thus renaming the internet television station from GBTV to TheBlaze.

[ 7 ] In 2012, Dish Network placed TheBlaze on its channel lineup. As a result of the "Get TheBlaze" campaign (a movement led by supporters to have other supporters call their cable or satellite television provider and ask them to carry the channel), several smaller, regional cable operators also have recently picked up TheBlaze—including Cablevision (also known as Optimum TV – Channel 828), a major cable provider in the New York metropolitan area .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Betsy Morgan was named CEO of TheBlaze on December 9, 2014, replacing Chris Balfe, who had been CEO since the beginning. Morgan left the company in June 2015.

[ 10 ] Chief Revenue Officer Kraig Kitchin replaced Morgan until he resigned in January 2016, taking the position of Interim Head of Sales and being replaced by Stewart Padveen, a digital startup entrepreneur, who resigned in February 2017. Beck took over as CEO of the company in May 2017.

[ 11 ] In November 2015, Beck sent an open letter to the Republican National Committee , requesting permission for TheBlaze to host a Republican presidential debate; this offer was not accepted.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] TheBlaze was dropped by Cablevision on August 31, 2016.

[ 14 ] A year later, on August 31, 2017, TheBlaze laid off nearly 60 employees, which cut its personnel by almost 30%.

[ 15 ] On December 28, 2018, Verizon Fios removed TheBlaze from its lineup.

[ 16 ] TheBlaze is available as Blaze Live on ad-supported streaming service Pluto TV with 24 hours a day programming.

Merger with CRTV [ edit ] On December 3, 2018, TheBlaze Inc. television arm merged with CRTV LLC, combining resources, personalities, personnel, subscribers, and programming. The merged entity, named Blaze Media, retained TheBlaze's channel slot and incorporated two of CRTV's programs into the channel's schedule ( Steve Deace Show and Wilkow!

).

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Gavin McInnes , the co-founder of Vice Media and Vice magazine [ 19 ] [ 20 ] and founder of the far-right organization Proud Boys , [ 21 ] was expected to host his programs Get Off My Lawn and CRTV Tonight for the new company, whose co-president, Gaston Mooney, called McInnes "a comedian and provocateur, one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms." Less than a week after the merger, however, it was announced that McInnes was no longer associated with Blaze Media, with no details given as to why.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Former contributor Michelle Malkin likewise followed McInnes out the door after CRTV 's merger with TheBlaze in December 2018.
