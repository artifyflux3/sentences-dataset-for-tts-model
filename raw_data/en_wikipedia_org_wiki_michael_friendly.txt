Citizenship Canadian, American Alma mater Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( BS ) Princeton University ( MS , PhD ) Known for mosaic plot Scientific career Fields Psychology , data visualization , statistics Institutions York University, Toronto Doctoral advisor Harold Gulliksen Michael Louis Friendly (born 1945) is an American-Canadian psychologist , Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, and director of its Statistical Consulting Service, especially known for his contributions to graphical methods for categorical and multivariate data, and on the history of data and information visualisation .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Born in New York City , Friendly obtained his BS in 1966 from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , and his MS in 1969 from Princeton University . In 1971/2 he also obtained his PhD in psychology at Princeton under supervision of Harold Gulliksen and Peter Ornstein, with the thesis titled "Proximity Analysis and the Structure of Organization in Free Recall." [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Friendly's first research project in the field of psychometrics and cognitive psychology had started at the Educational Testing Service and Princeton University , and was made possible by a Psychometric Fellowship awarded by the Educational Testing Service. After graduation Friendly jointed the Department of Psychology at the York University in Ontario, Canada, where he continued his research. At the York University he was appointed Associate Professor and later on Professor of Psychology, and since 1985 also director of its Statistical Consulting Service.

Friendly is Associate Editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics and an Editor of Statistical Science.

In 2018 he became a Fellow of the American Statistical Association .

[ 5 ] Work [ edit ] Friendly's research interests have developed over years. It started in the 1970s with the application of quantitative and computer methods to problems in cognitive psychology , including the cognitive aspects of extracting information from graphical displays.

[ 6 ] In the 1990s Friendly started focussing on the history of statistics and data visualization, and furthermore graphical methods for data and information visualization.
