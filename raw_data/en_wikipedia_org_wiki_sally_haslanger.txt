English subtitles .

Haslanger has published in metaphysics , feminist metaphysics , epistemology , feminist theory , ancient philosophy , and social and political philosophy .

[ 4 ] She writes that much of her work has focused on persistence through change; objectivity and objectification; and Catharine MacKinnon 's theory of gender . She has done work on the social construction of categories often considered to be natural kinds , particularly race and gender.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] A collection of her major papers on these topics appeared as Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique (Oxford University Press, 2012), which won the American Philosophical Association 's Joseph B. Gittler Award in 2014. This prize is given for an outstanding scholarly contribution in the field of the philosophy of one or more of the social sciences.

[ 13 ] Definition of gender [ edit ] One of Haslanger's most influential notions is her analytic definition of "woman". Her definition is as follows: S is a woman iff df S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is "marked" as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.

[ 14 ] The definition has been criticized on the grounds that it marginalizes trans women (Katharine Jenkins) [ 15 ] and that it excludes the Queen of The United Kingdom ( Mari Mikkola [ de ] ).
