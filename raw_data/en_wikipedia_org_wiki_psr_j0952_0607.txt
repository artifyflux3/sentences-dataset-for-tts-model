[ 6 ] As of 2022 [update] , it holds the record for being the most massive neutron star known, with a mass 2.35 ± 0.17 times that of the Sun—potentially close to the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff mass upper limit for neutron stars.

[ 4 ] [ 7 ] The pulsar rotates at a frequency of 707 Hz (a period of 1.41 ms ), making it the second-fastest-spinning pulsar known, and the fastest-spinning pulsar known within the Milky Way .

[ 8 ] [ 6 ] PSR J0952−0607 was discovered by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope during a search for pulsars in 2016.

[ 6 ] It is classified as a black widow pulsar , a type of pulsar harboring a closely-orbiting substellar-mass companion that is being ablated by the pulsar's intense high-energy solar winds and gamma-ray emissions.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] The pulsar's high-energy emissions have been detected in gamma-ray and X-ray wavelengths.

[ 10 ] [ 3 ] [ 11 ] Discovery [ edit ] PSR J0952−0607 was first identified as an unassociated gamma-ray source detected during the first seven years of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope 's all-sky survey since 2008.

[ 8 ] : 2 Because of its optimal location away from the crowded Galactic Center and its pulsar-like [ 12 ] : 8 gamma-ray emission peak at 1.4 GeV , it was deemed a prime millisecond pulsar candidate for follow-up.

[ 8 ] : 2 The pulsar was reobserved and confirmed by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope in the Netherlands on 25 December 2016, which revealed a 707-Hz radio pulsation frequency alongside radial acceleration by an unseen binary companion.

[ 8 ] : 3 Further LOFAR observations took place from January to February 2017, alongside radio observations by the Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia in March 2017.

[ 8 ] : 3 Optical observations by the 2.54-meter Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma detected and confirmed the pulsar's companion at a faint apparent magnitude of 23 in January 2017.

[ 8 ] : 3 The discovery was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and was announced in a NASA press release in September 2017.

[ 8 ] [ 6 ] Distance and location [ edit ] The distance of PSR J0952−0607 from Earth is highly uncertain.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Binary system [ edit ] The PSR J0952−0607 binary system is composed of a massive pulsar and a substellar-mass (< 0.1 M ☉ ) [ 9 ] : 127 companion in close orbit around it.

[ 4 ] Because of this configuration, this system falls under the category of black widow pulsars that "consume" their companion, by analogy with the mating behavior of the eponymous black widow spider .

[ 7 ] The companion is continuously losing mass through ablation by intense high-energy solar winds and gamma-ray emissions from the pulsar, which then accretes some of the companion's lost material onto itself.

[ 9 ] : 127 [ 4 ] : 1 Companion [ edit ] Artist's impression of a black widow pulsar system, where a stellar-mass companion is being ablated by the intense radiation of its host pulsar The companion orbits the pulsar at a distance of 1.6 million km (1 million mi) [ b ] with an orbital period of 6.42 hours.

[ 4 ] Because it orbits so closely, the companion is presumably tidally locked , with one hemisphere always facing the pulsar.

[ 3 ] : 8 The companion does not appear to eclipse the pulsar, [ 8 ] : 1 [ 3 ] : 12 indicating that its orbit is oriented nearly face-on with an inclination of 60° with respect to the plane perpendicular to Earth's line of sight.

[ 4 ] : 4 The companion's orbital motion also does not appear to modulate the pulsar's pulsations, signifying a circular orbit with negligible orbital eccentricity .

[ 3 ] : 4 The companion was likely a former star that had been reduced to the size of a large gas giant planet or brown dwarf , [ 7 ] [ 3 ] : 12 with a present-day mass of 0.032 ± 0.002 M ☉ or 34 ± 2 M J according to radial velocity measurements.

[ 4 ] : 4 Due to intense irradiation and heating by the host pulsar, the companion's radius is bloated up to 80% of its Roche lobe [ 3 ] : 8 [ 4 ] : 4 and brightly glows with a thermal luminosity of about 10 L ☉ , [ a ] thereby accounting for much of the system's optical brightness.

[ 4 ] : 1, 4 [ 2 ] : 1 As a result of bloating, the companion attains a low density likely around 10 g/cm 3 (with significant uncertainty due to the system's unknown distance from Earth), [ 2 ] : 11 making it susceptible to tidal deformation by the pulsar.

[ 3 ] : 12 A green-light light curve for PSR J0952-0607, adapted from  Draghis et al.

[ 2 ] The companion's pulsar-facing irradiated hemisphere is continuously heated up to a temperature of 6,200 K , whereas the companion's unirradiated hemisphere experiences a uniform [ 2 ] : 4 temperature of 3,000 K .

[ 4 ] : 4 This hemispherical temperature difference corresponds to a difference in hemisphere luminosities, which in turn causes significant variability in apparent brightness as the companion rotates around the pulsar.

[ 8 ] : 4 [ 3 ] : 8 This brightness variability is demonstrated in PSR J0952−0607's optical light curve , which exhibits an amplitude greater than one magnitude .

[ 2 ] : 4 Mass [ edit ] PSR J0952−0607 has a mass of 2.35 ± 0.17 M ☉ , making it the most massive neutron star known as of 2022 [update] .

[ 4 ] The pulsar likely acquired most of its mass by accreting up to 1 M ☉ of lost material from its companion.

[ 4 ] : 5 Rotation and age [ edit ] PSR J0952−0607 rotates at a frequency of 707 Hz (1.41 ms period), making it the second-fastest-spinning pulsar known, and the fastest-spinning pulsar that is located in the Milky Way .

[ 8 ] [ 6 ] Assuming a standard neutron star radius of 10 km (6.2 mi), [ 3 ] : 11 the equator of PSR J0952−0607 rotates at a tangential velocity over 44,400 km/s (27,600 mi/s)—about 14% the speed of light .

[ 13 ] Based on 7 years of precise pulsation timing data from gamma-ray and radio observations, the pulsar's rotation period is estimated to be slowing down at a spin-down rate less than 4.6 × 10 −21 seconds per second, corresponding to a characteristic age of 4.9 billion years.

[ 3 ] : 11 Magnetic field [ edit ] Measurements of PSR J0952−0607's spin-down rate show that the pulsar has a remarkably weak surface magnetic field strength of 6.1 × 10 7 gauss (6.1 × 10 3 T ), placing it among the 10 weakest pulsar magnetic fields known as of 2022 [update] .

[ 4 ] : 1 For context, ordinary pulsar magnetic fields usually lie on the order of teragauss (1 × 10 12 G, 1.0 × 10 8 T), over 10,000 times greater than that of PSR J0952−0607.

[ 14 ] [ 4 ] : 1 Other millisecond pulsars exhibit similarly weak magnetic fields, hinting at a common albeit unknown mechanism in these types of systems; [ 3 ] : 2 possible explanations range from accreted matter burying the pulsar's surface magnetic field to heat-driven evolution of the pulsar's solid crust .

[ 14 ] : 1–2 [ 4 ] : 1 Gamma-ray emissions [ edit ] PSR J0952−0607 appears very faint in gamma-rays and was not detected in July 2011.

[ 11 ] [ 3 ] : 2 See also [ edit ] Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit Black Widow Pulsar , the prototypical namesake for the class of binary pulsars with ablating companions PSR J1748−2446ad , the fastest-spinning pulsar located in the globular cluster Terzan 5 Notes [ edit ] ^ a b Luminosity converted from erg /s to L ☉ , given 3.81 +0.46 −0.43 × 10 34 erg/s from Romani et al. (2022) [ 4 ] and the solar luminosity L ☉ = 3.826 × 10 33 erg/s .

[ 4 ] Nieder et al. (2019) determined a minimum projected semi-major axis of 0.062 6670 light seconds ( 18 787 km ) from gamma-ray and radio pulsation timing.
