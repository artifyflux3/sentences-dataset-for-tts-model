Ampèremetre (Ammeter)

A **physical quantity** (or simply **quantity**)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-ISO_80000-1-1)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-2) is a property of a material or system that can be [quantified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(science) "Quantification (science)") by [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement "Measurement"). A physical quantity can be expressed as a _value_, which is the algebraic multiplication of a _[numerical value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical\_value "Numerical value")_ and a _[unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_of\_measurement "Unit of measurement")_. For example, the physical quantity [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), symbol _m_, can be quantified as _m_=_n_ kg, where _n_ is the numerical value and kg is the unit symbol (for [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")). Quantities that are vectors have, besides numerical value and unit, direction or orientation in space.

Following [ISO 80000-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_80000-1 "ISO 80000-1"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-ISO_80000-1-1) any value or [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") of a physical quantity is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. The _value_ of a physical quantity _Z_ is expressed as the product of a _numerical value_ {_Z_} (a pure number) and a unit [_Z_]:

![Image 2: {\displaystyle Z=\{Z\}\times [Z]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/def9bab2222172f53c7a8becf5e4185293817ff6)
For example, let ![Image 3: {\displaystyle Z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc6b75e09a8aa3f04d8584b11db534f88fb56bd) be "2 metres"; then, ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \{Z\}=2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9f3e204327b8ad2f7bc390aac76ce1c24ca13fe) is the numerical value and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle [Z]=\mathrm {metre} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6a8ec250d9a5d8cc852b7f4f0942e1753dbffd7) is the unit. Conversely, the numerical value expressed in an arbitrary unit can be obtained as:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \{Z\}=Z/[Z]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f34ded144b10ed1870ed60970d3e48a6a968381)
The multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in the scientific notation of formulas. The convention used to express quantities is referred to as _[quantity calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity\_calculus "Quantity calculus")_. In formulas, the unit [_Z_] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"): see _[Dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional\_analysis "Dimensional analysis")_ for more on this treatment.

Symbols and nomenclature
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_quantity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Symbols and nomenclature")]

International recommendations for the use of symbols for quantities are set out in [ISO/IEC 80000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000 "ISO/IEC 80000"), the [IUPAP red book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAP_red_book "IUPAP red book") and the [IUPAC green book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantities,_Units_and_Symbols_in_Physical_Chemistry "Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry"). For example, the recommended symbol for the physical quantity "mass" is _m_, and the recommended symbol for the quantity "electric charge" is _Q_.

Physical quantities are normally typeset in italics. Purely numerical quantities, even those denoted by letters, are usually printed in roman (upright) type, though sometimes in italics. Symbols for elementary functions (circular trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic etc.), changes in a quantity like Δ in Δ _y_ or operators like d in d _x_, are also recommended to be printed in roman type.

Examples:

*   Real numbers, such as 1 or √2,
*   e, the base of [natural logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithms "Natural logarithms"),
*   i, the [imaginary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_numbers "Imaginary numbers") unit,
*   π for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 3.14159265...
*   δ _x_, Δ _y_, d _z_, representing differences (finite or otherwise) in the quantities _x_, _y_ and _z_
*   sin _α_, sinh _γ_, log _x_

A [_scalar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") is a physical quantity that has magnitude but no direction. Symbols for physical quantities are usually chosen to be a single letter of the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") or [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"), and are printed in italic type.

[_Vectors_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") are physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction and whose operations obey the [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms "Axioms") of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). Symbols for physical quantities that are vectors are in bold type, underlined or with an arrow above. For example, if _u_ is the speed of a particle, then the straightforward notations for its velocity are **u**, u, or ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89c41e9cf70c5e5b56e2128a136985a75f90ba43).

Scalar and vector quantities are the simplest **tensor quantities**, which are [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") that can be used to describe more general physical properties. For example, the [Cauchy stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor "Cauchy stress tensor") possesses magnitude, direction, and orientation qualities.

Dimensions, units, and kind
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_quantity&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Dimensions, units, and kind")]

The notion of _dimension_ of a physical quantity was introduced by [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier") in 1822.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-3) By convention, physical quantities are organized in a dimensional system built upon base quantities, each of which is regarded as having its own dimension.

There is often a choice of unit, though [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI")[units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") are usually used in scientific contexts due to their ease of use, international familiarity and prescription. For example, a quantity of mass might be represented by the symbol _m_, and could be expressed in the units [kilograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") (kg), [pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) "Pound (mass)") (lb), or [daltons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit) "Dalton (unit)") (Da).

[Dimensional homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_homogeneity "Dimensional homogeneity") is not necessarily sufficient for quantities to be comparable;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-ISO_80000-1-1) for example, both [kinematic viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_viscosity "Kinematic viscosity") and [thermal diffusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity "Thermal diffusivity") have dimension of square length per time (in units of [m 2/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_squared_per_second "Metre squared per second")). Quantities of the same _**kind**_ share extra commonalities beyond their dimension and units allowing their comparison; for example, not all [dimensionless quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantities "Dimensionless quantities") are of the same kind.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-ISO_80000-1-1)

Base and derived quantities
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_quantity&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Base and derived quantities")]

A system of quantities relates physical quantities, and due to this dependence, a limited number of quantities can serve as a basis in terms of which the dimensions of all the remaining quantities of the system can be defined. A set of mutually independent quantities may be chosen by convention to act as such a set, and are called base quantities. The seven base quantities of the [International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities "International System of Quantities") (ISQ) and their corresponding [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") units and dimensions are listed in the following table.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-4): 136  Other conventions may have a different number of [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_unit_(measurement) "Base unit (measurement)") (e.g. the [CGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS "CGS") and [MKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mks_system_of_units "Mks system of units") systems of units).

[International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities "International System of Quantities") base quantities | Quantity | SI unit | Dimension symbol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name(s) | (Common) symbol(s) | Name | Symbol |

| [Luminous intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_intensity "Luminous intensity") | _I_ v | [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela") | cd | J |

The angular quantities, [plane angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_angle "Plane angle") and [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle "Solid angle"), are defined as derived dimensionless quantities in the SI. For some relations, their units [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") and [steradian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian "Steradian") can be written explicitly to emphasize the fact that the quantity involves plane or solid angles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-4): 137

### General derived quantities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_quantity&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: General derived quantities")]

Derived quantities are those whose definitions are based on other physical quantities (base quantities).

Important applied base units for space and time are below. [Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") are thus, of course, derived from the length, but included for completeness as they occur frequently in many derived quantities, in particular densities.

| Quantity | SI unit | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | Symbols |
| (Spatial) [position (vector)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)") | **r**, **R**, **a**, **d** | m | L |
| Angular position, angle of rotation (can be treated as vector or scalar) | _θ_, **θ** | rad | _None_ |
| Area, cross-section | _A_, _S_, Ω | m 2 | L 2 |
| [Vector area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_area "Vector area") (Magnitude of surface area, directed normal to [tangential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") plane of surface) | ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} \equiv A\mathbf {\hat {n}} ,\quad \mathbf {S} \equiv S\mathbf {\hat {n}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/338120f397feaf173794eaaea6ba382e7f6c402e) | m 2 | L 2 |
| Volume | _τ_, _V_ | m 3 | L 3 |

#### Densities, flows, gradients, and moments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_quantity&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Densities, flows, gradients, and moments")]

Important and convenient derived quantities such as densities, [fluxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux"), [flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), [currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") are associated with many quantities. Sometimes different terms such as _current density_ and _flux density_, _rate_, _frequency_ and _current_, are used interchangeably in the same context; sometimes they are used uniquely.

To clarify these effective template-derived quantities, we use _q_ to stand for _any_ quantity within some scope of context (not necessarily base quantities) and present in the table below some of the most commonly used symbols where applicable, their definitions, usage, SI units and SI dimensions – where [_q_] denotes the dimension of _q_.

For time derivatives, specific, molar, and flux densities of quantities, there is no one symbol; nomenclature depends on the subject, though time derivatives can be generally written using overdot notation. For generality we use _q m_, _q n_, and **F** respectively. No symbol is necessarily required for the gradient of a scalar field, since only the [nabla/del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del") ∇ or [grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") needs to be written. For spatial density, current, current density and flux, the notations are common from one context to another, differing only by a change in subscripts.

For current density, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {t}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9691832d05a3903569d9c552402966c11a8d5d3b) is a unit vector in the direction of flow, i.e. tangent to a flowline. Notice the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") with the unit normal for a surface, since the amount of current passing through the surface is reduced when the current is not normal to the area. Only the current passing perpendicular to the surface contributes to the current passing _through_ the surface, no current passes _in_ the (tangential) plane of the surface.

The calculus notations below can be used synonymously.

If _X_ is a [_n_-variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus")[function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")![Image 10: {\displaystyle X\equiv X\left(x_{1},x_{2}\cdots x_{n}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/803e38d87547b3c52907e705beab13013b498f5b), then

_**Differential**_ The differential [_n_-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_space "N-dimensional space")[volume element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_element "Volume element") is ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} ^{n}x\equiv \mathrm {d} V_{n}\equiv \mathrm {d} x_{1}\mathrm {d} x_{2}\cdots \mathrm {d} x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca99298cc89fe072f13ed450c53e15d636ef5bfd),

_**Integral**_: The [_multiple_ integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integral "Multiple integral") of _X_ over the _n_-space volume is ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \int X\mathrm {d} ^{n}x\equiv \int X\mathrm {d} V_{n}\equiv \int \cdots \int \int X\mathrm {d} x_{1}\mathrm {d} x_{2}\cdots \mathrm {d} x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06f68e5460293f53a4e2ba49713ac0ac45509efb).
