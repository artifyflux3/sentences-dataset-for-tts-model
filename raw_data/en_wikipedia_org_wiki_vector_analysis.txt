_**Vector Analysis**_ is a textbook by [Edwin Bidwell Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson "Edwin Bidwell Wilson"), first published in 1901 and based on the lectures that [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs") had delivered on the subject at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"). The book did much to standardize the [notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_notation "Vector notation") and vocabulary of three-dimensional [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") and [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus"), as used by physicists and mathematicians. It was reprinted by Yale in 1913, 1916, 1922, 1925, 1929, 1931, and 1943. The work is now in the public domain. It was reprinted by [Dover Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Publications "Dover Publications") in 1960.

The book carries the subtitle "A text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics. Founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs, Ph.D., LL.D." The first chapter covers [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") in three spatial dimensions, the concept of a (real) [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"), and the product of a scalar with a vector. The second chapter introduces the [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") and [cross products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") for pairs of vectors. These are extended to a [scalar triple product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product "Triple product") and a quadruple product. Pages 77–81 cover the essentials of [spherical trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry "Spherical trigonometry"), a topic of considerable interest at the time because of its use in [celestial navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_navigation "Celestial navigation"). The third chapter introduces the vector calculus notation based on the [del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_operator "Del operator"). The [Helmholtz decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition "Helmholtz decomposition") of a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") is given on page 237.

The final eight pages develop [bivectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector_(complex) "Bivector (complex)") as these were integral to the course on the [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") theory of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") that Professor Gibbs taught at Yale. First Wilson associates a bivector with an ellipse. The product of the bivector with a [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") on the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") is then called an _elliptical rotation_. Wilson continues with a description of _elliptic harmonic motion_ and the case of [stationary waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_wave "Stationary wave").

[Hermann Grassmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann "Hermann Grassmann") had introduced basic ideas of a [linear space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_space "Linear space") in 1844 and 1862, and [W. K. Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._K._Clifford "W. K. Clifford") published _[Elements of Dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements\_of\_Dynamic "Elements of Dynamic")_ in 1878, so as Gibbs was teaching physics in the 1880s he took these developments into consideration for his students. A pamphlet that he printed for them acknowledges both Grassmann and Clifford.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Analysis#cite_note-1) The influence of Grassmann is seen in the [bivectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector_(complex) "Bivector (complex)"), and the influence of Clifford in the decomposition of the [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") product into [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") and [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product").

In 1888 Gibbs sent a copy of his pamphlet to [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") who was formulating his own vectorial system in the _Transactions of the Royal Society_, praised Gibbs' "little book", saying it "deserves to be well known". However, he also noted that it was "much too condensed for a first introduction to the subject".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Analysis#cite_note-2)

On the occasion of the bicentennial of Yale University, a series of publications were to be issued to showcase Yale's role in the advancement of knowledge. Gibbs was authoring _[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_Principles\_in\_Statistical\_Mechanics "Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics")_ for that series. Mindful of the demand for innovative university textbooks, the editor of the series, Professor Morris, wished to include also a volume dedicated to Gibbs's lectures on vectors, but Gibbs's time and attention were entirely absorbed by the _Statistical Mechanics_.

E. B. Wilson was then a new graduate student in mathematics. He had learned about quaternions from [James Mills Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mills_Peirce "James Mills Peirce") at Harvard, but Dean A. W. Phillips persuaded him to take Gibbs's course on vectors, which treated similar problems from a rather different perspective. After Wilson had completed the course, Morris approached him about the project of producing a [textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook "Textbook"). Wilson wrote the book by expanding his own class notes, providing [exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_(mathematics) "Exercise (mathematics)"), and consulting with others (including his father).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Analysis#cite_note-3)
