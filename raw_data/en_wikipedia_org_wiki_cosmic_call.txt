The messages were designed with noise-resistant format and characters.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The project was funded by Team Encounter, [ 3 ] a Texas -based startup, which went out of business in 2004.

[ 4 ] Both transmissions were at ~150 kW, 5.01 GHz ( FSK +/-24 kHz).

[ 5 ] Message structure [ edit ] Each Cosmic Call 1 session had the following structure. The Scientific Part (DDM, BM, AM, and ESM) was sent three times (at 100 bit/s), [ 6 ] and the Public Part (PP) was sent once (at 2000 bit/s), [ 6 ] according to the following arrangement: DDM → BM → AM → ESM → DDM → BM → AM → ESM → DDM → BM → AM → ESM → PP, where DDM is the Dutil-Dumas Message , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] created by Canadian scientists Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas , BM is the Braastad Message, AM is the Arecibo Message , and ESM is the Encounter 2001 Staff Message.

[ 6 ] Each Cosmic Call 2 session in 2003 had the following structure: DDM2 → DDM2 → DDM2 → AM → AM → AM → BIG → BIG → BIG → BM → ESM → PP, where DDM2 is modernized DDM (aka Interstellar Rosetta Stone , ISR), BIG is Bilingual Image Glossary .

[ 5 ] All but the PP were transmitted at 400 bit/s [ 5 ] The ISR was 263,906 bits; BM, 88,687 bits, AM, 1,679 bits; BIG was 12 binary images 121,301 bits; ESM 24,899 bits.  Total = 500,472 bits for 53 minutes.  PP was 220 megabytes and sent at a rate of 100,000 bit/s for 11 hours total.

[ 5 ] Error in Cosmic Call 1 [ edit ] The DDM incorrectly gave the neutron mass as 1.67392... instead of the known value 1.67492... This error was corrected in DDM2.

Stars targeted [ edit ] The messages were sent to the following stars: [ 9 ] Name Designation HD Constellation Date sent Arrival date Message 16 Cyg A HD 186408 Cygnus May 24, 1999 November 2069 Cosmic Call 1 15 Sge HD 190406 Sagitta June 30, 1999 February 2057 Cosmic Call 1 HD 178428 Sagitta June 30, 1999 October 2067 Cosmic Call 1 Gl 777 HD 190360 Cygnus July 1, 1999 April 2051 Cosmic Call 1 GJ 49 HIP 4872 Cassiopeia July 6, 2003 April 2036 Cosmic Call 2 GJ 208 HD 245409 Orion July 6, 2003 August 2040 Cosmic Call 2 55 Cnc HD 75732 Cancer July 6, 2003 May 2044 Cosmic Call 2 HD 10307 Andromeda July 6, 2003 September 2044 Cosmic Call 2 47 UMa HD 95128 Ursa Major July 6, 2003 May 2049 Cosmic Call 2 See also [ edit ] Arecibo message Active SETI Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence Interstellar messages References [ edit ] ^ Oberhaus, Daniel (2019-09-27).
