For the work that librarians perform at a library reference desk, see Reference desk .

The Brockhaus Enzyklopädie , the best-known traditional reference book in German-speaking countries The Lexikon des Mittelalters , a specialised German encyclopedia Encyclopædia Britannica , 15th edition: volumes of the Propedia (green), Micropedia (red), Macropedia (black), and 2-volume Index (blue) A reference work is a document, such as a paper , book or periodical (or their electronic equivalents ), to which one can refer for information .

[ 1 ] The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Such works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid opinions and the use of the first person, and emphasize facts.

Indices are a common navigation feature in many types of reference works. Many reference works are put together by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors, rather than by an individual author. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually , such as Whitaker's Almanack , and Who's Who .

Reference works include textbooks , almanacs , atlases , bibliographies , biographical sources , catalogs such as library catalogs and art catalogs, concordances , dictionaries , directories such as business directories and telephone directories , discographies , encyclopedias , filmographies , gazetteers , glossaries , handbooks , indices such as bibliographic indices and citation indices , manuals , research guides , thesauruses , and yearbooks .

[ 2 ] Reference works, while traditionally printed, are often available in electronic form and can be obtained as reference software , CD-ROMs , DVDs , or online through the Internet .

Wikipedia , an online encyclopedia , is both the largest and the most-read reference work in history.

[ 3 ] Library reference book [ edit ] In most public and academic libraries , reference books are usually not available to be borrowed by patrons like the rest of the library's holdings. Reference books are either used very frequently—a dictionary or an atlas, for example—or very infrequently, such as a highly specialized concordance . Because some reference books are consulted by patrons too frequently to have enough copies and others so infrequently that replacing it would be difficult, libraries prefer to make them available for photocopy rather than checkout.

[ 4 ] Types of reference work [ edit ] The main types and categories of reference works include: Abstracting journal – a published summary of articles, theses, reviews, conference proceedings etc. arranged systematically Almanac – an annual publication, listing a set of current, general or specific information about one or multiple subjects Annals – concise historical record in which events are arranged chronologically Atlas – a collection of maps traditionally been bound into book form Bibliography – a systematic list of books and other works such as journal articles on a given subject or which satisfy particular criteria Biographical dictionary – an encyclopedic dictionary limited to biographical information Books of Quotations – collections of quotations satisfying particular criteria, arranged systematically Chronicle / Chronology – a historical account of events arranged in chronological order Compendium – a concise collection of information pertaining to a body of knowledge Concordance – an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work Dictionary – a list of words from one or more languages, systematically arranged and giving meanings, etymologies etc.

Digest – a summary of information on a particular subject Directory – a systematically arranged list of names, addresses, products, etc.

Business directory Telephone directory Web directory Encyclopaedia – a compendium providing summaries of knowledge either from all branches or from a particular field or discipline Gazetteer – a geographical dictionary or directory used to provide systematic access to a map or atlas Glossary – an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms Handbook – a small or portable book intended to provide ready reference Index – a publication giving systematic access to a body of knowledge Lexicon – a synonym for a dictionary or encyclopaedic dictionary List – a published enumeration of a set of items Manual – a handbook providing instructions in the use of a particular product Phrase book – a collection of ready-made phrases, arranged systematically, usually for a foreign language together with a translation Ready reckoner – a printed book or table containing pre-calculated values Thematic catalogue – an index used to identify musical compositions through the citation of the opening notes Textbook – a reference work containing information about a subject Thesaurus – a reference work for finding synonyms and sometimes antonyms of words Timetable – a published list of schedules giving times for transportation or other events Yearbook – a compendium containing events relating to a specific year Electronic resources [ edit ] An electronic resource is a computer program or data that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the Internet.
