Huayras were wind-driven and used to smelt copper.

[ 1 ] The furnance has the shape of a small turret with opening for wind to enter and drive the combustion.

[ 2 ] Molten metal collects at the bottom together with slag and for most purposes once separated from the slag it needs further processing to remove impurities .

[ 2 ] In Bolivia they were in use at least until the late 19th century and were known form colonial-era description of 1640.

Museo Nacional de La Paz in Bolivia host a reconstruction of a huayra.

[ 1 ] The Atacama Desert's Tarapacá valley alone had 26 archaeological huayra sites identified by 2013.
