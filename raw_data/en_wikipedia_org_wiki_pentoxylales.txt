Discovery [ edit ] The first specimens belonging to Pentoxylales were reported by Birbal Sahni in 1948 from Jurassic-Cretaceous strata of the Rajmahal Hills of northeastern India . Remains have subsequently been reported from New Zealand , Australia and Antarctica .

[ 1 ] The oldest records of the group date to the Upper Jurassic, though there are unconfirmed Early Jurassic records.

[ 2 ] Morphology [ edit ] Stem [ edit ] The stem of Pentoxylales, referred to by the morphogenus Pentoxylon , consists of 5 or 6 wedge shaped segments embedded within thin walled ground tissue .

[ 1 ] Leaves [ edit ] Leaves of Pentoxylales are of the strap shaped Taenopteris morphotype shared with other groups of seed plants, while leaves that preserve the cuticle are referred to the morphogenus Nipaniophyllum .

The leaves are up to 20 centimetres long, and have a prominent midrib .

[ 1 ] Pollen organs [ edit ] The pollen organs of Pentoxylales, referred to the morphogenus Sahnia , consist of microsporophylls arranged in tight spirals around or on a cylindrical or dome-shaped receptacle. The base of the pollen organs are surrounded by bracts up to 6 mm long. The pollen is monosulcate and approximately 25 μm long.

[ 1 ] Seed bearing organs [ edit ] Seed bearing organs of Pentoxylales, dubbed Carnoconites , which have a central axis or peduncle , which branches into numerous structures that end with an ovule . The morphology has variously been described as infructescences , seed cones , seed-bearing fruits , or female flowers . The seeds are apparently sessile.

[ 1 ] Whole plant reconstruction [ edit ] The habit of Pentoxylales is uncertain. They have been suggested to have been small trees .

[ 1 ] Their liana -like anatomy has also led to suggestions of a habit similar to that of brambles .

[ 3 ] Phylogenetics [ edit ] The affinities of Pentoxylales remain obscure, phylogenetic analyses have proposed various affinities with other seed plants groups, including glossopterids and Bennettitales , but evidence for this is inconclusive, and they cannot be definitively linked with any other seed plant group.
