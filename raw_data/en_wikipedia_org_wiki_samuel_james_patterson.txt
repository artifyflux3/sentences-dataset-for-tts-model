Patterson Samuel James Patterson (September 7, 1948 in Belfast) [ 2 ] is a Northern Irish mathematician specializing in analytic number theory .  He has been a professor at the University of Göttingen since 1981.

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Patterson was born in Belfast and grew up in the east of the city, attending Grosvenor High School . He went to Clare College, Cambridge , in 1967, and received his BA in mathematics in 1970, and his Ph.D. (completed in 1974, awarded in 1975) on "The limit set of a Fuchsian group" under Alan Beardon .

[ 4 ] He spent 1974–1975 at Göttingen, 1975–1979 he was back at Cambridge, and 1979–1981 he was at Harvard as Benjamin Pierce Lecturer . From 1981 to his retirement in 2011 he was professor of mathematics at Göttingen.

His 18 PhD students include Jörg Brüdern [ de ] and Bernd Otto Stratmann.

[ 1 ] He is the brother of the Northern Irish taxonomist David Joseph Patterson .

Mathematics [ edit ] Subjects that Patterson deals with include discontinuous groups ( Fuchsian groups ), different zeta functions (for example those of Ruelle and Selberg , in particular those associated with certain groups of infinite covolume [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ), metaplectic groups , [ 10 ] generalized theta functions , and exponential sums in analytical number theory.

In 1978, together with Roger Heath-Brown , he disproved the Kummer conjecture on cubic Gauss sums .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] He proposed a new conjecture [ 13 ] which was based on insights from his determination of the coefficients of the cuspidal Fourier expansions of the metaplectic cubic theta function.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] This revised conjecture remained open until 2021, when it was finally proved by Alexander Dunn and Maksym Radziwiłł at Caltech.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 1976 Patterson introduced what later became known as the Patterson-Sullivan measure.

[ 4 ] The concept was further developed and extended by Dennis Sullivan starting in 1979.

[ 18 ] It has proved to be a useful tool in studying Fuchsian and Kleinian groups (and certain generalizations) and their limit sets.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] History of mathematics [ edit ] Patterson is also interested in the history of mathematics . For example, together with Ralf Meyer, he contributed an updated introduction to a new edition of a classic textbook by Hermann Weyl , [ 21 ] and an introduction to the classic textbook of Whittaker and Watson.

[ 22 ] He has collaborated with Norbert Schappacher on elucidating the biography of Kurt Heegner .

Honors and awards [ edit ] In 1984 Patterson received the Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society .

[ 23 ] He is on the executive committee of the Leibniz Archives based in Hannover [ 24 ] and has been a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences since 1998.

[ 25 ] From 1982 to 1994 he was an editor of Crelle's Journal .

[ 26 ] To mark his 60th birthday friends and colleagues in Göttingen organized a three-day conference to celebrate his life in July, 2009.

[ 21 ] Speakers at this gathering included Daniel Bump , Dorian Goldfeld , David Kazhdan , and Andrew Ranicki .

[ 27 ] A commemorative volume, Contributions in Analytic and Algebraic Number Theory (Springer 2012), edited by Valentin Blomer & Preda Mihăilescu , collecting articles related to or developed at the conference, was issued as a Festschrift for him.
