Shannon's calculation [ edit ] Shannon showed a calculation for the lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess, resulting in about 10 120 possible games, to demonstrate the impracticality of solving chess by brute force , in his 1950 paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess".

[ 1 ] (This influential paper introduced the field of computer chess .) Shannon also estimated the number of possible positions, of the general order of 63 !

32 !

8 !

2 {\displaystyle {\frac {63!}{32!{8!}^{2}}}} , or roughly 3.7 ∗ ∗ 10 43 {\displaystyle 3.7*10^{43}} .  This includes some illegal positions (e.g., pawns on the first rank, both kings in check) and excludes legal positions following captures and promotions.

Tighter bounds [ edit ] Upper [ edit ] Taking Shannon's numbers into account, Victor Allis calculated an upper bound of 5×10 52 for the number of positions, and estimated the true number to be about 10 50 .

[ 4 ] Later work proved an upper bound of 8.7×10 45 , [ 5 ] and showed an upper bound 4×10 37 in the absence of promotions.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Lower [ edit ] Allis also estimated the game-tree complexity to be at least 10 123 , "based on an average branching factor of 35 and an average game length of 80". As a comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe , to which it is often compared, is roughly estimated to be 10 80 .

Accurate estimates [ edit ] John Tromp and Peter Österlund estimated the number of legal chess positions with a 95% confidence level at ( 4.822 ± ± 0.028 ) × × 10 44 {\displaystyle (4.822\pm 0.028)\times 10^{44}} , based on an efficiently computable bijection between integers and chess positions.

[ 5 ] Number of sensible chess games [ edit ] As a comparison to the Shannon number, if chess is analyzed for the number of "sensible" games that can be played (not counting ridiculous or obvious game-losing moves such as moving a queen to be immediately captured by a pawn without compensation), then the result is closer to around 10 40 games. This is based on having a choice of about three sensible moves at each ply (half-move), and a game length of 80 plies (or, equivalently, 40 moves).
