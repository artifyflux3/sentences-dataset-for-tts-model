A megaannus (Ma) represents one million (10 6 ) years.

The geologic time scale or geological time scale ( GTS ) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth . It is a system of chronological dating that uses chronostratigraphy (the process of relating strata to time) and geochronology (a scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks). It is used primarily by Earth scientists (including geologists , paleontologists , geophysicists , geochemists , and paleoclimatologists ) to describe the timing and relationships of events in geologic history. The time scale has been developed through the study of rock layers and the observation of their relationships and identifying features such as lithologies , paleomagnetic properties, and fossils . The definition of standardised international units of geological time is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), whose primary objective [ 1 ] is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC) [ 2 ] that are used to define divisions of geological time. The chronostratigraphic divisions are in turn used to define geochronologic units.

[ 2 ] Principles [ edit ] See also: Age of Earth , History of Earth , and Geological history of Earth The geologic time scale is a way of representing deep time based on events that have occurred through Earth's history , a time span of about 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years .

[ 3 ] It chronologically organises strata, and subsequently time, by observing fundamental changes in stratigraphy that correspond to major geological or paleontological events. For example, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , marks the lower boundary of the Paleogene System/Period and thus the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene systems/periods. For divisions prior to the Cryogenian , arbitrary numeric boundary definitions ( Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages , GSSAs) are used to divide geologic time. Proposals have been made to better reconcile these divisions with the rock record.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Historically, regional geologic time scales were used [ 5 ] due to the litho- and biostratigraphic differences around the world in time equivalent rocks. The ICS has long worked to reconcile conflicting terminology by standardising globally significant and identifiable stratigraphic horizons that can be used to define the lower boundaries of chronostratigraphic units. Defining chronostratigraphic units in such a manner allows for the use of global, standardised nomenclature. The International Chronostratigraphic Chart represents this ongoing effort.

Several key principles are used to determine the relative relationships of rocks and thus their chronostratigraphic position.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The law of superposition that states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will lie at the bottom of the sequence, while newer material stacks upon the surface.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 7 ] In practice, this means a younger rock will lie on top of an older rock unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise.

The principle of original horizontality that states layers of sediments will originally be deposited horizontally under the action of gravity.

[ 8 ] [ 10 ] [ 7 ] However, it is now known that not all sedimentary layers are deposited purely horizontally, [ 7 ] [ 11 ] but this principle is still a useful concept.

The principle of lateral continuity that states layers of sediments extend laterally in all directions until either thinning out or being cut off by a different rock layer, i.e. they are laterally continuous.

[ 8 ] Layers do not extend indefinitely; their limits are controlled by the amount and type of sediment in a sedimentary basin , and the geometry of that basin.

The principle of cross-cutting relationships that states a rock that cuts across another rock must be younger than the rock it cuts across.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 7 ] The law of included fragments that states small fragments of one type of rock that are embedded in a second type of rock must have formed first, and were included when the second rock was forming.

[ 10 ] [ 7 ] The relationships of unconformities which are geologic features representing a gap in the geologic record. Unconformities are formed during periods of erosion or non-deposition, indicating non-continuous sediment deposition.

[ 7 ] Observing the type and relationships of unconformities in strata allows geologist to understand the relative timing of the strata.

The principle of faunal succession (where applicable) that states rock strata contain distinctive sets of fossils that succeed each other vertically in a specific and reliable order.

[ 12 ] [ 7 ] This allows for a correlation of strata even when the horizon between them is not continuous.

Divisions of geologic time [ edit ] See also: Stratigraphy , Chronostratigraphy , Biostratigraphy , Magnetostratigraphy , Lithostratigraphy , and Geochronology The geologic time scale is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.

An eon is the largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic eonothem .

[ 13 ] There are four formally defined eons: the Hadean , Archean , Proterozoic and Phanerozoic .

[ 2 ] An era is the second largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic erathem .

[ 14 ] [ 13 ] There are ten defined eras: the Eoarchean , Paleoarchean , Mesoarchean , Neoarchean , Paleoproterozoic , Mesoproterozoic , Neoproterozoic , Paleozoic , Mesozoic and Cenozoic , with none from the Hadean eon.

[ 2 ] A period is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic system .

[ 14 ] [ 13 ] There are 22 defined periods, with the current being the Quaternary period.

[ 2 ] As an exception, two subperiods are used for the Carboniferous Period .

[ 14 ] An epoch is the second smallest geochronologic unit. It is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic series .

[ 14 ] [ 13 ] There are 37 defined epochs and one informal one. The current epoch is the Holocene . There are also 11 subepochs which are all within the Neogene and Quaternary.

[ 2 ] The use of subepochs as formal units in international chronostratigraphy was ratified in 2022.

[ 15 ] An age is the smallest hierarchical geochronologic unit. It is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic stage .

[ 14 ] [ 13 ] There are 96 formal and five informal ages.

[ 2 ] The current age is the Meghalayan .

A chron is a non-hierarchical formal geochronology unit of unspecified rank and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic chronozone .

[ 14 ] These correlate with magnetostratigraphic , lithostratigraphic , or biostratigraphic units as they are based on previously defined stratigraphic units or geologic features.

Formal, hierarchical units of the geologic time scale (largest to smallest) Chronostratigraphic unit (strata) Geochronologic unit (time) Time span [ note 1 ] Eonothem Eon Several hundred million years to two billion years Erathem Era Tens to hundreds of millions of years System Period Millions of years to tens of millions of years Series Epoch Hundreds of thousands of years to tens of millions of years Subseries Subepoch Thousands of years to millions of years Stage Age Thousands of years to millions of years The subdivisions Early and Late are used as the geochronologic equivalents of the chronostratigraphic Lower and Upper , e.g., Early Triassic Period (geochronologic unit) is used in place of Lower Triassic System (chronostratigraphic unit).

Rocks representing a given chronostratigraphic unit are that chronostratigraphic unit, and the time they were laid down in is the geochronologic unit, e.g., the rocks that represent the Silurian System are the Silurian System and they were deposited during the Silurian Period. This definition means the numeric age of a geochronologic unit can be changed (and is more often subject to change) when refined by geochronometry while the equivalent chronostratigraphic unit (the revision of which is less frequent) remains unchanged. For example, in early 2022, the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods (geochronologic units) was revised from 541 Ma to 538.8 Ma but the rock definition of the boundary (GSSP) at the base of the Cambrian, and thus the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian systems (chronostratigraphic units) has not been changed; rather, the absolute age has merely been refined.

Terminology [ edit ] Chronostratigraphy is the element of stratigraphy that deals with the relation between rock bodies and the relative measurement of geological time.

[ 14 ] It is the process where distinct strata between defined stratigraphic horizons are assigned to represent a relative interval of geologic time.

A chronostratigraphic unit is a body of rock, layered or unlayered, that is defined between specified stratigraphic horizons which represent specified intervals of geologic time. They include all rocks representative of a specific interval of geologic time, and only this time span. Eonothem, erathem, system, series, subseries, stage, and substage are the hierarchical chronostratigraphic units.

[ 14 ] A geochronologic unit is a subdivision of geologic time. It is a numeric representation of an intangible property (time).

[ 16 ] These units are arranged in a hierarchy: eon, era, period, epoch, subepoch, age, and subage.

[ 14 ] Geochronology is the scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks, fossils, and sediments either through absolute (e.g., radiometric dating ) or relative means (e.g., stratigraphic position , paleomagnetism , stable isotope ratios ).

Geochronometry is the field of geochronology that numerically quantifies geologic time.

[ 16 ] A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is an internationally agreed-upon reference point on a stratigraphic section that defines the lower boundaries of stages on the geologic time scale.

[ 17 ] (Recently this has been used to define the base of a system) [ 18 ] A Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA) [ 19 ] is a numeric-only, chronologic reference point used to define the base of geochronologic units prior to the Cryogenian. These points are arbitrarily defined.

[ 14 ] They are used where GSSPs have not yet been established. Research is ongoing to define GSSPs for the base of all units that are currently defined by GSSAs.

The standard international units of the geologic time scale are published by the International Commission on Stratigraphy on the International Chronostratigraphic Chart; however, regional terms are still in use in some areas. The numeric values on the International Chronostratigrahpic Chart are represented by the unit Ma (megaannum, for 'million years '). For example, 201.4 ± 0.2  Ma, the lower boundary of the Jurassic Period, is defined as 201,400,000 years old with an uncertainty of 200,000 years. Other SI prefix units commonly used by geologists are Ga (gigaannum, billion years), and ka (kiloannum, thousand years), with the latter often represented in calibrated units ( before present ).

Naming of geologic time [ edit ] The names of geologic time units are defined for chronostratigraphic units with the corresponding geochronologic unit sharing the same name with a change to the suffix (e.g. Phanerozoic Eonothem becomes the Phanerozoic Eon). Names of erathems in the Phanerozoic were chosen to reflect major changes in the history of life on Earth: Paleozoic (old life), Mesozoic (middle life), and Cenozoic (new life). Names of systems are diverse in origin, with some indicating chronologic position (e.g., Paleogene), while others are named for lithology (e.g., Cretaceous), geography (e.g., Permian ), or are tribal (e.g., Ordovician ) in origin. Most currently recognised series and subseries are named for their position within a system/series (early/middle/late); however, the International Commission on Stratigraphy advocates for all new series and subseries to be named for a geographic feature in the vicinity of its stratotype or type locality . The name of stages should also be derived from a geographic feature in the locality of its stratotype or type locality.

[ 14 ] Informally, the time before the Cambrian is often referred to as the Precambrian or pre-Cambrian (Supereon).

[ 37 ] The broader concept of the relation between rocks and time can be traced back to (at least) the philosophers of Ancient Greece from 1200 BC to 600 AD.

Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570–487 BCE ) observed rock beds with fossils of seashells located above the sea-level, viewed them as once living organisms, and used this to imply an unstable relationship in which the sea had at times transgressed over the land and at other times had regressed .

[ 38 ] This view was shared by a few of Xenophanes's scholars and those that followed, including Aristotle (384–322 BC) who (with additional observations) reasoned that the positions of land and sea had changed over long periods of time. The concept of deep time was also recognized by Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo [ 39 ] (1031–1095) and Islamic scientist -philosophers, notably the Brothers of Purity , who wrote on the processes of stratification over the passage of time in their treatises .

[ 38 ] Their work likely inspired that of the 11th-century Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sînâ, 980–1037) who wrote in The Book of Healing (1027) on the concept of stratification and superposition, pre-dating Nicolas Steno by more than six centuries.

[ 38 ] Avicenna also recognized fossils as "petrifications of the bodies of plants and animals", [ 40 ] with the 13th-century Dominican bishop Albertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280), who drew from Aristotle's natural philosophy, extending this into a theory of a petrifying fluid.

[ 41 ] These works appeared to have little influence on scholars in Medieval Europe who looked to the Bible to explain the origins of fossils and sea-level changes, often attributing these to the ' Deluge ', including Ristoro d'Arezzo in 1282.

[ 38 ] It was not until the Italian Renaissance when Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) would reinvigorate the relationships between stratification, relative sea-level change, and time, denouncing attribution of fossils to the 'Deluge': [ 42 ] [ 38 ] Of the stupidity and ignorance of those who imagine that these creatures were carried to such places distant from the sea by the Deluge...Why do we find so many fragments and whole shells between the different layers of stone unless they had been upon the shore and had been covered over by earth newly thrown up by the sea which then became petrified? And if the above-mentioned Deluge had carried them to these places from the sea, you would find the shells at the edge of one layer of rock only, not at the edge of many where may be counted the winters of the years during which the sea multiplied the layers of sand and mud brought down by the neighboring rivers and spread them over its shores. And if you wish to say that there must have been many deluges in order to produce these layers and the shells among them it would then become necessary for you to affirm that such a deluge took place every year.

Sketch of the Succession of Strata and their Relative Altitudes (William Smith) These views of da Vinci remained unpublished, and thus lacked influence at the time; however, questions of fossils and their significance were pursued and, while views against Genesis were not readily accepted and dissent from religious doctrine was in some places unwise, scholars such as Girolamo Fracastoro shared da Vinci's views, and found the attribution of fossils to the 'Deluge' absurd.

[ 38 ] Although many theories surrounding philosophy and concepts of rocks were developed in earlier years, "the first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century." [ 41 ] Later, in the 19th century, academics further developed theories on stratification.

William Smith , often referred to as the "Father of Geology" [ 43 ] developed theories through observations rather than drawing from the scholars that came before him. Smith's work was primarily based on his detailed study of rock layers and fossils during his time and he created "the first map to depict so many rock formations over such a large area".

[ 43 ] After studying rock layers and the fossils they contained, Smith concluded that each layer of rock contained distinct material that could be used to identify and correlate rock layers across different regions of the world.

[ 44 ] Smith developed the concept of faunal succession or the idea that fossils can serve as a marker for the age of the strata they are found in and published his ideas in his 1816 book, "Strata identified by organized fossils." [ 44 ] Establishment of primary principles [ edit ] Niels Stensen, more commonly known as Nicolas Steno (1638–1686), is credited with establishing four of the guiding principles of stratigraphy.

[ 38 ] In De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus Steno states: [ 8 ] [ 45 ] When any given stratum was being formed, all the matter resting on it was fluid and, therefore, when the lowest stratum was being formed, none of the upper strata existed.

... strata which are either perpendicular to the horizon or inclined to it were at one time parallel to the horizon.

When any given stratum was being formed, it was either encompassed at its edges by another solid substance or it covered the whole globe of the earth. Hence, it follows that wherever bared edges of strata are seen, either a continuation of the same strata must be looked for or another solid substance must be found that kept the material of the strata from being dispersed.

If a body or discontinuity cuts across a stratum, it must have formed after that stratum.

Respectively, these are the principles of superposition, original horizontality, lateral continuity, and cross-cutting relationships. From this Steno reasoned that strata were laid down in succession and inferred relative time (in Steno's belief, time from Creation ). While Steno's principles were simple and attracted much attention, applying them proved challenging.

[ 38 ] These basic principles, albeit with improved and more nuanced interpretations, still form the foundational principles of determining the correlation of strata relative to geologic time.

Over the course of the 18th-century geologists realised that: Sequences of strata often become eroded, distorted, tilted, or even inverted after deposition Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances The strata of any given area represented only part of Earth's long history Formulation of a modern geologic time scale [ edit ] The apparent, earliest formal division of the geologic record with respect to time was introduced during the era of Biblical models by Thomas Burnet who applied a two-fold terminology to mountains by identifying " montes primarii " for rock formed at the time of the 'Deluge', and younger " monticulos secundarios" formed later from the debris of the " primarii" .

[ 46 ] [ 38 ] Anton Moro (1687–1784) also used primary and secondary divisions for rock units but his mechanism was volcanic.

[ 47 ] [ 38 ] In this early version of the Plutonism theory, the interior of Earth was seen as hot, and this drove the creation of primary igneous and metamorphic rocks and secondary rocks formed contorted and fossiliferous sediments. These primary and secondary divisions were expanded on by Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti (1712–1783) and Giovanni Arduino (1713–1795) to include tertiary and quaternary divisions.

[ 38 ] These divisions were used to describe both the time during which the rocks were laid down, and the collection of rocks themselves (i.e., it was correct to say Tertiary rocks, and Tertiary Period). Only the Quaternary division is retained in the modern geologic time scale, while the Tertiary division was in use until the early 21st century. The Neptunism and Plutonism theories would compete into the early 19th century with a key driver for resolution of this debate being the work of James Hutton (1726–1797), in particular his Theory of the Earth , first presented before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785.

[ 48 ] [ 9 ] [ 49 ] Hutton's theory would later become known as uniformitarianism , popularised by John Playfair [ 50 ] (1748–1819) and later Charles Lyell (1797–1875) in his Principles of Geology .

[ 10 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Their theories strongly contested the 6,000 year age of the Earth as suggested determined by James Ussher via Biblical chronology that was accepted at the time by western religion. Instead, using geological evidence, they contested Earth to be much older, cementing the concept of deep time.

During the early 19th century William Smith , Georges Cuvier , Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy , and Alexandre Brongniart pioneered the systematic division of rocks by stratigraphy and fossil assemblages. These geologists began to use the local names given to rock units in a wider sense, correlating strata across national and continental boundaries based on their similarity to each other. Many of the names below erathem/era rank in use on the modern ICC/GTS were determined during the early to mid-19th century.

The advent of geochronometry [ edit ] During the 19th century, the debate regarding Earth's age was renewed, with geologists estimating ages based on denudation rates and sedimentary thicknesses or ocean chemistry, and physicists determining ages for the cooling of the Earth or the Sun using basic thermodynamics or orbital physics.

[ 3 ] These estimations varied from 15,000 million years to 0.075 million years depending on method and author, but the estimations of Lord Kelvin and Clarence King were held in high regard at the time due to their pre-eminence in physics and geology. All of these early geochronometric determinations would later prove to be incorrect.

The discovery of radioactive decay by Henri Becquerel , Marie Curie , and Pierre Curie laid the ground work for radiometric dating, but the knowledge and tools required for accurate determination of radiometric ages would not be in place until the mid-1950s.

[ 3 ] Early attempts at determining ages of uranium minerals and rocks by Ernest Rutherford , Bertram Boltwood , Robert Strutt , and Arthur Holmes, would culminate in what are considered the first international geological time scales by Holmes in 1911 and 1913.

[ 36 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] The discovery of isotopes in 1913 [ 55 ] by Frederick Soddy , and the developments in mass spectrometry pioneered by Francis William Aston , Arthur Jeffrey Dempster , and Alfred O. C. Nier during the early to mid- 20th century would finally allow for the accurate determination of radiometric ages, with Holmes publishing several revisions to his geological time-scale with his final version in 1960.

[ 3 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Modern international geological time scale [ edit ] The establishment of the IUGS in 1961 [ 58 ] and acceptance of the Commission on Stratigraphy (applied in 1965) [ 59 ] to become a member commission of IUGS led to the founding of the ICS. One of the primary objectives of the ICS is "the establishment, publication and revision of the ICS International Chronostratigraphic Chart which is the standard, reference global Geological Time Scale to include the ratified Commission decisions".

[ 1 ] Following on from Holmes, several A Geological Time Scale books were published in 1982, [ 60 ] 1989, [ 61 ] 2004, [ 62 ] 2008, [ 63 ] 2012, [ 64 ] 2016, [ 65 ] and 2020.

[ 66 ] However, since 2013, the ICS has taken responsibility for producing and distributing the ICC citing the commercial nature, independent creation, and lack of oversight by the ICS on the prior published GTS versions (GTS books prior to 2013) although these versions were published in close association with the ICS.

[ 2 ] Subsequent Geologic Time Scale books (2016 [ 65 ] and 2020 [ 66 ] ) are commercial publications with no oversight from the ICS, and do not entirely conform to the chart produced by the ICS. The ICS produced GTS charts are versioned (year/month) beginning at v2013/01. At least one new version is published each year incorporating any changes ratified by the ICS since the prior version.

The following five timelines show the geologic time scale to scale. The first shows the entire time from the formation of Earth to the present, but this gives little space for the most recent eon. The second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon. In a similar way, the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline, the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline, and the most recent epoch is expanded in the fifth timeline.

(Horizontal scale is millions of years for the above timelines; thousands of years for the timeline below) Major proposed revisions to the ICC [ edit ] Proposed Anthropocene Series/Epoch [ edit ] Main article: Anthropocene First suggested in 2000, [ 67 ] the Anthropocene is a proposed epoch/series for the most recent time in Earth's history. While still informal, it is a widely used term to denote the present geologic time interval, in which many conditions and processes on Earth are profoundly altered by human impact.

[ 68 ] As of April 2022 [update] the Anthropocene has not been ratified by the ICS; however, in May 2019 the Anthropocene Working Group voted in favour of submitting a formal proposal to the ICS for the establishment of the Anthropocene Series/Epoch.

[ 69 ] Nevertheless, the definition of the Anthropocene as a geologic time period rather than a geologic event remains controversial and difficult.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Proposals for revisions to pre-Cryogenian timeline [ edit ] Shields et al. 2021 [ edit ] The ICS Subcommission for Cryogenian Stratigraphy has outlined a template to improve the pre-Cryogenian geologic time scale based on the rock record to bring it in line with the post-Tonian geologic time scale.

[ 4 ] This work assessed the geologic history of the currently defined eons and eras of the Precambrian, [ note 2 ] and the proposals in the "Geological Time Scale" books 2004, [ 74 ] 2012, [ 5 ] and 2020.

[ 75 ] Their recommend revisions [ 4 ] of the pre-Cryogenian geologic time scale were as below (changes from the current scale [v2023/09] are italicised). This suggestion was unanimously rejected by the International Subcommission for Precambrian Stratigraphy, based on scientific weaknesses.

Three divisions of the Archean instead of four by dropping Eoarchean, and revisions to their geochronometric definition, along with the repositioning of the Siderian into the latest Neoarchean, and a potential Kratian division in the Neoarchean.

Tonian ( 800 –720 Ma) Cryogenian (720–635 Ma) Ediacaran (635–538.8 Ma) Proposed pre-Cambrian timeline (Shield et al. 2021, ICS working group on pre-Cryogenian chronostratigraphy), shown to scale: [ note 5 ] ICC pre-Cambrian timeline (v2024/12, current as of January 2025 [update] ), shown to scale: Van Kranendonk et al. 2012 (GTS2012) [ edit ] The book, Geologic Time Scale 2012, was the last commercial publication of an international chronostratigraphic chart that was closely associated with the ICS and the Subcommission on Precambrian Stratigraphy.

[ 2 ] It included a proposal to substantially revise the pre-Cryogenian time scale to reflect important events such as the formation of the Solar System and the Great Oxidation Event , among others, while at the same time maintaining most of the previous chronostratigraphic nomenclature for the pertinent time span.

[ 76 ] As of April 2022 [update] these proposed changes have not been accepted by the ICS. The proposed changes (changes from the current scale [v2023/09]) are italicised: Hadean Eon (4567 –4030 Ma) Chaotian Era/Erathem ( 4567–4404 Ma) – the name alluding both to the mythological Chaos and the chaotic phase of planet formation .

[ 64 ] Jatulian or Eukaryian Period/System ( 2250–2060 Ma) – names are respectively for the Lomagundi–Jatuli δ 13 C isotopic excursion event spanning its duration, and for the (proposed) [ 79 ] [ 80 ] first fossil appearance of eukaryotes .

[ 64 ] Columbian Period/System ( 2060–1780 Ma) – named after the supercontinent Columbia .

[ 64 ] Mesoproterozoic Era/Erathem ( 1780–850 Ma) Rodinian Period/System ( 1780–850 Ma) – named after the supercontinent Rodinia , stable environment.

[ 64 ] Proposed pre-Cambrian timeline (GTS2012), shown to scale: ICC pre-Cambrian timeline (v2024/12, current as of January 2025 [update] ), shown to scale: Table of geologic time [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

( November 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The following table summarises the major events and characteristics of the divisions making up the geologic time scale of Earth. This table is arranged with the most recent geologic periods at the top, and the oldest at the bottom. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time. As such, this table is not to scale and does not accurately represent the relative time-spans of each geochronologic unit. While the Phanerozoic Eon looks longer than the rest, it merely spans ~538.8 million years (~11.8% of Earth's history), whilst the previous three eons [ note 2 ] collectively span ~4,028.2 million years (~88.2% of Earth's history). This bias toward the most recent eon is in part due to the relative lack of information about events that occurred during the first three eons compared to the current eon (the Phanerozoic).

[ 4 ] [ 81 ] The use of subseries/subepochs has been ratified by the ICS.

[ 15 ] While some regional terms are still in use, [ 5 ] the table of geologic time conforms to the nomenclature , ages, and colour codes set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in the official International Chronostratigraphic Chart.

[ 1 ] [ 82 ] The International Commission on Stratigraphy also provide an online interactive version of this chart. The interactive version is based on a service delivering a machine-readable Resource Description Framework / Web Ontology Language representation of the time scale, which is available through the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information GeoSciML project as a service [ 83 ] and at a SPARQL end-point.

End of Permo-Carboniferous glaciation. Hot and dry climate. A possible drop in oxygen levels.

Synapsids ( pelycosaurs and therapsids ) become widespread and dominant, while parareptiles and temnospondyl amphibians remain common, with the latter probably giving rise to modern amphibians in this period. In the mid-Permian, lycophytes are heavily replaced by ferns and seed plants.

Beetles and flies evolve. The very large arthropods and non-tetrapod tetrapodomorphs go extinct. Marine life flourishes in warm shallow reefs; productid and spiriferid brachiopods, bivalves, forams , ammonoids (including goniatites), and orthoceridans all abundant.

Euramerica collides with Gondwana and Siberia-Kazakhstania, the latter of which forms Laurasia and the Uralian orogeny . Variscan orogeny continues (these collisions created orogenies, and ultimately Pangaea ).

Amphibians (e.g. temnospondyls) spread in Euramerica, with some becoming the first amniotes .

Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse occurs, initiating a dry climate which favors amniotes over amphibians. Amniotes diversify rapidly into synapsids , parareptiles , cotylosaurs , protorothyridids and diapsids .

Rhizodonts remained common before they died out by the end of the period. First sharks .

303.7 Kasimovian 307 ± 0.1 Moscovian 315.2 ± 0.2 Bashkirian 323.4 * Mississippian [ note 9 ] Serpukhovian Large lycopodian primitive trees flourish and amphibious eurypterids live amid coal -forming coastal swamps , radiating significantly one last time. First gymnosperms . First holometabolous , paraneopteran , polyneopteran , odonatopteran and ephemeropteran insects and first barnacles . First five-digited tetrapods (amphibians) and land snails . In the oceans, bony and cartilaginous fishes are dominant and diverse; echinoderms (especially crinoids and blastoids ) abundant.

Corals , bryozoans , orthoceridans , goniatites and brachiopods ( Productida , Spiriferida , etc.) recover and become very common again, but trilobites and nautiloids decline.

Strophomenid and atrypid brachiopods , rugose and tabulate corals, and crinoids are all abundant in the oceans. First fully coiled cephalopods ( Ammonoidea and Nautilida , independently) with the former group very abundant (especially goniatites ). Trilobites and ostracoderms decline, while jawed fishes ( placoderms , lobe-finned and ray-finned bony fish , and acanthodians and early cartilaginous fish ) proliferate. Some lobe finned fish transform into digited fishapods , slowly becoming amphibious. The last non-trilobite artiopods die off. First decapods (like prawns ) and isopods . Pressure from jawed fishes cause eurypterids to decline and some cephalopods to lose their shells while anomalocarids vanish. "Old Red Continent" of Euramerica persists after forming in the Caledonian orogeny. Beginning of Acadian Orogeny for Anti-Atlas Mountains of North Africa, and Appalachian Mountains of North America, also the Antler , Variscan , and Tuhua orogenies in New Zealand. A series of extinction events, including the massive Kellwasser and Hangenberg ones, wipe out many acritarchs, corals, sponges, molluscs, trilobites, eurypterids, graptolites, brachiopods, crinozoans (e.g. all cystoids ), and fish, including all placoderms and ostracoderms.

Formation of Earth (4,543 to 4,540 Ma) 4567 ± 0.16 [ note 10 ] Non-Earth based geologic time scales [ edit ] Main articles: Lunar geologic timescale , Martian geologic timescale , and Geology of Venus Some other planets and satellites in the Solar System have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories, for example, Venus , Mars and the Earth's Moon . Dominantly fluid planets, such as the giant planets , do not comparably preserve their history. Apart from the Late Heavy Bombardment , events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earth's time scale, except in a Solar System context. The existence, timing, and terrestrial effects of the Late Heavy Bombardment are still a matter of debate.

[ note 12 ] Lunar (selenological) time scale [ edit ] The geologic history of Earth's Moon has been divided into a time scale based on geomorphological markers, namely impact cratering , volcanism , and erosion . This process of dividing the Moon's history in this manner means that the time scale boundaries do not imply fundamental changes in geological processes, unlike Earth's geologic time scale. Five geologic systems/periods ( Pre-Nectarian , Nectarian , Imbrian , Eratosthenian , Copernican ), with the Imbrian divided into two series/epochs (Early and Late) were defined in the latest Lunar geologic time scale.

[ 115 ] The Moon is unique in the Solar System in that it is the only other body from which humans have rock samples with a known geological context.

Millions of years before present Martian geologic time scale [ edit ] The geological history of Mars has been divided into two alternate time scales. The first time scale for Mars was developed by studying the impact crater densities on the Martian surface. Through this method four periods have been defined, the Pre-Noachian (~4,500–4,100 Ma), Noachian (~4,100–3,700 Ma), Hesperian (~3,700–3,000 Ma), and Amazonian (~3,000 Ma to present).

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Martian time periods (millions of years ago) Epochs: A second time scale based on mineral alteration observed by the OMEGA spectrometer on board the Mars Express . Using this method, three periods were defined, the Phyllocian (~4,500–4,000 Ma), Theiikian (~4,000–3,500 Ma), and Siderikian (~3,500 Ma to present).

From p. 193: "Ce que je désirerais ... dont il faut également les distinguer." (What I would desire to prove above all is that the series of tertiary deposits continued – and even began in the more recent basins – for a long time, perhaps after that of the Seine had been completely filled, and that these later formations – Quaternary (1), so to say – should not retain the name of alluvial deposits any more than the true and ancient tertiary deposits, from which they must also be distinguished.)  However, on the very same page, Desnoyers abandoned the use of the term "Quaternary" because the distinction between Quaternary and Tertiary deposits wasn't clear.  From p. 193: "La crainte de voir mal comprise ... que ceux du bassin de la Seine." (The fear of seeing my opinion in this regard be misunderstood or exaggerated, has made me abandon the word "quaternary", which at first I had wanted to apply to all deposits more recent than those of the Seine basin.) ^ d'Halloy, d'O., J.-J.
