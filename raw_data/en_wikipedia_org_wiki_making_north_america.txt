[ 1 ] The PBS Nova film, comprising three episodes of one hour each, was hosted by Kirk Johnson (Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History ); Peter Oxley directed the first episode while Gwyn Williams directed the second and third. The series describes the very beginnings and later developments of the North American continent : from the origin of planet Earth 4.54 billion years ago; to the various movements of tectonic plates and their effect on the sculpturing of the continent's land and mountains, including the Rocky Mountains , Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon ; to the emergence of life on the continent and its later evolution ; and, finally, to the more recent settlement of the land by humans.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] According to Johnson, "Most people will not have considered a time when there was no North America ... What was there before North America? How did it form? When did it start? How did it come together?" [ 3 ] Episodes [ edit ] No.

Episode [ 1 ] Original air date (nationwide) 1 " Origins " [ 7 ] November 4, 2015 ( 2015-11-04 ) The very early formation of the North American continent over the first 3 billion years of the existence of Earth, after the origin of the planet 4.54 billion years ago , is presented. The appearance of the earliest life , possibly as early as 4.28 billion years ago, [ 4 ] and later evolution , about 800 million years ago, [ 5 ] from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms , [ 6 ] within the planet's ancient oceans , are described.

2 " Life " [ 8 ] November 11, 2015 ( 2015-11-11 ) The emergence of early life from ancient oceans onto the early North American continent , about 550 million years ago , and life's later evolution on land, are presented. Dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) , as well as giant marine reptiles that lived in a huge ancient inland sea which covered the state of Kansas (and much more) about 100 million years ago, are described.

3 " Human " [ 9 ] November 18, 2015 ( 2015-11-18 ) The human settlement of the North American continent , as early as 40,000 years ago by Native American ancestors , and later, about 500 years ago , by European settlers , are presented. Modern-day geological processes and the possible consequences of human activities , such as the burning of fossil fuels , that pose potential risks to our human civilization , are described.

That’s what a new three-part series from NOVA shows as it explores the rich history of the continent — from glaciers in Alaska to volcanoes in Hawaii to the crystal-clear waters of the Bahamas ." [ 3 ] Joanne Ostrow, television critic for the Denver Post , writes, "Thanks to innovative special effects and graphics, this dose of earth science is visually engaging ... The graphics let us see how a slab of ocean floor diving under the earth forced the land up ... Johnson [the narrator] is enthusiastic good company, a regular guy whether rappelling into the Grand Canyon , flying over an active volcano in Hawaii, hunting for fossils in Alaska where palm trees once flourished, or descending into the palladium mines of Ontario , where geologists have dated some of the oldest rock ever found in North America ... there's much to learn from this series and, thanks to rock-solid storytelling, it's mind-blowing but easy to grasp."
