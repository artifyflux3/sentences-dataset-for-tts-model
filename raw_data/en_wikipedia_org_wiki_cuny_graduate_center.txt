Formed in 1961 as Division of Graduate Studies at City University of New York, it was renamed to Graduate School and University Center in 1969. Serving as the principal doctorate-granting institution of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, CUNY Graduate Center is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity".

[ 3 ] CUNY Graduate Center is located at the B. Altman and Company Building at 365 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan . It offers 32 doctoral programs, 18 master's programs, and operates over 30 research centers and institutes. The Graduate Center employs a core faculty of approximately 130, in addition to over 1,700 faculty members appointed from other CUNY campuses throughout New York City. As of fall 2025, the Graduate Center enrolls over 3,100 students, of which 2,600 are doctoral students.

[ 4 ] For the fall 2024 semester, the average acceptance rate across all doctoral programs at the CUNY Graduate Center was 16.3%.

[ 5 ] The Graduate Center's primary library, named after the American mathematician Mina Rees , is part of the CUNY library network of 31 colleges that collectively holds over 6.2 million volumes. Since 1968, the CUNY Graduate Center has maintained an agreement with the New York Public Library , which gives faculty and students increased borrowing privileges at NYPL's research collections at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building .

[ 6 ] The Graduate Center building also houses the James Gallery, which is an independent exhibition space open to the public, and television studios for NYC Media and CUNY TV .

The faculty of the CUNY Graduate Center include recipients of the Nobel Prize , the Abel Prize , Pulitzer Prize , the National Humanities Medal , the National Medal of Science , the National Endowment for the Humanities , the Rockefeller Fellowship , the Schock Prize , the Bancroft Prize , the Wolf Prize , Grammy Awards , the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism, Guggenheim Fellowships , the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers , Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring , and memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the National Academy of Sciences , and the National Academy of Education .

History [ edit ] The Graduate Center is located in the former B. Altman and Company Building at 365 Fifth Avenue.

Main article: City University of New York § History CUNY began offering doctoral education through its Division of Graduate Studies in 1961, [ 7 ] and awarded its first two PhD to Daniel Robinson and Barbara Stern in 1965. Robinson, formerly a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford , received his Ph.D. in psychology, [ 8 ] while Stern, late of Rutgers University , received her Ph.D. in English literature.

[ 9 ] In 1969, the Division of Graduate Studies formally became the Graduate School and University Center.

[ 10 ] Mathematician Mina S. Rees served as the institution's first president from 1969 until her retirement in 1972.

[ 11 ] Rees was succeeded as president of the Graduate Center by environmental psychologist Harold M. Proshansky, who served until his death in 1990.

[ 12 ] Provost Steven M. Cahn was named acting president in Spring 1991.

[ 13 ] Psychologist Frances Degen Horowitz was appointed president in September 1991.

[ 14 ] In 2005, Horowitz was succeeded by the school's provost, Professor of English Literature William P. Kelly.

[ 15 ] During Kelly's tenure at the Graduate Center, the university saw significant growth in revenue, funding opportunities for students, increased Distinguished Faculty, and a general resurgence.

[ 16 ] This is in accordance with three primary goals articulated in the Graduate Center's strategic plan.

[ 17 ] The first of these involves enhancing student support. In 2013, 83 dissertation-year fellowships were awarded at a total cost of $1.65 million. The Graduate Center is also developing new programs to advance research prior to the dissertation phase, including archival work. The fiscal stability of the university has enabled the chancellery to increase, on an incremental basis, the value of these fellowships. The packages extended for the 2013–14 years increase stipends and reduce teaching requirements. In 2001, the Graduate Center provided 14 million dollars in student support, and, in Fall 2013, 51 million in student support.

[ 17 ] On April 23, 2013, the CUNY Board of Trustees announced that President Kelly would serve as interim chancellor for the City University of New York beginning July 1 with the retirement of Chancellor Matthew Goldstein .

[ 18 ] GC Provost Chase F. Robinson , a historian, was appointed to serve as interim president of the Graduate Center in 2013, and then served as president from July 2014 to December 2018.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Joy Connolly became provost in August 2016 and interim president in December 2018.

[ 21 ] Julia Wrigley was appointed as interim provost in December 2018.

[ 22 ] In July 2019, James Muyskens became interim president, as Connolly had been appointed president of the American Council of Learned Societies .

[ 23 ] On March 30, 2020, Robin L. Garrell , vice provost for graduate education and dean of graduate division at University of California, Los Angeles , was announced as the next president of the Graduate Center. She assumed office on August 1, 2020 [ 24 ] and served until September 28, 2023.

[ 25 ] Steve Everett assumed the position of provost and senior vice president in August 2021. Norman Carey succeeded him as interim provost in August 2024.

[ 26 ] Joshua Brumberg assumed the position of interim president on October 2, 2023.

[ 27 ] He was appointed president of the CUNY Graduate Center in June 2024.

Campus [ edit ] The CUNY Graduate Center's main campus is located in the B. Altman and Company Building at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. CUNY shares the B. Altman Building with the Oxford University Press .

[ 28 ] Before 2000, the Graduate Center was housed in Aeolian Hall on West 42nd Street across from the New York Public Library Main Branch .

[ 29 ] In 2017, the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center at 85 St. Nicholas Terrace in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood became part of the CUNY Graduate Center.

[ 30 ] Advanced Science Research Center [ edit ] The Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) is an interdisciplinary STEM center for research and education. It covers five related fields: nanoscience, photonics , structural biology , neuroscience , and environmental science . The CUNY ASRC is located in a 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m 2 ) building on the southern edge of City College 's campus in Upper Manhattan .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] The CUNY ASRC, which opened in September 2014, is an outgrowth of CUNY's "Decade of Science" initiative, a multibillion-dollar project to elevating science research and education.

[ 33 ] The CUNY ASRC formally joined the CUNY Graduate Center in spring 2017.

[ 30 ] Today, the CUNY ASRC is one of the major pieces of CUNY's citywide research network. Five years after the center opened, over 200 graduate, undergraduate, and high school students had been mentored by CUNY ASRC scientists.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] In that time, the center also hosted over 400 conferences, seminars, and workshops and awarded over $600,000 in seed grants to CUNY faculty.

[ 34 ] Research initiatives [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC was founded on the principle that researchers across different disciplines would collaborate to make scientific advancements. Thus, it consists of five related fields: Nanoscience: Exploring on the tiniest scale, using the living world for inspiration to create new materials and devices that advance fields ranging from biomedicine to energy production Photonics: Discovering new ways to control light, heat, radio waves, and sound for future optical computers, ultrasensitive cameras, and cell phone technology Structural biology: Combining physics and chemistry to explore biology at the molecular and cellular levels, with the intention of identifying new ways to treat diseases Neuroscience: Investigating how the brain senses and responds to environmental and social experiences, with a focus on neural networks, metabolic changes, and molecular signals occurring in brain cells, with the goal of developing biosensors and innovative solutions to promote mental health Environmental sciences: Developing high-tech, interdisciplinary solutions to urgent environmental challenges, including air and water issues, climate change, and disease transmission Each research initiative occupies one floor of the CUNY ASRC building that hosts four faculty laboratories and between two and four core facilities.

Core facilities [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC has 15 core facilities with a variety of equipment.

[ 36 ] These facilities are open to researchers from CUNY, other academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit companies from around the world.

The facilities include: Advanced Laboratory for Chemical and Isotopic Signatures (ALCIS) Facility Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Facility Comparative Medicine Unit (CMU) Epigenetics Facilities Imaging Facility Live Imaging & Bioenergetics Facility MALDI Imaging Joint Facility Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Facility Macromolecular Crystallization Facility Mass Spectrometry Core Facility Nanofabrication Facility Next Generation Environmental Sensor (NGENS) Lab Photonics Core Facility Radio Frequency and mm-Wave Facility Surface Science Facility Education and outreach [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC has various scientific education programs. Students from CUNY's community and senior colleges participate in research during the academic year and over the summer through programs such as the CUNY Summer Undergraduate Research Program.

[ 37 ] Graduate students from master's and doctoral programs at the Graduate Center and from the Grove School of Engineering are members of CUNY ASRC research teams.

IlluminationSpace [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC's IlluminationSpace is an interactive education center, which accommodates high school field trips and provides free community hours.

[ 38 ] It has numerous virtual programs and resources.

[ 39 ] The CUNY ASRC received a Public Interest Technology University Network 2021 Challenge Grant to establish the IlluminationSpace, STEM pathways, and science communications and outreach at CUNY.

[ 40 ] The funding is being used to increase participation of underrepresented demographic groups in STEM fields.

Community Sensor Lab [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC Community Sensor Lab teaches high school students and community members how to build inexpensive, homemade sensors that can monitor aspects of the environment from the level of carbon dioxide and pollutants in the air to acidity in the soil and water.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Faculty opportunities [ edit ] The CUNY ASRC offers a seed grant program to fund collaborative research that supports tenured and tenure-track faculty at CUNY colleges.

[ 45 ] The program started in 2015 and currently awards six one-year, $20,000 grants annually.

In addition, the center's National Science Foundation CAREER Bootcamp Program, [ 46 ] which guides tenure-track faculty through the proposal writing process, have helped CUNY researchers secure substantial NSF CAREER grants.

[ 47 ] Grants and research [ edit ] Between 2014 and 2019, CUNY ASRC researchers secured 126 grants totaling $61 million.

[ 34 ] Several recent grants have set records for CUNY and the CUNY Graduate Center.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students at the CUNY ASRC also hold several patents.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Professor Kevin Gardner, director of the CUNY ASRC Structural Biology Initiative, was instrumental in the identification of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α) as a druggable target and the drug development efforts that led to the FDA-approved first-in-kind kidney cancer drug from Merck, belzutifan.

[ 54 ] The CUNY ASRC is home to one of 15 Centers for Advanced Technology (CATs) [ 55 ] designated by Empire State Development NYSTAR. Funded by a nearly $8.8 million grant, [ 56 ] the CUNY ASRC Sensor CAT spurs academic-industry partnerships to develop sensor-based technology. Developing biomedical and environmental sensors is a particular focus, as is finding new approaches to sensing through photonics, materials, and nanoscience research.

[ 56 ] Supported by a 2020 grant of up to $16 million from the Simons Foundation, a team of scientists led by Professor Andrea Alù , director of the CUNY ASRC Photonics Initiative, is studying wave transport in metamaterials.

[ 57 ] The team's work could lead to greater sensing capabilities for the Internet of Things , improvements in biomedical applications, and extreme control of sound waves for medical imaging and wireless technology.

[ 49 ] Professors Rein Ulijn and Andrea Al], the directors of the CUNY ASRC Nanoscience Initiative and the CUNY ASRC Photonics Initiative, each won a prestigious Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship from the U.S. Department of Defense , the agency's highest-ranking single-investigator award.

[ 58 ] Alù's $3 million fellowship, awarded in 2019, allowed him to develop new materials that enable extreme wave manipulation in the context of thermal radiation and heat management.

[ 50 ] Alù was also named the 2021 Blavatnik National Awards Laureate in Physical Sciences and Engineering.

[ 59 ] Ulijn's $3 million fellowship, awarded in 2021, allowed him to research how complex mixtures of molecules acquire functionality and to repurpose this understanding to create new nanotechnology that is inspired by living systems.

Mina Rees Library [ edit ] The Mina Rees Library, named after former president Mina Rees , supports the research, teaching, and learning activities of the CUNY Graduate Center by connecting its community with print materials, electronic resources, research assistance and instruction, and expertise about the complexities of scholarly communication. Situated on three floors of the CUNY Graduate Center, the library is a hub for discovery, delivery, digitization, and a place for solitary study. The library offers many services, including research consultations, a 24/7 online chat service with reference librarians, and workshops and webinars on using research tools.
