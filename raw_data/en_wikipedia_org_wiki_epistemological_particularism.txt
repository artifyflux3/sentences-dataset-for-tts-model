[ 1 ] By this view, one's knowledge is justified before one knows how such belief could be justified. Taking this as a philosophical approach, one would ask the question "What do we know?" before asking "How do we know?" The term appears in Roderick Chisholm 's " The Problem of the Criterion ", and in the work of his student, Ernest Sosa ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge"). Particularism is contrasted with methodism , which answers the latter question before the former. Since the question "What do we know" implies that we know, particularism is considered [ by whom?

] fundamentally anti-skeptical, and was ridiculed by Kant in the Prolegomena .
