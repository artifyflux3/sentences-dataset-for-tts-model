Calliphon (or Callipho, Koine Greek : Καλλιφῶν ) was a Greek philosopher , who probably belonged to the Peripatetic school and lived in the 2nd century BCE .

[ 1 ] He is mentioned several times and condemned by Cicero as making the chief good of man to consist in a union of virtue ( Latin : honestas ) and bodily pleasure ( Ancient Greek : ἡδονή , Latin : voluptas ), or, as Cicero says, in the union of the human with the beast.
