[ 1 ] The journal publishes long review papers which are intended to generalize and summarize previously published results, making them easier to use and to understand. The journal covers all topics of modern physics. The English version has existed since 1958, first under the name Soviet Physics Uspekhi and after 1993 as Physics-Uspekhi . The year 2008 marked the 90th birthday with a jubilee retrospective.
