[ 1 ] His work often focused on the Hebrew prophetic tradition and the sociopolitical imagination of the Church. He argued that the Church must provide a counter-narrative to the dominant forces of consumerism , militarism , and nationalism .

He wrote more than 58 books, hundreds of articles, and several commentaries on books of the Bible . He was also a contributor to a number of the Living the Questions DVD programs and was featured in the program "Countering Pharaoh's Production-Consumption Society Today." [ 7 ] Brueggemann participated in Bill Moyers ' 1990s PBS television series on Genesis (documented in Genesis: A Living Conversation.

Main Street Books, 1997.

ISBN 0-385-49043-7 ).

[ page needed ] Originally a strong supporter of modern-day Israel and its biblical claims, Brueggemann later repudiated Israel for what he believed to be its exploitation of "ancient promises" to create a "toxic ideology," and then affirmed his belief that it was not anti-Semitic to stand up for justice for Palestinians .

[ 8 ] Brueggemann was known throughout the world for his method of combining literary and sociological modes when reading the Bible. V. S. Parrish categorized Brueggemann as being an exegete and theologian.

[ 9 ] As an exegete he composed several commentaries (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, 1 and 2 Samuel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah). His most notable work was on the book of Psalms , and he wrote many monographs and articles on specific portions of the Hebrew Bible. For example, he believed that lament is lacking in current religious faith and practice with detrimental results.

[ 10 ] As a theologian, Brueggemann was an editor for the Fortress Press series "Overtures to Biblical Theology". His development of Old Testament theological methods consists of literary mode, social function, and dialectical approach.

[ clarification needed ] Titles such as "David's Truth in Israel's Imagination and Memory" (1985), "Power, Providence and Personality" (1990), "1 Kings and 2 Kings" (1982c), "The Prophetic Imagination" (1978), and "Hopeful Imagination" (1986) reflect his interest in the prophetic corpus.

[ 11 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Brueggemann was married twice. After his marriage to Mary Bonner Miller ended in divorce in 2005, he married Tia Ehrhardt.

[ 4 ] He had two sons.

[ 4 ] Brueggemann died at a hospice in Traverse City, Michigan, on June 5, 2025, at the age of 92.
