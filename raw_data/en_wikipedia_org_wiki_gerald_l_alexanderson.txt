Alexanderson Born ( 1933-11-13 ) November 13, 1933 Died December 16, 2020 (2020-12-16) (aged 87) [ 1 ] Nationality American Occupation(s) Valeriote Professor of Science, Santa Clara University Board member of The Fibonacci Association Mathematical Association of America Academic background Alma mater Stanford University University of Oregon Academic work Discipline Mathematics Sub-discipline Combinatorics specialist, Number Theory specialist Gerald Lee Alexanderson (1933–2020) was an American mathematician. He was the Michael & Elizabeth Valeriote Professor of Science at Santa Clara University , and in 1997–1998 was president of the Mathematical Association of America . He was also president of The Fibonacci Association from 1980 to 1984.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Education and career [ edit ] Alexanderson did his undergraduate studies at the University of Oregon , graduating with a B.A. in 1955. He earned a master's degree from Stanford University in 1958, and in the same year joined the Santa Clara University faculty. At Santa Clara, he chaired the department of mathematics for 35 years, from 1967 to 2002.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He was the co-author, editor, or co-editor of 15 books, and was editor of Mathematics Magazine from 1986 to 1990.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Abraham Hillman [ 4 ] was his most frequent co-author.

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2005, Alexanderson won both one of the Deborah and Franklin Haimo Awards for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics , [ 2 ] [ 5 ] and the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics, [ 2 ] [ 6 ] both from the Mathematical Association of America.
