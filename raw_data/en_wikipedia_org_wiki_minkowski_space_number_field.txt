In mathematics , specifically the field of algebraic number theory , a Minkowski space is a Euclidean space associated with an algebraic number field .

[ 1 ] If K is a number field of degree d then there are d distinct embeddings of K into C .   We let K C be the image of K in the product C d , considered as equipped with the usual Hermitian inner product .  If c denotes complex conjugation , let K R denote the subspace of K C fixed by c , equipped with a scalar product .  This is the Minkowski space of K .
