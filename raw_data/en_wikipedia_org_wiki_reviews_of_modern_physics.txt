5975699 Links Journal homepage Online access Online archive Reviews of Modern Physics (often abbreviated RMP ) is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Physical Society . Michael Thoennessen is the current editor-in-chief . Established in 1929, [ 1 ] the journal publishes review articles , usually by established researchers, on all aspects of physics and related fields. It is one of the most prestigious journals of its kind today.

[ 2 ] Its intended readers include not just professional physicists, but also university students, university and high-school instructors, as well as scientifically literate members of the general public.

[ 2 ] The RMP occasionally publishes articles concerning topics that are also of interest to people outside of physics, such as the safety of light-water nuclear reactors , the feasibility of the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars), and the nature of the deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) molecule.

[ 3 ] Over the years, the editors of the journal included John Torrence Tate (1929–41, 1947), who worked on antisubmarine warfare during the Second World War; Samuel Goudsmit (1951–57), co-discover of quantum spin ; and Edward Condon (1951–68), member of the Manhattan Engineer District .

[ 3 ] The journal has published several historically significant papers on quantum foundations , [ 4 ] as well as the development of the Standard Model of particle physics.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] During the early years of the journal, the United States was supplanting Germany as the leading nation for physics, and English was becoming more common in scientific communications.

[ 2 ] While review papers were nothing new, they were published only sporadically. The RMP was the first of its kind, fulfilling an unmet need among physicists.

[ 2 ] At that time, the focus was on reviewing the research literature on largely established branches of physics. Fields in which there were controversies or unanswered questions were generally excluded.

[ 3 ] By the 1950s and 1960s, however, the journal faced falling readership and the editorial board decided to expand the scope of the journal to include topics at the frontier of research.

[ 3 ] Former editor Edward Condon was of the opinion that writing review articles should be part of the training of graduate students in physics and one of the responsibilities of physicists.

[ 3 ] Among the most cited papers in the Reviews of Modern Physics are three by Hans Bethe on nuclear physics (1936–7), [ 2 ] one my Enrico Fermi on quantum electrodynamics (1932), one by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar on stochastic processes in astronomy and physics (1943); [ 3 ] one by Howard Percy Robertson on relativistic cosmology (1931), [ 2 ] two by Clemens Roothaan on molecular orbitals (1951) and electronic systems (1960), [ 3 ] and one by Kurt Alder , Aage Bohr , Torben Huus, Ben Mottelson , and Aage Winther on nuclear structure (1956).

[ 3 ] Some of the top papers in this journal were written by Nobel laureates.

[ 3 ] Since the 1960s, multiple authorship has become more frequent.

[ 3 ] Authors of the most cited papers were affiliated with Bell Laboratories ; the University of Chicago ; the Argonne National Laboratory , the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology ); and the University of California at Berkeley , Irvine , and San Diego .
