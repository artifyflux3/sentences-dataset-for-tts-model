One of her siblings was Jenny Aubry . She grew up in Paris with five siblings, was trained as a teacher against the will of her family, was a teacher at a secondary school for arts and was awarded a degree from Oxford University .

From 1935 to the beginning of World War II , she committed herself to women's suffrage . In 1936, she stood for French parliamentary elections , running in the Fifth arrondissement of Paris . She was active in the French Resistance during the War. She claimed she was a member of the Patriam Recuperare network; however, this was formally denied by network members. She was chief editor of the secret magazine, "Nouvelle République" from 1942 until 1944. In 1945, she founded the Institute for Polemology (research on war and conflict) together with Gaston Bouthoul [ fr ] [ 5 ] in London.

Between 1919 and 1939, she often travelled to Czechoslovakia . In 1918, she founded the weekly newspaper, Europe nouvelle [ fr ] (New Europe), which she published in 1934.

Thomas Mann , Gustav Stresemann , Rudolf Breitscheid and Aristide Briand were among her co-authors on the paper. Louise Weiss described those who paved the way for the closening of the German-French relationship between the World Wars as "peace pilgrims", and they called their important co-worker "my good Louise". Europe dreamed of unification and in 1930, she founded the "Ecole de la Paix" (School of Peace), a private institute for international relations. With the takeover by the National Socialists in Germany, the possibility of a unification was over.
