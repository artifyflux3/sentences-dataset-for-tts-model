[ 1 ] He was a scientist in the fledgling field of synthetic biology , particularly in relation to diffusion and osmosis . He was a professor at the École de Médecine de Nantes and worked on osmotic crystallisation and the physiological effects of electric current . He was an Officier de la Légion d'honneur .

Views [ edit ] Leduc believed that it is necessary to appreciate biological processes from a physical perspective and constructed models from physics and chemistry to try to explain development and growth; these would typically involve ingenious combinations of chemicals to produce systems which mimicked the appearance of living processes such as karyokinesis and "remarkable fungus-like forms".

[ 1 ] He "[repudiated] extra-physical forces in the phenomena of life".

[ 1 ] According to Keller, these models were largely unsuccessful, "not just because of the conspicuous artificiality of his osmotic growths".

[ 1 ] Leduc sought to synthesise life "by directing the physical forces which are its cause" (in his own words).
