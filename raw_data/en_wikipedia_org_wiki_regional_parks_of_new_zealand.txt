Regional parks are found across several regions of New Zealand: the Auckland Region , Waikato Region , Bay of Plenty Region , Hawkes Bay Region , Wellington Region and Canterbury Region . Regional parks in the Auckland and Waikato regions are administered by the Auckland Council , while parks in other areas are administered by regional councils: the Bay of Plenty Regional Council , [ 1 ] Hawke's Bay Regional Council , [ 2 ] Greater Wellington Regional Council , [ 3 ] and Canterbury Regional Council .

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Regional parks in New Zealand are large open spaces typically outside the metropolitan boundaries of cities; larger than city parks and smaller than the National parks of New Zealand . The first regional park in New Zealand was the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park , which was established in 1964 when the Centennial Memorial Park of the Waitākere Ranges had its administration transferred from Auckland City Council to the Auckland Regional Authority . The first park purchased and established by the Auckland Regional Authority was Wenderholm Regional Park in 1965.

[ 5 ] East Harbour Regional Park , managed by the Greater Wellington Regional Council , was the first regional park established in the Wellington Region in 1979.

[ 6 ] The Local Government Act 2002 empowered other local government authorities outside of Auckland and Wellington to establish regional parks.

[ 5 ] The first of these was the Papamoa Hills Regional Park in the Bay of Plenty Region , established in 2004. The first regional park in the Canterbury Region was the Waimakariri River Regional Park , established in 2006/ [ 7 ] In November 2010, local government reforms merged the different local government authorities of Auckland into a single unitary authority, the Auckland Council . During this process, areas of Franklin District and Manukau City were reassigned to the Waikato Region , including areas which included regional parks. Because of this, three regional parks are found in the northern Waikato, which are administered by the Auckland Council.

[ 8 ] List of regional parks [ edit ] This table lists current regional parks from north to south.
