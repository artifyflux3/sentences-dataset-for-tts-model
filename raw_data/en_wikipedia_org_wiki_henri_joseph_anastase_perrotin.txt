[ 2 ] Some sources give his middle name as Athanase .

In his early career, he and Guillaume Bigourdan were assistants of Félix Tisserand at Toulouse Observatory . Later, he was the first director of the Nice Observatory in Nice, France from 1884 until his death. He made observations of Mars and attempted to determine the rotation period of Venus . He also calculated perturbations in the orbit of 4 Vesta .

[ 2 ] In the literature, he is sometimes referred to as Henri Perrotin and sometimes as Joseph Perrotin (this is indeed one and the same person). He is also referenced in H. G. Wells 's novel The War of the Worlds as "Perrotin of Nice" . His 6 asteroid discoveries are credited by the Minor Planet Center to "J. Perrotin".

[ 1 ] He won the Prix Lalande in 1875 and 1883.

[ 3 ] The Martian crater Perrotin and the inner main-belt asteroid 1515 Perrotin were named in his honor.
