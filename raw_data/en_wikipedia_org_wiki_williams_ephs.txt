In 1961, the men's basketball program qualified for the College Division tournament. After defeating Rochester (NY) in the first round and Bates in the regional championship, the team advanced to the national quarterfinals against Wittenberg . Williams lost the game, 64-51, and the unruly celebrations of Wittenberg students led Williams administrators to decide the school should no longer compete in national tournaments. When the NESCAC formed in 1971, the league's other ten members adopted Williams's policy. Despite this ban, the women's swimming & diving team won the 1982 and 1983 national championships by qualifying enough individuals to outscore all other teams.

[ 194 ] The ban was lifted for the 1993–1994 academic year for all sports except football.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 49 ] The following is a list of Williams's 37 national championships.

[ 194 ] Williams's total is tied for the most in the NESCAC with Middlebury.
