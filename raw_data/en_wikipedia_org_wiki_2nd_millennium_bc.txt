The 2nd millennium BC spanned the years 2000 BC to 1001 BC. 
In the Ancient Near East , it marks the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age .
The Ancient Near Eastern cultures are well within the historical era:
The first half of the millennium is dominated by the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and Babylonia . The alphabet develops. 
At the center of the millennium, a new order emerges with Mycenaean Greek dominance of the Aegean and the rise of the Hittite Empire . The end of the millennium sees the Bronze Age collapse and the transition to the Iron Age .

Other regions of the world are still in the prehistoric period. In Europe, the Beaker culture introduces the Bronze Age , presumably associated with Indo-European expansion . The Indo-Iranian expansion reaches the Iranian plateau and onto the Indian subcontinent ( Vedic India ), propagating the use of the chariot .

Mesoamerica enters the Pre-Classic ( Olmec ) period. North America is in the late Archaic stage . In Maritime Southeast Asia, the Austronesian expansion reaches Micronesia . In Sub-Saharan Africa , the Bantu expansion begins.

World population rose steadily, possibly surpassing the 100 million mark for the first time.

Middle Bronze Age [ edit ] Spending much of their energies in trying to recuperate from the chaotic situation that existed at the turn of the millennium, the most powerful civilizations of the time, Egypt and Mesopotamia , turned their attention to more modest goals. The Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and their contemporary Kings of Babylon , of Amorite origin, brought governance that was largely popular and approved of among their subjects, and favoured elegant art and architecture. Farther east, the Indus Valley civilization was in a period of decline, possibly as a result of intense, ruinous flooding.

Egypt and Babylonia's military tactics were still based on foot soldiers transporting their equipment on donkeys . Combined with a weak economy and difficulty in maintaining order, this was a fragile situation that crumbled under the pressure of external forces they could not oppose.

Unrest of the 16th century [ edit ] About a century before the middle of the millennium, bands of Indo-European invaders came from the Central Asian plains and swept through Western Asia and Northeast Africa . They were riding fast two-wheeled chariots powered by horses , a system of weaponry developed earlier in the context of plains warfare. This tool of war was unknown among the classical civilizations. Egypt and Babylonia's foot soldiers were unable to defend against the invaders: in 1630 BC , the Hyksos swept into the Nile Delta , and in 1595 BC , the Hittites swept into Mesopotamia .

Late Bronze Age [ edit ] The people in place were quick to adapt to the new tactics, and a new international situation resulted from the change. Though during most of the second half of the 2nd millennium BC several regional powers competed relentlessly for hegemony, many developments occurred: there was new emphasis on grandiose architecture, new clothing fashions, vivid diplomatic correspondence on clay tablets , renewed economic exchanges, and the New Kingdom of Egypt played the role of the main superpower . Among the great states of the time, only Babylon refrained from taking part in battles, mainly due to its new position as the world's religious and intellectual capital.

The Bronze Age civilization at its final period of time, displayed all its characteristic social traits: low level of urbanization, small cities centered on temples or royal palaces, strict separation of classes between an illiterate mass of peasants and craftsmen, and a powerful military elite , knowledge of writing and education reserved to a tiny minority of scribes , and pronounced aristocratic life.

Near the end of the 2nd millennium BC, new waves of barbarians , this time riding on horseback, wholly destroyed the Bronze Age world, and were to be followed by waves of social changes that marked the beginning of different times. Also contributing to the changes were the Sea Peoples , ship-faring raiders of the Mediterranean.

( April 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Further information: Bronze Age writing The Kadesh peace agreement —on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum —is believed to be the earliest international agreement In the history of the Egyptian language , the early 2nd millennium saw a transition from Old Egyptian to Middle Egyptian . As the most used written form of the Ancient Egyptian language, it is frequently (incorrectly) referred to simply as " Hieroglyphics ".

The earliest attested Indo-European language , the Hittite language , first appears in cuneiform in the 16th century BC ( Anitta text ), before disappearing from records in the 13th century BC. Hittite is the best known and the most studied language of the extinct Anatolian branch of Indo-European languages.

The first Northwest Semitic language , Ugaritic , is attested in the 14th century BC. The first fully phonemic script Proto-Canaanite developed from Egyptian hieroglyphs, becoming the Phoenician alphabet by 1200 BC. The Phoenician alphabet was spread throughout the Mediterranean by Phoenician maritime traders and became one of the most widely used writing systems in the world, and the parent of virtually all alphabetic writing systems. The Phoenician language is also the first Canaanite language , the Northwest Semitic languages spoken by the ancient peoples of the Canaan region: the Israelites , Phoenicians , Amorites , Ammonites , Moabites and Edomites .

Mycenaean Greek , the most ancient attested form of the Greek language , was used on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in the Mycenaean period .
