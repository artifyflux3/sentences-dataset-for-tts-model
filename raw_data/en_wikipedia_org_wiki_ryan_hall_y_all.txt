[ 3 ] He frequently uploads forecasts for upcoming severe weather and live streams ongoing severe weather events. Hall operates the non-profit Y'all Squad to assist those affected by significant severe weather.

Early life and education [ edit ] Hall was born in Pikeville, Kentucky , [ 2 ] and went to Mississippi State University to pursue broadcast meteorology, while working at WYMT-TV .  However, Hall chose to leave his degree program and WYMT-TV to work more in the field.

[ 2 ] YouTube career [ edit ] Despite his background and interest in meteorology, Ryan did not post his first weather video on the platform until January 4, 2021.

[ 2 ] He livestreamed for the first time in early March 2021, and would draw his first large live audience while livestreaming a tornado outbreak on March 17, 2021. Broadcasting his screen set to multiple paid radar subscription programs, Hall managed to inform and alert viewers on the live locations and impacts of the storms, while explaining safety measures and courses of action for the people to follow. A recurrent format on his channel, his streams have helped his channel grow and reach thousands of people in the path of severe weather, with the help of resharing and forwarding of his videos and broadcasts on social media . Other types of content he uploads include forecasts of upcoming weather, and storm chasing footage. Throughout his YouTube career, Hall has done collaborations with extreme meteorologist and storm chaser Reed Timmer as well as other storm chasers.

[ 4 ] In addition to working with storm chasers, Hall has assembled a large team to help him produce weather content. This includes Andy Hill, a degreed meteorologist who began working with Ryan in March 2022.

[ 5 ] Top streams [ edit ] Hall has done numerous severe weather livestreams, which reached number one in the United States and ranked in the top 10 elsewhere across the world.

Some have criticized his use of clickbait and statements that present certainty in a prediction when traditional meteorologists have been more cautious about forecasting a storm or system. Kim Klockow McClain, a meteorologist at NOAA and a team lead for the Behavioral Insights Unit says that flashy thumbnails like those used by Hall can dilute the message of the video and skew a viewer's perception of an event being more serious than it is.

[ 20 ] Charitable work [ edit ] In March 2023, Hall's subscribers raised $120,000 to help victims of the Rolling Fork and Amory , Mississippi tornadoes, along with supplies and meals.

[ 21 ] In the following months, Hall established "The Y'all Squad", a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization to provide relief to storm victims.

[ 21 ] Hall also created a third YouTube channel "The Y'all Squad" for his non-profit; here he periodically releases content showing how donations have been used to help victims affected by natural disasters. In May 2024, Hall's subscribers raised $93,000 after an EF4 tornado hit the town of Greenfield, Iowa . "The Y'all Squad" was able to help storm victims with supplies and meals hours after the tornado struck the town.

[ 22 ] Personal life [ edit ] Hall currently lives in Pikeville, Kentucky . Hall is married and has two children.
