PG(3, 2) depicted as a tetrahedron (see _[§Tetrahedral depiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#Tetrahedral\_depiction)_)

In [finite geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry"), **PG(3, 2)** is the smallest three-dimensional [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"). It can be thought of as an extension of the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane"), _PG(2, 2)_.

It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes. Each point is contained in 7 lines and 7 planes. Each line is contained in 3 planes and contains 3 points. Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeserve198329-1)

These can be summarized in a rank 3 [configuration matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_(polytope) "Configuration (polytope)") counting points, lines, and planes on the diagonal. The incidences are expressed off diagonal. The structure is self dual, swapping points and planes, expressed by rotating the configuration matrix 180 degrees.

It has the following properties:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPolster199869-2)

*   Each plane is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to the Fano plane.
*   Every pair of distinct planes intersects in a line.
*   A line and a plane not containing the line intersect in exactly one point.

PG(3, 2) has 20160 [automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism"). The number of automorphisms is given by finding the number of ways of selecting 4 points that are not coplanar; this works out to (2 4-1)(2 4-2)(2 4-2 2)(2 4-2 3)/(2-1) = 15⋅14⋅12⋅8.

If one plane is removed (and its 7 points and 7 lines), we create the [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") AG(3,2), composed of 7 sets of 2 parallel planes (each K 4 graphs). The 8 points and 28 lines alone make a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph "Complete graph") K 8 graph. It has 20160/15 = 1344 automorphisms.

Removing one point (and its 7 lines and 7 planes) further creates a smaller self dual rank 3 configuration of 7 points, 21 lines and 7 K 4 graph planes. Automorphisms reduce to 168 (1344/8).

### Construction from _K_ 6

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PG(3,2)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Construction from K6")]

Take a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph "Complete graph")_K_ 6. It has 15 edges, 15 [perfect matchings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_matching "Perfect matching") and 20 triangles. Create a point for each of the 15 edges, and a line for each of the 20 triangles and 15 matchings. The [incidence structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure "Incidence structure") between each triangle or matching (line) and its three constituent edges (points) induces a PG(3, 2).

### Construction from Fano planes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PG(3,2)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Construction from Fano planes")]

Take a Fano plane and apply all 5040 permutations of its 7 points. Discard duplicate planes to obtain a set of 30 distinct Fano planes. Pick any of the 30, and pick the 14 others that have exactly one line in common with the first, not 0 or 3. The [incidence structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure "Incidence structure") between the 1 + 14 = 15 Fano planes and the 35 triplets they mutually cover induces a PG(3, 2).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPolster199877-3)

### Tetrahedral depiction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PG(3,2)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Tetrahedral depiction")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/PG3-2-configuration.gif/330px-PG3-2-configuration.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PG3-2-configuration.gif)

PG(3,2) points and "lines" in a tetrahedron.

It has 15 red vertices: 4 corners (v), 6 mid-edge (e), 4 mid-face (f), and 1 central (c).

It has 35 "lines" colored by positions: 6 vve (green), 12 vef (blue), 4 eee (red circles), 4 vfc (magenta), 3 eec (yellow), 6 eff (cyan circles).

PG(3, 2) can be represented as a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron"). The 15 points correspond to the 4 vertices + 6 edge-midpoints + 4 face-centers + 1 body-center. The 35 lines correspond to the 6 edges + 12 face-medians + 4 face-incircles + 4 altitudes from a face to the opposite vertex + 3 lines connecting the midpoints of opposite edges + 6 ellipses connecting each edge midpoint with its two non-neighboring face centers. The 15 planes consist of the 4 faces + the 6 "medial" planes connecting each edge to the midpoint of the opposite edge + 4 "cones" connecting each vertex to the incircle of the opposite face + one "sphere" with the 6 edge centers and the body center. This was described by [Burkard Polster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkard_Polster "Burkard Polster").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPolster199882%E2%80%9383-4) The tetrahedral depiction has the same structure as the visual representation of the multiplication table for the [sedenions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedenion "Sedenion").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTELohmusPaalSorgsepp1994139-5)

Numbering the points 0...14 (4 (v)ertices, 6 mid-(e)dges, 4 mid-(f)aces, and 1 (c)entral), the 15 planes and 35 lines of the [configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_(geometry) "Configuration (geometry)") can be grouped by symmetry positions in the tetrahedron:

### Square representation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PG(3,2)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Square representation")]

Square model of Fano 3-space

PG(3, 2) can be represented as a square. The 15 points are assigned 4-bit binary coordinates from 0001 to 1111, augmented with a point labeled 0000, and arranged in a 4×4 grid. Lines correspond to the equivalence classes of sets of four vertices that [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR "XOR") together to 0000. With certain arrangements of the vertices in the 4×4 grid, such as the "natural" [row-major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major "Row-major") ordering or the [Karnaugh map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map "Karnaugh map") ordering, the lines form symmetric sub-structures like rows, columns, transversals, or rectangles, as seen in the figure. (There are 20160 such orderings, as seen below in [the section on Automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#Automorphisms).) This representation is possible because geometrically the 35 lines are represented as a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") with the 35 ways to partition a 4×4 affine space into 4 parallel planes of 4 cells each. This was described by Steven H. Cullinane.

### Sedenion representation

An illustration of the structure of PG(3,2) that provides the multiplication law for [sedenions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedenion "Sedenion"), as shown by [Saniga, Holweck & Pracna (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#CITEREFSanigaHolweckPracna2015). Any three points (representing three sedenion imaginary units) lying on the same line are such that the product of two of them yields the third one, sign disregarded.

The Doily. This is also a representation of the [strongly regular graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_regular_graph "Strongly regular graph") srg(15,6,1,3) drawn with overlapping edges.

The Doily diagram often used to represent the [generalized quadrangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_quadrangle "Generalized quadrangle")GQ(2, 2) is also used to represent PG(3, 2). This was described by Richard Doily.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPolster199869-2)

Kirkman's schoolgirl problem
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PG(3,2)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Kirkman's schoolgirl problem")]

PG(3, 2) arises as a background in some solutions of [Kirkman's schoolgirl problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkman%27s_schoolgirl_problem "Kirkman's schoolgirl problem"). Two of the seven non-isomorphic solutions to this problem can be embedded as structures in the Fano 3-space. In particular, a [spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_(projective_geometry) "Spread (projective geometry)") of PG(3, 2) is a partition of points into disjoint lines, and corresponds to the arrangement of girls (points) into disjoint rows (lines of a _spread_) for a single day of Kirkman's schoolgirl problem. There are 56 different spreads of 5 lines each. A _packing_ of PG(3, 2) is a partition of the 35 lines into 7 disjoint spreads of 5 lines each, and corresponds to a solution for all seven days. There are 240 packings of PG(3, 2), that fall into two conjugacy classes of 120 under the action of PGL(4, 2) (the collineation group of the space); a correlation interchanges these two classes.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHirschfeld198573-6)

It is known that a PG(_n_, 2) can be coordinatized with (GF(2))_n_+1, i.e. a bit string of length _n_ + 1. PG(3, 2) can therefore be coordinatized with 4-bit strings.

In addition, the line joining points (_a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 3, _a_ 4) and (_b_ 1, _b_ 2, _b_ 3, _b_ 4) can be naturally assigned [Plücker coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates "Plücker coordinates")(_p_ 12, _p_ 13, _p_ 14, _p_ 23, _p_ 24, _p_ 34) where _p_ _ij_ = _a_ _i_ _b_ _j_ − _a_ _j_ _b_ _i_, and the line coordinates satisfy _p_ 12 _p_ 34 + _p_ 13 _p_ 24 + _p_ 14 _p_ 23 = 0. Each line in projective 3-space thus has six coordinates, and can be represented as a point in projective 5-space; the points lie on the surface _p_ 12 _p_ 34 + _p_ 13 _p_ 24 + _p_ 14 _p_ 23 = 0.
