He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2010 in Hyderabad .

[ 1 ] Education and career [ edit ] After secondary education at Essen's Burggymnasium , Schappacher studied from 1969 to 1971 at the University of Bonn , where he was taught by (among others) Günter Harder and Friedrich Hirzebruch . Schappacher obtained his Vordiplom in 1971 at the University of Göttingen , where he studied from 1971 to 1974 and was taught by (among others) Hans Grauert , Ulrich Stuhler , and Martin Kneser . For the academic year 1974–1975, Schappacher studied as an exchange student at the University of California, Berkeley , where his teachers included Tsit Yuen Lam and Robin Hartshorne . At the University of Göttingen, Schappacher received his Diplom in 1975 and from 1977 to 1986 held the position of assistant at the Göttingen Mathematical Institute.

[ 2 ] There in 1978 he received his doctorate with advisor Martin Kneser and thesis Eine diophantische Invariante von Singularitäten über nichtarchimedischen Körpern (A diophantine invariant of singularities over non-Archimedean fields).

[ 3 ] He was from 1979 to 1981 at Paris-Sud University (University of Paris XI) in Orsay with John H. Coates and for the academic year 1983–1984 at the Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik (MPI) in Bonn with Günter Harder. Schappacher in 1985 was an assistant professor ( Professeur associé ) at Paris-Sud University and habilitated in 1986 at the University of Göttingen with thesis Periods of Hecke operators . He was in 1986 at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, then worked in 1987 as an assistant professor in Orsay and was from 1987 to 1991 a Heisenberg fellow at the MPI in Bonn. He was at the Institute for Advanced Study for five months in 1990.

[ 2 ] Schappacher is since 1991 a professor at the University of Strasbourg . From 2002 to 2004 he was a visiting professor at TU Darmstadt and returned in 2004 to the University of Strasbourg. He has held visiting positions at several academic institutions, including the Isaac Newton Institute (for 2 months in 1997), Mumbai 's Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (for 2 months in 2000–2001), and the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen (as Gauss-Professor in summer 2007). In 2011–2012 he was a Fellow of Lichtenberg-Kolleg , Göttingen.

[ 2 ] Schappacher's research is primarily on number theory , arithmetic geometry , and the history of mathematics. He has done research on the history of mathematics in Germany during the era of National Socialism (including Edmund Landau , Oswald Teichmüller and the Mathematical Institute in Göttingen), as well as historical research on Kurt Heegner , Bartel Leendert van der Waerden , Diophantus of Alexandria , and Leonhard Euler . Since 2008 Schappacher is a member of the Euler Committee of the Swiss Academy of Sciences . He was from 2009 to 2016 editor-in-chief of the Revue d'histoire des mathématiques and is the managing editor of the Elemente der Mathematik .

[ 2 ] In 2011 he was elected a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen .
