In particular, it does not rely on the possible vector bundle structure of the underlying fiber bundle, but nevertheless, linear connections may be viewed as a special case. Another important special case of Ehresmann connections are principal connections on principal bundles , which are required to be equivariant in the principal Lie group action.

Introduction [ edit ] A covariant derivative in differential geometry is a linear differential operator which takes the directional derivative of a section of a vector bundle in a covariant manner.  It also allows one to formulate a notion of a parallel section of a bundle in the direction of a vector: a section s is parallel along a vector X {\displaystyle X} if ∇ ∇ X s = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla _{X}s=0} .  So a covariant derivative provides at least two things: a differential operator, and a notion of what it means to be parallel in each direction.  An Ehresmann connection drops the differential operator completely and defines a connection axiomatically in terms of the sections parallel in each direction ( Ehresmann 1950 ).  Specifically, an Ehresmann connection singles out a vector subspace of each tangent space to the total space of the fiber bundle, called the horizontal space .  A section s {\displaystyle s} is then horizontal (i.e., parallel) in the direction X {\displaystyle X} if d s ( X ) {\displaystyle {\rm {d}}s(X)} lies in a horizontal space.  Here we are regarding s {\displaystyle s} as a function s : : M → → E {\displaystyle s\colon M\to E} from the base M {\displaystyle M} to the fiber bundle E {\displaystyle E} , so that d s : : T M → → T E {\displaystyle {\rm {d}}s\colon TM\to TE} is then the pushforward of tangent vectors. The horizontal spaces together form a vector subbundle of T E {\displaystyle TE} .

This has the immediate benefit of being definable on a much broader class of structures than mere vector bundles.   In particular, it is well-defined on a general fiber bundle .  Furthermore, many of the features of the covariant derivative still remain: parallel transport, curvature , and holonomy .

The missing ingredient of the connection, apart from linearity, is covariance .  With the classical covariant derivatives, covariance is an a posteriori feature of the derivative.  In their construction one specifies the transformation law of the Christoffel symbols – which is not covariant – and then general covariance of the derivative follows as a result.  For an Ehresmann connection, it is possible to impose a generalized covariance principle from the beginning by introducing a Lie group acting on the fibers of the fiber bundle.  The appropriate condition is to require that the horizontal spaces be, in a certain sense, equivariant with respect to the group action.

The finishing touch for an Ehresmann connection is that it can be represented as a differential form , in much the same way as the case of a connection form .  If the group acts on the fibers and the connection is equivariant, then the form will also be equivariant.  Furthermore, the connection form allows for a definition of curvature as a curvature form as well.

Formal definition [ edit ] An Ehresmann connection is a choice of horizontal subspace H p ⊂ ⊂ T p P {\displaystyle H_{p}\subset T_{p}P} for every p ∈ ∈ P {\displaystyle p\in P} , where P {\displaystyle P} is some fiber bundle, typically a principal bundle .

Let π π : : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to M} be a smooth fiber bundle .

[ 1 ] Let V = ker ⁡ ⁡ ( d ⁡ ⁡ π π : : T E → → T M ) {\displaystyle V=\ker(\operatorname {d} \pi \colon TE\to TM)} be the vertical bundle consisting of the vectors "tangent to the fibers" of E , i.e. the fiber of V at e ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} is V e = T e ( E π π ( e ) ) {\displaystyle V_{e}=T_{e}(E_{\pi (e)})} . This subbundle of T E {\displaystyle TE} is canonically defined even when there is no canonical subspace tangent to the base space M . (Of course, this asymmetry comes from the very definition of a fiber bundle, which "only has one projection" π π : : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to M} while a product E = M × × F {\displaystyle E=M\times F} would have two.) Definition via horizontal subspaces [ edit ] An Ehresmann connection on E {\displaystyle E} is a smooth subbundle H {\displaystyle H} of T E {\displaystyle TE} , called the horizontal bundle of the connection, which is complementary to V , in the sense that it defines a direct sum decomposition T E = H ⊕ ⊕ V {\displaystyle TE=H\oplus V} .

[ 2 ] In more detail, the horizontal bundle has the following properties.

For each point e ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} , H e {\displaystyle H_{e}} is a vector subspace of the tangent space T e E {\displaystyle T_{e}E} to E {\displaystyle E} at e {\displaystyle e} , called the horizontal subspace of the connection at e {\displaystyle e} .

H e {\displaystyle H_{e}} depends smoothly on e {\displaystyle e} .

For each e ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} , H e ∩ ∩ V e = { 0 } {\displaystyle H_{e}\cap V_{e}=\{0\}} .

Any tangent vector in T e E {\displaystyle T_{e}E} (for any e ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} ) is the sum of a horizontal and vertical component, so that T e E = H e + V e {\displaystyle T_{e}E=H_{e}+V_{e}} .

In more sophisticated terms, such an assignment of horizontal spaces satisfying these properties corresponds precisely to a smooth section of the jet bundle J 1 E → E .

Definition via a connection form [ edit ] Equivalently, let Φ be the projection onto the vertical bundle V along H (so that H = ker Φ ).  This is determined by the above direct sum decomposition of TE into horizontal and vertical parts and is sometimes called the connection form of the Ehresmann connection.  Thus Φ is a vector bundle homomorphism from TE to itself with the following properties (of projections in general): Φ 2 = Φ ; Φ is  the identity on V =Im Φ .

Conversely, if Φ is a vector bundle endomorphism of TE satisfying these two properties, then H = ker Φ is the horizontal subbundle of an Ehresmann connection.

Finally, note that Φ , being a linear mapping of each tangent space into itself, may also be regarded as a TE -valued 1-form on E . This will be a useful perspective in sections to come.

Parallel transport via horizontal lifts [ edit ] An Ehresmann connection also prescribes a manner for lifting curves from the base manifold M into the total space of the fiber bundle E so that the tangents to the curve are horizontal.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] These horizontal lifts are a direct analogue of parallel transport for other versions of the connection formalism.

Specifically, suppose that γ ( t ) is a smooth curve in M through the point x = γ (0).  Let e ∈ E x be a point in the fiber over x .  A lift of γ through e is a curve γ γ ~ ~ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {\gamma }}(t)} in the total space E such that γ γ ~ ~ ( 0 ) = e {\displaystyle {\tilde {\gamma }}(0)=e} , and π π ( γ γ ~ ~ ( t ) ) = γ γ ( t ) .

{\displaystyle \pi ({\tilde {\gamma }}(t))=\gamma (t).} A lift is horizontal if, in addition, every tangent of the curve lies in the horizontal subbundle of TE : γ γ ~ ~ ′ ( t ) ∈ ∈ H γ γ ~ ~ ( t ) .

{\displaystyle {\tilde {\gamma }}'(t)\in H_{{\tilde {\gamma }}(t)}.} It can be shown using the rank–nullity theorem applied to π and Φ that each vector X ∈ T x M has a unique horizontal lift to a vector X ~ ~ ∈ ∈ T e E {\displaystyle {\tilde {X}}\in T_{e}E} .  In particular, the tangent field to γ generates a horizontal vector field in the total space of the pullback bundle γ * E .  By the Picard–Lindelöf theorem , this vector field is integrable .  Thus, for any curve γ and point e over x = γ (0), there exists a unique horizontal lift of γ through e for small time t .

Note that, for general Ehresmann connections, the horizontal lift is path-dependent.  When two smooth curves in M , coinciding at γ 1 (0) = γ 2 (0) = x 0 and also intersecting at another point x 1 ∈ M , are lifted horizontally to E through the same e ∈ π −1 ( x 0 ), they will generally pass through different points of π −1 ( x 1 ).  This has important consequences for the differential geometry of fiber bundles: the space of sections of H is not a Lie subalgebra of the space of vector fields on E , because it is not (in general) closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields . This failure of closure under Lie bracket is measured by the curvature .

Properties [ edit ] Curvature [ edit ] Let Φ be an Ehresmann connection.  Then the curvature of Φ is given by [ 2 ] R = 1 2 [ Φ Φ , Φ Φ ] {\displaystyle R={\tfrac {1}{2}}[\varPhi ,\varPhi ]} where [-,-] denotes the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket of Φ ∈ Ω 1 ( E , TE ) with itself.  Thus R ∈ Ω 2 ( E , TE ) is the two-form on E with values in TE defined by R ( X , Y ) = Φ Φ ( [ ( i d − − Φ Φ ) X , ( i d − − Φ Φ ) Y ] ) {\displaystyle R(X,Y)=\varPhi \left([(\mathrm {id} -\varPhi )X,(\mathrm {id} -\varPhi )Y]\right)} , or, in other terms, R ( X , Y ) = [ X H , Y H ] V {\displaystyle R\left(X,Y\right)=\left[X_{H},Y_{H}\right]_{V}} , where X = X H + X V denotes the direct sum decomposition into H and V components, respectively.  From this last expression for the curvature, it is seen to vanish identically if, and only if, the horizontal subbundle is Frobenius integrable .  Thus the curvature is the integrability condition for the horizontal subbundle to yield transverse sections of the fiber bundle E → M .

The curvature of an Ehresmann connection also satisfies a version of the Bianchi identity : [ Φ Φ , R ] = 0 {\displaystyle \left[\varPhi ,R\right]=0} where again [-,-] is the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket of Φ ∈ Ω 1 ( E , TE ) and R ∈ Ω 2 ( E , TE ).

Completeness [ edit ] An Ehresmann connection allows curves to have unique horizontal lifts locally .  For a complete Ehresmann connection, a curve can be horizontally lifted over its entire domain.

Holonomy [ edit ] Flatness of the connection corresponds locally to the Frobenius integrability of the horizontal spaces.  At the other extreme, non-vanishing curvature implies the presence of holonomy of the connection.

[ 4 ] Special cases [ edit ] Principal bundles and principal connections [ edit ] Main article: Connection (principal bundle) A principal bundle connection form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } may be thought of as a projection operator on the tangent bundle T P {\displaystyle TP} of the principal bundle P {\displaystyle P} . The kernel of the connection form is given by the horizontal subspaces for the associated Ehresmann connection.

Suppose that E is a smooth principal G -bundle over M . Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a principal (Ehresmann) connection [ 3 ] if it is invariant with respect to the G action on E in the sense that H e g = d ( R g ) e ( H e ) {\displaystyle H_{eg}=\mathrm {d} (R_{g})_{e}(H_{e})} for any e ∈ E and g ∈ G ; here d ( R g ) e {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} (R_{g})_{e}} denotes the differential of the right action of g on E at e .

The one-parameter subgroups of G act vertically on E .  The differential of this action allows one to identify the subspace V e {\displaystyle V_{e}} with the Lie algebra g of group G , say by map ι ι : : V e → → g {\displaystyle \iota \colon V_{e}\to {\mathfrak {g}}} . The connection form Φ of the Ehresmann connection may then be viewed as a 1-form ω on E with values in g defined by ω ( X )= ι ( Φ ( X )).

Thus reinterpreted, the connection form ω satisfies the following two properties: It transforms equivariantly under the G action: R h ∗ ∗ ω ω = Ad ( h − − 1 ) ω ω {\displaystyle R_{h}^{*}\omega ={\hbox{Ad}}(h^{-1})\omega } for all h ∈ G , where R h * is the pullback under the right action and Ad is the adjoint representation of G on its Lie algebra.

It maps vertical vector fields to their associated elements of the Lie algebra: ω ( X )= ι ( X ) for all X ∈ V .

Conversely, it can be shown that such a g -valued 1-form on a principal bundle generates a horizontal distribution satisfying the aforementioned properties.

Given a local trivialization one can reduce ω to the horizontal vector fields (in this trivialization). It defines a 1-form ω' on M via pullback . The form ω' determines ω completely, but it depends on the choice of trivialization. (This form is often also called a connection form and denoted simply by ω .) Vector bundles and covariant derivatives [ edit ] Main article: Connection (vector bundle) Suppose that E is a smooth vector bundle over M . Then an Ehresmann connection H on E is said to be a linear (Ehresmann) connection if H e depends linearly on e ∈ E x for each x ∈ M . To make this precise, let S λ denote scalar multiplication by λ on E . Then H is linear if and only if H λ λ e = d ( S λ λ ) e ( H e ) {\displaystyle H_{\lambda e}=\mathrm {d} (S_{\lambda })_{e}(H_{e})} for any e ∈ E and scalar λ.

Since E is a vector bundle, its vertical bundle V is isomorphic to π * E . Therefore if s is a section of E , then Φ (d s ): TM → s * V = s * π * E = E . It is a vector bundle morphism, and is therefore given by a section ∇ s of the vector bundle Hom( TM , E ). The fact that the Ehresmann connection is linear implies that in addition it verifies for every function f {\displaystyle f} on M {\displaystyle M} the Leibniz rule, i.e.

∇ ∇ ( f s ) = f ∇ ∇ ( s ) + d ( f ) ⊗ ⊗ s {\displaystyle \nabla (fs)=f\nabla (s)+d(f)\otimes s} , and therefore is a covariant derivative of s .

Conversely a covariant derivative ∇ on a vector bundle defines a linear Ehresmann connection by defining H e , for e ∈ E with x = π ( e ), to be the image d s x ( T x M ) where s is a section of E with s ( x ) = e and ∇ X s = 0 for all X ∈ T x M .

Note that (for historical reasons) the term linear when applied to connections, is sometimes used (like the word affine – see Affine connection ) to refer to connections defined on the tangent bundle or frame bundle .

Associated bundles [ edit ] An Ehresmann connection on a fiber bundle (endowed with a structure group) sometimes gives rise to an Ehresmann connection on an associated bundle .  For instance, a (linear) connection in a vector bundle E , thought of giving a parallelism of E as above, induces a connection on the associated bundle of frames P E of E .  Conversely, a connection in P E gives rise to a (linear) connection in E provided that the connection in P E is equivariant with respect to the action of the general linear group on the frames (and thus a principal connection ).  It is not always possible for an Ehresmann connection to induce, in a natural way, a connection on an associated bundle.  For example, a non-equivariant Ehresmann connection on a bundle of frames of a vector bundle may not induce a connection on the vector bundle.

Suppose that E is an associated bundle of P , so that E = P × G F .  A G -connection on E is an Ehresmann connection such that the parallel transport map τ : F x → F x′ is given by a G -transformation of the fibers (over sufficiently nearby points x and x ′ in M joined by a curve).

[ 5 ] Given a principal connection on P , one obtains a G -connection on the associated fiber bundle E = P × G F via pullback .

Conversely, given a G -connection on E it is possible to recover the principal connection on the associated principal bundle P .  To recover this principal connection, one introduces the notion of a frame on the typical fiber F .  Since G is a finite-dimensional [ 6 ] Lie group acting effectively on F , there must exist a finite configuration of points ( y 1 ,..., y m ) within F such that the G -orbit R = {( gy 1 ,..., gy m ) | g ∈ G } is a principal homogeneous space of G .  One can think of R as giving a generalization of the notion of a frame for the G -action on F .  Note that, since R is a principal homogeneous space for G , the fiber bundle E ( R ) associated to E with typical fiber R is (equivalent to) the principal bundle associated to E .  But it is also a subbundle of the m -fold product bundle of E with itself.  The distribution of horizontal spaces on E induces a distribution of spaces on this product bundle.  Since the parallel transport maps associated to the connection are G -maps, they preserve the subspace E ( R ), and so the G -connection descends to a principal G -connection on E ( R ).

In summary, there is a one-to-one correspondence (up to equivalence) between the descents of principal connections to associated fiber bundles, and G -connections on associated fiber bundles.  For this reason, in the category of fiber bundles with a structure group G , the principal connection contains all relevant information for G -connections on the associated bundles.  Hence, unless there is an overriding reason to consider connections on associated bundles (as there is, for instance, in the case of Cartan connections ) one usually works directly with the principal connection.

Notes [ edit ] ^ These considerations apply equally well to the more general situation in which π π : : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi \colon E\to M} is a surjective submersion : i.e., E is a fibered manifold over M .  In an alternative generalization, due to Lang (1999) and Eliason (1967) , E and M are permitted to be Banach manifolds , with E a fiber bundle over M as above.
