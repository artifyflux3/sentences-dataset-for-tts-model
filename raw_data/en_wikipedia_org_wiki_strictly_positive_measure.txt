Intuitively, a strictly positive measure is one that is "nowhere zero", or that is zero "only on points".

Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , T ) {\displaystyle (X,T)} be a Hausdorff topological space and let Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } be a σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra on X {\displaystyle X} that contains the topology T {\displaystyle T} (so that every open set is a measurable set , and Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is at least as fine as the Borel σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra on X {\displaystyle X} ). Then a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is called strictly positive if every non-empty open subset of X {\displaystyle X} has strictly positive measure.

More concisely, μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is strictly positive if and only if for all U ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle U\in T} such that U ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ , μ μ ( U ) > 0.

{\displaystyle U\neq \varnothing ,\mu (U)>0.} Examples [ edit ] Counting measure on any set X {\displaystyle X} (with any topology) is strictly positive.

Dirac measure is usually not strictly positive unless the topology T {\displaystyle T} is particularly "coarse" (contains "few" sets). For example, δ δ 0 {\displaystyle \delta _{0}} on the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with its usual Borel topology and σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra is not strictly positive; however, if R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is equipped with the trivial topology T = { ∅ ∅ , R } , {\displaystyle T=\{\varnothing ,\mathbb {R} \},} then δ δ 0 {\displaystyle \delta _{0}} is strictly positive. This example illustrates the importance of the topology in determining strict positivity.

Gaussian measure on Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} (with its Borel topology and σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra) is strictly positive.

Wiener measure on the space of continuous paths in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a strictly positive measure — Wiener measure is an example of a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional space.

Lebesgue measure on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} (with its Borel topology and σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra) is strictly positive.

The trivial measure is never strictly positive, regardless of the space X {\displaystyle X} or the topology used, except when X {\displaystyle X} is empty.

Properties [ edit ] If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } are two measures on a measurable topological space ( X , Σ Σ ) , {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ),} with μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } strictly positive and also absolutely continuous with respect to ν ν , {\displaystyle \nu ,} then ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is strictly positive as well. The proof is simple: let U ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle U\subseteq X} be an arbitrary open set; since μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is strictly positive, μ μ ( U ) > 0 ; {\displaystyle \mu (U)>0;} by absolute continuity, ν ν ( U ) > 0 {\displaystyle \nu (U)>0} as well.

Hence, strict positivity is an invariant with respect to equivalence of measures .
