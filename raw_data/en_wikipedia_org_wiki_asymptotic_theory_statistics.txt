Within this framework, it is often assumed that the sample size n may grow indefinitely; the properties of estimators and tests are then evaluated under the limit of n → ∞ . In practice, a limit evaluation is considered to be approximately valid for large finite sample sizes too.

[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] Most statistical problems begin with a dataset of size n . The asymptotic theory proceeds by assuming that it is possible (in principle) to keep collecting additional data, thus that the sample size grows infinitely, i.e.

n → ∞ . Under the assumption, many results can be obtained that are unavailable for samples of finite size. An example is the weak law of large numbers . The law states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables X 1 , X 2 , ...

, if one value is drawn from each random variable and the average of the first n values is computed as X n , then the X n converge in probability to the population mean E[ X i ] as n → ∞ .

[ 2 ] In asymptotic theory, the standard approach is n → ∞ . For some statistical models , slightly different approaches of asymptotics may be used. For example, with panel data , it is commonly assumed that one dimension in the data remains fixed, whereas the other dimension grows: T = constant and N → ∞ , or vice versa.

[ 2 ] Besides the standard approach to asymptotics, other alternative approaches exist: Within the local asymptotic normality framework, it is assumed that the value of the "true parameter" in the model varies slightly with n , such that the n -th model corresponds to θ n = θ + h / √ n . This approach lets us study the regularity of estimators .

When statistical tests are studied for their power to distinguish against the alternatives that are close to the null hypothesis, it is done within the so-called "local alternatives" framework: the null hypothesis is H 0 : θ = θ 0 and the alternative is H 1 : θ = θ 0 + h / √ n . This approach is especially popular for the unit root tests .

There are models where the dimension of the parameter space Θ n slowly expands with n , reflecting the fact that the more observations there are, the more structural effects can be feasibly incorporated in the model.

In kernel density estimation and kernel regression , an additional parameter is assumed—the bandwidth h . In those models, it is typically taken that h → 0 as n → ∞ . The rate of convergence must be chosen carefully, though, usually h ∝ n −1/5 .

In many cases, highly accurate results for finite samples can be obtained via numerical methods (i.e. computers); even in such cases, though, asymptotic analysis can be useful. This point was made by Small (2010 , §1.4), as follows.

A primary goal of asymptotic analysis is to obtain a deeper qualitative understanding of quantitative tools. The conclusions of an asymptotic analysis often supplement the conclusions which can be obtained by numerical methods.

Modes of convergence of random variables [ edit ] Further information: Convergence of random variables Asymptotic properties [ edit ] Estimators [ edit ] Consistency [ edit ] A sequence of estimates is said to be consistent , if it converges in probability to the true value of the parameter being estimated: θ θ ^ ^ n → p θ θ 0 .

{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}_{n}\ {\xrightarrow {\overset {}{p}}}\ \theta _{0}.} That is, roughly speaking with an infinite amount of data the estimator (the formula for generating the estimates) would almost surely give the correct result for the parameter being estimated.

[ 2 ] Asymptotic distribution [ edit ] If it is possible to find sequences of non-random constants { a n }, { b n } (possibly depending on the value of θ 0 ), and a non-degenerate distribution G such that b n ( θ θ ^ ^ n − − a n ) → d G , {\displaystyle b_{n}({\hat {\theta }}_{n}-a_{n})\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ G,} then the sequence of estimators θ θ ^ ^ n {\displaystyle \textstyle {\hat {\theta }}_{n}} is said to have the asymptotic distribution G .

Most often, the estimators encountered in practice are asymptotically normal , meaning their asymptotic distribution is the normal distribution , with a n = θ 0 , b n = √ n , and G = N (0, V ) : n ( θ θ ^ ^ n − − θ θ 0 ) → d N ( 0 , V ) .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}({\hat {\theta }}_{n}-\theta _{0})\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ {\mathcal {N}}(0,V).} Asymptotic confidence regions [ edit ] Asymptotic theorems [ edit ] Central limit theorem Continuous mapping theorem Glivenko–Cantelli theorem Law of large numbers Law of the iterated logarithm Slutsky's theorem Delta method See also [ edit ] Asymptotic analysis Exact statistics Large deviations theory References [ edit ] ^ Höpfner, R.
