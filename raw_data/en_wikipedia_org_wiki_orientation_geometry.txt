Changing orientation of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") is the same as [rotating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") the axes of a [reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") attached to it.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the **orientation**, **attitude**, **bearing**, **direction**, or **angular position** of an object – such as a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") or [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") – is part of the description of how it is placed in the [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") it occupies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)#cite_note-Moores-1) More specifically, it refers to the imaginary [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") that is needed to move the object from a reference placement to its current placement. A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement, in which case it may be necessary to add an imaginary [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") to change the object's [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)") (or linear position). The position and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space. The above-mentioned imaginary rotation and translation may be thought to occur in any order, as the orientation of an object does not change when it translates, and its position does not change when it rotates.

[Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem") shows that in three dimensions any orientation can be reached with a single [rotation around a fixed axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis "Rotation around a fixed axis"). This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an [axis–angle representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation "Axis–angle representation"). Other widely used methods include [rotation quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation "Quaternions and spatial rotation"), [rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"), or [rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix"). More specialist uses include [Miller indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_indices "Miller indices") in crystallography, [strike and dip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_and_dip "Strike and dip") in geology and [grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(slope) "Grade (slope)") on maps and signs. A [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") may also be used to represent an object's [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector")[direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") or the [relative direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_direction_(geometry) "Relative direction (geometry)") between two points.

Typically, the orientation is given relative to a [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference"), usually specified by a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").

Mathematical representations
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(geometry)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Mathematical representations")]

In general the position and orientation in space of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") are defined as the position and orientation, relative to the main reference frame, of another reference frame, which is fixed relative to the body, and hence translates and rotates with it (the body's _local reference frame_, or _local coordinate system_). At least three independent values are needed to describe the orientation of this local frame. Three other values describe the position of a point on the object. All the points of the body change their position during a rotation except for those lying on the rotation axis. If the rigid body has [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") not all orientations are distinguishable, except by observing how the orientation evolves in time from a known starting orientation. For example, the orientation in space of a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), or [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") can be specified with only two values, for example two [direction cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_cosines "Direction cosines"). Another example is the position of a point on the Earth, often described using the orientation of a line joining it with the Earth's center, measured using the two angles of [longitude and latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_and_latitude "Longitude and latitude"). Likewise, the orientation of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") can be described with two values as well, for instance by specifying the orientation of a line [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal "Surface normal") to that plane, or by using the strike and dip angles.

Further details about the mathematical methods to represent the orientation of rigid bodies and planes in three dimensions are given in the following sections.

In [two dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_dimensions "Two dimensions") the orientation of any object (line, vector, or [plane figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_figure "Plane figure")) is given by a single value: the angle through which it has rotated. There is only one degree of freedom and only one fixed point about which the rotation takes place.

### Multiple dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(geometry)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Multiple dimensions")]

When there are d dimensions, specification of an orientation of an object that does not have any rotational symmetry requires _d_(_d_ − 1) / 2 independent values.

Rigid body in three dimensions
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(geometry)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Rigid body in three dimensions")]

Several methods to describe orientations of a rigid body in three dimensions have been developed. They are summarized in the following sections.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Eulerangles.svg/250px-Eulerangles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eulerangles.svg)

Euler angles, one of the possible ways to describe an orientation

The first attempt to represent an orientation is attributed to [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"). He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one around the other, and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and another to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles").

Tait–Bryan angles. Other way for describing orientation

These are three angles, also known as yaw, pitch and roll, Navigation angles and Cardan angles. Mathematically they constitute a set of six possibilities inside the twelve possible sets of Euler angles, the ordering being the one best used for describing the orientation of a vehicle such as an airplane. In aerospace engineering they are usually referred to as Euler angles.

A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.

### Orientation vector

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(geometry)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Orientation vector")]

Euler also realized that the composition of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis ([Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem")). Therefore, the composition of the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed.

Based on this fact he introduced a vectorial way to describe any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module equal to the value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector.

A similar method, called [axis–angle representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation "Axis–angle representation"), describes a rotation or orientation using a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") aligned with the rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure).

With the introduction of matrices, the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by [orthogonal matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix") referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an orientation, a rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix.

The above-mentioned Euler vector is the [eigenvector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector "Eigenvector") of a rotation matrix (a rotation matrix has a unique real [eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue")). The product of two rotation matrices is the composition of rotations. Therefore, as before, the orientation can be given as the rotation from the initial frame to achieve the frame that we want to describe.

The [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(mathematics) "Configuration space (mathematics)") of a non-[symmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") object in _n_-dimensional space is [SO(_n_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group")[×](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology")[**R**_n_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). Orientation may be visualized by attaching a basis of [tangent vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") to an object. The direction in which each vector points determines its orientation.

### Orientation quaternion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(geometry)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Orientation quaternion")]

Another way to describe rotations is using [rotation quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation "Quaternions and spatial rotation"), also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, they can be more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions.

The orientation of a rigid body is determined by three angles

The attitude of a rigid body is its orientation as described, for example, by the orientation of a frame fixed in the body relative to a fixed reference frame. The attitude is described by _attitude coordinates_, and consists of at least three coordinates.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)#cite_note-Schaub-2) One scheme for orienting a rigid body is based upon body-axes rotation; successive rotations three times about the axes of the body's fixed reference frame, thereby establishing the body's [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)#cite_note-Kuipers-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)#cite_note-Wie-4) Another is based upon [roll, pitch and yaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tait%E2%80%93Bryan_angles#Aircraft_attitudes "Tait–Bryan angles"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry)#cite_note-Sciavicco-5) although these terms also refer to [incremental deviations from the nominal attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics")
