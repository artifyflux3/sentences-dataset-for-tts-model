The family of Nakagami distributions has two parameters: a shape parameter m ≥ ≥ 1 / 2 {\displaystyle m\geq 1/2} and a scale parameter Ω Ω > 0 {\displaystyle \Omega >0} .
It is used to model physical phenomena such as those found in medical ultrasound imaging, communications engineering, meteorology, hydrology, multimedia, and seismology.

Characterization [ edit ] Its probability density function (pdf) is [ 1 ] f ( x ; m , Ω Ω ) = 2 m m Γ Γ ( m ) Ω Ω m x 2 m − − 1 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − m Ω Ω x 2 ) for x ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle f(x;\,m,\Omega )={\frac {2m^{m}}{\Gamma (m)\Omega ^{m}}}x^{2m-1}\exp \left(-{\frac {m}{\Omega }}x^{2}\right){\text{ for }}x\geq 0.} where m ≥ ≥ 1 / 2 {\displaystyle m\geq 1/2} and Ω Ω > 0 {\displaystyle \Omega >0} .

Its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is [ 1 ] F ( x ; m , Ω Ω ) = γ γ ( m , m Ω Ω x 2 ) Γ Γ ( m ) = P ( m , m Ω Ω x 2 ) {\displaystyle F(x;\,m,\Omega )={\frac {\gamma \left(m,{\frac {m}{\Omega }}x^{2}\right)}{\Gamma (m)}}=P\left(m,{\frac {m}{\Omega }}x^{2}\right)} where P is the regularized (lower) incomplete gamma function .

Parameterization [ edit ] The parameters m {\displaystyle m} and Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } are [ 2 ] m = ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 2 ] ) 2 Var ⁡ ⁡ [ X 2 ] , {\displaystyle m={\frac {\left(\operatorname {E} [X^{2}]\right)^{2}}{\operatorname {Var} [X^{2}]}},} and Ω Ω = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X 2 ] .

{\displaystyle \Omega =\operatorname {E} [X^{2}].} No closed form solution exists for the median of this distribution, although special cases do exist, such as Ω Ω ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 ) {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\Omega \ln(2)}}} when m = 1. For practical purposes the median would have to be calculated as the 50th-percentile of the observations.

Parameter estimation [ edit ] An alternative way of fitting the distribution is to re-parametrize Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } as σ = Ω/ m .

[ 3 ] Given independent observations X 1 = x 1 , … … , X n = x n {\textstyle X_{1}=x_{1},\ldots ,X_{n}=x_{n}} from the Nakagami distribution, the likelihood function is L ( σ σ , m ) = ( 2 Γ Γ ( m ) σ σ m ) n ( ∏ ∏ i = 1 n x i ) 2 m − − 1 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i 2 σ σ ) .

{\displaystyle L(\sigma ,m)=\left({\frac {2}{\Gamma (m)\sigma ^{m}}}\right)^{n}\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right)^{2m-1}\exp \left(-{\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}{\sigma }}\right).} Its logarithm is ℓ ℓ ( σ σ , m ) = log ⁡ ⁡ L ( σ σ , m ) = − − n log ⁡ ⁡ Γ Γ ( m ) − − n m log ⁡ ⁡ σ σ + ( 2 m − − 1 ) ∑ ∑ i = 1 n log ⁡ ⁡ x i − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i 2 σ σ .

{\displaystyle \ell (\sigma ,m)=\log L(\sigma ,m)=-n\log \Gamma (m)-nm\log \sigma +(2m-1)\sum _{i=1}^{n}\log x_{i}-{\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}{\sigma }}.} Therefore ∂ ∂ ℓ ℓ ∂ ∂ σ σ = − − n m σ σ + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i 2 σ σ 2 and ∂ ∂ ℓ ℓ ∂ ∂ m = − − n Γ Γ ′ ( m ) Γ Γ ( m ) − − n log ⁡ ⁡ σ σ + 2 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n log ⁡ ⁡ x i .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial \ell }{\partial \sigma }}={\frac {-nm\sigma +\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}{\sigma ^{2}}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad {\frac {\partial \ell }{\partial m}}=-n{\frac {\Gamma '(m)}{\Gamma (m)}}-n\log \sigma +2\sum _{i=1}^{n}\log x_{i}.\end{aligned}}} These derivatives vanish only when σ σ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i 2 n m {\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}{nm}}} and the value of m for which the derivative with respect to m vanishes is found by numerical methods including the Newton–Raphson method .

It can be shown that at the critical point a global maximum is attained, so the critical point is the maximum-likelihood estimate of ( m , σ ). Because of the equivariance of maximum-likelihood estimation, a maximum likelihood estimate for Ω is obtained as well.

Random variate generation [ edit ] The Nakagami distribution is related to the gamma distribution .
In particular, given a random variable Y ∼ ∼ Gamma ( k , θ θ ) {\displaystyle Y\,\sim {\textrm {Gamma}}(k,\theta )} , it is possible to obtain a random variable X ∼ ∼ Nakagami ( m , Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle X\,\sim {\textrm {Nakagami}}(m,\Omega )} , by setting k = m {\displaystyle k=m} , θ θ = Ω Ω / m {\displaystyle \theta =\Omega /m} , and taking the square root of Y {\displaystyle Y} : X = Y .

{\displaystyle X={\sqrt {Y}}.\,} Alternatively, the Nakagami distribution f ( y ; m , Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle f(y;\,m,\Omega )} can be generated from the chi distribution with parameter k {\displaystyle k} set to 2 m {\displaystyle 2m} and then following it by a scaling transformation of random variables. That is, a Nakagami random variable X {\displaystyle X} is generated by a simple scaling transformation on a chi-distributed random variable Y ∼ ∼ χ χ ( 2 m ) {\displaystyle Y\sim \chi (2m)} as below.

X = ( Ω Ω / 2 m ) Y .

{\displaystyle X={\sqrt {(\Omega /2m)}}Y.} For a chi-distribution, the degrees of freedom 2 m {\displaystyle 2m} must be an integer, but for Nakagami the m {\displaystyle m} can be any real number greater than 1/2. This is the critical difference and accordingly, Nakagami-m is viewed as a generalization of chi-distribution, similar to a gamma distribution being considered as a generalization of chi-squared distributions.

History and applications [ edit ] The Nakagami distribution is relatively new, being first proposed in 1960 by Minoru Nakagami as a mathematical model for small-scale fading in long-distance high-frequency radio wave propagation.

[ 4 ] It has been used to model attenuation of wireless signals traversing multiple paths [ 5 ] and to study the impact of fading channels on wireless communications.

[ 6 ] Related distributions [ edit ] Restricting m to the unit interval ( q = m ; 0 < q < 1) [ dubious – discuss ] defines the Nakagami - q distribution, also known as Hoyt distribution , first studied by R.S. Hoyt in the 1940s.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In particular, the radius around the true mean in a bivariate normal random variable, re-written in polar coordinates (radius and angle), follows a Hoyt distribution. Equivalently, the modulus of a complex normal random variable also does.

With 2 m = k , the Nakagami distribution gives a scaled chi distribution .

With m = 1 2 {\displaystyle m={\tfrac {1}{2}}} , the Nakagami distribution gives a scaled half-normal distribution .

A Nakagami distribution is a particular form of generalized gamma distribution , with p = 2 and d = 2 m .
