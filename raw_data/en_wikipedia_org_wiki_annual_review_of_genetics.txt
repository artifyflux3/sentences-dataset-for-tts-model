[ 1 ] History [ edit ] In 1965, the nonprofit publisher Annual Reviews surveyed geneticists to determine if there was a need for an annual journal that published review articles about recent developments in the field of genetics. Responses to the survey were favorable, with the first volume of the Annual Review of Genetics published two years later in 1967.

[ 4 ] Its inaugural editor was Herschel L. Roman .

[ 5 ] As of 2020, it was published both in print and electronically.

[ 6 ] Scope and indexing [ edit ] It defines its scope as covering various aspects of genetics , including molecular , cell , and developmental biology; behavioral genetics , population genetics , chromosome structure and transmission, gene function and expression , mutation and DNA repair , genomics , and immunogenetics . Various organisms are considered, including viruses , bacteria , fungi , plants , and animals .

[ 7 ] It is abstracted and indexed in Scopus , Science Citation Index Expanded , MEDLINE , Embase , and Academic Search , among others.

[ 8 ] Editorial processes [ edit ] The Annual Review of Genetics is helmed by the editor or the co-editors. The editor is assisted by the editorial committee, which includes associate editors, regular members, and occasionally guest editors. Guest members participate at the invitation of the editor, and serve terms of one year. All other members of the editorial committee are appointed by the Annual Reviews board of directors and serve five-year terms. The editorial committee determines which topics should be included in each volume and solicits reviews from qualified authors.

[ 9 ] Unsolicited manuscripts are not accepted.

Peer review of accepted manuscripts is undertaken by the editorial committee.

[ 10 ] Editors of volumes [ edit ] Dates indicate publication years in which someone was credited as a lead editor or co-editor of a journal volume. The planning process for a volume begins well before the volume appears, so appointment to the position of lead editor generally occurred prior to the first year shown here. An editor who has retired or died may be credited as a lead editor of a volume that they helped to plan, even if it is published after their retirement or death.
