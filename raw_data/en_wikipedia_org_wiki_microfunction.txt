Semantically, it is the application of algebraic operations on analytic quantities. As a research programme, it was started by the Japanese mathematician Mikio Sato in 1959.

[ 1 ] This can be seen as an algebraic geometrization of analysis. According to Schapira, parts of Sato's work can be regarded as a manifestation of Grothendieck's style of mathematics within the realm of classical analysis. It derives its meaning from the fact that the differential operator is right-invertible in several function spaces.

It helps in the simplification of the proofs due to an algebraic description of the problem considered.

( September 2019 ) Let M be a real - analytic manifold of dimension n , and let X be its complexification. The sheaf of microlocal functions on M is given as [ 2 ] H n ( μ μ M ( O X ) ⊗ ⊗ o r M / X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{n}(\mu _{M}({\mathcal {O}}_{X})\otimes {\mathcal {or}}_{M/X})} where μ μ M {\displaystyle \mu _{M}} denotes the microlocalization functor , o r M / X {\displaystyle {\mathcal {or}}_{M/X}} is the relative orientation sheaf .

A microfunction can be used to define a Sato's hyperfunction . By definition, the sheaf of Sato's hyperfunctions on M is the restriction of the sheaf of microfunctions to M , in parallel to the fact the sheaf of real-analytic functions on M is the restriction of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on X to M .
