[ 2 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Alda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936, in Manhattan , New York City.

[ 3 ] He spent his childhood traveling around the United States with his parents, in support of his father's job as a performer; [ 4 ] he  performed with his father in the less risqué burlesque sketches.

[ 5 ] His father, Robert Alda (born Alfonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo), was an actor and singer, and his mother, Joan Browne, was a homemaker and former beauty-pageant winner.

[ 6 ] His father was of Italian descent (D' Abruzzo is a toponymic surname ) and his mother of Irish descent .

[ 7 ] His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and, according to Alan, tried to stab his father when Alan was six. In the same interview he said that his mother taught him to improvise, an important skill of his: he had to learn how to react to the state she was in, for his own safety.

[ 5 ] When Alda was seven, he contracted polio . To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by Elizabeth Kenny , consisting of applying hot woollen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles.

[ 8 ] Alda attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York .

[ 9 ] He studied English at Fordham University in the Bronx, where he was a student staff member of its FM radio station, WFUV . During his junior year, he studied in Paris, acted in a play in Rome, and performed with his father on television in Amsterdam .

In 1956, Alda received his Bachelor of Arts degree. A member of the ROTC , he entered the United States Army Reserve and served for six months at Fort Benning .

[ 10 ] Despite some erroneous reports on military sites that Alda then served in Korea, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] he has repeatedly said he did not serve there, instead following up active duty of six months at Fort Benning with a time in the reserves in New York City.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In a 2013 interview, he joked that he was in charge of a mess tent.

[ 17 ] Alda's half-brother Antony Alda was born in 1956 and also became an actor.

Career [ edit ] 1958–1971: Broadway debut and early work [ edit ] Alda began his career in the 1950s as a member of the Compass Players , an improvisational comedy revue directed by Paul Sills . He later joined the improvisational group Second City in Chicago. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during their 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation , appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son , Heaven Come Wednesday , Monique , and Job .

[ 18 ] In 1958, he appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled "Bilko the Art Lover".

Alda portrayed Charlie Cotchipee in the 1961 Ossie Davis play Purlie Victorious on Broadway. In the November 1964 world premiere at the August Wilson Theatre of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat , he played Felix the Owl, opposite Doris the Pussycat played by actress/singer Diana Sands , [ 19 ] an African-American actress; their onstage kiss prompted hate mail.

[ 20 ] He continued to play Felix the Owl for the 1964–65 Broadway season.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway with Barbara Harris , and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for the role. Alda said he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.

[ 23 ] Alda was part of the cast, along with David Frost , Henry Morgan and Buck Henry , of the American television version of That Was the Week That Was , which ran as a series from January 10, 1964, to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone Are the Days!

, a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious , which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis . Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968), [ 9 ] as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins . During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a game show panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?

, and on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival. Alda wrote several of the stories and poems featured in Marlo Thomas ' television show Free to Be... You and Me .

1972–1983: M*A*S*H and acclaim [ edit ] Alda (left of center) as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H , 1972 In early 1972, Alda was selected to play Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film M*A*S*H .

[ 9 ] He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards , and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 2.5-hour series finale " Goodbye, Farewell and Amen ", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes.

[ 24 ] The cast of M*A*S*H from season two, 1974 (clockwise from left): Loretta Swit , Larry Linville , Wayne Rogers , Gary Burghoff , McLean Stevenson , and Alda Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H .

[ 25 ] His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, initially because he did not know how long the show would last. Alda's father Robert Alda and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in the 20th episode of season eight of M*A*S*H , "Lend a Hand". Robert had previously appeared in "The Consultant" in season three .

Alan and Robert Alda in 1975 During the series' first five seasons, its tone was largely that of a traditional "service comedy" in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy . As the original writers gradually left the show, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a more serious tone, openly addressing political and social issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart / Gene Reynolds "comedy" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda "dramatic" years (1977–1983).

[ citation needed ] Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he said, "I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that." [ 26 ] Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted their characters' original 'equal' standing. Rogers and Stevenson left the show at the end of the third season.

[ 27 ] Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character of Colonel Blake. Veteran actor Harry Morgan , who was a fan of the series, joined the cast as Colonel Sherman T. Potter and carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists.

[ 28 ] Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new tentmate BJ Hunnicutt .

By 1981, he was the highest paid person on a TV show with a contract paying him $225,000 an episode ($5.4 million per season).

[ 29 ] In his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper , who directed several early M*A*S*H episodes, wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility, and that the two of them barely spoke by the end of Cooper's tenure.

[ 30 ] During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably on The $10,000 Pyramid , and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line?

and To Tell the Truth . He also starred in films including the 1978 comedy films Same Time, Next Year and California Suite , and wrote and starred in the title role of the 1979 political drama film The Seduction of Joe Tynan .

His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are " Dear Sigmund " and "In Love and War".

[ 31 ] In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide ' s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.

In August 2006, Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of Vinick in the final season of The West Wing . Alda appeared in a total of 28 episodes during the show's sixth and seventh seasons.

They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it.

[ 58 ] He addressed the incident saying "We did eat the rum cake off the floor and were inseparable after that. But I was captivated by her even earlier in the meal when I heard her at the end of the table laughing at my jokes. She had me at Ha."

The Aldas were long-time residents of Leonia, New Jersey .

[ 61 ] In Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself , Alda described how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he states that he still prays on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one.

[ 62 ] He states that when he talks to God it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief.

[ 62 ] Furthermore, he does not like to be labeled as an agnostic, stating in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website, that it was too fancy a word for him.

[ 63 ] He argues he simply is not a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different from their own.

He also talks about his mother's battle with schizophrenia . The title comes from an incident in his childhood, when Alda was distraught about his dog dying and his well-meaning father had the animal stuffed . Alda was horrified by the results, and took from this that sometimes we have to accept things as they are, rather than desperately and fruitlessly trying to change them.

His second memoir, Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself [ 65 ] (2008), weaves together advice from public speeches he has given with personal recollections about his life and beliefs.

His third memoir, If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face? My Adventures in the Art and Science of Relating and Communicating [ 66 ] (2017), is a story of his quest to learn how to communicate better, and to teach others to do the same.
