Jech ( Czech : Tomáš Jech , pronounced [ˈtomaːʃ ˈjɛx] ; born 29 January 1944 in Prague ) is a mathematician specializing in set theory who was at Penn State for more than 25 years.

Life [ edit ] He was educated at Charles University (his advisor was Petr Vopěnka ) and from 2000 is at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic .

Work [ edit ] Jech's research also includes mathematical logic , algebra , analysis , topology , and measure theory .

Jech gave the first published proof of the consistency of the existence of a Suslin line .
With Karel Prikry , he introduced the notion of precipitous ideal .

[ 1 ] He gave several models where the axiom of choice failed, for example one with ω 1 measurable . The concept of a Jech–Kunen tree is named after him and Kenneth Kunen .
