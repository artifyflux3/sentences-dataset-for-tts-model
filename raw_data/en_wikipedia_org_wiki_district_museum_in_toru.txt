Footnotes [ edit ] ^ The oldest known portrait of Copernicus is that on Strasbourg astronomical clock , made by Tobias Stimmer c. 1571–74. According to the inscription next to the portrait, it was made from a self-portrait by Copernicus himself. This has led to speculation that the Torun portrait may be a copy based on the same self-portrait, but its provenance is unknown.
