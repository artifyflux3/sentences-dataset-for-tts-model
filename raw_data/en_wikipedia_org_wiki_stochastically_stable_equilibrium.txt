An evolutionary stable state S is also stochastically stable if under vanishing noise, the probability that the population is in the vicinity of state S does not go to zero.

[ 1 ] The concept is extensively used in models of learning in populations, where "noise" is used to model experimentation or replacement of unsuccessful players with new players ( random mutation ). Over time, as the need for experimentation dies down or the population becomes stable, the population will converge towards a subset of evolutionarily stable states. Foster and Young have shown that this subset is the set of states with the highest potential .
