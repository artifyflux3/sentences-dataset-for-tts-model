These interactions are specifically mediated by the W + and W − bosons .

Overview [ edit ] The simplest Feynman diagram for beta decay . It contains a charged current interaction at each vertex.

Charged current interactions are the most easily detected class of weak interactions. The weak force is best known for mediating nuclear decay . It has very short range, but is the only force (apart from gravity ) to interact with neutrinos . The weak force is communicated via the W and Z exchange particles . Of these, the W-boson has either a positive or negative electric charge , and mediates neutrino absorption and emission by or with an electrically charged particle. During these processes, the W-boson induces electron or positron emission or absorption, or changing the flavour of a quark as well as its electrical charge, such as in beta decay or K-capture .

[ 1 ] By contrast, the Z particle is electrically neutral, and exchange of a Z-boson leaves the interacting particles' quantum numbers unaffected, except for a transfer of momentum, spin, and energy.

Because exchange of W bosons involves a transfer of electric charge (as well as a transfer of weak isospin , while weak hypercharge is not transferred), it is known as "charged current". By contrast, exchanges of Z bosons involve no transfer of electrical charge, so it is referred to as a " neutral current ". In the latter case, the word "current" has nothing to do with electricity – it simply refers to the Z bosons' movement between other particles.

Definition [ edit ] The name "charged current" arises due to currents of fermions coupled to the W bosons having electric charge. For example, the charged current contribution to the ν e e − → ν e e − elastic scattering amplitude is: [ 2 ] M C C ∝ ∝ J μ μ ( C C ) ( e − − → → ν ν e ) J ( C C ) μ μ ( ν ν e → → e − − ) , {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {M}}^{\mathrm {CC} }\propto J_{\mu }^{\mathrm {(CC)} }(\mathrm {e^{-}} \to \nu _{\mathrm {e} })\;J^{\mathrm {(CC)} \mu }(\nu _{\mathrm {e} }\to \mathrm {e^{-}} ),} where the charged currents describing the flow of one fermion into the other are given by: [ 2 ] J ( C C ) μ μ ( f → → f ′ ) = u ¯ ¯ f ′ γ γ μ μ 1 2 ( 1 − − γ γ 5 ) u f .

{\displaystyle J^{\mathrm {(CC)\mu } }(f\to f')={\bar {u}}_{f'}\gamma ^{\mu }{\frac {1}{2}}\left(1-\gamma ^{5}\right)u_{f}.} The W-Boson can couple to any particle with weak isospin (i.e. any left-handed Standard Model fermions).

[ Note 1 ] See also [ edit ] Neutral current W and Z bosons Notes [ edit ] ^ The W-Boson can also couple with any electroweak gauge boson and the Higgs Boson , but these are typically not characterized as charged current interactions.
