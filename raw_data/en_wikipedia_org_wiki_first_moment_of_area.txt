It is a measure of the spatial distribution of a shape in relation to an axis.

The first moment of area of a shape, about a certain axis, equals the sum over all the infinitesimal parts of the shape of the area of that part times its distance from the axis [Σ ad ].

First moment of area is commonly used to determine the centroid of an area.

Definition [ edit ] Given an area, A , of any shape, and division of that area into n number of very small, elemental areas ( dA i ). Let x i and y i be the distances (coordinates) to each elemental area measured from a given x-y axis. Now, the first moment of area in the x and y directions are respectively given by: S x = A y ¯ ¯ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n y i d A i = ∫ ∫ A y d A {\displaystyle S_{x}=A{\bar {y}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{y_{i}\,dA_{i}}=\int _{A}y\,dA} and S y = A x ¯ ¯ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i d A i = ∫ ∫ A x d A .

{\displaystyle S_{y}=A{\bar {x}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}\,dA_{i}}=\int _{A}x\,dA.} The SI unit for first moment of area is a cubic metre (m 3 ). In the American Engineering and Gravitational systems the unit is a cubic foot (ft 3 ) or more commonly inch 3 .

The static or statical moment of area , usually denoted by the symbol Q , is a property of a shape that is used to predict its resistance to shear stress .  By definition: Q j , x = ∫ ∫ y i d A , {\displaystyle Q_{j,x}=\int y_{i}\,dA,} where Q j,x – the first moment of area "j" about the neutral x axis of the entire body (not the neutral axis of the area "j"); dA – an elemental area of area "j"; y – the perpendicular distance to the centroid of element dA from the neutral axis x .

Shear stress in a semi-monocoque structure [ edit ] The equation for shear flow in a particular web section of the cross-section of a semi-monocoque structure is: q = V y S x I x {\displaystyle q={\frac {V_{y}S_{x}}{I_{x}}}} q – the shear flow through a particular web section of the cross-section V y – the shear force perpendicular to the neutral axis x through the entire cross-section S x – the first moment of area about the neutral axis x for a particular web section of the cross-section I x – the second moment of area about the neutral axis x for the entire cross-section Shear stress may now be calculated using the following equation: τ τ = q t {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {q}{t}}} τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } – the shear stress through a particular web section of the cross-section q – the shear flow through a particular web section of the cross-section t – the thickness of a particular web section of the cross-section at the point being measured [ 1 ] See also [ edit ] Second moment of area Polar moment of inertia Section modulus References [ edit ] ^ Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design, 9th Ed.
