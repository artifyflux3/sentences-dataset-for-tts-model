It is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Her) probably due to Roche lobe overflow.

Intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB) [ edit ] Her X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, ~2 M ☉ , between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.

[ 2 ] An intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole . The other component is an intermediate mass star.

[ 3 ] Intensity [ edit ] This light curve of Her X-1 shows long term and medium term variability. Each pair of vertical lines delineate the eclipse of the compact object behind its companion star. In this case, the companion is a 2 Solar-mass star with a radius of nearly 4 times that of the Sun . This eclipse shows the 1.7-day orbital period of the system.

The source exhibits complex time variability, pulsing with a period of 1.24 s due to the rotation of the neutron star, eclipsing every 1.70 days with the period of the binary orbit, and also varying with a 35-day period believed associated with the precession of the accretion disk . From observations, a twisted accretion disk, in retrograde precession , modulates the X-rays illuminating HZ Her and Earth.

[ 2 ] Uhuru observations revealed the presence of X-ray pulsations in Her X-1 (1.2 s) and confirmed that it contains a rapidly rotating neutron star. Figure adapted from figures by E. Schreier, STScI, taken from Figure 7-2a in Charles and Seward.

The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data. The sharp cut-off at ~24 keV in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for radiative transfer effects to be associated with a highly magnetized plasma near the surface of a neutron star.

The figure shows 15-second samples of the raw counts (per 20.48 ms) observed in a 1973 sounding-rocket-borne exposure to three of the X-ray brightest binary sources in the Milky Way galaxy: Her X-1 (1.7 days), Cyg X-3 (0.2 day), and Cyg X-1 (5.6 days).

OSO 8 spectra of Hercules X-1 Discovery of Her X-1 [ edit ] The actual announcement of the discovery of Hercules X-1 by Uhuru occurred at the 1971–72 Winter Meeting of the High-Energy Astrophysics Division AAS held in San Juan .

[ 4 ] The original discovery of this periodically pulsating binary X-ray source occurred in November 1971.

[ 5 ] Location [ edit ] The position of Her X-1 was uncertain due to the failure of the Uhuru star aspect sensors, having been reported [ 5 ] at J1950 RA 17 h 05 m Dec 34°52' using Uhuru and at 16 h 56.7 m Dec 35°35' [ 6 ] using OSO 7 . However, there is only one weak X-ray source (2U 1735+43) within 10° of Her X-1.

[ 7 ] But four radio sources: (1) RA 16 h 56 m 50.75 s Dec 35°14'33 ± 3" of a double point source separated by 17 ± 2 " and a stellar image 13 ± 3 " from the centroid, (2) RA 16 h 57 m 10.65 s Dec 35°21'35 ± 3" within 6 ± 3 " of the stellar image, (3) RA 16 h 57 m 35.72 s Dec 35°15'19 ± 3" with no star visible on the Palomar Sky Survey print, and (4) RA 16 h 58 m 39.17 s Dec 35°10'53 ± 3" were found near the overlap of Uhuru and OSO 7 positions.

[ 8 ] At that time the search could not discover the radio counterpart of Her X-1 if its radio emission were analogous to its 36-day periodic X-ray behavior, although there was no compelling astrophysical reason for the two fluxes to be correlated.

[ 8 ] The four sources above were observed during several eclipse phases of the X-ray star. No radio eclipses were detected that corresponded. At that time Doxsey [ 8 ] specified that (1) repeated radio searches, especially during the high X-ray luminosity state of Her X-1, should be made and (2) there was a clear need for a better position determination for Her X-1.

In 1973, Bahcall and Bahcall determined that HZ Herculis had a light curve that matched Hercules X-1's, fixing Hercules X-1's position.
