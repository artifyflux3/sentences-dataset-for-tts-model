The issue is a complicated one, since both physics and chemistry are divided into multiple subfields, each with their own goals. A major theme is whether, and in what sense, chemistry can be said to " reduce " to physics.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Background [ edit ] Although physics and chemistry are branches of science that both study matter, they differ in the scopes of their respective subjects. While physics focuses on phenomena such as force , motion , electromagnetism , elementary particles , and spacetime , [ 3 ] chemistry is concerned mainly with the structure and reactions of atoms and molecules , but does not necessarily deal with non-baryonic matter.

[ 4 ] However, the two disciplines overlap in subjects concerning the behaviour of fluids , the thermodynamics of chemical reactions, the magnetic forces between atoms and molecules, and quantum chemistry . Moreover, the laws of chemistry highly depend on the laws of quantum mechanics .

[ 5 ] In some respects the two sciences have developed independently, but less so towards the end of the twentieth century. There are many areas where there is major overlap, for instance both chemical physics and physical chemistry combine the two, while materials science is an interdisciplinary areas which combines both as well as some elements of engineering. This was deliberate, as recognized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 6 ] there are limitations to trying to force science into categories rather than focusing on the issues of importance, an approach now common in materials science.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Historical views [ edit ] In the 19th century, Auguste Comte in his hierarchy of the sciences , classified chemistry as more dependent than physics, as chemistry requires physics.

[ 9 ] In 1958, Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam put forward the idea that in the 20th century chemistry has been reduced to physics, as evidence for the unity of science .
