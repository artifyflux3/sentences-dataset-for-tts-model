Strategic moves can either be unconditional moves or response rules . The key characteristics of a strategic move are that it involves a commitment from the player, meaning the player can only restrict their own choices and that the commitment has to be credible , meaning that once employed it must be in the interest of the player to follow through with the move. Credible moves should also be observable to the other players.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Strategic moves are not warnings or assurances.

Warnings and assurances are merely statements of a player's interest, rather than an actual commitment from the player.

The term was coined by Thomas Schelling in his 1960 book, The Strategy of Conflict , and has gained wide currency in political science and industrial organization .
