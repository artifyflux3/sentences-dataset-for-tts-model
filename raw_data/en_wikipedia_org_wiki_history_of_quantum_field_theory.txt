In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), the **history of quantum field theory** starts with its creation by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac"), when he attempted to [quantize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics) "Quantization (physics)") the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") in the late 1920s. Major advances in the theory were made in the 1940s and 1950s, leading to the introduction of renormalized [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") (QED). The field theory behind QED was so accurate and successful in predictions that efforts were made to apply the same basic concepts for the other forces of nature. Beginning in 1954, the parallel was found by way of [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory"), leading by the late 1970s, to quantum field models of [strong nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_force "Strong nuclear force") and [weak nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force "Weak nuclear force"), united in the modern [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics").

Efforts to describe [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") using the same techniques have, to date, failed. The study of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") is still flourishing, as are applications of its methods to many physical problems. It remains one of the most vital areas of [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") today, providing a common language to several different branches of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics").

Quantum field theory originated in the 1920s from the problem of creating a [quantum mechanical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") of the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"). In particular, [de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie "De Broglie") in 1924 introduced the idea of a wave description of elementary systems in the following way: "we proceed in this work from the assumption of the existence of a certain periodic phenomenon of a yet to be determined character, which is to be attributed to each and every isolated energy parcel".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-1)

In 1925, [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), and [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan") constructed just such a theory by expressing the field's internal [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)") as an infinite set of [harmonic oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator"), and by then utilizing the [canonical quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_quantization "Canonical quantization") procedure to these oscillators; their paper was published in 1926.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-4) This theory assumed that no electric charges or currents were present and today would be called a [free field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_field_theory "Free field theory").

The first reasonably complete theory of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), which included both the electromagnetic field and electrically charged matter as quantum mechanical objects, was created by [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") in 1927.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-5) This quantum field theory could be used to model important processes such as the emission of a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") by an electron dropping into a [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") of lower energy, a process in which the _number of particles changes_—one atom in the initial state becomes an atom plus a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") in the final state. It is now understood that the ability to describe such processes is one of the most important features of quantum field theory.

The final crucial step was [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi "Enrico Fermi")'s [theory of β-decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%27s_interaction "Fermi's interaction") (1934).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-7) In it, fermion species nonconservation was shown to follow from second quantization: creation and annihilation of fermions came to the fore and quantum field theory was seen to describe particle decays. (Fermi's breakthrough was somewhat foreshadowed in the abstract studies of Soviet physicists, [Viktor Ambartsumian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Ambartsumian "Viktor Ambartsumian") and [Dmitri Ivanenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Ivanenko "Dmitri Ivanenko"), in particular the Ambarzumian–Ivanenko hypothesis of creation of massive particles (1930).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-8) The idea was that not only the quanta of the electromagnetic field, photons, but also other particles might emerge and disappear as a result of their interaction with other particles.)

Incorporating special relativity
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Incorporating special relativity")]

It was evident from the beginning that a proper quantum treatment of the electromagnetic field had to somehow incorporate [Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")[relativity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), which had grown out of the study of [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"). This need to put together relativity and quantum mechanics was the second major motivation in the development of quantum field theory. [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan") and [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli") showed in 1928[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-10) that quantum fields could be made to behave in the way predicted by [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") during [coordinate transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") (specifically, they showed that the field [commutators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator") were [Lorentz invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_invariant "Lorentz invariant")). A further boost for quantum field theory came with the discovery of the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"), which was originally formulated and interpreted as a single-particle equation analogous to the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"), but unlike the Schrödinger equation, the Dirac equation satisfies both the Lorentz invariance, that is, the requirements of special relativity, and the rules of quantum mechanics. The Dirac equation accommodated the spin-1/2 value of the electron and accounted for its magnetic moment as well as giving accurate predictions for the spectra of hydrogen.

The attempted interpretation of the Dirac equation as a single-particle equation could not be maintained long, however, and finally it was shown that several of its undesirable properties (such as negative-energy states) could be made sense of by reformulating and reinterpreting the Dirac equation as a true field equation, in this case for the quantized "Dirac field" or the "electron field", with the "negative-energy solutions" pointing to the existence of [anti-particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticles "Antiparticles"). This work was performed first by Dirac himself with the invention of [hole theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_theory "Hole theory") in 1930 and by [Wendell Furry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Furry "Wendell Furry"), [Robert Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Oppenheimer "Robert Oppenheimer"), [Vladimir Fock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Fock "Vladimir Fock"), and others. [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger"), during the same period that he discovered his equation in 1926,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-11) also independently found the relativistic generalization of it known as the [Klein–Gordon equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%E2%80%93Gordon_equation "Klein–Gordon equation") but dismissed it since, without [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)"), it predicted impossible properties for the hydrogen spectrum. (See [Oskar Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Klein "Oskar Klein") and [Walter Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gordon_(physicist) "Walter Gordon (physicist)").) All relativistic wave equations that describe spin-zero particles are said to be of the Klein–Gordon type.

A subtle and careful analysis in 1933 by [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") and [Léon Rosenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Rosenfeld "Léon Rosenfeld")[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-12) showed that there is a fundamental limitation on the ability to simultaneously measure the electric and magnetic field strengths that enter into the description of charges in interaction with radiation, imposed by the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), which must apply to all canonically conjugate quantities. This limitation is crucial for the successful formulation and interpretation of a quantum field theory of photons and electrons (quantum electrodynamics), and indeed, any [perturbative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory") quantum field theory. The analysis of Bohr and Rosenfeld explains fluctuations in the values of the electromagnetic field that differ from the classically "allowed" values distant from the sources of the field.

Their analysis was crucial to showing that the limitations and physical implications of the uncertainty principle apply to all dynamical systems, whether fields or material particles. Their analysis also convinced most physicists that any notion of returning to a fundamental description of nature based on classical field theory, such as what Einstein aimed at with his numerous and failed attempts at a classical [unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory "Unified field theory"), was simply out of the question. _Fields had to be quantized_.

Second quantization
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Second quantization")]

The third thread in the development of quantum field theory was the need to handle the statistics of many-particle systems consistently and with ease. In 1927, [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan") tried to extend the canonical quantization of fields to the many-body wave functions of [identical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles "Identical particles")[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-14) using a formalism which is known as statistical transformation theory;[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-15) this procedure is now sometimes called [second quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization "Second quantization").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-17) Dirac is also credited with the invention, as he introduced the key ideas in a 1927 paper.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-Dirac1927-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-:4-19) In 1928, Jordan and [Eugene Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner "Eugene Wigner") found that the quantum field describing electrons, or other [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), had to be expanded using anti-commuting creation and annihilation operators due to the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle") (see [Jordan–Wigner transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation "Jordan–Wigner transformation")). This thread of development was incorporated into [many-body theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-body_theory "Many-body theory") and strongly influenced [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics") and [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics").

The problem of infinities
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The problem of infinities")]

Despite its early successes quantum field theory was plagued by several serious theoretical difficulties. Basic physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron, the energy shift of electron states due to the presence of the electromagnetic field, gave infinite, divergent contributions—a nonsensical result—when computed using the perturbative techniques available in the 1930s and most of the 1940s. The electron self-energy problem was already a serious issue in the classical electromagnetic field theory, where the attempt to attribute to the electron a finite size or extent (the classical electron-radius) led immediately to the question of what non-electromagnetic stresses would need to be invoked, which would presumably hold the electron together against the Coulomb repulsion of its finite-sized "parts". The situation was dire, and had certain features that reminded many of the "[Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_catastrophe "Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe")". What made the situation in the 1940s so desperate and gloomy, however, was the fact that the correct ingredients (the second-quantized Maxwell–Dirac field equations) for the theoretical description of interacting photons and electrons were well in place, and no major conceptual change was needed analogous to that which was necessitated by a finite and physically sensible account of the radiative behavior of hot objects, as provided by the Planck radiation law.

Renormalization procedures
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Renormalization procedures")]

Improvements in [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-lamb-20) now known as the [Lamb shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift "Lamb shift") and [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") of the electron.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-foley-21) These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.

A first indication of a possible way out was given by [Hans Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe") in 1947,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-bethe-22) after attending the [Shelter Island Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_Island_Conference "Shelter Island Conference").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-schweber-23) While he was traveling by train from the conference to [Schenectady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenectady "Schenectady") he made the first non-relativistic computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Lamb and [Retherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Retherford "Robert Retherford").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-bethe-22) Despite the limitations of the computation, agreement was excellent. The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)") that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments. In this way, the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result in good agreement with experiments. This procedure was named [renormalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization "Renormalization").

This "divergence problem" was solved in the case of quantum electrodynamics through the procedure known as [renormalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization "Renormalization") in 1947–49 by [Hans Kramers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kramers "Hans Kramers"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-24)[Hans Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-25)[Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger "Julian Schwinger"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-29)[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-32) and [Shin'ichiro Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichiro_Tomonaga "Shin'ichiro Tomonaga");[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-39) the procedure was systematized by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson") in 1949.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-40) Great progress was made after realizing that all infinities in quantum electrodynamics are related to two effects: the self-energy of the electron/positron, and vacuum polarization.

Renormalization requires paying very careful attention to just what is meant by, for example, the very concepts "charge" and "mass" as they occur in the pure, non-interacting field-equations. The "vacuum" is itself polarizable and, hence, populated by [virtual particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle "Virtual particle") ([on shell and off shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_shell_and_off_shell "On shell and off shell")) pairs, and, hence, is a seething and busy dynamical system in its own right. This was a critical step in identifying the source of "infinities" and "divergences". The "bare mass" and the "bare charge" of a particle, the values that appear in the free-field equations (non-interacting case), are abstractions that are simply not realized in experiment (in interaction). What we measure, and hence, what we must take account of with our equations, and what the solutions must account for, are the "renormalized mass" and the "renormalized charge" of a particle. That is to say, the "shifted" or "dressed" values these quantities must have when due systematic care is taken to include all deviations from their "bare values" is dictated by the very nature of quantum fields themselves.

Quantum electrodynamics
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Quantum electrodynamics")]

The first approach that bore fruit is known as the "interaction representation" (see the article [Interaction picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_picture "Interaction picture")), a [Lorentz-covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz-covariant "Lorentz-covariant") and [gauge-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge-invariant "Gauge-invariant") generalization of time-dependent perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum mechanics, and developed by Tomonaga and Schwinger, generalizing earlier efforts of Dirac, Fock and [Boris Podolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky "Boris Podolsky"). Tomonaga and Schwinger invented a relativistically covariant scheme for representing field commutators and field operators intermediate between the two main representations of a quantum system, the Schrödinger and the Heisenberg representations. Within this scheme, field commutators at separated points can be evaluated in terms of "bare" field creation and annihilation operators. This allows for keeping track of the time-evolution of both the "bare" and "renormalized", or perturbed, values of the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)") and expresses everything in terms of the coupled, gauge invariant "bare" field-equations. Schwinger gave the most elegant formulation of this approach. The next development was due to [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), with his rules for assigning a graph to the terms in the scattering matrix (see [S-matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix "S-matrix") and [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagrams "Feynman diagrams")). These directly corresponded (through the [Schwinger–Dyson equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger%E2%80%93Dyson_equation "Schwinger–Dyson equation")) to the measurable physical processes (cross sections, probability amplitudes, decay widths and lifetimes of excited states) one needs to be able to calculate. This revolutionized how quantum field theory calculations are carried out in practice.

Two classic text-books from the 1960s, [James D. Bjorken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Bjorken "James D. Bjorken"), [Sidney David Drell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_David_Drell "Sidney David Drell"), _Relativistic Quantum Mechanics_ (1964) and [J. J. Sakurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Sakurai "J. J. Sakurai"), _Advanced Quantum Mechanics_ (1967), thoroughly developed the Feynman graph expansion techniques using physically intuitive and practical methods following from the [correspondence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle "Correspondence principle"), without worrying about the technicalities involved in deriving the Feynman rules from the superstructure of quantum field theory itself. Although both Feynman's heuristic and pictorial style of dealing with the infinities, as well as the formal methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, worked extremely well, and gave spectacularly accurate answers, the true analytical nature of the question of "renormalizability", that is, whether ANY theory formulated as a "quantum field theory" would give finite answers, was not worked-out until much later, when the urgency of trying to formulate finite theories for the strong and electro-weak (and gravitational) interactions demanded its solution.

Renormalization in the case of QED was largely fortuitous due to the smallness of the coupling constant, the fact that the coupling has no dimensions involving mass, the so-called [fine-structure constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant "Fine-structure constant"), and also the zero-mass of the gauge boson involved, the photon, rendered the small-distance/high-energy behavior of QED manageable. Also, electromagnetic processes are very "clean" in the sense that they are not badly suppressed/damped and/or hidden by the other gauge interactions. By 1965 James D. Bjorken and Sidney David Drell observed: "Quantum electrodynamics (QED) has achieved a status of peaceful coexistence with its divergences...".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-41)

The unification of the electromagnetic force with the weak force encountered initial difficulties due to the lack of accelerator energies high enough to reveal processes beyond the [Fermi interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%27s_interaction "Fermi's interaction") range. Additionally, a satisfactory theoretical understanding of hadron substructure had to be developed, culminating in the [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model "Quark model").

Thanks to the somewhat brute-force, _ad hoc_ and heuristic early methods of Feynman, and the abstract methods of Tomonaga and Schwinger, elegantly synthesized by [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson"), from the period of early renormalization, the modern theory of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") (QED) has established itself. It is still the most accurate physical theory known, the prototype of a successful quantum field theory. Quantum electrodynamics is an example of what is known as an [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group") gauge theory. It relies on the symmetry group _U_(1) and has one massless gauge field, the _U_(1) gauge symmetry, dictating the form of the interactions involving the electromagnetic field, with the photon being the gauge boson.

In the 1950s [Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Ning_Yang "Chen Ning Yang") and [Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mills_(physicist) "Robert Mills (physicist)"), following the previous lead of [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl"), explored the impact of symmetries and invariances on field theory. All field theories, including QED, were generalized to a class of quantum field theories known as [gauge theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory"). That symmetries dictate, limit and necessitate the form of interaction between particles is the essence of the "gauge theory revolution". Yang and Mills formulated the first explicit example of a non-abelian gauge theory, [Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory"), with an attempted explanation of the [strong interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interactions "Strong interactions") in mind. The strong interactions were then (incorrectly) understood in the mid-1950s, to be mediated by the pi-mesons, the particles predicted by [Hideki Yukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa "Hideki Yukawa") in 1935,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-42) based on his profound reflections concerning the reciprocal connection between the mass of any force-mediating particle and the range of the force it mediates. This was allowed by the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"). In the absence of dynamical information, [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") pioneered the extraction of physical predictions from sheer non-abelian symmetry considerations, and introduced non-abelian Lie groups to [current algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_algebra "Current algebra") and so the gauge theories that came to supersede it.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the formulation of a gauge theory now known as the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), which systematically describes the elementary particles and the interactions between them. The strong interactions are described by [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") (QCD), based on "color" _SU_(3). The weak interactions require the additional feature of [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking "Spontaneous symmetry breaking"), elucidated by [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu "Yoichiro Nambu") and the adjunct [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism"), considered next.

Electroweak unification

The [electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction") part of the Standard Model was formulated by [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow"), [Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam "Abdus Salam"), and [John Clive Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clive_Ward "John Clive Ward") in 1959,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-44) with their discovery of the SU(2)xU(1) group structure of the theory. In 1967, [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg "Steven Weinberg") invoked the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism") for the generation of the W and Z masses[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-45) (the intermediate [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson "Vector boson") responsible for the weak interactions and neutral-currents) and keeping the mass of the photon zero. The Goldstone and Higgs idea for generating mass in gauge theories was sparked in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a number of theoreticians (including [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu "Yoichiro Nambu"), [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg "Steven Weinberg"), [Jeffrey Goldstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldstone "Jeffrey Goldstone"), [François Englert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Englert "François Englert"), [Robert Brout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brout "Robert Brout"), [G. S. Guralnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._S._Guralnik "G. S. Guralnik"), [C. R. Hagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._R._Hagen "C. R. Hagen"), [Tom Kibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kibble "Tom Kibble") and [Philip Warren Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson "Philip Warren Anderson")) noticed a possibly useful analogy to the (spontaneous) breaking of the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism in the formation of the [BCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardeen%E2%80%93Cooper%E2%80%93Schrieffer_theory "Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory") ground-state of a superconductor. The gauge boson involved in this situation, the photon, behaves as though it has acquired a finite mass.

There is a further possibility that the physical vacuum (ground-state) does not respect the symmetries implied by the "unbroken" electroweak [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory) "Lagrangian (field theory)") from which one arrives at the field equations (see the article [Electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction") for more details). The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was shown to be [renormalizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalizable "Renormalizable") (finite) and hence consistent by [Gerardus 't Hooft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_%27t_Hooft "Gerardus 't Hooft") and [Martinus Veltman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinus_Veltman "Martinus Veltman"). The Glashow–Weinberg–Salam theory (GWS theory), in certain applications, gives an accuracy on a par with quantum electrodynamics.

Quantum chromodynamics
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Quantum chromodynamics")]

In the case of the strong interactions, progress concerning their short-distance/high-energy behavior was much slower and more frustrating. For strong interactions with the electro-weak fields, there were difficult issues regarding the strength of coupling, the mass generation of the force carriers as well as their non-linear, self interactions. Although there has been theoretical progress toward a [grand unified quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_unified_theory "Grand unified theory") incorporating the electro-magnetic force, the weak force and the strong force, empirical verification is still pending. [Superunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything"), incorporating the gravitational force, is still very speculative, and is under intensive investigation by many of the best minds in contemporary theoretical physics. Gravitation is a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") description of a spin-2 gauge-boson, the "[graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton")", and is further discussed in the articles on [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity").

From the point of view of the techniques of (four-dimensional) quantum field theory, and as the numerous efforts to formulate a consistent quantum gravity theory attests, gravitational quantization has been the reigning champion for bad behavior.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-46)

There are technical problems underlain by the fact that the [Newtonian constant of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_constant_of_gravitation "Newtonian constant of gravitation") has dimensions involving inverse powers of mass, and, as a simple consequence, it is plagued by perturbatively badly behaved non-linear self-interactions. Gravity is itself a source of gravity, analogously to gauge theories (whose couplings, are, by contrast, dimensionless) leading to uncontrollable divergences at increasing orders of perturbation theory.

Moreover, gravity couples to all energy equally strongly, as per the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle"), so this makes the notion of ever really "switching-off", "cutting-off" or separating, the gravitational interaction from other interactions ambiguous, since, with gravitation, we are dealing with the very structure of space-time itself.

Moreover, it has not been established that a theory of quantum gravity is necessary (see [Quantum field theory in curved spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory_in_curved_spacetime "Quantum field theory in curved spacetime")).

Contemporary framework of renormalization
-----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_field_theory&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Contemporary framework of renormalization")]

Parallel breakthroughs in the understanding of [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition "Phase transition") in [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics") led to novel insights based on the [renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group "Renormalization group"). They involved the work of [Leo Kadanoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kadanoff "Leo Kadanoff") (1966)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-47) and [Kenneth Geddes Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Geddes_Wilson "Kenneth Geddes Wilson")–[Michael Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fisher "Michael Fisher") (1972)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-48)—extending the work of [Ernst Stueckelberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Stueckelberg "Ernst Stueckelberg")–[André Petermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Petermann "André Petermann") (1953)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-49) and [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann")–[Francis Low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_E._Low "Francis E. Low") (1954)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-50)—which led to the seminal reformulation of quantum field theory by Kenneth Geddes Wilson in 1975.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-51) This reformulation provided insights into the evolution of [effective field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theories "Effective field theories") with scale, which classified all field theories, [renormalizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalizable "Renormalizable") or not. The remarkable conclusion is that, in general, most observables are "irrelevant", i.e., the macroscopic physics is _dominated by only a few observables_ in most systems.

During the same period, Leo Kadanoff (1969)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-52) introduced an [operator algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra "Operator algebra") formalism for the two-dimensional [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model "Ising model"), a widely studied mathematical model of [ferromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") in [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics "Statistical physics"). This development suggested that quantum field theory describes its [scaling limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_limit "Scaling limit"). Later, there developed the idea that a finite number of generating [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator "Linear operator") could represent all the [correlation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_function "Correlation function") of the Ising model. The existence of a much stronger symmetry for the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical systems was suggested by [Alexander Belavin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Belavin "Alexander Belavin"), [Alexander Markovich Polyakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Markovich_Polyakov "Alexander Markovich Polyakov") and [Alexander Zamolodchikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zamolodchikov "Alexander Zamolodchikov") in 1984, which eventually led to the development of [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory "Conformal field theory"),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory#cite_note-54) a special case of quantum field theory, which is presently utilized in different areas of particle physics and condensed matter physics.

The [renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group "Renormalization group") spans a set of ideas and methods to monitor changes of the behavior of the theory with scale, providing a deep physical understanding which sparked what has been called the "grand synthesis" of theoretical physics, uniting the quantum field theoretical techniques used in particle physics and condensed matter physics into a single powerful theoretical framework.

The gauge field theory of the [strong interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"), [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics"), relies crucially on this renormalization group for its distinguishing characteristic features, [asymptotic freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom "Asymptotic freedom") and [color confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement "Color confinement").
