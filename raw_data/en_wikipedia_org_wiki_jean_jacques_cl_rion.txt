Clérion was born in either Aix-en-Provence or Trets .  For much of his career he worked on the Chateau de Versailles , including many of the famous garden sculptures, such as the "Apollo Fountain".  His admission piece to the Académie française , a 1689 bas relief of Saint James the Less , may be seen in the Louvre .  He also produced a copy of the Kallipygian Venus for Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles in 1686, and a copy of the Medici Venus which may be seen at the Château de Menars .   He died in Paris .
