There is also a generalization to infinite-dimensional spaces. Gaussian measures are named after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss . One reason why Gaussian measures are so ubiquitous in probability theory is the central limit theorem . Loosely speaking, it states that if a random variable X {\displaystyle X} is obtained by summing a large number N {\displaystyle N} of independent random variables with variance 1, then X {\displaystyle X} has variance N {\displaystyle N} and its law is approximately Gaussian.

Definitions [ edit ] Let n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in N} and let B 0 ( R n ) {\displaystyle B_{0}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})} denote the completion of the Borel σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Let λ λ n : B 0 ( R n ) → → [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \lambda ^{n}:B_{0}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})\to [0,+\infty ]} denote the usual n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Lebesgue measure . Then the standard Gaussian measure γ γ n : B 0 ( R n ) → → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}:B_{0}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})\to [0,1]} is defined by γ γ n ( A ) = 1 2 π π n ∫ ∫ A exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 1 2 ‖ x ‖ R n 2 ) d λ λ n ( x ) {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}(A)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {2\pi }}^{n}}}\int _{A}\exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\left\|x\right\|_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}^{2}\right)\,\mathrm {d} \lambda ^{n}(x)} for any measurable set A ∈ ∈ B 0 ( R n ) {\displaystyle A\in B_{0}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})} . In terms of the Radon–Nikodym derivative , d γ γ n d λ λ n ( x ) = 1 2 π π n exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 1 2 ‖ x ‖ R n 2 ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \gamma ^{n}}{\mathrm {d} \lambda ^{n}}}(x)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {2\pi }}^{n}}}\exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\left\|x\right\|_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}^{2}\right).} More generally, the Gaussian measure with mean μ μ ∈ ∈ R n {\displaystyle \mu \in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and variance σ σ 2 > 0 {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}>0} is given by γ γ μ μ , σ σ 2 n ( A ) := 1 2 π π σ σ 2 n ∫ ∫ A exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 1 2 σ σ 2 ‖ x − − μ μ ‖ R n 2 ) d λ λ n ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \gamma _{\mu ,\sigma ^{2}}^{n}(A):={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma ^{2}}}^{n}}}\int _{A}\exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2\sigma ^{2}}}\left\|x-\mu \right\|_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}^{2}\right)\,\mathrm {d} \lambda ^{n}(x).} Gaussian measures with mean μ μ = 0 {\displaystyle \mu =0} are known as centered Gaussian measures .

The Dirac measure δ δ μ μ {\displaystyle \delta _{\mu }} is the weak limit of γ γ μ μ , σ σ 2 n {\displaystyle \gamma _{\mu ,\sigma ^{2}}^{n}} as σ σ → → 0 {\displaystyle \sigma \to 0} , and is considered to be a degenerate Gaussian measure ; in contrast, Gaussian measures with finite, non-zero variance are called non-degenerate Gaussian measures .

Properties [ edit ] The standard Gaussian measure γ γ n {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}} on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a Borel measure (in fact, as remarked above, it is defined on the completion of the Borel sigma algebra, which is a finer structure); is equivalent to Lebesgue measure: λ λ n ≪ ≪ γ γ n ≪ ≪ λ λ n {\displaystyle \lambda ^{n}\ll \gamma ^{n}\ll \lambda ^{n}} , where ≪ ≪ {\displaystyle \ll } stands for absolute continuity of measures; is supported on all of Euclidean space: supp ⁡ ⁡ ( γ γ n ) = R n {\displaystyle \operatorname {supp} (\gamma ^{n})=\mathbb {R} ^{n}} ; is a probability measure ( γ γ n ( R n ) = 1 ) {\displaystyle (\gamma ^{n}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})=1)} , and so it is locally finite ; is strictly positive : every non-empty open set has positive measure; is inner regular : for all Borel sets A {\displaystyle A} , γ γ n ( A ) = sup { γ γ n ( K ) ∣ ∣ K ⊆ ⊆ A , K is compact } , {\displaystyle \gamma ^{n}(A)=\sup\{\gamma ^{n}(K)\mid K\subseteq A,K{\text{ is compact}}\},} so Gaussian measure is a Radon measure ; is not translation - invariant , but does satisfy the relation d ( T h ) ∗ ∗ ( γ γ n ) d γ γ n ( x ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ⟨ ⟨ h , x ⟩ ⟩ R n − − 1 2 ‖ ‖ h ‖ ‖ R n 2 ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} (T_{h})_{*}(\gamma ^{n})}{\mathrm {d} \gamma ^{n}}}(x)=\exp \left(\langle h,x\rangle _{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}-{\frac {1}{2}}\|h\|_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}^{2}\right),} where the derivative on the left-hand side is the Radon–Nikodym derivative , and ( T h ) ∗ ∗ ( γ γ n ) {\displaystyle (T_{h})_{*}(\gamma ^{n})} is the push forward of standard Gaussian measure by the translation map T h : R n → → R n {\displaystyle T_{h}:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , T h ( x ) = x + h {\displaystyle T_{h}(x)=x+h} ; is the probability measure associated to a normal probability distribution : Z ∼ ∼ Normal ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ , σ σ 2 ) ⟹ ⟹ P ( Z ∈ ∈ A ) = γ γ μ μ , σ σ 2 n ( A ) .

{\displaystyle Z\sim \operatorname {Normal} (\mu ,\sigma ^{2})\implies \mathbb {P} (Z\in A)=\gamma _{\mu ,\sigma ^{2}}^{n}(A).} Infinite-dimensional spaces [ edit ] It can be shown that there is no analogue of Lebesgue measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space . Even so, it is possible to define Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional spaces, the main example being the abstract Wiener space construction. A Borel measure γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } on a separable Banach space E {\displaystyle E} is said to be a non-degenerate (centered) Gaussian measure if, for every linear functional L ∈ ∈ E ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle L\in E^{*}} except L = 0 {\displaystyle L=0} , the push-forward measure L ∗ ∗ ( γ γ ) {\displaystyle L_{*}(\gamma )} is a non-degenerate (centered) Gaussian measure on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } in the sense defined above.

For example, classical Wiener measure on the space of continuous paths is a Gaussian measure.
