He was the [Savilian Chair of Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savilian_Chair_of_Astronomy "Savilian Chair of Astronomy") at the [University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") from 1999 to September 2011.

He is an [Emeritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeritus "Emeritus") Fellow of [New College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College,_Oxford "New College, Oxford")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Silk#cite_note-2) and a [Fellow of the Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society "Fellow of the Royal Society") (elected May 1999).

He was educated at [Tottenham County School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_County_School "Tottenham County School") (1954–1960) and went on to study Mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") (1960–1963), followed by a diploma in astrophysics at the [University of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester") under the supervision of [Roger Jennison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Clifton_Jennison "Roger Clifton Jennison").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Silk#cite_note-Zierler-4) He obtained his PhD in Astronomy from [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") in 1968, under the direction of [David Layzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Layzer "David Layzer").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Silk#cite_note-Zierler-4) Silk took up his first post at [Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") in 1970, and the Chair in Astronomy in 1978. Following a career of nearly 30 years there, Silk returned to the UK in 1999 to take up the [Savilian Chair of Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Astronomy "Savilian Professor of Astronomy") at the [University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford"). He is currently Professor of Physics at the [Institut d'astrophysique de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_d%27astrophysique_de_Paris "Institut d'astrophysique de Paris"), [Université Pierre et Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_Pierre_et_Marie_Curie "Université Pierre et Marie Curie"), Homewood Professor of Physics and Astronomy at [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University") (since in 2010), and was [Professor of Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham_Professor_of_Astronomy "Gresham Professor of Astronomy") at [Gresham College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham_College "Gresham College") from 2015 to 2019.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Silk#cite_note-5)

The structure of the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation") anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping. The latter is also called collisionless or _Silk_ damping after Joseph Silk.
