A **scalar** is an element of a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") which is used to define a _[vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_space "Vector space")_. In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or generally elements of a field are called **scalars** and relate to vectors in an associated vector space through the operation of [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") (defined in the vector space), in which a vector can be multiplied by a scalar in the defined way to produce another vector.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) Generally speaking, a vector space may be defined by using any field instead of real numbers (such as [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")). Then scalars of that vector space will be elements of the associated field (such as complex numbers).

A [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") operation –not to be confused with scalar multiplication– may be defined on a vector space, allowing two vectors to be multiplied in the defined way to produce a scalar. A vector space equipped with a scalar product is called an [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space").

A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a _[vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_(mathematics\_and\_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)")_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-4) The term scalar is also sometimes used informally to mean a vector, [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), or other, usually, "compound" value that is actually reduced to a single component. Thus, for example, the product of a 1 × _n_ matrix and an _n_ × 1 matrix, which is formally a 1 × 1 matrix, is often said to be a **scalar**. The real component of a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") is also called its **scalar part**.

The term [scalar matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_matrix "Scalar matrix") is used to denote a matrix of the form _kI_ where _k_ is a scalar and _I_ is the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix").

The word _scalar_ derives from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language") word _scalaris_, an adjectival form of _scala_ (Latin for "ladder"). The first recorded usage of the word "scalar" in mathematics occurs in [François Viète](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Vi%C3%A8te "François Viète")'s _Analytic Art_ (_In artem analyticem isagoge_) (1591):[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)#cite_note-6)

Magnitudes that ascend or descend proportionally in keeping with their nature from one kind to another may be called scalar terms.(Latin: _Magnitudines quae ex genere ad genus sua vi proportionaliter adscendunt vel descendunt, vocentur Scalares._)
According to a citation in the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ the first recorded usage of the term "scalar" in English came with [W. R. Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") in 1846, referring to the real part of a quaternion:

_The algebraically real part may receive, according to the question in which it occurs, all values contained on the one scale of progression of numbers from negative to positive infinity; we shall call it therefore the scalar part._

Definitions and properties
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalar_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Definitions and properties")]

Scalars are [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers") used in linear algebra, as opposed to [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"). This image shows a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"). Its coordinates _x_ and _y_ are scalars, as is its length, but **v** is not a scalar.

### Scalars of vector spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalar_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Scalars of vector spaces")]

A [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") is defined as a set of vectors (additive [abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group")), a set of scalars ([field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")), and a scalar multiplication operation that takes a scalar _k_ and a vector **v** to form another vector _k_**v**. For example, in a [coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_space "Coordinate space"), the scalar multiplication ![Image 2: {\displaystyle k(v_{1},v_{2},\dots ,v_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61d5a29fad8cb1753b84b286c36aab1cb2a1ca71) yields ![Image 3: {\displaystyle (kv_{1},kv_{2},\dots ,kv_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0d951ba4fc19216877ba5522c1f329dc174d945). In a (linear) [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space"), _kf_ is the function _x_ ↦ _k_(_f_(_x_)).

The scalars can be taken from any field, including the [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number "Algebraic number"), real, and complex numbers, as well as [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field").

### Scalars as vector components

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalar_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Scalars as vector components")]

According to a fundamental theorem of linear algebra, every vector space has a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)"). It follows that every vector space over a field _K_ is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to the corresponding [coordinate vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector_space "Coordinate vector space") where each [coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") consists of elements of _K_ (E.g., coordinates (_a 1_, _a 2_, ..., _a n_) where _a i_ ∈ _K_ and _n_ is the dimension of the vector space in consideration.). For example, every real vector space of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)")_n_ is isomorphic to the _n_-dimensional real space **R**_n_.

### Scalars in normed vector spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalar_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Scalars in normed vector spaces")]

Alternatively, a vector space _V_ can be equipped with a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)") function that assigns to every vector **v** in _V_ a scalar ||**v**||. By definition, multiplying **v** by a scalar _k_ also multiplies its norm by |_k_|. If ||**v**|| is interpreted as the _length_ of **v**, this operation can be described as **scaling** the length of **v** by _k_. A vector space equipped with a norm is called a [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space") (or _normed linear space_).

The norm is usually defined to be an element of _V_'s scalar field _K_, which restricts the latter to fields that support the notion of sign. Moreover, if _V_ has dimension 2 or more, _K_ must be closed under square root, as well as the four arithmetic operations; thus the rational numbers **Q** are excluded, but the [surd field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_surd "Quadratic surd") is acceptable. For this reason, not every scalar product space is a normed vector space.

When the requirement that the set of scalars form a field is relaxed so that it need only form a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") (so that, for example, the division of scalars need not be defined, or the scalars need not be [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative")), the resulting more general algebraic structure is called a [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)").

In this case the "scalars" may be complicated objects. For instance, if _R_ is a ring, the vectors of the product space _R_ _n_ can be made into a module with the _n_×_n_ matrices with entries from _R_ as the scalars. Another example comes from [manifold theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), where the space of [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") forms a module over the [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") of real functions on the manifold.

### Scaling transformation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scalar_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Scaling transformation")]

The scalar multiplication of vector spaces and modules is a special case of [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)"), a kind of [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation").
