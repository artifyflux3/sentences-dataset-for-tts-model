He is a professor at Brown University , where he has taught since 1967. He is known for his research in differential geometry in three and four dimensions, for his efforts to develop methods of computer graphics in the early 1990s, and most recently for his pioneering work in methods of undergraduate education utilizing online resources.

Banchoff graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1960, receiving his B.A. in Mathematics, and received his Masters and Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1962 and 1964, where he was a student of Shiing-Shen Chern .

[ 1 ] Before going to Brown he taught at Harvard University and the University of Amsterdam .

In 1996 he received the Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics .

[ 2 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 3 ] In addition, he was a president of the Mathematical Association of America .
