Thomas Banchoff at Berkeley in 1973

**Thomas Francis Banchoff** (born April 7, 1938) is an American [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") specializing in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"). He is a professor at [Brown University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University "Brown University"), where he has taught since 1967. He is known for his research in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") in three and four dimensions, for his efforts to develop methods of [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") in the early 1990s, and most recently for his pioneering work in methods of undergraduate education utilizing online resources.

Banchoff graduated from the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame "University of Notre Dame") in 1960, receiving his B.A. in Mathematics, and received his Masters and Ph.D. from [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") in 1962 and 1964, where he was a student of [Shiing-Shen Chern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiing-Shen_Chern "Shiing-Shen Chern").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Banchoff#cite_note-1) Before going to Brown he taught at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") and the [University of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam "University of Amsterdam").

In 1996 he received the [Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_and_Franklin_Haimo_Awards_for_Distinguished_College_or_University_Teaching_of_Mathematics "Deborah and Franklin Haimo Awards for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Banchoff#cite_note-web-2)

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [American Mathematical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mathematical_Society "American Mathematical Society").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Banchoff#cite_note-3) In addition, he was a president of the [Mathematical Association of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America "Mathematical Association of America").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Banchoff#cite_note-4)
