There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past. The list given here is far from exhaustive, only containing some of the most influential, currently publishing journals in each field. As a rule of thumb, each field should be represented by fewer than ten positions, chosen by their impact factors and other ratings.

Note : there are many science magazines that are not scientific journals, including Scientific American , New Scientist , Australasian Science and others. They are not listed here.
