( January 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Medscape Type of site Health information Available in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese Owner Internet Brands URL www .medscape .com Registration Required Launched May 22, 1995 ; 30 years ago ( 1995-05-22 ) Medscape is a website providing access to medical information for clinicians and medical scientists; the organization also provides continuing education for physicians and other health professionals. It references medical journal articles, Continuing Medical Education (CME), a version of the National Library of Medicine 's MEDLINE database, medical news, and drug information (Medscape Drug Reference, or MDR). At one time Medscape published seven electronic peer reviewed journals.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Medscape launched May 22, 1995, by SCP Communications, Inc.

[ 2 ] under the direction of its CEO Peter Frishauf.

[ 3 ] The first editor of Medscape was a P.A. named Stephen Smith. In 1999, George D. Lundberg became the editor-in-chief of Medscape. For seventeen years before joining Medscape he served as editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association .

[ citation needed ] In September 1999, Medscape, Inc. went public and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol MSCP. In 2000, Medscape merged with MedicaLogic, Inc., another public company. MedicaLogic filed for bankruptcy within 18 months and sold Medscape to WebMD in December 2001. In 2008, Lundberg was terminated by WebMD. The following year the Medscape Journal of Medicine ceased publishing.

[ 4 ] In January 2013, Eric Topol was named editor-in-chief of Medscape.

[ 5 ] The same year, Lundberg returned to Medscape as editor-at-large .

[ citation needed ] In 2009, WebMD released an iOS application of Medscape, [ 6 ] followed by an Android version two years later.

[ 7 ] In 2015, WebMD launched Medscape CME & Education on iOS.

[ 8 ] In 2021, Medscape launched Medscape UK to expand their business in United Kingdom.

[ 9 ] Criticisms [ edit ] In 2016 a survey of doctors found WebMD and its sister company Medscape to have incomplete medical information lacking depth and also numerous cases of misinformation on their sites.

[ 10 ] A study of Medscape and WebMD also found both services to lack neutrality and exhibiting bias potentially based on very high payments (compared to their industry competitors) from the pharmaceutical industry.

[ 10 ] In 2012, Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, MD, Associate Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Ottawa and the medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute, wrote an article entitled "Why I Can No Longer Trust Medscape".

[ 11 ] In it he wrote that Medscape is "putting patients at risk by actively misinforming their physicians." [ 11 ] He also noted poor vetting of studies that Medscape chooses to publish as his reason for stating this.

[ 11 ] In April 2024, Medscape was strongly criticized for running educational content funded by tobacco transnational Philip Morris International (PMI), with critics saying that the tobacco industry should abstain from any involvement in medical education.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In response, Medscape said the content was fully compliant with medical education industry accreditation standards, but said it would not accept funding from any tobacco industry-affiliated organization in the future.

[ 14 ] It also withdrew from the multimillion dollar deal with PMI, which included plans to deliver 13 programs, called the "PMI Curriculum", as well as podcasts and a TV-like series.
