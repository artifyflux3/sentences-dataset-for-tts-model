[ 3 ] The Association was established in 1873 with John S. Damrell as president.

[ 1 ] It is headquartered in McLean, Virginia , United States. The President and Chair of the Board is Josh Waldo, Fire Chief, from Bozeman, Montana.

[ 4 ] The CEO and Executive Director is Rob Brown.

[ 5 ] During the late 19th century, as many U.S. cities transitioned from volunteer to paid fire departments, a confluence of factors such as major fires and communication advancements led to the establishment of IAFC. Key figures from cities like Portland, Chicago, Boston, and Baltimore gathered in 1873 in New York City to consider the creation of a national association for fire chiefs. The inaugural convention, convened in October of that year, drew 61 participants and elected Chief Engineer John S. Damrell of Boston as its first President. The organization's original name, the National Association of Fire Engineers, underscored the aim to foster idea exchange and introduce innovative firefighting machinery. By 1884, the inclusion of Canadian fire chiefs prompted a name change to the International Association of Fire Engineers, evolving into the International Association of Fire Chiefs in 1926.

IAFC's headquarters have transitioned over the years, from Baltimore to New York City's Case-Shepperd-Mann Publishing Company in the 1920s, then to Washington, D.C., in the 1970s, and eventually to McLean, VA in 1992. The IAFC's annual conference, an uninterrupted tradition since 1873 (except during World War I and II), has grown and diversified. In 1994, the conference was renamed Fire-Rescue International (FRI).

Divisions [ edit ] The association is broken into eight divisions spanning across Canada and the United States.
