As a depth, the precipitable water is measured in millimeters or inches. The term is often abbreviated as "TPW", for Total Precipitable Water.

Measurement [ edit ] There are different measurement techniques: One type of measurement is based on the measurement of the solar irradiance on two wavelengths, one in a water absorption band, and the other not. The precipitable water column is determined using the irradiances in these bands and the Beer–Lambert law .

The precipitable water can also be calculated by integration of radiosonde data ( relative humidity , pressure and temperature ) over the whole atmosphere .

Data can be viewed on a Lifted-K index. The numbers represent inches of water as mentioned above for a geographical location.

Recently, methods using the Global Positioning System have been developed.

[ 1 ] Some work has been performed to create empirical relationships between surface specific humidity and precipitable water based on localized measurements (generally a 2nd to 5th order polynomial).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] However, this method has not received widespread use in part because humidity is a local measurement and precipitable water is a total column measurement.
