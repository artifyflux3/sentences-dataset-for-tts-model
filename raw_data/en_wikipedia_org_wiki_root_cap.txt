Elongation zone The root cap (also called the calyptra ) is a small but multitasking organ that covers the very tip of every growing plant root . It shields the delicate apical meristem from mechanical damage, lubricates the root's passage through soil, and houses specialised gravity-sensing cells that guide the root's overall direction of growth.

Structure and function [ edit ] Root caps contain statocytes ( gravity-sensing cells) whose dense statoliths settle in response to gravity; if the cap is carefully removed a root loses its orientation and grows at random. The cap also secretes a layer of mucilage that reduces friction and may foster signalling with the surrounding soil microbiota .

[ 1 ] Because of its sensor cells, the organ underpins gravitropism (sometimes called geoperception), helping the root grow downwards with gravity or reorient upwards against it.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Development and turnover [ edit ] The root cap is renewed continuously. Stem-cell files on its inner face divide to generate successive layers of columella and lateral root-cap cells; as the root advances, the oldest outer layers are sloughed off so the organ maintains a steady size. In cereals and many legumes these discarded layers separate as long-lived "border cells", whereas in Arabidopsis thaliana most surface cells undergo rapid, developmentally- programmed cell death before shedding.

[ 4 ] Sensory roles and variation [ edit ] Beyond sensing gravity, the cap acts as a broader signalling hub. Asymmetric redistribution of the plant hormone auxin in its statolith-bearing cells initiates curvature that restores the root to the gravity vector; related pathways also mediate water-seeking ( hydrotropism ) and help position future lateral roots , shaping overall root-system architecture.

[ 4 ] A true root cap is absent in some parasitic plants [ 5 ] and several aquatic plants , which instead form a thin, sac-like root pocket that performs a reduced protective role.
