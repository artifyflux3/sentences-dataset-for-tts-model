That is, it formalizes the concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence, statement or idea "is true." Languages which allow a truth predicate [ edit ] Based on "Chomsky Definition", a language is assumed to be a countable set of sentences, each of finite length, and constructed out of a countable set of symbols. A theory of syntax is assumed to introduce symbols, and rules to construct well-formed sentences. A language is called fully interpreted if meanings are attached to its sentences so that they all are either true or false.

A fully interpreted language L which does not have a truth predicate can be extended to a fully interpreted language Ľ that contains a truth predicate T , i.e., the sentence A ↔ T (⌈ A ⌉) is true for every sentence A of Ľ , where T (⌈ A ⌉) stands for "the sentence (denoted by) A is true". The main tools to prove this result are ordinary and transfinite induction , recursion methods, and ZF set theory (cf.

[ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ).
