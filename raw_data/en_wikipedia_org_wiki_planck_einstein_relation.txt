{\displaystyle E=h\nu .} The constant of proportionality , h , is known as the Planck constant . Several equivalent forms of the relation exist, including in terms of angular frequency ω : E = ℏ ℏ ω ω , {\displaystyle E=\hbar \omega ,} where ℏ ℏ = h / 2 π π {\displaystyle \hbar =h/2\pi } .  Written using the symbol f for frequency, the relation is E = h f .

{\displaystyle E=hf.} The relation accounts for the quantized nature of light and plays a key role in understanding phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and black-body radiation (where the related Planck postulate can be used to derive Planck's law ).

Spectral forms [ edit ] Light can be characterized using several spectral quantities, such as frequency ν , wavelength λ , wavenumber ν ν ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\nu }}} , and their angular equivalents ( angular frequency ω , angular wavelength y , and angular wavenumber k ). These quantities are related through ν ν = c λ λ = c ν ν ~ ~ = ω ω 2 π π = c 2 π π y = c k 2 π π , {\displaystyle \nu ={\frac {c}{\lambda }}=c{\tilde {\nu }}={\frac {\omega }{2\pi }}={\frac {c}{2\pi y}}={\frac {ck}{2\pi }},} so the Planck relation can take the following "standard" forms: E = h ν ν = h c λ λ = h c ν ν ~ ~ , {\displaystyle E=h\nu ={\frac {hc}{\lambda }}=hc{\tilde {\nu }},} as well as the following "angular" forms: E = ℏ ℏ ω ω = ℏ ℏ c y = ℏ ℏ c k .

{\displaystyle E=\hbar \omega ={\frac {\hbar c}{y}}=\hbar ck.} The standard forms make use of the Planck constant h . The angular forms make use of the reduced Planck constant ħ = ⁠ h / 2π ⁠ . Here c is the speed of light .

de Broglie relation [ edit ] See also: Matter wave § de Broglie relations The de Broglie relation, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] also known as de Broglie's momentum–wavelength relation, [ 4 ] generalizes the Planck relation to matter waves .

Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature , the relation E = hν would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to λ = ⁠ h / p ⁠ . Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to p = h ν ν ~ ~ {\displaystyle p=h{\tilde {\nu }}} or p = ℏ ℏ k .

{\displaystyle p=\hbar k.} The de Broglie relation is also often encountered in vector form p = ℏ ℏ k , {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\hbar \mathbf {k} ,} where p is the momentum vector, and k is the angular wave vector .

Bohr's frequency condition [ edit ] Bohr's frequency condition [ 13 ] states that the frequency of a photon absorbed or emitted during an electronic transition is related to the energy difference ( Δ E ) between the two energy levels involved in the transition: [ 14 ] Δ Δ E = h ν ν .

{\displaystyle \Delta E=h\nu .} This is a direct consequence of the Planck–Einstein relation.
