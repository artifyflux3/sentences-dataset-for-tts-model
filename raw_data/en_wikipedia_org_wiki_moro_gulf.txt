Sagun Zamboanga City The Moro Gulf is the largest gulf in the Philippines . It is located off the coast of Mindanao Island , and is part of the Celebes Sea . The gulf is one of the country's tuna fishing grounds.

[ 1 ] Geography [ edit ] The gulf stretches between and is surrounded by the main section of Mindanao on the east, and the Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao on the west. The peninsula's major drainage goes towards the gulf.

[ 2 ] Sibuguey Bay and Illana Bay are its major bays.

Zamboanga City , which is an international port, is bound by the Gulf and Celebes Sea in the East.

[ 3 ] Polloc, on Parang, Maguindanao del Norte , at the eastern coast, is another major port.

( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Moro Gulf is also an area of significant tectonic activity with several fault zones in the region capable of producing major earthquakes and destructive local tsunamis, such as the devastating 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake which killed over 5,000 people and left over 90,000 people homeless as it hit the west coast of Mindanao .

Moro Gulf 1918 1976 2002 class=notpageimage| The two largest 20th century Philippine earthquakes: the 1918 Celebes Sea earthquake (8.3 M w ) and the 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake (8.0 M w ). The relatively large 2002 Mindanao earthquake (7.5 M w ) also occurred in the area. The Moro Gulf, part of the Celebes Sea , is labeled for context.
