[ 1 ] Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard , the creator of Christian existentialism , which inspired the philosophical movement of Existentialism . Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including Harald Høffding , who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism . Among Kierkegaard's other followers include Jean-Paul Sartre who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and Rollo May , who helped create humanistic psychology . Danish philosophy was also strongly influenced by French hermeneutics philosopher Paul Ricœur .
