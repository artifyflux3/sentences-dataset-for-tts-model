It is fed by the Brazil Current , and the fraction of it which reaches the African coast feeds the Benguela Current . Its surface velocity is about 0.2 m/s and its average volume transport is about 30 Sverdrups , both being higher in the western portion and decreasing to the east.

[ 1 ] It is continuous with the northern edge of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The SAC and ACC are distinguished by the subtropical front , a boundary at approximately 40°S where sea surface temperature and salinity decrease sharply from north to south.

[ 1 ] The seafaring is usually easier and thus safer in area of the South Atlantic Current than in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, though also slower.
