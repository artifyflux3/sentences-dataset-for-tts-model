[ 1 ] Existence [ edit ] If the intended model is infinite and the language is first-order , then the Löwenheim–Skolem theorems guarantee the existence of non-standard models. The non-standard models can be chosen as elementary extensions or elementary substructures of the intended model.

Importance [ edit ] Non-standard models are studied in set theory , non-standard analysis and non-standard models of arithmetic .
