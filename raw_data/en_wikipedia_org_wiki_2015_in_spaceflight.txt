A total of 87 orbital launches were attempted in 2015, of which 82 were successful, one was partially successful and four were failures. The year also saw seven EVAs by ISS astronauts. The majority of the year's orbital launches were conducted by Russia , the United States and China , with 27, 20 and 19 launches respectively.

Overview [ edit ] In February 2015, the European Space Agency's experimental lifting body spacecraft, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle , successfully conducted its first test flight.

In March 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to be visited by a spacecraft when Dawn entered orbit. In July 2015, New Horizons visited the Pluto - Charon system after a 9-year voyage, returning a trove of pictures and information about the former "ninth planet" (now classified as a dwarf planet). Meanwhile, the MESSENGER probe was deliberately crashed into Mercury after 4 years of in-orbit observations.

On 23 November 2015, the Blue Origin New Shepard suborbital rocket achieved its first powered soft landing near the launch site, paving the way for full reuse of its propulsion stage. On 21 December, the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 Full Thrust took place, ending with a successful landing of its first stage.

Two old weather satellites , NOAA-16 and DMSP 5D-2/F13 , broke up in 2015, creating several hundred pieces of space debris . In both cases, a battery explosion is suspected as the root cause.

[ 72 ] Space debris events [ edit ] Date/Time (UTC) Source object Event type Pieces tracked Remarks 3 February 17:40 [ 73 ] DMSP 5D-2/F13 (USA-109) Satellite breakup 159 [ 74 ] The breakup was most likely caused by a battery explosion.

[ 73 ] [ 75 ] This satellite had been launched in 1995 . Another satellite from the same series, DMSP 5D-2/F11 , had broken up in 2004.

[ 73 ] Debris are expected to remain in orbit for decades.

[ 76 ] 25 November 7:20 [ 77 ] NOAA-16 Satellite breakup 275 [ 78 ] As this weather satellite, launched in 2000 , had a similar construction to the DMSP satellite which broke up in February 2015, the same cause is suspected (battery overheating and explosion).

[ 79 ] 22 December 16:00 [ 80 ] Briz-M upper stage Booster explosion 9 [ 80 ] A Briz-M upper-stage booster, having subsisted in geosynchronous transfer orbit since launching the Canadian Nimiq 6 commsat in 2012 , was seen to have broken up into 9 pieces as of 26 January 2016. Orbital analysis of the debris allowed to time the explosion within one minute of 16:00 UTC on 22 December 2015.

[ 80 ] Three other Briz-M upper stages had exploded earlier in 2007, 2010 and 2012.

[ 81 ] Orbital launch statistics [ edit ] By country [ edit ] For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket , not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket.
