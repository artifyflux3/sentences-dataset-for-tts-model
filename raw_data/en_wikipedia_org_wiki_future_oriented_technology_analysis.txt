Future-oriented technology analysis (FTA) is a collective term from futures studies for analyzing future technology and its consequences.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It includes technology intelligence, technology forecasting , technology roadmapping , technology assessment , and technology foresight .

Technology Futures Analysis or Technology Future Analysis (TFA) is a synonym.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Future-oriented technology analysis shares common methods with horizon scanning .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Definitions [ edit ] Year Definition 2004 Technology futures analysis is "any process to produce judgments about emerging technology characteristics, development pathways, and potential impacts of a technology in the future. ... [TFA] encompasses the broad technology foresight and assessment studies of the public sector and the technology forecasting and intelligence studies in private industry." [ 6 ] 2013 Future-oriented technology analysis is "an umbrella term to denote several decision-preparatory tools - (technology) foresight, forecasting and technology assessment - and thus it is not a discipline with solid, widely accepted theoretical foundations."
