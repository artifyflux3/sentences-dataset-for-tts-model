Practiced among book groups, friends and colleagues at work, it provides an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books and obtain a new book to read without having to pay.  Because swaps occur between individuals, without central distribution or warehousing, and without the copyright owner making a profit, the practice has been compared to peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as BitTorrent [ 1 ] —except that hard-copy original analog objects are exchanged.

College book exchange programs Many colleges and universities have developed online book exchange programs to help students save money on textbooks .

[ 2 ] Some colleges build their own systems and others use systems from third party service providers.

Informal book exchanges Juxtaposition of a "closed" and "open" outdoor book exchange in a park, Warsaw , Poland Some book exchanges are informal – a shelf or box is provided where books can be left or picked up. The exchange relies on users leaving and taking books and is generally not supervised.

This is a frequent practice in youth hostels where travellers can leave a book and take a different book with them. Some railway stations in Great Britain have informal book exchanges and one has also been set up in a phone box in Kington Magna .
