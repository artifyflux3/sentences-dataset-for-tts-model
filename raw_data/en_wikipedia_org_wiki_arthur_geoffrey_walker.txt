Although he was an accomplished geometer , he is best remembered today for two important contributions to general relativity , namely, the Robertson-Walker metric and the Fermi–Walker transport .

Early life [ edit ] He was born in Watford on 17 July 1909 the son of Arthur John Walker (b.1879), a coach builder, and his wife, Eleanor Joanna Gosling.

[ 2 ] Walker attended Watford Grammar School for Boys and won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford , where he graduated with first class honours in Mathematics.

[ 3 ] He then studied at Merton College, Oxford . He then went as a postgraduate to University of Edinburgh , studying for his doctorate (PhD) under Professor Edmund Taylor Whittaker . Professor Arthur Stanley Eddington was his external examiner.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] His exposure to differential geometry, general relativity, and cosmology created the background for his future work.

[ 1 ] Academic career [ edit ] Luther Pfahler Eisenhart 's 1926 text, Riemannian Geometry , proved to a great influence on Walker, who referred to it as his "Bible" and cited it in many of his papers.

[ 1 ] The notion of parallel transport was introduced by Tullio Levi-Civita and again by Enrico Fermi , who also applied it to world lines in spacetime. In 1932, Walker developed this idea further, creating the technique of parallel transport for a tensor . The Fermi-Walker transport is now of common use in general relativity.

[ 1 ] Walker took up a post as Lecturer at Imperial College in 1935; the following year he was appointed as Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of Liverpool , a post he held until 1947, when he moved to the University of Sheffield as Professor of Pure Mathematics.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 1935, Walker and Robertson demonstrated that the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models previously constructed by Georges Lemaître and Alexander Friedmann all shared the same general form, the Robertson-Walker metric. They also showed that this was the most general model possible that featured isotropy and homogeneity (see the Copernican principle ).

[ 1 ] During the mid 1930s, he collaborated with the Department of Mechanical Engineering on problems involving tidal flow.

[ 1 ] In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh . His proposers were Harold Stanley Ruse , Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, David Gibb and William Edge . He won the Society's Keith Medal for the period 1947/49.

[ 4 ] In 1952 he returned to Liverpool University, in 1962 becoming Dean of its Faculty of Science.

[ 3 ] Having been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, he served as a member of the organisation's council from 1961 to 1962.

[ 3 ] He served as president of the London Mathematical Society from 1962 to 1963.

[ 4 ] Walker retired from Liverpool University in 1974.

[ 2 ] He died in Chichester on 31 March 2001, aged 91.
