It does so by representing the relation as the graph of a function . There may not be a single function whose graph can represent the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the domain of the relation. The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.

More precisely, given a system of m equations f i ( x 1 , ..., x n , y 1 , ..., y m ) = 0, i = 1, ..., m (often abbreviated into F ( x , y ) = 0 ), the theorem states that, under a mild condition on the partial derivatives (with respect to each y i ) at a point, the m variables y i are differentiable functions of the x j in some neighborhood of the point. As these functions generally cannot be expressed in closed form , they are implicitly defined by the equations, and this motivated the name of the theorem.

[ 1 ] In other words, under a mild condition on the partial derivatives, the set of zeros of a system of equations is locally the graph of a function .

History [ edit ] Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) is credited with the first rigorous form of the implicit function theorem.

Ulisse Dini (1845–1918) generalized the real-variable version of the implicit function theorem to the context of functions of any number of real variables.

[ 2 ] Two variables case [ edit ] Let f : R 2 → → R {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{2}\to \mathbb {R} } be a continuously differentiable function defining the implicit equation of a curve f ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=0} . Let ( x 0 , y 0 ) {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})} be a point on the curve, that is, a point such that f ( x 0 , y 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x_{0},y_{0})=0} . In this simple case, the implicit function theorem can be stated as follows: Theorem — If ⁠ f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)} ⁠ is a function that is continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of the point ⁠ ( x 0 , y 0 ) {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})} ⁠ , and ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( x 0 , y 0 ) ≠ ≠ 0 , {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})\neq 0,} then there exists a unique differentiable function ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ such that ⁠ y 0 = φ φ ( x 0 ) {\displaystyle y_{0}=\varphi (x_{0})} ⁠ and ⁠ f ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,\varphi (x))=0} ⁠ in a neighbourhood of ⁠ x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} ⁠ .

Proof.

By differentiating the equation ⁠ f ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,\varphi (x))=0} ⁠ , one gets ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) + φ φ ′ ( x ) ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x,\varphi (x))+\varphi '(x)\,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x,\varphi (x))=0.} and thus φ φ ′ ( x ) = − − ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( x , φ φ ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi '(x)=-{\frac {{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x,\varphi (x))}{{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x,\varphi (x))}}.} This gives an ordinary differential equation for ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ , with the initial condition ⁠ φ φ ( x 0 ) = y 0 {\displaystyle \varphi (x_{0})=y_{0}} ⁠ .

Since ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( x 0 , y 0 ) ≠ ≠ 0 , {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})\neq 0,} the right-hand side of the differential equation is continuous. Hence, the Peano existence theorem applies so there is a (possibly non-unique) solution. To see why φ φ {\textstyle \varphi } is unique, note that the function g x ( y ) = f ( x , y ) {\textstyle g_{x}(y)=f(x,y)} is strictly monotone in a neighborhood of x 0 , y 0 {\textstyle x_{0},y_{0}} (as ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( x 0 , y 0 ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})\neq 0} ), thus it is injective . If φ φ , ϕ ϕ {\textstyle \varphi ,\phi } are solutions to the differential equation, then g x ( φ φ ( x ) ) = g x ( ϕ ϕ ( x ) ) = 0 {\textstyle g_{x}(\varphi (x))=g_{x}(\phi (x))=0} and by injectivity we get, φ φ ( x ) = ϕ ϕ ( x ) {\textstyle \varphi (x)=\phi (x)} .

First example [ edit ] The unit circle of implicit equation x 2 + y 2 – 1 = 0 cannot be represented as the graph of a function. Around the point A where the tangent is not vertical, the bolded circular arc is the graph of some function of x , while around B , there is no function of x with the circle as its graph.

This is exactly what the implicit function theorem asserts in this case.

If we define the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 , then the equation f ( x , y ) = 1 cuts out the unit circle as the level set {( x , y ) | f ( x , y ) = 1} . There is no way to represent the unit circle as the graph of a function of one variable y = g ( x ) because for each choice of x ∈ (−1, 1) , there are two choices of y , namely ± ± 1 − − x 2 {\displaystyle \pm {\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}} .

However, it is possible to represent part of the circle as the graph of a function of one variable. If we let g 1 ( x ) = 1 − − x 2 {\displaystyle g_{1}(x)={\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}} for −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 , then the graph of y = g 1 ( x ) provides the upper half of the circle. Similarly, if g 2 ( x ) = − − 1 − − x 2 {\displaystyle g_{2}(x)=-{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}} , then the graph of y = g 2 ( x ) gives the lower half of the circle.

The purpose of the implicit function theorem is to tell us that functions like g 1 ( x ) and g 2 ( x ) almost always exist, even in situations where we cannot write down explicit formulas. It guarantees that g 1 ( x ) and g 2 ( x ) are differentiable, and it even works in situations where we do not have a formula for f ( x , y ) .

Definitions [ edit ] Let f : R n + m → → R m {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n+m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} be a continuously differentiable function. We think of R n + m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+m}} as the Cartesian product R n × × R m , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{m},} and we write a point of this product as ( x , y ) = ( x 1 , … … , x n , y 1 , … … y m ) .

{\displaystyle (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} )=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n},y_{1},\ldots y_{m}).} Starting from the given function f {\displaystyle f} , our goal is to construct a function g : R n → → R m {\displaystyle g:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} whose graph ( x , g ( x ) ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {x}},g({\textbf {x}}))} is precisely the set of all ( x , y ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {x}},{\textbf {y}})} such that f ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle f({\textbf {x}},{\textbf {y}})={\textbf {0}}} .

As noted above, this may not always be possible. We will therefore fix a point ( a , b ) = ( a 1 , … … , a n , b 1 , … … , b m ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})=(a_{1},\dots ,a_{n},b_{1},\dots ,b_{m})} which satisfies f ( a , b ) = 0 {\displaystyle f({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})={\textbf {0}}} , and we will ask for a g {\displaystyle g} that works near the point ( a , b ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})} . In other words, we want an open set U ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} containing a {\displaystyle {\textbf {a}}} , an open set V ⊂ ⊂ R m {\displaystyle V\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} containing b {\displaystyle {\textbf {b}}} , and a function g : U → → V {\displaystyle g:U\to V} such that the graph of g {\displaystyle g} satisfies the relation f = 0 {\displaystyle f={\textbf {0}}} on U × × V {\displaystyle U\times V} , and that no other points within U × × V {\displaystyle U\times V} do so. In symbols, { ( x , g ( x ) ) ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ U } = { ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ U × × V ∣ ∣ f ( x , y ) = 0 } .

{\displaystyle \{(\mathbf {x} ,g(\mathbf {x} ))\mid \mathbf {x} \in U\}=\{(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} )\in U\times V\mid f(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} )=\mathbf {0} \}.} To state the implicit function theorem, we need the Jacobian matrix of f {\displaystyle f} , which is the matrix of the partial derivatives of f {\displaystyle f} . Abbreviating ( a 1 , … … , a n , b 1 , … … , b m ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},\dots ,a_{n},b_{1},\dots ,b_{m})} to ( a , b ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})} , the Jacobian matrix is ( D f ) ( a , b ) = [ ∂ ∂ f 1 ∂ ∂ x 1 ( a , b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ f 1 ∂ ∂ x n ( a , b ) ∂ ∂ f 1 ∂ ∂ y 1 ( a , b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ f 1 ∂ ∂ y m ( a , b ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ∂ ∂ f m ∂ ∂ x 1 ( a , b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ f m ∂ ∂ x n ( a , b ) ∂ ∂ f m ∂ ∂ y 1 ( a , b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ f m ∂ ∂ y m ( a , b ) ] = [ X Y ] {\displaystyle (Df)(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )=\left[{\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}{\frac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&\cdots &{\frac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{n}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&{\frac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial y_{1}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&\cdots &{\frac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial y_{m}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )\\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\{\frac {\partial f_{m}}{\partial x_{1}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&\cdots &{\frac {\partial f_{m}}{\partial x_{n}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&{\frac {\partial f_{m}}{\partial y_{1}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )&\cdots &{\frac {\partial f_{m}}{\partial y_{m}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )\end{array}}\right]=\left[{\begin{array}{c|c}X&Y\end{array}}\right]} where X {\displaystyle X} is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} and Y {\displaystyle Y} is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables y j {\displaystyle y_{j}} . The implicit function theorem says that if Y {\displaystyle Y} is an invertible matrix, then there are U {\displaystyle U} , V {\displaystyle V} , and g {\displaystyle g} as desired. Writing all the hypotheses together gives the following statement.

Statement of the theorem [ edit ] Let f : R n + m → → R m {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n+m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} be a continuously differentiable function , and let R n + m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+m}} have coordinates ( x , y ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {x}},{\textbf {y}})} . Fix a point ( a , b ) = ( a 1 , … … , a n , b 1 , … … , b m ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})=(a_{1},\dots ,a_{n},b_{1},\dots ,b_{m})} with f ( a , b ) = 0 {\displaystyle f({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})=\mathbf {0} } , where 0 ∈ ∈ R m {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} \in \mathbb {R} ^{m}} is the zero vector. If the Jacobian matrix (this is the right-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section): J f , y ( a , b ) = [ ∂ ∂ f i ∂ ∂ y j ( a , b ) ] {\displaystyle J_{f,\mathbf {y} }(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )=\left[{\frac {\partial f_{i}}{\partial y_{j}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )\right]} is invertible , then there exists an open set U ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} containing a {\displaystyle {\textbf {a}}} such that there exists a unique function g : U → → R m {\displaystyle g:U\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} such that g ( a ) = b {\displaystyle g(\mathbf {a} )=\mathbf {b} } , and f ( x , g ( x ) ) = 0 for all x ∈ ∈ U {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} ,g(\mathbf {x} ))=\mathbf {0} ~{\text{for all}}~\mathbf {x} \in U} .

Moreover, g {\displaystyle g} is continuously differentiable and, denoting the left-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section as: J f , x ( a , b ) = [ ∂ ∂ f i ∂ ∂ x j ( a , b ) ] , {\displaystyle J_{f,\mathbf {x} }(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )=\left[{\frac {\partial f_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}(\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {b} )\right],} the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of g {\displaystyle g} in U {\displaystyle U} is given by the matrix product : [ 3 ] [ ∂ ∂ g i ∂ ∂ x j ( x ) ] m × × n = − − [ J f , y ( x , g ( x ) ) ] m × × m − − 1 [ J f , x ( x , g ( x ) ) ] m × × n {\displaystyle \left[{\frac {\partial g_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}(\mathbf {x} )\right]_{m\times n}=-\left[J_{f,\mathbf {y} }(\mathbf {x} ,g(\mathbf {x} ))\right]_{m\times m}^{-1}\,\left[J_{f,\mathbf {x} }(\mathbf {x} ,g(\mathbf {x} ))\right]_{m\times n}} For a proof, see Inverse function theorem#Implicit_function_theorem . Here, the two-dimensional case is detailed.

Higher derivatives [ edit ] If, moreover, f {\displaystyle f} is analytic or continuously differentiable k {\displaystyle k} times in a neighborhood of ( a , b ) {\displaystyle ({\textbf {a}},{\textbf {b}})} , then one may choose U {\displaystyle U} in order that the same holds true for g {\displaystyle g} inside U {\displaystyle U} .

[ 4 ] In the analytic case, this is called the analytic implicit function theorem .

The circle example [ edit ] Let us go back to the example of the unit circle . In this case n = m = 1 and f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}-1} . The matrix of partial derivatives is just a 1 × 2 matrix, given by ( D f ) ( a , b ) = [ ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x ( a , b ) ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ( a , b ) ] = [ 2 a 2 b ] {\displaystyle (Df)(a,b)={\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(a,b)&{\dfrac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(a,b)\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}2a&2b\end{bmatrix}}} Thus, here, the Y in the statement of the theorem is just the number 2 b ; the linear map defined by it is invertible if and only if b ≠ 0 . By the implicit function theorem we see that we can locally write the circle in the form y = g ( x ) for all points where y ≠ 0 . For (±1, 0) we run into trouble, as noted before. The implicit function theorem may still be applied to these two points, by writing x as a function of y , that is, x = h ( y ) {\displaystyle x=h(y)} ; now the graph of the function will be ( h ( y ) , y ) {\displaystyle \left(h(y),y\right)} , since where b = 0 we have a = 1 , and the conditions to locally express the function in this form are satisfied.

The implicit derivative of y with respect to x , and that of x with respect to y , can be found by totally differentiating the implicit function x 2 + y 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1} and equating to 0: 2 x d x + 2 y d y = 0 , {\displaystyle 2x\,dx+2y\,dy=0,} giving d y d x = − − x y {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\frac {x}{y}}} and d x d y = − − y x .

{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dy}}=-{\frac {y}{x}}.} Application: change of coordinates [ edit ] Suppose we have an m -dimensional space, parametrised by a set of coordinates ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} . We can introduce a new coordinate system ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ ) {\displaystyle (x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m})} by supplying m functions h 1 … … h m {\displaystyle h_{1}\ldots h_{m}} each being continuously differentiable. These functions allow us to calculate the new coordinates ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ ) {\displaystyle (x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m})} of a point, given the point's old coordinates ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} using x 1 ′ = h 1 ( x 1 , … … , x m ) , … … , x m ′ = h m ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle x'_{1}=h_{1}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m}),\ldots ,x'_{m}=h_{m}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} . One might want to verify if the opposite is possible: given coordinates ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ ) {\displaystyle (x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m})} , can we 'go back' and calculate the same point's original coordinates ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} ? The implicit function theorem will provide an answer to this question. The (new and old) coordinates ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ , x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle (x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} are related by f = 0, with f ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ , x 1 , … … , x m ) = ( h 1 ( x 1 , … … , x m ) − − x 1 ′ , … … , h m ( x 1 , … … , x m ) − − x m ′ ) .

{\displaystyle f(x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})=(h_{1}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})-x'_{1},\ldots ,h_{m}(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})-x'_{m}).} Now the Jacobian matrix of f at a certain point ( a , b ) [ where a = ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ ) , b = ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle a=(x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m}),b=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} ] is given by ( D f ) ( a , b ) = [ − − 1 ⋯ ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ 0 ⋯ ⋯ − − 1 | ∂ ∂ h 1 ∂ ∂ x 1 ( b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ h 1 ∂ ∂ x m ( b ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ∂ ∂ h m ∂ ∂ x 1 ( b ) ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ h m ∂ ∂ x m ( b ) ] = [ − − I m | J ] .

{\displaystyle (Df)(a,b)=\left[{\begin{matrix}-1&\cdots &0\\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\0&\cdots &-1\end{matrix}}\left|{\begin{matrix}{\frac {\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}}(b)&\cdots &{\frac {\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{m}}}(b)\\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\{\frac {\partial h_{m}}{\partial x_{1}}}(b)&\cdots &{\frac {\partial h_{m}}{\partial x_{m}}}(b)\\\end{matrix}}\right.\right]=[-I_{m}|J].} where I m denotes the m × m identity matrix , and J is the m × m matrix of partial derivatives, evaluated at ( a , b ). (In the above, these blocks were denoted by X and Y. As it happens, in this particular application of the theorem, neither matrix depends on a .) The implicit function theorem now states that we can locally express ( x 1 , … … , x m ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m})} as a function of ( x 1 ′ , … … , x m ′ ) {\displaystyle (x'_{1},\ldots ,x'_{m})} if J is invertible. Demanding J is invertible is equivalent to det J ≠ 0, thus we see that we can go back from the primed to the unprimed coordinates if the determinant of the Jacobian J is non-zero. This statement is also known as the inverse function theorem .

Example: polar coordinates [ edit ] As a simple application of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by polar coordinates ( R , θ ) . We can go to a new coordinate system ( cartesian coordinates ) by defining functions x ( R , θ ) = R cos( θ ) and y ( R , θ ) = R sin( θ ) . This makes it possible given any point ( R , θ ) to find corresponding Cartesian coordinates ( x , y ) . When can we go back and convert Cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have det J ≠ 0 , with J = [ ∂ ∂ x ( R , θ θ ) ∂ ∂ R ∂ ∂ x ( R , θ θ ) ∂ ∂ θ θ ∂ ∂ y ( R , θ θ ) ∂ ∂ R ∂ ∂ y ( R , θ θ ) ∂ ∂ θ θ ] = [ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ − − R sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ R cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ] .

{\displaystyle J={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial x(R,\theta )}{\partial R}}&{\frac {\partial x(R,\theta )}{\partial \theta }}\\{\frac {\partial y(R,\theta )}{\partial R}}&{\frac {\partial y(R,\theta )}{\partial \theta }}\\\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-R\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &R\cos \theta \end{bmatrix}}.} Since det J = R , conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if R ≠ 0 . So it remains to check the case R = 0 . It is easy to see that in case R = 0 , our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.

Generalizations [ edit ] Banach space version [ edit ] Based on the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces , it is possible to extend the implicit function theorem to Banach space valued mappings.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Let X , Y , Z be Banach spaces . Let the mapping f : X × Y → Z be continuously Fréchet differentiable . If ( x 0 , y 0 ) ∈ ∈ X × × Y {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})\in X\times Y} , f ( x 0 , y 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x_{0},y_{0})=0} , and y ↦ ↦ D f ( x 0 , y 0 ) ( 0 , y ) {\displaystyle y\mapsto Df(x_{0},y_{0})(0,y)} is a Banach space isomorphism from Y onto Z , then there exist neighbourhoods U of x 0 and V of y 0 and a Fréchet differentiable function g : U → V such that f ( x , g ( x )) = 0 and f ( x , y ) = 0 if and only if y = g ( x ), for all ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ U × × V {\displaystyle (x,y)\in U\times V} .

Implicit functions from non-differentiable functions [ edit ] Various forms of the implicit function theorem exist for the case when the function f is not differentiable. It is standard that local strict monotonicity suffices in one dimension.

[ 7 ] The following more general form was proven by Kumagai based on an observation by Jittorntrum.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Consider a continuous function f : R n × × R m → → R n {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} such that f ( x 0 , y 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x_{0},y_{0})=0} . If there exist open neighbourhoods A ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle A\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and B ⊂ ⊂ R m {\displaystyle B\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} of x 0 and y 0 , respectively, such that, for all y in B , f ( ⋅ ⋅ , y ) : A → → R n {\displaystyle f(\cdot ,y):A\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is locally one-to-one, then there exist open neighbourhoods A 0 ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle A_{0}\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and B 0 ⊂ ⊂ R m {\displaystyle B_{0}\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} of x 0 and y 0 , such that, for all y ∈ ∈ B 0 {\displaystyle y\in B_{0}} , the equation f ( x , y ) = 0 has a unique solution x = g ( y ) ∈ ∈ A 0 , {\displaystyle x=g(y)\in A_{0},} where g is a continuous function from B 0 into A 0 .

Collapsing manifolds [ edit ] Perelman’s collapsing theorem for 3-manifolds , the capstone of his proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture , can be understood as an extension of the implicit function theorem.

[ 10 ] See also [ edit ] Inverse function theorem Constant rank theorem : Both the implicit function theorem and the inverse function theorem can be seen as special cases of the constant rank theorem.
