Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Find sources: "Macronucleus" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A macronucleus (formerly also meganucleus) is the larger type of nucleus in ciliates . Macronuclei are polyploid and undergo direct division without mitosis . It controls the non-reproductive cell functions, such as metabolism . During conjugation, the macronucleus disintegrates, and a new one is formed by karyogamy of the micronuclei .

Macronuclei contain hundreds to thousands of chromosomes, each present in many copies.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] There is no mechanism to precisely partition this complex genome equally during nuclear division; thus, how the cell manages to maintain a balanced genome after generations of divisions is unknown.
