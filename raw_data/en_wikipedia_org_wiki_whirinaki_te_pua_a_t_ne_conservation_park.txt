The park is centered on the town of Minginui and part of the eastern boundary flanks Te Urewera . The Whirinaki Forest is one of the world's last prehistoric rainforests.

[ 1 ] The Department of Conservation is responsible for administering the 562 km 2 (217 sq mi) [ 2 ] park jointly with the local iwi, Ngāti Whare .

Tramping is a popular recreation in the park and there is a network of 175 km of tracks and 9 huts that are used for this purpose.

[ 3 ] Mangamate Hut, one of the backcountry huts in the park The unsealed River Road provides access to a carpark and the starting point of many walks.  Short walks lead through native bush to Waiatiu Falls , Arohaki Lagoon , Te Whaiti-Nui-A-Toi Canyon, and Whirinaki Falls , respectively.  The rain-fed Arohaki Lagoon is often alive with Southern Bell Frogs.  Longer tramping tracks connect several huts and two other access roads.

The forests were a focus of protests over logging in the 1970s and 80s. Large parts of the park remain covered in native podocarp forest featuring rimu , tōtara , kahikatea , mataī ( Prumnopitys taxifolia ), and miro.  Some higher parts contain beech forest.  The forest supports a wide range of birds, some of which are endangered.

Whirinaki is the location of Nga Hua a Tane, a radical place based [ further explanation needed ] research program on rainforests and the ecosystem services they provide to support life on our planet, led by the local school, Te Kura Toitu o Te Whaiti Nui-a-Toi and its community.

[ citation needed ] In 2010, a co-governance agreement was signed with Ngati Whare as part of a treaty settlement . As part of the settlement, the New Zealand government apologised for past injustices and acknowledged the park was integral to Ngati Whare's cultural identity and wellbeing. The settlement provided for a joint Ngati Whare and Crown regeneration project, which aimed to regenerate 640ha of exotic pine adjacent to the park back to the indigenous podocarp forest, with David Bellamy as a patron. The park's name was changed from Whirinaki Forest Park to Whirinaki Te Pua-a-Tāne Conservation Park. Whirinaki Te Pua-a-Tāne means the abundance of Tāne .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Moerangi Mountain Bike Track [ edit ] The Moerangi Track is a dual purpose track for mountain bikers and trampers located in the Whirinaki Te Pu-a-Tane Conservation Park.

The track is 35 km of Grade 3 (intermediate) mountain bike track and takes around 5 to 6 hours to complete for someone with medium to high level of fitness.

Situated along the track are three huts, Skips, Rogers and Moerangi. All three spots are a good stopping point for riders or a place to stay on an overnight ride.
