It is one of Aristotle's virtues , being the "golden mean" between boorishness ( ἀγροικία ) and buffoonery ( βωμολοχία ).

[ 1 ] Construed narrowly, eutrapelia is associated with an emotion in the same manner modesty and righteousness are associated with emotion; while it is not tied to any particular emotion when construed in wider terms, and is classified with truthfulness, friendliness, and dignity in the category of mean-dispositions that cannot be called pathetikai mesotetes .

[ 2 ] In Ephesians 5:4 , Paul the Apostle uses the word εὐτραπελία with a negative meaning, referring to dirty jokes which do not befit Christians.

[ 3 ] John Chrysostom follows him in strongly criticizing inappropriate witticism, warning "that the greatest evils are both produced and increased by it, and that it oftentimes terminates in fornication".

[ 4 ] Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), viewed eutrapelia in a positive light, again, favoring the ancient Aristotelian notion that it is constituted by mental relaxation and honorable fun.

[ 5 ] In the Summa Theologica , Aquinas made it the virtue of moderation in relation to jesting.

[ 5 ] By the second half of thirteenth century, the concept was considered a state of judicious pleasure and returned to being considered a virtue by commentators.

[ 6 ] The term eutrapely is derived from eutrapelia and, since 1596, shares the original meaning of wittiness in conversations.
