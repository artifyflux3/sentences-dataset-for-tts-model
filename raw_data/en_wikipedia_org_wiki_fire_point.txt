For points at which fire alarms may be activated, see Manual fire alarm activation .

"Ignition point" redirects here. For the episode of Adventure Time , see Ignition Point .

The fire point , or combustion point , of a fuel is the lowest temperature at which the liquid fuel will continue to burn for at least five seconds after ignition by an open flame of standard dimension.

[ 1 ] At the flash point , a lower temperature, a substance will ignite briefly, but vapour might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire. Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points. In general, the fire point can be assumed to be about 10 °C higher than the flash point, [ 2 ] although this is no substitute for testing if the fire point is safety critical .

[ 2 ] Testing of the fire point is done by open cup apparatus .
