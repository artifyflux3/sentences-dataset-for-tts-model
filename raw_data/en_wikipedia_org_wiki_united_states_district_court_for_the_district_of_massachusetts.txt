Chief judges [ edit ] Chief Judge Sweeney 1948–1965 Wyzanski 1965–1971 Julian 1971–1972 Caffrey 1972–1986 Freedman 1986–1992 Tauro 1992–1999 Young 1999–2005 Wolf 2005–2012 Saris 2013–2019 Saylor 2020–2025 Casper 2025–present Chief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their district court. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge.

A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years, or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.

When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire, on what has since 1958 been known as senior status , or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.
