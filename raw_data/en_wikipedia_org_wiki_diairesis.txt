Diairesis ( Ancient Greek : διαίρεσις , romanized : diaíresis , "division") is a form of classification used in ancient (especially Platonic ) logic that serves to systematize concepts and come to definitions. When defining a concept using diairesis, one starts with a broad concept, then divides this into two or more specific sub-concepts, and this procedure is repeated until a definition of the desired concept is reached.

Aristotle makes extensive use of diaresis in categorization as basis for syllogizing .  He makes clear, however, that definition by diaresis does not in itself prove anything.

[ 1 ] Apart from this definition, the procedure also results in a taxonomy of other concepts, ordered according to a general–specific relation.

The founder of diairesis as a method was Plato . Later ancient logicians (including Aristotle) and practitioners of other ancient sciences have employed diairetic modes of classification, e.g., to classify plants in ancient biology .

Plato's method of definition [ edit ] See also: Sophist (dialogue) § Method of definition (216a–236d) Diairesis is Plato's later method of definition based on division, developed in the Platonic dialogues Phaedrus , Sophist , Statesman , and Philebus . Further applications are found in the Laws [ 2 ] and Timaeus . It is a means of attempting to reach a definition by which a collection of candidates is repeatedly divided into two parts with one part eliminated until a suitable definition is discovered.

A complementary term is merismos (cf. English merism : parsing or the distinguishing of parts, as opposed to diairesis , which is the division of a genus into its parts).

For example, in the Sophist (§235B), the Eleatic Stranger is examining illusions, which consist of words and "visual objects." By using diairesis , he divides visual objects, by which it becomes clear he means works of art, into two categories: eikastikē technē , the art of making likenesses or eikones ; and phantastikē technē , the art of creating illusionary appearances. The Stranger is much more fond of the former; the latter is only created to produce an appearance of beauty.

The method of diairesis in the history of philosophy [ edit ] Forerunners of Plato [ edit ] Opinions about possible forerunners of Platonic diairesis are varying; they even reach back until Homer . Also an adoption from the fields of mathematics has been considered, [ 3 ] like one from musicology, [ 4 ] one from pre-scientific and everyday divisions [ 5 ] and one from medicine.

[ 6 ] About forerunners in the field of philosophy there are as well different opinions. Under consideration are Prodicus of Ceos , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Democritus , Leucippus , [ 9 ] and the sophists .

[ 10 ] It was even suggested that Plato says that he himself found the new method, [ 11 ] which shows that it is possible that Plato had no forerunners at all.

[ 12 ] Later exponents of the method of diairesis [ edit ] The platonic method of division is found to be applied at the first steps of classifying biology, namely in the zoology of Aristotle [ 13 ] and in the botany of Theophrastus .

[ 14 ] Diairesis is central to Galen 's therapeutics; see for example 'Therapeutics to Glaucon' 1 (XI, 4 K), where Galen, attributing the method to Plato, asserts that 'the errors of the [medical] sects and whatever mistakes the majority of physicians make in the care of the sick have incompetent division as their principal and major cause' (tr. Dickson.) [ 15 ] Philosophically relevant methodical divisions or statements about the method of diairesis can be found in members of the Platonic Academy (especially Speusippus [ 16 ] and Xenocrates ), of the Peripatetic school (especially Aristotle , Aristoxenus , Theophrastus ), of Stoicism (especially Chrysippus ), of Middle Platonism (especially Alcinous , Maximus of Tyre , Philo ) and of Neoplatonism (especially Plotinus , Porphyry ). In medieval times the so-called method of divisio was a common method.
