General performances [ edit ] Performances of host countries [ edit ] Map of countries' best results From 1959 to 1982, the host qualified directly to the final round, thus bypassing the preliminary round (group stages). As a result, the host's final rank would no worse than the number of teams in the final round (between six and eight); however, from 1986 the host was made to compete in the preliminary round.

However, the success rate of hosts winning the tournament is rather low (14%, 3 of 18), as compared to the FIFA World Cup 's success rate of 22% (6 of 21); furthermore, no host has won the championship since Yugoslavia won in 1970 , and only one host since then has won any type of medal ( Turkey with a silver medal in 2010 ).
