[ 1 ] Vector operators include: Gradient is a vector operator that operates on a scalar field , producing a vector field .

Divergence is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field .

Curl is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a vector field.

Defined in terms of del : grad ≡ ≡ ∇ ∇ div ≡ ≡ ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ curl ≡ ≡ ∇ ∇ × × {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {grad} &\equiv \nabla \\\operatorname {div} &\equiv \nabla \cdot \\\operatorname {curl} &\equiv \nabla \times \end{aligned}}} The Laplacian operates on a scalar field, producing a scalar field: ∇ ∇ 2 ≡ ≡ div ⁡ ⁡ grad ≡ ≡ ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\equiv \operatorname {div} \ \operatorname {grad} \equiv \nabla \cdot \nabla } Vector operators must always come right before the scalar field or vector field on which they operate, in order to produce a result. E.g.

∇ ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} yields the gradient of f , but f ∇ ∇ {\displaystyle f\nabla } is just another vector operator, which is not operating on anything.

A vector operator can operate on another vector operator, to produce a compound vector operator, as seen above in the case of the Laplacian.
