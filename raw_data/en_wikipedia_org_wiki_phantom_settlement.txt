For other uses, see Paper Towns (disambiguation) .

Not to be confused with ghost town or abandoned village .

Phantom settlements , or paper towns , are settlements that appear on maps but do not actually exist. They are either accidents or copyright traps . Notable examples in the English-speaking world include Argleton , Lancashire in England, and Beatosu and Goblu , Ohio in the United States.

[ 1 ] Phantom settlements often result from copyright traps, also known as mountweazels, which is when a false entry is placed in literature to catch illegal copiers.

[ 2 ] Agloe, New York , was invented on a 1930s map as a copyright trap. In 1950, a general store was built there and named Agloe General Store, as that was the name seen on the map. Thus, the phantom settlement became a real one.

[ 3 ] There are also misnamed settlements, such as the villages of Mawdesky and Dummy 1325 in Lancashire on Google Maps .

[ 4 ] There is a satirical conspiracy theory that the German city of Bielefeld is a phantom settlement, despite its population of over 300,000.

[ 5 ] Another example is Leiria , Portugal, (pop. 128,640), [ 6 ] which even gave rise to a song "Leiria não existe".
