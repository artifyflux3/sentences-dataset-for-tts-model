Before 2000 BC [ edit ] Further information: Prehistoric numerals c.

20,000 BC — Nile Valley , Ishango Bone : suggested, though disputed, as the earliest reference to prime numbers as also a common number.

[ 1 ] c. 3400 BC — the Sumerians invent the first so-known numeral system , [ dubious – discuss ] and a system of weights and measures .

c. 3100 BC — Egypt , earliest known decimal system allows indefinite counting by way of introducing new symbols, [1] .

[ citation needed ] c. 2800 BC — Indus Valley civilization on the Indian subcontinent , earliest use of decimal ratios in a uniform system of ancient weights and measures , the smallest unit of measurement used is 1.704 millimetres and the smallest unit of mass used is 28 grams.

[ citation needed ] c. 2000 BC — Mesopotamia , the Babylonians use a base-60 decimal system, and compute the first known approximate value of π at 3.125.

[ citation needed ] 1st millennium BC [ edit ] c. 1000 BC — Vulgar fractions used by the Egyptians .

second half of 1st millennium BC — The Lo Shu Square , the unique normal magic square of order three, was discovered in China .

c. 400 BC — Jaina mathematicians in India write the “Surya Prajinapti”, a mathematical text which classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable and infinite . It also recognises five different types of infinity : infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.

c. 300 BC — Brahmi numerals are conceived in India .

300 BC — Mesopotamia , the Babylonians invent the earliest calculator, the abacus .

[ 2 ] c. 300 BC — Indian mathematician Pingala writes the “Chhandah-shastra”, which contains the first Indian use of zero as a digit (indicated by a dot) and also presents a description of a binary numeral system , along with the first use of Fibonacci numbers and Pascal's triangle .

c. 250 BC — late Olmecs had already begun to use a true zero (a shell glyph) several centuries before Ptolemy in the New World. See 0 (number) .

150 BC — Jain mathematicians in India write the “Sthananga Sutra”, which contains work on the theory of numbers, arithmetical operations, geometry , operations with fractions , simple equations, cubic equations , quartic equations, and permutations and combinations .

50 BC — Indian numerals , the first positional notation base-10 numeral system , begins developing in India .

1st millennium AD [ edit ] 300 — the earliest known use of zero as a decimal digit in the Old World is introduced by Indian mathematicians .

c. 400 — the Bakhshali manuscript uses numerals with a place-value system, using a dot as a place holder for zero .

550 — Hindu mathematicians give zero a numeral representation in the positional notation Indian numeral system.

628 — Brahmagupta writes the Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta , where zero is clearly explained, and where the modern place-value Indian numeral system is fully developed. It also gives rules for manipulating both negative and positive numbers , methods for computing square roots , methods of solving linear and quadratic equations , and rules for summing series , Brahmagupta's identity , and the Brahmagupta theorem .

940 — Abu'l-Wafa al-Buzjani extracts roots using the Indian numeral system.

953 — The arithmetic of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system at first required the use of a dust board (a sort of handheld blackboard ) because “the methods required moving the numbers around in the calculation and rubbing some out as the calculation proceeded.” Al-Uqlidisi modified these methods for pen and paper use. Eventually the advances enabled by the decimal system led to its standard use throughout the region and the world.

1000–1500 [ edit ] c. 1000 — Pope Sylvester II introduces the abacus using the Hindu–Arabic numeral system to Europe.

1030 — Ali Ahmad Nasawi writes a treatise on the decimal and sexagesimal number systems. His arithmetic explains the division of fractions and the extraction of square and cubic roots (square root of 57,342; cubic root of 3, 652, 296) in an almost modern manner.

[ 3 ] 12th century — Indian numerals have been modified by Persian mathematicians al-Khwārizmī to form the modern Arabic numerals (used universally in the modern world.) 12th century — the Arabic numerals reach Europe through the Arabs .

1202 — Leonardo Fibonacci demonstrates the utility of Hindu–Arabic numeral system in his Book of the Abacus .

c. 1400 — Ghiyath al-Kashi “contributed to the development of decimal fractions not only for approximating algebraic numbers , but also for real numbers such as pi . His contribution to decimal fractions is so major that for many years he was considered as their inventor.  Although not the first to do so, al-Kashi gave an algorithm for calculating nth roots which is a special case of the methods given many centuries later by Ruffini and Horner .” He is also the first to use the decimal point notation in arithmetic and Arabic numerals . His works include The Key of arithmetics, Discoveries in mathematics, The Decimal point , and The benefits of the zero . The contents of the Benefits of the Zero are an introduction followed by five essays: “On whole number arithmetic”, “On fractional arithmetic”, “On astrology”, “On areas”, and “On finding the unknowns [unknown variables]”. He also wrote the Thesis on the sine and the chord and Thesis on finding the first degree sine .

15th century — Ibn al-Banna and al-Qalasadi introduced symbolic notation for algebra and for mathematics in general.

[ 4 ] 1427 — Al-Kashi completes The Key to Arithmetic containing work of great depth on decimal fractions . It applies arithmetical and algebraic methods to the solution of various problems, including several geometric ones.

1478 — An anonymous author writes the Treviso Arithmetic .

17th century [ edit ] 1614 — John Napier publishes a table of Napierian logarithms in Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio , 1617 — Henry Briggs discusses decimal logarithms in Logarithmorum Chilias Prima , 1618 — John Napier publishes the first references to e in a work on logarithms .

18th century [ edit ] 1758 — Arithmetika Horvatzka , Croatia 's first arithmetic textbook is published in Zagreb by Mihalj Šilobod Bolšić (1724–1787).

1794 — Jurij Vega publishes Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus .

Calculation of Pi [ edit ] 1706 — John Machin develops a quickly converging inverse-tangent series for π and computes π to 100 decimal places.

1789 — Jurij Vega improves Machin's formula and computes π to 140 decimal places.

1949 — John von Neumann computes π to 2,037 decimal places using ENIAC .

1961 — Daniel Shanks and John Wrench compute π to 100,000 decimal places using an inverse-tangent identity and an IBM-7090 computer.

1987 — Yasumasa Kanada , David Bailey , Jonathan Borwein , and Peter Borwein use iterative modular equation approximations to elliptic integrals and a NEC SX-2 supercomputer to compute π to 134 million decimal places.

2002 — Yasumasa Kanada , Y. Ushiro, Hisayasu Kuroda , Makoto Kudoh and a team of nine more compute π to 1241.1 billion digits using a Hitachi 64-node supercomputer .
