**Nitrogen** is a [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"); it has [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry) "Symbol (chemistry)")**N** and [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number") 7. Nitrogen is a [nonmetal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonmetal_(chemistry) "Nonmetal (chemistry)") and the lightest member of [group 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen "Pnictogen") of the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"), often called the [pnictogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen "Pnictogen"). It is a common element in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), estimated at [seventh in total abundance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements "Abundance of the chemical elements") in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") and the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). At [standard temperature and pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure "Standard temperature and pressure"), two atoms of the element [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") to form N 2, a colourless and odourless [diatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule "Diatomic molecule")[gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"). N 2 forms about 78% of [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.

It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician [Daniel Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rutherford "Daniel Rutherford") in 1772 and independently by [Carl Wilhelm Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele "Carl Wilhelm Scheele") and [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish") at about the same time. The name _nitrogène_ was suggested by French chemist [Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine-Claude_Chaptal "Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal") in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in [nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid") and [nitrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate"). [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") suggested instead the name _azote_, from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): ἀζωτικός "no life", as it is an [asphyxiant gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxiant_gas "Asphyxiant gas"); this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine"), [azides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide") and [azo compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound "Azo compound").

Elemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by [pressure swing adsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_swing_adsorption "Pressure swing adsorption") technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as [liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen "Liquid nitrogen") in [cryogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic "Cryogenic") applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"), nitric acid, organic nitrates ([propellants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant "Propellant") and [explosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive "Explosive")), and [cyanides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide"), contain nitrogen. The extremely strong [triple bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bond "Triple bond") in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any [diatomic molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule "Diatomic molecule") after [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") (CO),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-8) dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N 2 into useful [compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound"), but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial [fertilisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertiliser "Fertiliser"), and fertiliser nitrates are key [pollutants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant "Pollutant") in the [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication "Eutrophication") of water systems. Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as [aramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramid "Aramid") used in high-strength fabric and [cyanoacrylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate "Cyanoacrylate") used in [superglue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superglue "Superglue").

Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid") (and thus [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein")), in the [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid "Nucleic acid") ([DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") and [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA")) and in the energy transfer molecule [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate"). The [human body contains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body "Composition of the human body") about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The [nitrogen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle "Nitrogen cycle") describes the movement of the element from the air, into the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic "Antibiotic"). Many drugs are mimics or [prodrugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug "Prodrug") of natural nitrogen-containing [signal molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling "Cell signaling"): for example, the organic nitrates [nitroglycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin "Nitroglycerin") and [nitroprusside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroprusside "Nitroprusside") control [blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure "Blood pressure") by metabolising into [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide"). Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural [caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine "Caffeine") and [morphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine "Morphine") or the synthetic [amphetamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine "Amphetamine"), act on receptors of animal [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter").

[Daniel Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rutherford "Daniel Rutherford"), discoverer of nitrogen

Nitrogen compounds have a very long history, [ammonium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chloride "Ammonium chloride") having been known to [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus "Herodotus"). They were well known by the Middle Ages. [Alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") knew nitric acid as _[aqua fortis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua\_fortis "Aqua fortis")_ (strong water), as well as other nitrogen compounds such as [ammonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium "Ammonium") salts and [nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate") salts. The mixture of nitric and [hydrochloric acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid "Hydrochloric acid") was known as _[aqua regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua\_regia "Aqua regia")_ (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), the king of metals.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood406-9)

The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician [Daniel Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rutherford "Daniel Rutherford") in 1772, who called it _noxious air_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Weeks-11) Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance, he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Black's ["fixed air"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black#Carbon_dioxide "Joseph Black"), or carbon dioxide.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-12) The fact that there was a component of air that does not support [combustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion "Combustion") was clear to Rutherford, although he was not aware that it was an element. Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by [Carl Wilhelm Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele "Carl Wilhelm Scheele"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-13)[Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-14) and [Joseph Priestley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley "Joseph Priestley"),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-15) who referred to it as _burnt air_ or _[phlogisticated air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston\_theory "Phlogiston theory")_. French chemist [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") referred to nitrogen gas as "[mephitic air](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mephitic_air "wikt:mephitic air")" or _azote_, from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") word άζωτικός (azotikos), "no life", because it is [asphyxiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxiant_gas "Asphyxiant gas").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-17) In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, animals died and flames were extinguished. Though Lavoisier's name was not accepted in English since it was pointed out that all gases but oxygen are either asphyxiant or outright toxic, it is used in many languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Turkish, etc.; the German _Stickstoff_ similarly refers to the same characteristic, viz. _ersticken_ "to choke or suffocate") and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds, such as [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine") and compounds of the [azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide") ion. Finally, it led to the name "[pnictogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen "Pnictogen")" for the group headed by nitrogen, from the Greek πνίγειν "to choke".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood406-9)

The English word nitrogen (1794) entered the language from the French _nitrogène_, coined in 1790 by French chemist [Jean-Antoine Chaptal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Chaptal "Jean-Antoine Chaptal") (1756–1832),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-18) from the French _nitre_ ([potassium nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate "Potassium nitrate"), also called [saltpetre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltpetre "Saltpetre")) and the French suffix _-gène_, "producing", from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") -γενής (-genes, "begotten"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of [nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid"), which in turn was produced from [nitre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"). In earlier times, nitre had been confused with Egyptian "natron" ([sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate "Sodium carbonate"))– called νίτρον (nitron) in Greek– which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-19)

The earliest military, industrial, and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpetre ([sodium nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrate "Sodium nitrate") or potassium nitrate), most notably in [gunpowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), and later as [fertiliser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertiliser "Fertiliser"). In 1910, [Lord Rayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Strutt,_3rd_Baron_Rayleigh "John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh") discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced "active nitrogen", a [monatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monatomic "Monatomic")[allotrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotrope "Allotrope") of nitrogen.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-20) The "whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light" produced by his apparatus reacted with [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)") to produce explosive [mercury nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_nitride "Mercury nitride").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-21)

For a long time, sources of nitrogen compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. [Nitrogen fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation "Nitrogen fixation") by industrial processes like the [Frank–Caro process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Caro_process "Frank–Caro process") (1895–1899) and [Haber–Bosch process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber%E2%80%93Bosch_process "Haber–Bosch process") (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, to the extent that half of global [food production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_production "Food production") now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Haber100-22) At the same time, use of the [Ostwald process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostwald_process "Ostwald process") (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as [feedstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedstock "Feedstock") in the manufacture of [explosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosives "Explosives") in the [World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war "World war") of the 20th century.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-24)

### Atomic

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Neon_orbitals.png/500px-Neon_orbitals.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neon_orbitals.png)

The shapes of the five orbitals occupied in nitrogen. The two colours show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region. From left to right: 1s, 2s (cutaway to show internal structure), 2p _x_, 2p _y_, 2p _z_.

A nitrogen atom has seven electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration 1s 2

2s 2

2p 1

_x_ 2p 1

_y_ 2p 1

_z_. It, therefore, has five [valence electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron "Valence electron") in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It has one of the highest [electronegativities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity "Electronegativity") among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine "Chlorine") (3.16), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (3.44), and [fluorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine "Fluorine") (3.98). (The light [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas"), [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon "Neon"), and [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), would presumably also be more electronegative, and in fact are on the Allen scale.)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood411-25) Following periodic trends, its single-bond [covalent radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_radius "Covalent radius") of 71 pm is smaller than those of [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron "Boron") (84 pm) and [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") (76 pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66 pm) and fluorine (57 pm). The [nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitride "Nitride") anion, N 3−, is much larger at 146 pm, similar to that of the [oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide "Oxide") (O 2−: 140 pm) and [fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride "Fluoride") (F−: 133 pm) anions.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood411-25) The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577 MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920 MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood550-26) The lack of radial nodes in the 2p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the [p-block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-block "P-block"), especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating [orbital hybridisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_hybridisation "Orbital hybridisation"). It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. [Hypervalency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervalent_molecule "Hypervalent molecule") is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich [three-center four-electron bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-center_four-electron_bond "Three-center four-electron bond") since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus"), [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic "Arsenic"), [antimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony "Antimony"), and [bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth "Bismuth").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Kaupp-27)

Nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours' carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Although each period 2 element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group (from magnesium to chlorine; these are known as [diagonal relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_relationship "Diagonal relationship")), their degree drops off abruptly past the boron–silicon pair. The similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)

Nitrogen does not share the proclivity of carbon for [catenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenation "Catenation"). Like carbon, nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals. Nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon, including those with chain-, [graphitic-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite "Graphite"), and [fullerenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene "Fullerene")-like structures.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-29)

It resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for [hydrogen bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond") and the ability to form [coordination complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex "Coordination complex") by donating its [lone pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_pair "Lone pair") of electrons. There are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia NH 3 and water H 2 O. For example, the capacity of both compounds to be protonated to give NH 4+ and H 3 O+ or deprotonated to give NH 2− and OH−, with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-30)

Nitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, oxygen, or other nitrogen atoms, through p _π_–p _π_ interactions.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28) Thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower [melting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point "Melting point") (−210°C) and [boiling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point "Boiling point") (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N 2 molecules are only held together by weak [van der Waals interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_interaction "Van der Waals interaction") and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the [nitrogen oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide "Nitrogen oxide"), [nitrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite "Nitrite"), [nitrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate"), [nitro-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_compound "Nitro compound"), [nitroso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroso "Nitroso")-, [azo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound "Azo compound")-, and [diazo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazo "Diazo")-compounds, [azides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide"), [cyanates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanate "Cyanate"), [thiocyanates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiocyanate "Thiocyanate"), and [imino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imino "Imino")-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28) Setting aside their differences, nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another; these have chain, ring, and cage structures.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-31)

### Isotopes

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/NuclideMap_C-F.png/960px-NuclideMap_C-F.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NuclideMap_C-F.png)

Table of nuclides (Segrè chart) from carbon to fluorine (including nitrogen). Orange indicates [proton emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_emission "Proton emission") (nuclides outside the proton drip line); pink for [positron emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission "Positron emission") (inverse beta decay); black for [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_nuclide "Stable nuclide") nuclides; blue for [electron emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_emission "Electron emission") (beta decay); and violet for [neutron emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_emission "Neutron emission") (nuclides outside the neutron drip line). Proton number increases going up the vertical axis and neutron number going to the right on the horizontal axis.

Nitrogen has two stable [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope"): 14 N and 15 N. The first is much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is slightly heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007 u.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood411-25) Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the [CNO cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle "CNO cycle") in [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), but 14 N is more common as its proton capture is the rate-limiting step. 14 N is one of the five stable [odd–odd nuclides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_atomic_nuclei "Even and odd atomic nuclei") (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are [2 H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium "Deuterium"), 6 Li, 10 B, and 180m Ta.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-BetheBible-34)

The relative abundance of 14 N and 15 N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological [redox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox "Redox") reactions and the evaporation of natural [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia") or [nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-CIAAWnitrogen-1) Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., [assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(biology) "Assimilation (biology)"), [nitrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrification "Nitrification"), and [denitrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denitrification "Denitrification")) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15 N enrichment of the [substrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(chemistry) "Substrate (chemistry)") and depletion of the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry) "Product (chemistry)").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-enrich-35)

The heavy isotope 15 N was first discovered by S. M. Naudé in 1929, and soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") were discovered.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood408-36) It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-37) It is frequently used in [nuclear magnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Nuclear magnetic resonance") (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional [nuclear spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_spin "Nuclear spin") of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14 N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a [quadrupole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_moment "Quadrupole moment") that leads to wider and less useful spectra.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood411-25)15 N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15 N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low [gyromagnetic ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio "Gyromagnetic ratio"), (only 10.14% that of 1 H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1 H is about 300 times as much as that for 15 N at the same magnetic field strength.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-autogenerated2007-38) This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15 N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15 N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood411-25) The 15 N:14 N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of [geochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry "Geochemistry"), [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), [paleoclimatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology "Paleoclimatology") and [paleoceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoceanography "Paleoceanography"), where it is called [_δ_ 15 N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9415N "Δ15N").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-39)

Of the thirteen other isotopes produced synthetically, ranging from 9 N to 23 N, [13 N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen-13 "Nitrogen-13") has a [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "Half-life") of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half-lives less than eight seconds.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-N9sci-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-NUBASE-41) Given the half-life difference, 13 N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in [positron emission tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography "Positron emission tomography") (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron "Cyclotron") via proton bombardment of 16 O producing 13 N and an [alpha particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Carlson_151-42)

The [radioisotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope "Radioisotope")16 N is the dominant [radionuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide "Radionuclide") in the coolant of [pressurised water reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurised_water_reactor "Pressurised water reactor") or [boiling water reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor "Boiling water reactor") during normal operation. It is produced from 16 O (in water) via an [(n,p) reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Np_reaction "Np reaction"), in which the 16 O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s,[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-NUBASE-41) but its decay back to 16 O produces high-energy [gamma radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_radiation "Gamma radiation") (5 to 7 MeV).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-NUBASE-41)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Neeb-43) Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during [reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") power operation.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Neeb-43) It is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Neeb-43)

### Allotropes

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/N2MolecularDiagramCR.jpg/500px-N2MolecularDiagramCR.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:N2MolecularDiagramCR.jpg)

[Molecular orbital diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_diagram "Molecular orbital diagram") of dinitrogen molecule, N 2. There are five bonding orbitals and two antibonding orbitals (marked with an asterisk; orbitals involving the inner 1s electrons not shown), giving a total bond order of three.

Atomic nitrogen, also known as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a [triradical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") with three unpaired electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N 2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") and [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2 mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)

Given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N 2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless [diamagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetic "Diamagnetic") gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28) Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, but it will nevertheless react with [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium") metal and some [transition metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal "Transition metal") complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N [triple bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bond "Triple bond"). Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76 pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41 kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's low level of chemical reactivity.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-44)

Other nitrogen [oligomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomers "Oligomers") and polymers may be possible. If they could be synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Lewars-45) Under extremely high pressures (1.1 million[atm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit) "Atmosphere (unit)")) and high temperatures (2000 K), as produced in a [diamond anvil cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell "Diamond anvil cell"), nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded [cubic gauche](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cubic_gauche&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cubic gauche (page does not exist)") crystal structure. This structure is similar to that of [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond"), and both have extremely strong [covalent bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond"), resulting in its nickname "nitrogen diamond".[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-46)

[Solid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_nitrogen "Solid nitrogen") on the plains of [Sputnik Planitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Planitia "Sputnik Planitia") (on the bottom-right side of the image) on [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") next to water ice mountains (on the up-left side of the image)

At [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), molecular nitrogen [condenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation "Condensation") ([liquefies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid")) at 77[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (−195.79°[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius")) and [freezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") at 63 K (−210.01°C)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Gray-47) into the beta [hexagonal close-packed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_close-packed "Hexagonal close-packed") crystal [allotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropy "Allotropy") form. Below 35.4 K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the [cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system "Cubic crystal system") crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-schu-48)[Liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen "Liquid nitrogen"), a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808 g/mL), is a common [cryogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogen "Cryogen").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-49)[Solid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_nitrogen "Solid nitrogen") has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-50) and outer moons of the Solar System such as [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon) "Triton (moon)").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-51) Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can [sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition) "Sublimation (phase transition)") to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers, and on Triton [geysers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser "Geyser") of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-52)

Beyond dinitrogen (N 2), chemists have long sought to synthesize and stabilize other neutral nitrogen allotropes, which are typically much less stable and often exist only fleetingly or under extreme conditions. Cyclic [hexazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexazine "Hexazine") (N 6), a hypothetical ring-like molecule analogous to benzene, has not been synthesized as a neutral species, though negatively charged variants have been produced under extreme conditions; its instability is attributed to the repulsion of lone pairs on nitrogen atoms. [Hexanitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexanitrogen "Hexanitrogen") (N 6), a neutral, linear chain of six nitrogen atoms with alternating double and single bonds, which is stable only at cryogenic temperatures and represents the first stable neutral nitrogen allotrope beyond dinitrogen.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Qian_2025-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Halford_2025-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-56)[Octaazacubane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octaazacubane "Octaazacubane") (N 8), a hypothetical [cubane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubane "Cubane")-like cluster of eight nitrogen atoms, is predicted to be highly energetic and potentially useful as an explosive or rocket fuel, though it remains unsynthesized to date.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Halford_2025-54)[Tetranitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetranitrogen "Tetranitrogen") (N 4) and [trinitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrogen "Trinitrogen") (N 3, the [azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide") radical) are also known, but these are either extremely unstable or exist only as short-lived intermediates.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Halford_2025-54) Among the several different phases of [solid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_nitrogen "Solid nitrogen"), an N 8 molecular allotrope has been detected[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-57) as well as several different three-dimensional lattices and amorphous forms.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Qian_2025-53)

Chemistry and compounds
-----------------------

### Dinitrogen complexes

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/RuA5N2.png/250px-RuA5N2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RuA5N2.png)

Structure of [Ru(NH 3)5(N 2)]2+ ([pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II)_chloride "Pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II) chloride")), the first dinitrogen complex to be discovered

The first example of a [dinitrogen complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_complex "Dinitrogen complex") to be discovered was [Ru(NH 3)5(N 2)]2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These [complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(chemistry) "Complex (chemistry)"), in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation, illustrate how N 2 might bind to the metal(s) in [nitrogenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogenase "Nitrogenase") and the [catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis "Catalysis") for the [Haber process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process "Haber process"): these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Schrock-59)

Dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (_[η](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapticity "Hapticity")_ 1) and M←N≡N→M (_[μ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging\_ligand "Bridging ligand")_, bis-_η_ 1), in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a [bridging ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_ligand "Bridging ligand") to two metal cations (_μ_, bis-_η_ 2) or to just one (_η_ 2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (_μ_ 3-N 2). A few complexes feature multiple N 2 ligands and some feature N 2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N 2 is isoelectronic with [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") (CO) and [acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene "Acetylene") (C 2 H 2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in [carbonyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl "Carbonyl") compounds, although N 2 is a weaker _σ_-donor and _π_-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that _σ_ donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M–N bond than _π_ back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (_η_ 1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (_η_ 2) donation.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)

Today, dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the [transition metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal "Transition metal"), accounting for several hundred compounds. They are normally prepared by three methods:[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)

1.   Replacing labile ligands such as [H 2 O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), [H−](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydride "Hydride"), or [CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") directly by nitrogen: these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions.
2.   Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable co-ligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice includes replacing chloride ligands with [dimethylphenylphosphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylphenylphosphine "Dimethylphenylphosphine") (PMe 2 Ph) to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached to the original chlorine ligands.
3.   Converting a ligand with N–N bonds, such as hydrazine or azide, directly into a dinitrogen ligand.

Occasionally the N≡N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex, for example by directly reacting coordinated [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia") (NH 3) with [nitrous acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_acid "Nitrous acid") (HNO 2), but this is not generally applicable. Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white-yellow-orange-red-brown; a few exceptions are known, such as the blue [{Ti(_η_ 5-C 5 H 5)2}2-(N 2)].[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28)

### Nitrides, azides, and nitrido complexes

Nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first two [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas"), [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") and [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon "Neon"), and some of the very short-lived elements after [bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth "Bismuth"), creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood412-28) Many binary compounds are known: with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides, oxides, and fluorides, these are typically called [nitrides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitride "Nitride"). Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements (e.g. MnN, Mn 6 N 5, Mn 3 N 2, Mn 2 N, Mn 4 N, and Mn _x_ N for 9.2 <_x_< 25.3). They may be classified as "salt-like" (mostly ionic), covalent, "diamond-like", and metallic (or [interstitial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_compound "Interstitial compound")), although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies. They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia (sometimes after heating), or by [thermal decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_decomposition "Thermal decomposition") of metal amides:[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood417-60)

3 Ca + N 2 → Ca 3 N 2 3 Mg + 2 NH 3 → Mg 3 N 2 + 3 H 2 (at 900°C)3 Zn(NH 2)2 → Zn 3 N 2 + 4 NH 3
Many variants on these processes are possible. The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the [alkali metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal "Alkali metal") and [alkaline earth metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal "Alkaline earth metal"), Li 3 N (Na, K, Rb, and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons) and M 3 N 2 (M = Be, Mg, Ca Sr, Ba). These can formally be thought of as salts of the N 3− anion, although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements. However, the alkali metal [azides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide") NaN 3 and KN 3, featuring the linear N−

3 anion, are well-known, as are Sr(N 3)2 and Ba(N 3)2. Azides of the B-subgroup metals (those in [groups 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_11_element "Group 11 element") through [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcogen "Chalcogen")) are much less ionic, have more complicated structures, and detonate readily when shocked.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood417-60)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Borazin_Mesomers1.svg/500px-Borazin_Mesomers1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Borazin_Mesomers1.svg)

Mesomeric structures of borazine, (–BH–NH–)3

Many covalent binary nitrides are known. Examples include [cyanogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen "Cyanogen") ((CN)2), [triphosphorus pentanitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triphosphorus_pentanitride "Triphosphorus pentanitride") (P 3 N 5), [disulfur dinitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfur_dinitride "Disulfur dinitride") (S 2 N 2), and [tetrasulfur tetranitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrasulfur_tetranitride "Tetrasulfur tetranitride") (S 4 N 4). The essentially covalent [silicon nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_nitride "Silicon nitride") (Si 3 N 4) and [germanium nitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium_nitride "Germanium nitride") (Ge 3 N 4) are also known: silicon nitride, in particular, would make a promising [ceramic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic "Ceramic") if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the [group 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group "Boron group") nitrides, most of which are promising [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor"), are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and [silicon carbide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide "Silicon carbide") and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry") finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in [borazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borazine "Borazine") ("inorganic [benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene "Benzene")"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of [nucleophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleophile "Nucleophile") attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood417-60)

The largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M 2 N, and M 4 N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or [hexagonal close-packed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_close-packed "Hexagonal close-packed") lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood417-60)

The nitride anion (N 3−) is the strongest _π_ donor known among ligands (the second-strongest is O 2−). Nitrido complexes are generally made by the thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia, and they usually involve a terminal {≡N}3− group. The linear azide anion (N−

3), being isoelectronic with [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide"), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), and [cyanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanate "Cyanate"), forms many coordination complexes. Further catenation is rare, although N 4−

4 (isoelectronic with [carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") and [nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate")) is known.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood417-60)

### Hydrides

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Nitrogen_electrode_potentials.svg/580px-Nitrogen_electrode_potentials.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nitrogen_electrode_potentials.svg)

Standard reduction potentials for nitrogen-containing species. Top diagram shows potentials at pH 0; bottom diagram shows potentials at pH 14.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood434-61)

Industrially, [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia") (NH 3) is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of [hydrogen bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonding "Hydrogen bonding") has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high [dielectric constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_constant "Dielectric constant"), and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH 3 is weaker than that in H 2 O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH 3 rather than two in H 2 O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution ([p _K_ _b_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_dissociation_constant "Acid dissociation constant") 4.74); its conjugate acid is [ammonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium "Ammonium"), NH+

4. It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, NH−

2. It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give [nitrogen trifluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trifluoride "Nitrogen trifluoride"). Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood420-62)

Many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known, but the most important are [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine") (N 2 H 4) and [hydrogen azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_azide "Hydrogen azide") (HN 3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, [hydroxylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylamine "Hydroxylamine") (NH 2 OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similar to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00 g/cm 3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood426-63) It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Vieira-64)

Hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline [sodium hypochlorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite "Sodium hypochlorite") in the presence of gelatin or glue:[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood426-63)

NH 3 + OCl− → NH 2 Cl + OH−NH 2 Cl + NH 3 → N

2 H+

5 + Cl− (slow)N

2 H+

5 + OH− → N 2 H 4 + H 2 O (fast)
(The attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed, thus passing through the intermediate NHCl− instead.) The reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as Cu 2+ that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with [monochloramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochloramine "Monochloramine") (NH 2 Cl) to produce [ammonium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chloride "Ammonium chloride") and nitrogen.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood426-63)

[Hydrogen azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_azide "Hydrogen azide") (HN 3) was first produced in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the [hydrohalic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrohalic_acid "Hydrohalic acid").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood426-63)

### Halides and oxohalides

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Nitrogen_trichloride.JPG/250px-Nitrogen_trichloride.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nitrogen_trichloride.JPG)

[Nitrogen trichloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride "Nitrogen trichloride")

All four simple nitrogen trihalides are known. A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known, but are mostly unstable; examples include NClF 2, NCl 2 F, NBrF 2, NF 2 H, [NFH 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroamine "Fluoroamine"), [NCl 2 H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloramine "Dichloramine"), and [NClH 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochloramine "Monochloramine").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood438-65)

[Nitrogen trifluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trifluoride "Nitrogen trifluoride") (NF 3, first prepared in 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily produced by the [electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis "Electrolysis") of molten [ammonium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_fluoride "Ammonium fluoride") dissolved in anhydrous [hydrogen fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride "Hydrogen fluoride"). Like [carbon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrafluoride "Carbon tetrafluoride"), it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper"), arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give [tetrafluorohydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrafluorohydrazine "Tetrafluorohydrazine") (N 2 F 4). The cations NF+

4 and N

2 F+

3 are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as [arsenic pentafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_pentafluoride "Arsenic pentafluoride")), as is ONF 3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF 2•. [Fluorine azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine_azide "Fluorine azide") (FN 3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. [Dinitrogen difluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_difluoride "Dinitrogen difluoride") (N 2 F 2) exists as thermally interconvertible _cis_ and _trans_ isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN 3.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood438-65)

[Nitrogen trichloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride "Nitrogen trichloride") (NCl 3) is a dense, volatile, and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of [carbon tetrachloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride "Carbon tetrachloride"), although one difference is that NCl 3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl 4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by [Pierre Louis Dulong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Dulong "Pierre Louis Dulong"), who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. [Nitrogen tribromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_tribromide "Nitrogen tribromide") (NBr 3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100°C. [Nitrogen triiodide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_triiodide "Nitrogen triiodide") (NI 3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the touch of a feather, shifting air currents, or even [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood438-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-66) For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of "chemical magic".[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-67)[Chlorine azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_azide "Chlorine azide") (ClN 3) and [bromine azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine_azide "Bromine azide") (BrN 3) are extremely sensitive and explosive.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-68)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-solid-69)

Two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO 2). The first is very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. [Nitrosyl fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosyl_fluoride "Nitrosyl fluoride") (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. [Nitrosyl chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosyl_chloride "Nitrosyl chloride") (NOCl) behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent. [Nitrosyl bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosyl_bromide "Nitrosyl bromide") (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: [nitryl fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitryl_fluoride "Nitryl fluoride") (FNO 2) and [nitryl chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitryl_chloride "Nitryl chloride") (ClNO 2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood438-65)

### Oxides

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Nitrogen_dioxide_at_different_temperatures.jpg/500px-Nitrogen_dioxide_at_different_temperatures.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nitrogen_dioxide_at_different_temperatures.jpg)

Nitrogen dioxide at −196°C, 0°C, 23°C, 35°C, and 50°C. NO

2 converts to colourless dinitrogen tetroxide (N

2 O

4) at low temperatures, and reverts to NO

2 at higher temperatures.

Nitrogen forms nine molecular oxides, some of which were the first gases to be identified: N 2 O ([nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide")), NO ([nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide")), N 2 O 3 ([dinitrogen trioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_trioxide "Dinitrogen trioxide")), NO 2 ([nitrogen dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide "Nitrogen dioxide")), N 2 O 4 ([dinitrogen tetroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide "Dinitrogen tetroxide")), N 2 O 5 ([dinitrogen pentoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_pentoxide "Dinitrogen pentoxide")), N 4 O ([nitrosylazide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosylazide "Nitrosylazide")),[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70) and N(NO 2)3 ([trinitramide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitramide "Trinitramide")).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-71) All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is [oxatetrazole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxatetrazole "Oxatetrazole") (N 4 O), an aromatic ring.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70)

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O), better known as laughing gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten [ammonium nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate "Ammonium nitrate") at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for [sprayed canned whipped cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream "Cream"), and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot be considered to be the [anhydride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_anhydride "Inorganic anhydride") of [hyponitrous acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponitrous_acid "Hyponitrous acid") (H 2 N 2 O 2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone") at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70) Nitric oxide (NO) is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, it is an important cellular [signalling molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_molecule "Signalling molecule") involved in many physiological and pathological processes.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-72) It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a _π_* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the _cis_ isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70)

Blue dinitrogen trioxide (N 2 O 3) is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them, although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to [nitrosonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosonium "Nitrosonium") and [nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate") in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form [nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid"). Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR") by the late 1950s. This is because it is a [hypergolic propellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant "Hypergolic propellant") in combination with a [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine")-based [rocket fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant "Rocket propellant") and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70)

The thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) is the anhydride of [nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid"), and can be made from it by dehydration with [phosphorus pentoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_pentoxide "Phosphorus pentoxide"). It is of interest for the preparation of explosives.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-73) It is a [deliquescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliquescent "Deliquescent"), colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure [NO 2]+[NO 3]−; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O 2 N–O–NO 2. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with [hydrogen peroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide "Hydrogen peroxide") giving [peroxonitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxonitric_acid "Peroxonitric acid") (HOONO 2). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows:[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood443-70)

N 2 O 5 ⇌ NO 2 + NO 3 → NO 2 + O 2 + NO N 2 O 5 + NO ⇌ 3 NO 2
### Oxoacids, oxoanions, and oxoacid salts

Many nitrogen [oxoacids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoacid "Oxoacid") are known, though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solutions or as salts. [Hyponitrous acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponitrous_acid "Hyponitrous acid") (H 2 N 2 O 2) is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON=NOH (p _K_ a1 6.9, p _K_ a2 11.6). Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH 4 base-catalysed decomposition occurs via [HONNO]− to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion. [Hyponitrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponitrite "Hyponitrite") (involving the N

2 O 2−

2 anion) are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves. They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which occurs in the [nitrogen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle "Nitrogen cycle"). Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

[Nitrous acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_acid "Nitrous acid") (HNO 2) is not known as a pure compound, but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous [nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite "Nitrite") (NO−

2, bent) solutions, although already at room temperature disproportionation to [nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate") and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with p _K_ _a_ 3.35 at 18°C. They may be [titrimetrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration "Titration") analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by [permanganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanganate "Permanganate"). They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide "Sulfur dioxide"), to hyponitrous acid with [tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin "Tin")(II), and to ammonia with [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide "Hydrogen sulfide"). Salts of [hydrazinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazinium "Hydrazinium")N

2 H+

5 react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. [Sodium nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite "Sodium nitrite") is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100 mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to [diazotise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazonium_compound#Preparation "Diazonium compound") primary aromatic amines as follows:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

ArNH 2 + HNO 2 → [ArNN]Cl + 2 H 2 O
Nitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Fuming_nitric_acid_40ml.jpg/250px-Fuming_nitric_acid_40ml.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fuming_nitric_acid_40ml.jpg)

Fuming nitric acid contaminated with yellow nitrogen dioxide

[Nitric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid "Nitric acid") (HNO 3) is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being [sulfuric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid "Sulfuric acid") and [hydrochloric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid "Hydrochloric acid")) and was first discovered by alchemists in the 13th century. It is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes [self-ionisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_autoionization "Molecular autoionization") to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

2 HNO 3 ⇌ H

2 NO+

3 + NO−

3 ⇌ H 2 O + [NO 2]+ + [NO 3]−
Two hydrates, HNO 3·H 2 O and HNO 3·3H 2 O, are known that can be crystallised. It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents, though [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), [platinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum "Platinum"), [rhodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodium "Rhodium"), and [iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium "Iridium") are immune to attack. A 3:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, called _[aqua regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua\_regia "Aqua regia")_, is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum, because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes. In concentrated sulfuric acid, nitric acid is protonated to form [nitronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitronium "Nitronium"), which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

HNO 3 + 2 H 2 SO 4 ⇌ NO+

2 + H 3 O+ + 2 HSO−

4
The thermal stabilities of [nitrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate") (involving the trigonal planar NO−

3 anion) depends on the basicity of the metal, and so do the products of decomposition (thermolysis), which can vary between the nitrite (for example, sodium), the oxide (potassium and [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead")), or even the metal itself ([silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver "Silver")) depending on their relative stabilities. Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

Finally, although orthonitric acid (H 3 NO 4), which would be analogous to [orthophosphoric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthophosphoric_acid "Orthophosphoric acid"), does not exist, the tetrahedral [orthonitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonitrate "Orthonitrate") anion NO 3−

4 is known in its sodium and potassium salts:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

![Image 16: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {NaNO} {\vphantom {A}}_{\smash[{t}]{3}}{}+{}\mathrm {Na} {\vphantom {A}}_{\smash[{t}]{2}}\mathrm {O} {}\mathrel {\xrightarrow[{300{\vphantom {A}}^{\circ }\mathrm {C} ~\mathrm {for} ~7\,\mathrm {days} }]{\mathrm {Ag} ~\mathrm {crucible} }} {}\mathrm {Na} {\vphantom {A}}_{\smash[{t}]{3}}\mathrm {NO} {\vphantom {A}}_{\smash[{t}]{4}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec729bc88f520e08fdce8a013dec8ae601d28509)
These white crystalline salts are very sensitive to water vapour and carbon dioxide in the air:[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

Na 3 NO 4 + H 2 O + CO 2 → NaNO 3 + NaOH + NaHCO 3
Despite its limited chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N–O bond lengths, implying significant polar character to the bonding.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood459-74)

### Organic nitrogen compounds

Nitrogen is one of the most important elements in [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry"). Many organic [functional groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group "Functional group") involve a [carbon–nitrogen bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93nitrogen_bond "Carbon–nitrogen bond"), such as [amides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide "Amide") (RCONR 2), [amines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine "Amine") (R 3 N), [imines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine "Imine") (RC(=NR)R), [imides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imide "Imide") (RCO)2 NR, [azides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azide "Azide") (RN 3), [azo compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound "Azo compound") (RN 2 R), [cyanates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanate_ester "Cyanate ester") (ROCN), [isocyanates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocyanate "Isocyanate") (RNCO), [nitrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate "Nitrate") (RONO 2), [nitriles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrile "Nitrile") (RCN), [isonitriles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isonitrile "Isonitrile") (RNC), [nitrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite#Organic_nitrites "Nitrite") (RONO), [nitro compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitro_compound "Nitro compound") (RNO 2), [nitroso compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroso_compound "Nitroso compound") (RNO), [oximes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxime "Oxime") (RC(=NOH)R), and [pyridine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyridine "Pyridine") derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in [quaternary ammonium salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_ammonium_salt "Quaternary ammonium salt"), R 4 N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as bases at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and [pyrrole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrole "Pyrrole") is not basic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an [aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity "Aromaticity") ring.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Jerry-75) The amount of nitrogen in a [chemical substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance "Chemical substance") can be determined by the [Kjeldahl method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeldahl_method "Kjeldahl method").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-76) In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acids "Nucleic acids"), [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid") and thus [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"), and the energy-carrying molecule [adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate") and is thus vital to all life on Earth.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Jerry-75)

Occurrence
----------

Schematic representation of the [flow of nitrogen compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle "Nitrogen cycle") through a land environment

Nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the volume of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood406-9) (75.5% by mass), around 3.89 million [gigatonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigatonnes "Gigatonnes") (3.89×10 18 kg). Despite this, it is [not very abundant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust "Abundance of elements in Earth's crust") in Earth's crust, making up somewhere around 19[parts per million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million") of this, on par with [niobium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium "Niobium"), [gallium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium "Gallium"), and [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium"). (This represents 300,000 to a million gigatonnes of nitrogen, depending on the mass of the crust.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-77)) The only important nitrogen minerals are [nitre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitre "Nitre") ([potassium nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate "Potassium nitrate"), saltpetre) and [soda nitre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodanitre "Sodanitre") ([sodium nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrate "Sodium nitrate"), Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood407-78)

Nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or "[fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation "Nitrogen fixation")", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by [diazotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph "Diazotroph") bacteria through enzymes known as [nitrogenases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogenase "Nitrogenase") (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, it is used to synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their proteins and excrete nitrogen-bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and [denitrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denitrification "Denitrification"), returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the [Haber process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process "Haber process") is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen–bearing waste, when leached, leads to [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication "Eutrophication") of freshwater and the creation of marine [dead zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology) "Dead zone (ecology)"), as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood407-78)

Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of [trimethylamine oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylamine_oxide "Trimethylamine oxide") to protect them from the high [osmotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis "Osmosis") effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to [dimethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylamine "Dimethylamine") is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-79) In animals, [free radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_radical "Free radical")[nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (derived from an [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid")), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-ocean-80)

Nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite [nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite "Nitrite"). Animal [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism") of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in the [excretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion "Excretion") of [urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea "Urea"), while animal metabolism of [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acids "Nucleic acids") results in the excretion of [urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea "Urea") and [uric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid "Uric acid"). The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing [amines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine "Amine"), such as [putrescine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrescine "Putrescine") and [cadaverine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaverine "Cadaverine"), which are breakdown products of the amino acids [ornithine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithine "Ornithine") and [lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine "Lysine"), respectively, in decaying proteins.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-81)

Production
----------

Nitrogen gas is an [industrial gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_gas "Industrial gas") produced by the [fractional distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_distillation "Fractional distillation") of [liquid air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_air "Liquid air"), or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse [osmosis membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure "Osmotic pressure") or [pressure swing adsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_swing_adsorption "Pressure swing adsorption")). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk-delivered nitrogen.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-82) Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen).[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-83) Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20 ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2 ppm oxygen and 10 ppm [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon") are also available.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood409-84)

In a chemical laboratory, it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of [ammonium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chloride "Ammonium chloride") with [sodium nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite "Sodium nitrite").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-labProduction-85)

NH 4 Cl + NaNO 2 → N 2 + NaCl + 2 H 2 O
Small amounts of the impurities NO and HNO 3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing [potassium dichromate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_dichromate "Potassium dichromate").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-labProduction-85)

It can also be obtained by the thermal decomposition of [ammonium dichromate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_dichromate "Ammonium dichromate").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-86)

3(NH 4)2 Cr 2 O 7 → 2N 2 + 9H 2 O + 3Cr 2 O 3 + 2NH 3 + 32O 2
Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of [barium azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_azide "Barium azide") or [sodium azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_azide "Sodium azide").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-87)

2 NaN 3 → 2 Na + 3 N 2
Applications
------------

The applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class: hence, only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here. Two-thirds (2/3) of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as gas and the remaining one-third (1/3) as a liquid.

### Gas

The gas is mostly used as a low reactivity safe atmosphere wherever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire, explosion, or oxidising hazard. Some examples include:[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood409-84)

*   As a [modified atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_atmosphere "Modified atmosphere"), pure or mixed with [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods (by delaying [rancidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancidification "Rancidification") and other forms of [oxidative damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox "Redox")). Pure nitrogen as food additive is labelled in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") with the [E number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number "E number") E941.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-88)
*   In [incandescent light bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb") as an inexpensive alternative to [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-89)
*   In [fire suppression systems for Information technology (IT) equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_fire_suppression "Gaseous fire suppression").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood409-84)
*   In the manufacture of [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel "Stainless steel").[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-90)
*   In the [case-hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-hardening "Case-hardening") of steel by [nitriding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitriding "Nitriding").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Duplex-91)
*   In some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard (see [inerting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inerting_system "Inerting system")).
*   To inflate race car and aircraft [tires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire "Tire"),[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-92) reducing the problems of inconsistent expansion and contraction caused by moisture and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox "Redox") in natural air.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood409-84)

Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in [chemical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_analysis "Chemical analysis"). It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-93)

Nitrogen can be used as a replacement, or in combination with, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") to pressurise kegs of some [beers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer "Beer"), particularly [stouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout "Stout") and British [ales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale "Ale"), due to the smaller [bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_bubble "Liquid bubble") it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and [headier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_head "Beer head").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-94) A pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a "[widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(beer) "Widget (beer)")" allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in [cans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_can "Beverage can") and [bottles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle "Bottle").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-95)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-96) Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for [paintball guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball_gun "Paintball gun"). Nitrogen must be kept at a higher pressure than CO 2, making N 2 tanks heavier and more expensive.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-97)

#### Equipment

Some construction equipment uses pressurised nitrogen gas to help [hydraulic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics "Hydraulics") to provide extra power to devices such as [hydraulic hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_(hydraulic) "Breaker (hydraulic)"). Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of [sodium azide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_azide "Sodium azide"), is used for the inflation of [airbags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag "Airbag").[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-98)

#### Execution

As nitrogen is an asphyxiant gas in itself, some jurisdictions have considered asphyxiation by inhalation of pure nitrogen as a means of [capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment "Capital punishment") (as a substitute for [lethal injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_injection "Lethal injection")).[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Time-apr2015-99)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-100)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-101) In January 2024, [Kenneth Eugene Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Kenneth_Eugene_Smith "Execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith") became the first person executed by nitrogen asphyxiation.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-102)

### Liquid

Liquid nitrogen is a [cryogenic liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogen "Cryogen") which looks like [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"). When insulated in proper containers such as [dewar flasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewar_flask "Dewar flask"), it can be transported and stored with a low rate of [evaporative loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation").[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-103)

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/A_cylinder_container%2C_containing_liquid_nitrogen.jpg/250px-A_cylinder_container%2C_containing_liquid_nitrogen.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_cylinder_container,_containing_liquid_nitrogen.jpg)

A container vehicle carrying liquid nitrogen

Like [dry ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_ice "Dry ice"), the main use of liquid nitrogen is for cooling to low temperatures. It is used in the [cryopreservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation "Cryopreservation") of biological materials such as blood and reproductive cells ([sperm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm "Sperm") and [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovum "Ovum")). It is used in [cryotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy "Cryotherapy") to remove cysts and warts on the skin by freezing them.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-104) It is used in laboratory [cold traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_trap "Cold trap"), and in [cryopumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopump "Cryopump") to obtain lower pressures in [vacuum pumped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump "Vacuum pump") systems. It is used to cool heat-sensitive electronics such as [infrared detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_detector "Infrared detector") and [X-ray detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_detector "X-ray detector"). Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures where necessary. Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is often used for cooling even when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, [freeze-branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-branding "Freeze-branding") livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Greenwood409-84)

Safety

### Gas

Although nitrogen is non-toxic, when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an [asphyxiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_asphyxiation "Nitrogen asphyxiation") hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human [carotid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_body "Carotid body") is a relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-105) An example occurred shortly before the launch of the [first Space Shuttle mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1 "STS-1") on March 19, 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the [Space Shuttle's mobile launcher platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_launcher_platform#Saturn_V_and_Space_Shuttle "Mobile launcher platform") that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-106)

When inhaled at high [partial pressures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure "Partial pressure") (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30 m in [scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving "Scuba diving")), nitrogen is an anaesthetic agent, causing [nitrogen narcosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis "Nitrogen narcosis"), a temporary state of mental impairment similar to [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide") intoxication.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-107)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-108)

Nitrogen dissolves in the [blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood "Blood") and body fats. Rapid decompression (as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called [decompression sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness "Decompression sickness") (formerly known as caisson sickness or _the bends_), when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream, nerves, joints, and other sensitive or vital areas.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-DCShx-109)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-Kindwall-110) Bubbles from other "inert" gases (gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen) cause the same effects, so replacement of nitrogen in [breathing gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas "Breathing gas") may prevent nitrogen narcosis, but does not prevent decompression sickness.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-usn1-111)

### Liquid

As a [cryogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic "Cryogenic") liquid, liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing [cold burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_burn "Cold burn") on contact, although the [Leidenfrost effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect "Leidenfrost effect") provides protection for very short exposure (about one second).[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-112) Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, a young woman in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-113)

Because the liquid-to-gas [expansion ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_ratio "Expansion ratio") of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006, at [Texas A&M University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University "Texas A&M University"), the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2 m off their foundations.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-114)

Liquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-BCGACOPCP30-115)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-116)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-117) For example, [oxygen sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_sensor "Oxygen sensor") are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-usn-118)

Vessels containing liquid nitrogen can [condense oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen "Liquid oxygen") from air. The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183°C, higher than that of nitrogen) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-119)

### Oxygen deficiency monitors

Oxygen deficiency monitors are used to measure levels of oxygen in confined spaces and any place where nitrogen gas or liquid are stored or used. In the event of a nitrogen leak, and a decrease in oxygen to a pre-set alarm level, an oxygen deficiency monitor can be programmed to set off audible and visual alarms, thereby providing notification of the possible impending danger. Most commonly, the oxygen range to alert personnel is when oxygen levels get below 19.5%. OSHA specifies that a hazardous atmosphere may include one where the oxygen concentration is below 19.5% or above 23.5%.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#cite_note-120) Oxygen deficiency monitors can either be fixed, mounted to the wall and hard-wired into the building's power supply or simply plugged into a power outlet, or a portable hand-held or wearable monitor.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
