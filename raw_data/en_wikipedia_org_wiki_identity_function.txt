Graph of the identity function on the real numbers In mathematics , an identity function , also called an identity relation , identity map or identity transformation , is a function that always returns the value that was used as its argument , unchanged. That is, when f is the identity function, the equality f ( x ) = x is true for all values of x to which f can be applied.

Definition [ edit ] Formally, if X is a set , the identity function f on X is defined to be a function with X as its domain and codomain , satisfying f ( x ) = x for all elements x in X .

[ 1 ] In other words, the function value f ( x ) in the codomain X is always the same as the input element x in the domain X . The identity function on X is clearly an injective function as well as a surjective function (its codomain is also its range ), so it is bijective .

[ 2 ] The identity function f on X is often denoted by id X .

In set theory , where a function is defined as a particular kind of binary relation , the identity function is given by the identity relation , or diagonal of X .

[ 3 ] Algebraic properties [ edit ] If f : X → Y is any function, then f ∘ id X = f = id Y ∘ f , where "∘" denotes function composition .

[ 4 ] In particular, id X is the identity element of the monoid of all functions from X to X (under function composition).

Since the identity element of a monoid is unique , [ 5 ] one can alternately define the identity function on M to be this identity element. Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an identity morphism in category theory , where the endomorphisms of M need not be functions.

Properties [ edit ] The identity function is a linear operator when applied to vector spaces .

[ 6 ] In an n - dimensional vector space the identity function is represented by the identity matrix I n , regardless of the basis chosen for the space.

[ 7 ] The identity function on the positive integers is a completely multiplicative function (essentially multiplication by 1), considered in number theory .

[ 8 ] In a metric space the identity function is trivially an isometry . An object without any symmetry has as its symmetry group the trivial group containing only this isometry (symmetry type C 1 ).

[ 9 ] In a topological space , the identity function is always continuous .

[ 10 ] The identity function is idempotent .
