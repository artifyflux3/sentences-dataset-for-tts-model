Latitude 36° 32′ N to 39° 28′ N Longitude 75° 15′ W to 83° 41′ W Website virginia .gov Virginia , officially the Commonwealth of Virginia , [ a ] is a state in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains . The state's capital is Richmond and its most populous city is Virginia Beach . Its most populous subdivision is Fairfax County , part of Northern Virginia , where slightly over a third of Virginia's population of more than 8.8 million live.

Eastern Virginia is part of the Atlantic Plain , and the Middle Peninsula forms the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay . Central Virginia lies predominantly in the Piedmont , the foothill region of the Blue Ridge Mountains , which cross the western and southwestern parts of the state. The fertile Shenandoah Valley fosters the state's most productive agricultural counties, while the economy in Northern Virginia is driven by technology companies and U.S. federal government agencies.

Hampton Roads is also the site of the region's main seaport and Naval Station Norfolk , the world's largest naval base.

Virginian history begins with several Indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607, the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World , leading to Virginia's nickname as the Old Dominion . Slaves from Africa and land from displaced native tribes fueled the growing plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony. Virginians fought for the independence of the Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolution , and helped establish the new national government. During the American Civil War , the state government in Richmond joined the Confederacy , while many northwestern counties remained loyal to the Union , which led to the separation of West Virginia in 1863.

Although the state was under one-party Democratic rule for nearly a century following the Reconstruction era , both major political parties have been competitive in Virginia since the repeal of racial segregation laws in the 1960s and 1970s. Virginia's state legislature is the Virginia General Assembly , which was established in July 1619, making it the oldest current law-making body in North America . Unlike other states, cities and counties in Virginia function as equals, but the state government manages most local roads. It is also the only state where governors are prohibited from serving consecutive terms.

History Main article: History of Virginia Earliest inhabitants Main article: Native American tribes in Virginia The story of Pocahontas was simplified and romanticized by later artists and authors, including Smith himself, and promoted by her descendants, some of whom married into elite colonial families .

[ 5 ] Nomadic hunters are estimated to have arrived in Virginia around 17,000 years ago. Evidence from Daugherty's Cave shows it was regularly used as a rock shelter by 9,800 years ago.

[ 6 ] During the late Woodland period (500–1000 CE ), tribes coalesced, and farming, first of corn and squash, began, with beans and tobacco arriving from the southwest and Mexico by the end of the period.

Palisaded towns began to be built around 1200. The native population in the current boundaries of Virginia reached around 50,000 in the 1500s.

[ 7 ] Large groups in the area at that time included the Algonquian in the Tidewater region , which they referred to as Tsenacommacah , the Iroquoian -speaking Nottoway and Meherrin to the north and south, and the Tutelo , who spoke Siouan , to the west.

[ 8 ] In response to threats from these other groups to their trade network, thirty or so Virginia Algonquian -speaking tribes consolidated during the 1570s under Wahunsenacawh, known in English as Chief Powhatan .

[ 8 ] Powhatan controlled more than 150 settlements that had a total population of around 15,000 in 1607.

[ 9 ] Three-fourths of the native population in Virginia, however, died from smallpox and other Old World diseases during that century, [ 10 ] disrupting their oral traditions and complicating research into earlier periods.

[ 11 ] Additionally, many primary sources, including those that mention Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas , were created by Europeans, who may have held biases or misunderstood native social structures and customs.

[ 5 ] [ 12 ] Colony Main article: Colony of Virginia Several European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits , explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century.

[ 13 ] To help counter Spain's colonies in the Caribbean , Queen Elizabeth I of England supported Walter Raleigh 's 1584 expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The name "Virginia" was used by Captain Arthur Barlowe in the expedition's report, and may have been suggested by Raleigh or Elizabeth (perhaps noting her status as the "Virgin Queen" or that they viewed the land as being untouched) or related to an Algonquin phrase, Wingandacoa or Windgancon , or leader's name, Wingina , as heard by the expedition.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The name initially applied to the entire coastal region from South Carolina in the south to Maine in the north, along with the island of Bermuda .

[ 18 ] Raleigh's colony failed, but the potential financial and strategic gains still captivated many English policymakers. In 1606, King James I issued a charter for a new colony to the Virginia Company of London . The group financed an expedition under Christopher Newport that established a settlement named Jamestown in 1607.

[ 19 ] Though more settlers soon joined, many were ill-prepared for the dangers of the new settlement. As the colony's president, John Smith secured food for the colonists from nearby tribes, but after he left in 1609, this trade stopped and a series of ambush-style killings between colonists and natives under Chief Powhatan and his brother began, resulting in mass starvation in the colony that winter.

[ 20 ] By the end of the colony's first fourteen years, over eighty percent of the roughly eight thousand settlers transported there had died.

[ 21 ] Demand for exported tobacco , however, fueled the need for more workers.

[ 22 ] Starting in 1618, the headright system tried to solve this by granting colonists farmland for their help attracting indentured servants .

[ 23 ] Enslaved Africans were first sold in Virginia in 1619. Though other Africans arrived as indentured servants and could be freed after four to seven years, the basis for lifelong slavery was developed in legal cases like those of John Punch in 1640 and John Casor in 1655.

[ 24 ] Laws passed in Jamestown defined slavery as race-based in 1661, as inherited maternally in 1662, and as enforceable by death in 1669.

[ 25 ] In 1699, after the statehouse in Jamestown was destroyed by fire, the Colony of Virginia 's capitol was moved to Williamsburg , where the College of William & Mary was founded six years earlier.

[ 26 ] From the colony's start, residents agitated for greater local control, and in 1619, certain male colonists began electing representatives to an assembly, later called the House of Burgesses , that negotiated issues with the governing council appointed by the London Company.

[ 27 ] Unhappy with this arrangement, the monarchy revoked the company's charter and began directly naming governors and Council members in 1624. In 1635, colonists arrested a governor who ignored the assembly and sent him back to England against his will.

[ 28 ] William Berkeley was named governor in 1642, just as the turmoil of the English Civil War and Interregnum permitted the colony greater autonomy.

[ 29 ] As a supporter of the king, Berkeley welcomed other Cavaliers who fled to Virginia. He surrendered to Parliamentarians in 1652, but after the 1660 Restoration made him governor again, he blocked assembly elections and exacerbated the class divide by disenfranchising and restricting the movement of indentured servants, who made up around eighty percent of the workforce.

[ 30 ] On the colony's frontier, tribes like the Tutelo and Doeg were being squeezed by Seneca raiders from the north, leading to more confrontations with colonists. In 1676, several hundred working-class followers of Nathaniel Bacon , upset by Berkeley's refusal to retaliate against the tribes, burned Jamestown.

[ 31 ] Bacon's Rebellion forced the signing of Bacon's Laws , which restored some of the colony's rights and sanctioned both attacks on native tribes and the enslavement of their people.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Treaty of 1677 further reduced the independence of the tribes that signed it, and aided the colony's assimilation of their land in the years that followed.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Colonists in the 1700s were pushing westward into the area held by the Seneca and their larger Iroquois Nation , and in 1748, a group of wealthy speculators, backed by the British monarchy, formed the Ohio Company to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains .

[ 36 ] France, which claimed this area as part of New France , viewed this as a threat, and in 1754 the French and Indian War engulfed England, France, the Iroquois, and other allied tribes on both sides. A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment , was led by Major George Washington , himself one of the investors in the Ohio Company.

[ 37 ] Statehood See also: Virginia in the American Revolution In 1765, Patrick Henry led a protest of the unpopular Stamp Act in the House of Burgesses , later depicted in this portrait by Peter F. Rothermel .

In the decade following the French and Indian War , the British Parliament passed new taxes which were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses , opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee , among others.

[ 38 ] Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year.

[ 39 ] After the House of Burgesses was dissolved in 1774 by the royal governor , Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions . On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence and adopted George Mason 's Virginia Declaration of Rights , which was then included in a new constitution that designated Virginia as a commonwealth .

[ 40 ] Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson , drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence .

[ 41 ] After the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia to head the Continental Army , and many Virginians joined the army and revolutionary militias. Virginia was the first colony to ratify the Articles of Confederation in December 1777.

[ 42 ] In April 1780, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack.

[ 43 ] British forces under Benedict Arnold did take Portsmouth in December 1780, and raided Richmond the following month.

[ 44 ] The British army had over seven thousand soldiers and twenty-five warships stationed in Virginia at the beginning of 1781, but General Charles Cornwallis and his superiors were indecisive, and maneuvers by the three thousand soldiers under the Marquis de Lafayette and twenty-nine allied French warships together managed to confine the British to a swampy area of the Virginia Peninsula in September. Around sixteen thousand soldiers under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau quickly converged there and defeated Cornwallis in the siege of Yorktown .

[ 45 ] His surrender on October 19, 1781, led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.

[ 46 ] Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution : James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789.

[ 41 ] Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives . Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. Virginia is called the "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states such as Kentucky , and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.

[ 47 ] Civil War Main article: Virginia in the American Civil War Eyre Crowe 's 1853 portrait, Slaves Waiting for Sale: Richmond, Virginia , which he completed after visiting Richmond 's slave markets, where thousands were sold annually [ 48 ] Between 1790 and 1860, the number of slaves in Virginia rose from around 290 thousand to over 490 thousand, roughly one-third of the state population, and the number of slave owners rose to over 50 thousand. Both of these numbers represented the most in the U.S.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] The boom in Southern cotton production using cotton gins to harvest upland cotton increased the amount of labor needed, but new federal laws prohibited the importation of slaves. Decades of monoculture tobacco farming had also degraded Virginia's agricultural productivity .

[ 51 ] Virginia plantations increasingly turned to exporting slaves , which broke up countless families and made the breeding of slaves , often through rape, a profitable business.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Slaves in the Richmond area were also forced into industrial jobs, including mining and shipbuilding.

[ 54 ] The failed slave uprisings of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, George Boxley in 1815, and Nat Turner in 1831, however, marked the growing resistance to slavery. Afraid of further uprisings, Virginia's government in the 1830s encouraged free Blacks to migrate to Liberia .

[ 51 ] On October 16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown led a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia , in an attempt to start a slave revolt across the southern states. The polarized national response to his raid, capture, trial, and execution that December marked a tipping point for many who believed slavery would need to be ended by force.

[ 55 ] Abraham Lincoln 's 1860 election further convinced many southern supporters of slavery that his opposition to its expansion would ultimately mean the end of slavery across the country. The seizure of Fort Sumter by Confederate forces on April 14, 1861, prompted Lincoln to call for the federalization of 75,000 militiamen .

[ 56 ] The Confederacy used Richmond as their capital from May 1861 till April 1865, when they abandoned the city and set fire to its downtown .

The Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted on April 17 to secede on the condition it was approved in a referendum the next month. The convention voted to join the Confederacy, which named Richmond its capital on May 20.

[ 47 ] During the May 23 referendum, armed pro-Confederate groups prevented the casting and counting of votes from areas that opposed secession. Representatives from 27 of these northwestern counties instead began the Wheeling Convention , which organized a government loyal to the Union and led to the separation of West Virginia as a new state.

[ 57 ] The armies of the Union and Confederacy first met on July 21, 1861, in Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia , a bloody Confederate victory. Union General George B. McClellan organized the Army of the Potomac , which landed on the Virginia Peninsula in March 1862 and reached the outskirts of Richmond that June. With Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston wounded in fighting outside the city, command of his Army of Northern Virginia fell to Robert E. Lee . Over the next month, Lee drove the Union army back , and starting that September led the first of several invasions into Union territory. During the next three years of war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including the battles of Fredericksburg , Chancellorsville , Spotsylvania , and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House , where Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865.

[ 58 ] Reconstruction and segregation With nearly 800,000 soldiers passing through, Hampton Roads was the second-largest port of embarkation during World War I .

[ 59 ] Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the Committee of Nine .

[ 60 ] During the post-war Reconstruction era , African Americans were able to unite in communities, particularly around Richmond , Danville , and the Tidewater region , and take a greater role in Virginia society; many achieved some land ownership during the 1870s.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Virginia adopted a constitution in 1868 which guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights , and provided for free public schools.

[ 63 ] However, with many railroad lines and other infrastructure destroyed during the Civil War, the Commonwealth was deeply in debt, and in the late 1870s redirected money from public schools to pay bondholders. The Readjuster Party formed in 1877 and won legislative power in 1879 by uniting Black and white Virginians behind a shared opposition to debt payments and the perceived plantation elites .

[ 64 ] The Readjusters focused on building up schools, like Virginia Tech and Virginia State , and successfully forced West Virginia to share in the pre-war debt.

[ 65 ] But in 1883, they were divided by a proposed repeal of anti-miscegenation laws , and days before that year's election, a riot in Danville , involving armed policemen, left four Black men and one white man dead.

[ 66 ] These events motivated a push by white supremacists to seize political power through voter suppression , and segregationists in the Democratic Party won the legislature that year and maintained control for decades.

[ 67 ] They passed Jim Crow laws that established a racially segregated society , and in 1902 rewrote the state constitution to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites.

[ 68 ] New economic forces meanwhile industrialized the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new large-scale production centered around Richmond. Railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding in 1886, which was responsible for building 38 warships for the U.S. Navy between 1907 and 1923.

[ 69 ] During World War I , German submarines attacked ships outside the port, [ 70 ] which was a major site for transportation of soldiers and supplies.

[ 59 ] After the war, a homecoming parade to honor African-American troops was attacked in July 1919 by the city's police as part of a renewed white-supremacy movement, known as Red Summer .

[ 71 ] The shipyard continued building warships in World War II , and quadrupled its pre-war labor force to 70,000 by 1943. The Radford Arsenal outside Blacksburg also employed 22,000 workers making explosives, [ 72 ] while the Torpedo Factory in Alexandria had over 5,050.

[ 73 ] Civil rights to present Protests in 2020 focused on Confederate monuments in the state .

High-school student Barbara Rose Johns started a strike in 1951 at her underfunded and segregated school in Prince Edward County . The protests led Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill to file a lawsuit against the county . Their case joined Brown v. Board of Education at the Supreme Court, which rejected the doctrine of " separate but equal " in 1954. The segregationist establishment, led by Senator Harry F. Byrd and his Byrd Organization , reacted with a strategy called " massive resistance ", and the General Assembly passed a package of laws in 1956 that cut off funding to local schools that desegregated , causing some to close. Courts ruled the strategy unconstitutional, and on February 2, 1959, Black students integrated schools in Arlington and Norfolk , where they were known as the Norfolk 17 .

[ 74 ] Rather than integrate, county leaders in Prince Edward shut their school system in June 1959. When litigation again reached the Supreme Court , it ordered the county to reopen and integrate its schools, which finally happened in September 1964.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Federal passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965), and their later enforcement by the Justice Department , helped end racial segregation in Virginia and overturn Jim Crow laws .

[ 77 ] In 1967, the Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia . In 1968, Governor Mills Godwin called a commission to rewrite the state constitution. The new constitution, which banned discrimination and removed articles that now violated federal law, passed in a referendum and went into effect in 1971.

[ 78 ] In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States, and in 1992, Bobby Scott became the first Black congressman from Virginia since 1888.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The expansion of federal government offices into Northern Virginia's suburbs during the Cold War boosted the region's population and economy.

[ 81 ] The Central Intelligence Agency outgrew their offices in Foggy Bottom during the Korean War , and moved to Langley in 1961, in part due to a decision by the National Security Council that the agency relocate outside the District of Columbia.

[ 82 ] The Pentagon , built in Arlington during World War II as the headquarters of the Department of Defense, was struck by a hijacked plane in the September 11, 2001 attacks .

[ 83 ] Mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and in Virginia Beach in 2019 led to passage of gun control measures in 2020.

[ 84 ] Racial injustice and the presence of Confederate monuments in Virginia have also led to large demonstrations, including in August 2017, when a white supremacist drove his car into protesters , killing one, and in June 2020, when protests that were part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement brought about the removal of Confederate statues .

[ 85 ] Geography Main article: Environment of Virginia Virginia is shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains , the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed, and the parallel 36°30′ north .

Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Virginia has a total area of 42,774.2 square miles (110,784.7 km 2 ), including 3,180.13 square miles (8,236.5 km 2 ) of water, making it the 35th- largest state by area.

[ 88 ] It is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C.

to the northeast; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina to the south; by Tennessee to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the northwest. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C., the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River , has been an issue for water rights .

[ 89 ] Virginia's southern border was defined in 1665 as 36°30' north latitude . Surveyors marking the border with North Carolina in the 18th century however started about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to the north and drifted an additional 3.5 miles by the border's westernmost point .

[ 90 ] After Tennessee joined the U.S. in 1796, new surveyors worked in 1802 and 1803 to reset their border with Virginia as a line from the summit of White Top Mountain to the top of Tri-State Peak in the Cumberland Mountains . However, deviations in that border were identified when it was re-marked in 1856, and the Virginia General Assembly proposed a new surveying commission in 1871. Representatives from Tennessee preferred to keep the less-straight 1803 line, and in 1893, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for them against Virginia .

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] One result is how the city of Bristol is divided in two between the states.

[ 93 ] Geology and terrain Main article: Geology of Virginia Great Falls is on the fall line of the Potomac River , and its rocks date to the late Precambrian .

[ 94 ] The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore . The bay was formed from the drowned river valley of the ancient Susquehanna River .

[ 95 ] Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac , Rappahannock , York , and James , which create three peninsulas in the bay, traditionally referred to as "necks" named Northern Neck , Middle Peninsula , and the Virginia Peninsula from north to south.

[ 96 ] Sea level rise has eroded the land on Virginia's islands, which include Tangier Island in the bay and Chincoteague , one of 23 barrier islands on the Atlantic coast.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line . It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock -based foothills east of the mountains.

[ 99 ] The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains around Charlottesville .

[ 100 ] The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the Commonwealth, the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet (1,746 m).

[ 2 ] The Ridge-and-Valley region is west of the mountains, carbonate rock based, and includes the Massanutten Mountain ridge and the Great Appalachian Valley , which is called the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, named after the river of the same name that flows through it.

[ 101 ] The Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the Allegheny Plateau . In this region, rivers flow northwest into the Ohio River basin.

[ 102 ] Virginia's seismic zones have not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude . The Commonwealth's largest earthquake in at least a century, at a magnitude of 5.8, struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011 .

[ 103 ] 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting Chesapeake Bay impact crater may explain what earthquakes and subsidence the region does experience.

[ 104 ] A meteor impact is also theorized as the source of Lake Drummond , the largest of the two natural lakes in the state .

[ 105 ] The Commonwealth's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 limestone caves , ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular Luray Caverns and Skyline Caverns .

[ 106 ] Virginia's iconic Natural Bridge is the remaining roof of a collapsed limestone cave.

[ 107 ] Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions.

[ 108 ] More than 72 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate , kyanite , sand, or gravel, were mined in Virginia in 2020 [update] .

[ 109 ] The largest known deposits of uranium in the U.S. are under Coles Hill, Virginia . Despite a challenge that reached the U.S. Supreme Court twice , the state has banned its mining since 1982 due to environmental and public health concerns.

[ 111 ] Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 25 °F (−4 °C) in January to average highs of 86 °F (30 °C) in July.

[ 112 ] The Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Stream have a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas, making the climate there warmer but also more constant. Most of Virginia's recorded extremes in temperature and precipitation have occurred in the Blue Ridge Mountains and areas west.

[ 113 ] Virginia receives an average of 43.47 inches (110 cm) of precipitation annually, [ 112 ] with the Shenandoah Valley being the state's driest region.

[ 113 ] Virginia has around 35–45 days with thunderstorms annually, and storms are common in the late afternoon and evenings between April and September.

[ 114 ] These months are also the most common for tornadoes , [ 115 ] twelve of which touched down in the Commonwealth in 2024.

[ 116 ] Hurricanes and tropical storms can occur from August to October. The deadliest natural disaster in Virginia was Hurricane Camille , which killed over 150 people in 1969 mainly in inland Nelson County .

[ 113 ] [ 117 ] Between December and March, cold-air damming caused by the Appalachian Mountains can lead to significant snowfalls across the state, such as the January 2016 blizzard , which created the state's highest recorded one-day snowfall of 36.6 inches (93 cm) near Bluemont .

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] On average, cities in Virginia can receive between 5.8–12.3 inches (15–31 cm) of snow annually, but recent winters have seen below-average snowfalls, and much of Virginia had no measurable snow during the 2022–2023 winter season.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] Climate change in Virginia is leading to higher temperatures year-round as well as more heavy rain and flooding events.

[ 122 ] Urban heat islands can be found in many Virginia cities and suburbs, particularly in neighborhoods linked to historic redlining .

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] The air in Virginia has statistically improved since 1998.

[ 125 ] The closure and conversion of coal power plants in Virginia and the Ohio Valley region has helped cut the amount of particulate matter in Virginia's air in half.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] Current plans call for 30% of the Commonwealth's electricity to be renewable by 2030 and for all to be carbon-free by 2050.

[ 128 ] Ecosystem See also: List of endangered species in Virginia Up to 7,000 white-tailed deer , also known as Virginia deer, live in Shenandoah National Park .

[ 129 ] Forests cover 62% of Virginia as of 2021 [update] , of which 80% is considered hardwood forest, meaning that trees are primarily deciduous and broad-leaved . The other 20% is pine, with loblolly and shortleaf pine dominating much of central and eastern Virginia.

[ 130 ] In the western and mountainous parts of the Commonwealth, oak and hickory are most common, while lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of hemlocks and mosses in abundance.

[ 113 ] Spongy moth infestations in oak trees and the blight in chestnut trees have decreased both of their numbers, leaving more room for hickory and the invasive tree of heaven .

[ 131 ] [ 113 ] In the lowland tidewater and Piedmont , yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps.

[ 130 ] Other common trees include red spruce, Atlantic white cedar , tulip-poplar , and the flowering dogwood , the state tree and flower .

[ 132 ] Plants like milkweed , dandelions, daisies, ferns, and Virginia creeper , which is featured on the state flag , are also common.

[ 133 ] The Thompson Wildlife Area in Fauquier is known for having one of the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America.

[ 113 ] White-tailed deer , one of 75 mammal species found in Virginia, rebounded from an estimated population of as few as 25,000 in the 1930s to over one million by the 2010s.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] Native carnivorans include black bears , who have a population of around five to six thousand in the state, [ 136 ] as well as bobcats , coyotes , both gray and red foxes , raccoons , weasels and skunks . Rodents include groundhogs , nutria , beavers , both gray squirrels and fox squirrels , chipmunks, and Allegheny woodrats , while the seventeen bat species include brown bats and the Virginia big-eared bat , the state mammal .

[ 142 ] Peregrine falcons , whose numbers dramatically declined due to DDT poisoning in the middle of the 20th century, are the focus of conservation efforts in the state and a reintroduction program in Shenandoah National Park .

[ 143 ] Virginia has 226 species of freshwater fish from 25 families, a diversity attributable to the area's varied and humid climate, topography, interconnected river system, and lack of Pleistocene glaciers . Common examples on the Cumberland Plateau and higher-elevation regions include Eastern blacknose dace , sculpin , smallmouth bass , redhorse sucker , Kanawha darter , and brook trout , the state fish . Downhill in the Piedmont, stripeback darter and Roanoke bass become common, as do swampfish , bluespotted sunfish , and pirate perch in the Tidewater .

[ 144 ] The Chesapeake Bay hosts clams, oysters, and 350 species of saltwater and estuarine fish , including the bay's most abundant finfish, the Bay anchovy , as well as the invasive blue catfish .

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] An estimated 238 million Chesapeake blue crabs live in the bay as of 2025 [update] .

[ 147 ] There are 34 native species of crayfish, like the Big Sandy .

[ 148 ] [ 113 ] Amphibians found in Virginia include the Cumberland Plateau salamander and Eastern hellbender , [ 149 ] while the northern watersnake is the most common of the 32 snake species.

[ 150 ] Protected lands See also: List of Virginia state parks Oak trees produce a haze of isoprene , which helps give the Blue Ridge Mountains their signature color.

[ 151 ] As of 2019 [update] , roughly 16.2% of land in the Commonwealth is protected by federal, state, and local governments and non-profits.

[ 152 ] Federal lands account for the majority, with thirty National Park Service units, such as Great Falls Park and the Appalachian Trail , and one national park, Shenandoah .

[ 153 ] Almost forty percent of Shenandoah's total 199,173 acres (806 km 2 ) area has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System .

[ 154 ] The U.S. Forest Service administers the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests , which cover more than 1.6 million acres (6,500 km 2 ) within Virginia's mountains, and continue into West Virginia and Kentucky .

[ 155 ] The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge also extends into North Carolina, as does the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge , which marks the beginning of the Outer Banks .

[ 156 ] State agencies control about one-third of protected land in the state, [ 152 ] and the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation manages over 75,900 acres (307.2 km 2 ) in forty Virginia state parks and 59,222 acres (239.7 km 2 ) in 65 Natural Area Preserves , plus three undeveloped parks.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] Breaks Interstate Park crosses the Kentucky border and is one of only two inter-state parks in the United States.

[ 159 ] Sustainable logging is allowed in 26 state forests managed by the Virginia Department of Forestry totaling 71,972 acres (291.3 km 2 ), [ 160 ] as is hunting in 44 Wildlife Management Areas run by the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources covering over 205,000 acres (829.6 km 2 ).

[ 161 ] The Chesapeake Bay is not a national park, but is protected by both state and federal legislation and the inter-state Chesapeake Bay Program .

[ 162 ] Cities and towns See also: Political subdivisions of Virginia and Virginia statistical areas The population density of Virginia counties and cities as of 2020 Virginia is divided into 95 counties and 38 independent cities , which the U.S. Census Bureau describes as county-equivalents .

[ 163 ] This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia and stretches back to the influence of Williamsburg and Norfolk in the colonial period.

[ 164 ] Only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the US.

[ 165 ] The differences between counties and cities in Virginia are small and have to do with how each assess new taxes, whether a referendum is necessary to issue bonds, and with the application of Dillon's Rule , which limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand acts expressly allowed by the General Assembly .

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] Counties can also have incorporated towns , and while there are no further administrative subdivisions , the Census Bureau recognizes several hundred unincorporated communities .

Arlington County in Northern Virginia was once part of Washington, D.C.

Over three million people, 35% of Virginians, live in the twenty jurisdictions collectively defined as Northern Virginia , part of the larger Washington metropolitan area and the Northeast megalopolis .

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] Fairfax County , with more than 1.1 million residents, is Virginia's most populous jurisdiction, [ 170 ] and has a major urban business and shopping center in Tysons , Virginia's largest office market.

[ 171 ] Neighboring Prince William County , with over 450,000 residents, is Virginia's second-most populous county and home to Marine Corps Base Quantico , the FBI Academy , and Manassas National Battlefield Park .

Arlington County is the smallest self-governing county in the U.S. by land area, [ 172 ] and local politicians have proposed reorganizing it as an independent city due to its high density.

[ 166 ] Loudoun County is the fastest-growing county in the state.

[ 170 ] [ 173 ] In western Virginia, Roanoke city and Montgomery County , part of the Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area , both have surpassed a population of 100,000 since 2018.

[ 174 ] On the western edge of the Tidewater region is Virginia's capital, Richmond , which has a population of around 230,000 in its city proper and over 1.3 million in its metropolitan area. On the eastern edge is the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, where over 1.7 million reside across six counties and nine cities, including the Commonwealth's three most populous independent cities: Virginia Beach , Chesapeake , and Norfolk .

[ 168 ] [ 175 ] Neighboring Suffolk , which includes a portion of the Great Dismal Swamp , is the largest city by area at 429.1 square miles (1,111 km 2 ).

[ 176 ] One reason for the concentration of independent cities in the Tidewater region is that several rural counties there re-incorporated as cities or consolidated with existing cities to try to hold on to their new suburban neighborhoods that started booming in the 1950s , since cities like Norfolk and Portsmouth were able to annex land from adjoining counties until a moratorium in 1987.

[ 177 ] Others, like Poquoson , became cities to try to preserve racial segregation during the desegregation era of the 1970s.

Another 23,149 Virginians live overseas, giving the state a total population of 8,654,542. Virginia has the fourth-largest overseas population of U.S. states due to its federal employees and military personnel.

[ 181 ] The fertility rate in Virginia as of 2020 [update] was 55.8 per 1,000 females between the ages of 15 and 44, [ 182 ] and the median age as of 2021 [update] was the same as the national average of 38.8 years old.

[ 175 ] The geographic center of population is located northwest of Richmond in Hanover County , as of 2020 [update] .

[ 183 ] Though still growing naturally as births outnumber deaths, Virginia has had a negative net migration rate since 2013, with 8,995 more people leaving the state than moving to it in 2021. This is largely credited to high home prices in Northern Virginia, [ 184 ] which are driving residents there to relocate south; Raleigh is their top destination.

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] Aside from Virginia, the top birth state for Virginians is New York , with the Northeast accounting for the largest number of domestic migrants into the state by region.

[ 187 ] About twelve percent of residents were born outside the United States as of 2020 [update] .

El Salvador is the most common foreign country of birth, with India , Mexico , South Korea , the Philippines , and Vietnam as other common birthplaces.

[ 188 ] Race and ethnicity The state's most populous racial group, non-Hispanic whites , has declined as a proportion of the population from 76% in 1990 to 58.6% in 2020.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] Immigrants from Britain and Ireland settled throughout the Commonwealth during the colonial period, [ 191 ] when roughly three-fourths of immigrants came as indentured servants .

[ 192 ] The Appalachian mountains and Shenandoah Valley have many settlements that were populated by German and Scotch-Irish immigrants in the 18th and 19th centuries, often following the Great Wagon Road .

[ 193 ] [ 194 ] Over ten percent of Virginians have German ancestry as of 2020 [update] .

[ 195 ] New citizens attend a naturalization ceremony in Northern Virginia , where 25% of residents are foreign-born, almost twice the overall state average.

[ 188 ] The largest minority group in Virginia are Blacks and African Americans, about one-fifth of the population.

[ 190 ] Virginia was a major destination of the Atlantic slave trade . The Igbo ethnic group of what is now southern Nigeria were the largest African group among slaves in Virginia.

[ 196 ] Blacks in Virginia also have more European ancestry than those in other southern states, and DNA analysis shows many have asymmetrical male and female ancestry from before the Civil War, evidence of European fathers and African or Native American mothers.

[ 197 ] [ 198 ] Though the Black population was reduced by the Great Migration to northern industrial cities in the first half of the 20th century, since 1965 there has been a reverse migration of Blacks returning south .

[ 199 ] The Commonwealth has the highest number of Black-white interracial marriages in the US , [ 200 ] and 8.2% of Virginians describe themselves as multiracial .

[ 3 ] More recent immigration since the late 20th century has resulted in new communities of Hispanics and Asians. As of 2020 [update] , 10.5% of Virginia's total population describe themselves as Hispanic or Latino , and 8.8% as Asian .

[ 3 ] The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics in the state living in Northern Virginia .

[ 201 ] Northern Virginia also has a significant population of Vietnamese Americans , whose major wave of immigration followed the Vietnam War .

[ 202 ] Korean Americans have migrated there more recently, [ 203 ] while about 45,000 Filipino Americans have settled in the Hampton Roads area.

[ 204 ] Governor Glenn Youngkin receiving a ceremonial tribute from representatives of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey tribes, a Thanksgiving tradition since 1677.

[ 205 ] Tribal membership in Virginia is complicated by the legacy of the state's " pencil genocide " of intentionally categorizing Native Americans and Blacks together, and many tribal members do have African or European ancestry, or both.

[ 206 ] In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau found that only 0.5% of Virginians were exclusively American Indian or Alaska Native , though 2.1% were in some combination with other ethnicities.

[ 190 ] The state government has extended recognition to eleven tribes. Seven tribes also have federal recognition.

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] The Pamunkey and Mattaponi have reservations on tributaries of the York River in the Tidewater region .

Spanish is the next most commonly spoken language, with 7.5% (611,831) of Virginia households, though age is a factor; 8.7% (120,560) of Virginians under age eighteen speak Spanish.

Arabic was the third most commonly spoken language with around 0.8% of residents, followed by Chinese languages and Vietnamese each with over 0.7%, and then Korean and Tagalog , just under 0.7% and 0.6% respectively.

[ 210 ] English was passed as the Commonwealth's official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996, though the status is not mandated by the constitution.

[ 211 ] While a more homogenized American English is found in urban areas, and the use of Southern accents in general has been on the decline in speakers born since the 1960s, [ 212 ] various accents are still present.

[ 213 ] The Piedmont region is known for its non-rhotic dialect's strong influence on Southern American English , and a BBC America study in 2014 ranked it as one of the most identifiable accents in American English.

[ 214 ] The Tidewater accent evolved from the language that upper-class English typically spoke in the early Colonial period, while the Appalachian accent has much more influence from the English spoken by Scottish and Irish immigrants from that time.

[ 213 ] [ 215 ] Appalachian stereotypes have, however, led to some from the region code-switching to a less distinct English accent.

[ 216 ] The English spoken on Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay , preserved by the island's isolation, contains many phrases and euphemisms not found anywhere else and retains elements of Early Modern English .

[ 217 ] [ 218 ] Religion See also: Religion in early Virginia Religious Tradition ( 2023 ) Unaffiliated (29.0%) Protestantism (46.0%) Catholicism (16.0%) Jehovah's Witnesses (2.00%) Judaism (2.00%) Eastern Orthodoxy (1.00%) Islam (1.00%) Mormonism (1.00%) Unitarian Universalism (1.00%) Other (1.00%) Virginia enshrined religious freedom in a 1786 statute . Though the state is historically part of America's Bible Belt , the 2023 Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey estimated that 55% of Virginians either seldom or never attend religious services, ahead of the national average of 53.2%, and that the percent of Virginians unaffiliated with any particular religious body had increased from 21% in 2013 to 29% in 2023.

[ 219 ] The 2020 U.S. Religion Census conducted by the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) similarly found that 55% of Virginians attend none of the state's 10,477 congregations.

[ 220 ] Overall belief in God has also declined in the South region , of which Virginia is a part, from 93% of respondents in Gallup surveys from 2013 to 2017, to 86% in 2022.

[ 221 ] Of the 45% of Virginians who were associated with religious bodies in the 2020 ARDA census, Evangelical Protestants made up the largest overall grouping, with 20.3% of the state's population, while 8.1% and 2% were mainline and Black Protestant respectively.

Baptists , 84% of which are counted as Evangelical, included 9.4% of Virginians in that census.

[ 222 ] Their major division is between the Baptist General Association of Virginia , which formed in 1823, and the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia , which split off in 1996. Other Protestant branches with over one percent of Virginians included Pentecostalism (1.8%), Presbyterianism (1.3%), Anglicanism (1.2%), and Adventism (1%).

[ 222 ] The 2023 PRRI survey estimated that 46% of Virginians were Protestants, with 14% each as White Evangelical, White Mainline, and Black, though these numbers include individuals who report not attending services.

[ 219 ] Since 1927, Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County has hosted an annual nondenominational sunrise service every Easter.

[ 223 ] Catholics accounted for 10.3% in the 2020 ARDA census, [ 222 ] and 16% in the 2023 PRRI survey, which divided them into 9% White Catholic, 6% Hispanic Catholic, and 1% other.

[ 219 ] Catholic churches are organized in either the Diocese of Arlington or Richmond , while Episcopal churches are similarly in their Diocese of Virginia , Southern Virginia , and Southwestern Virginia . Adherents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints constitute just over one percent of the population, with 210 congregations in Virginia as of 2024 [update] .

[ 224 ] While the state's Jewish population is small, organized Jewish sites date to 1789 with Congregation Beth Ahabah .

[ 225 ] Fairfax County is the state's most religiously diverse jurisdiction.

[ 220 ] Fairfax Station is the site of the Ekoji Buddhist Temple , of the Jōdo Shinshū school, and the Hindu Durga Temple of Virginia . The All Dulles Area Muslim Society , on the county's border in Sterling , considers its eleven branches the country's second-largest Muslim mosque community.

[ 226 ] McLean Bible Church , with around 16,500 weekly visitors, is among the top 25 largest megachurches in the U.S. and 8.4% of Virginians attend nondenomination Christian churches like it, according to the 2020 ARDA census.

[ 227 ] [ 222 ] Lynchburg and Roanoke ranked in that census as the two metropolitan areas with the highest rates of religious adherence, while the state-college-dominated Blacksburg–Christiansburg and Charlottesville were the lowest.

[ 222 ] Two major Christian universities, Liberty University and the University of Lynchburg , are based in Lynchburg, while Regent University is in Virginia Beach .

Loudoun County meanwhile has the highest median household income in the nation, and the wider Northern Virginia region is among the highest-income regions nationwide.

[ 233 ] As of 2022 [update] , eighteen of the hundred highest-income counties in the United States , including the two highest, are located in Northern Virginia.

[ 234 ] Though median home prices in Virginia are generally above the national average, particularly in Northern Virginia, where they were 44.8% higher in May 2024, at $760,000, [ 235 ] 69.1% of Virginians own their home as of 2023 [update] .

[ 236 ] The Hampton Roads region has the state's highest per capita number of homeless individuals, with 11 per 10,000, as of 2020 [update] .

[ 237 ] Though the Gini index shows Virginia has less income inequality than the national average, [ 238 ] the state's middle class is also smaller than the majority of states.

[ 314 ] Law and government Main article: Government of Virginia The Virginia State Capitol in Richmond , designed by Thomas Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau , is home to the Virginia General Assembly .

In 1619, the first Virginia General Assembly met, making Virginia's legislature the oldest of its kind in North America.

[ 315 ] The government today functions under the seventh Constitution of Virginia , which was approved by voters in 1970 and went into effect in July 1971.

[ 78 ] It is similar to the federal structure in that it provides for three branches : a strong legislature, an executive, and a unified judicial system.

[ 316 ] Virginia's legislature is bicameral , with a 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate , who together write the laws for the Commonwealth. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve four-year terms, with the most recent elections for both taking place in November 2023. The executive department includes the governor , lieutenant governor , and attorney general , who are elected every four years in separate elections, with the next taking place in November 2025 .

Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election; governors can and have served non-consecutive terms.

[ 317 ] The lieutenant governor is the official head of the Senate and is responsible for breaking ties. The House elects a Speaker of the House and the Senate elects a President pro tempore , who presides when the lieutenant governor is not present, and both houses elect a clerk and majority and minority leaders.

[ 318 ] The governor also nominates their 16 cabinet members and others who head various state departments.

[ 319 ] The legislature starts regular sessions on the second Wednesday of every year. They meet for up to 48 days in odd years, which are election years, or 60 days in even years, to allow more time for biennial state budgets, which governors propose.

[ 318 ] [ 320 ] After regular sessions end, special sessions can be called either by the governor or with agreement of two-thirds of both houses, and 21 special sessions have been called since 2000, typically for legislation on preselected issues.

[ 321 ] Though not a full-time legislature, the Assembly is classified as a hybrid because special sessions are not limited by the state constitution and often last several months.

[ 322 ] A one-day "veto session" is also automatically triggered when a governor chooses to veto or return legislation to the Assembly with amendments. Vetoes can then be overturned with approval of two-thirds of both the House and Senate.

[ 323 ] A bill that passes with two-thirds approval can also become law without action from the governor, [ 324 ] and Virginia has no " pocket veto ", so bills become law if the governor chooses to neither approve nor veto them.

[ 325 ] Legal system Unlike the federal judiciary system , justices of the Virginia Supreme Court have term limits, a mandatory retirement age, and select their own Chief Justice.

The judges and justices who make up Virginia's judicial system , also the oldest in America, are elected by a majority vote in both the House and Senate without input from the governor, one way Virginia's legislature is stronger than its executive. The governor can make recess appointments , and when both branches are controlled by the same party, the assembly often confirms them. The judicial hierarchy starts with the General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts , with the Circuit Courts above them, then the Court of Appeals of Virginia , and the Supreme Court of Virginia on top.

[ 326 ] The Supreme Court has seven justices who serve 12-year terms, with a mandatory retirement age of 73; they select their own chief justice, who is informally limited to two four-year terms.

[ 327 ] Virginia was the last state to guarantee an automatic right of appeal for all civil and criminal cases. Its Court of Appeals increased from 11 to 17 judges in 2021.

[ 328 ] [ 329 ] The Code of Virginia is the statutory law and consists of the codified legislation of the General Assembly. The largest law enforcement agency in Virginia is the Virginia State Police , with 3,035 sworn and civilian members as of 2019 [update] .

[ 330 ] The Virginia Marine Police were founded as the "Oyster Navy" in 1864 in response to oyster bed poaching .

[ importance?

] [ 331 ] The Virginia Capitol Police protect the legislature and executive department, and are the oldest police department in the United States, dating to the guards who protected the colonial leadership.

[ 332 ] The governor can also call upon the Virginia National Guard , which consists of approximately 7,200 army soldiers , 1,200 airmen , 300 Defense Force members , and 400 civilians.

[ 333 ] Between 1608 and 2021, when the death penalty was abolished, the state executed over 1,300 people, including 113 following the resumption of capital punishment in 1982.

[ 334 ] Virginia's prison system incarcerates 30,936 people as of 2018 [update] , 53% of whom are Black, [ 335 ] and the state has the sixteenth-highest rate of incarceration in the country , at 422 per 100,000 residents.

[ 336 ] Prisoner parole was ended in 1995, [ 337 ] and Virginia's rate of recidivism of released felons who are re-convicted within three years and sentenced to a year or more is 23.1%, the lowest in the country as of 2019 [update] .

[ 338 ] [ 339 ] Virginia has the fourth lowest violent crime rate and thirteenth lowest property crime rate as of 2018 [update] .

[ 340 ] Between 2008 and 2017, arrests for drug-related crimes rose 38%, with 71% of those related to marijuana , [ 341 ] which Virginia decriminalized in July 2020 and legalized in July 2021.

[ 342 ] [ 343 ] Politics Main article: Politics of Virginia Mirroring Virginia's political transition, the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield has evolved from a vestige of the Byrd era into a regular stop for many state campaigns.

[ 344 ] Over the past century, Virginia has shifted politically from being a largely rural, conservative, Southern bloc member to a state that is more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate, as both greater enfranchisement and demographic shifts have changed the electorate. Up until the 1970s, Virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the Byrd Organization .

[ 345 ] They sought to stymie the political power of Northern Virginia, perpetuate segregation , and successfully restricted voter registration such that between 1905 and 1948 voter turnout was regularly below ten percent.

[ 346 ] [ 347 ] The organization used malapportionment to manipulate what areas were over-represented in the General Assembly and the U.S. Congress until ordered to end the practice by the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Davis v. Mann and the 1965 Virginia Supreme Court decision in Wilkins v. Davis respectively.

[ 348 ] Enforcement of federal civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s helped overturn the state's Jim Crow laws that effectively disenfranchised African Americans.

[ 349 ] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made Virginia one of nine states that were required to receive federal approval for changes to voting laws, until the system for including states was struck down in 2013 .

[ 350 ] The Voting Rights Act of Virginia was passed in 2021, requiring preclearance from the state Attorney General for local election changes that could result in disenfranchisement, including closing or moving polling sites.

[ 351 ] Though many Jim Crow provisions were removed in Virginia's 1971 constitution, a lifetime ban on voting for felony convictions was unchanged, and by 2016, up to twenty percent of African Americans in Virginia were disenfranchised because of prior felonies.

[ 352 ] That year, Governor Terry McAuliffe ended the lifetime ban and individually restored voting rights to over 200,000 ex-felons.

[ 346 ] Virginia moved from being ranked as the second most difficult state to vote in 2016, to the twelfth easiest in 2020.

[ 353 ] While urban and expanding suburban areas, including much of Northern Virginia , form the modern Democratic Party base , rural southern and western areas moved to support the Republican Party in response to its " southern strategy " starting around 1970.

[ 354 ] [ 355 ] Rural Democratic support has nevertheless persisted in union-influenced Roanoke , college towns such as Charlottesville and Blacksburg , and the southeastern Black Belt Region .

[ 356 ] African Americans are the most reliable bloc of Democratic voters, [ 349 ] but educational attainment and gender have also become strong indicators of political alignment, with the majority of women in Virginia supporting Democratic presidential candidates since 1980.

[ 357 ] International immigration and domestic migration into Virginia have also increased the proportion of eligible voters born outside the state from 44% in 1980 to 55% in 2019.

[ 358 ] State elections See also: Elections in Virginia and Political party strength in Virginia 2023 Virginia House of Delegates election 2023 Virginia Senate election Republican hold Democratic hold Republican gain Democratic gain Because Virginia enacted their post-Civil-War constitution in 1870, state elections in Virginia occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following U.S. presidential elections and State Senate elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections.

[ 359 ] House of Delegates elections take place concurrent with each of those elections. National politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and Virginians have elected governors of the party opposite the U.S. president in eleven of the last twelve contests, with only Terry McAuliffe beating the trend in 2013 .

[ 360 ] [ 361 ] The 2017 state elections resulted in Democrats holding the three executive offices, as lieutenant governor Ralph Northam won the race for governor . In concurrent House of Delegates elections , Democrats flipped fifteen of the Republicans' previous sixteen-seat majority.

[ 362 ] Control of the House came down to a tied election in the 94th district , which the Republican won by a drawing of lots, giving the party a slim 51–49 majority in the 2018–19 legislative sessions .

[ 363 ] At this time, Virginia was ranked as having the most gerrymandered U.S. state legislature, as Republicans controlled the House with only 44.5% of the total vote.

[ 364 ] In 2019, federal courts found that eleven House district lines, including the 94th, were unconstitutionally drawn to discriminate against African Americans.

[ 365 ] [ 366 ] Adjusted districts were used in the 2019 elections , when Democrats won full control of the General Assembly, despite a political crisis earlier that year .

[ 367 ] [ 368 ] Voters in 2020 then passed a referendum to give control of drawing both state and congressional districts to a commission of eight citizens and four legislators from each of the two major parties, rather than the legislature.

[ 369 ] In 2021, Glenn Youngkin became the first Republican to win the governor's race since 2009, [ 370 ] with his party also winning the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general and gaining seven seats in the House of Delegates .

[ 371 ] [ 372 ] Two years later, new legislative maps drawn by special masters appointed by the state supreme court led to nine retirements in the state senate and to twenty-five House delegates not seeking re-election. In those elections , Democrats claimed a slim majority of one seat in both the Senate and the House.

Though Virginia was considered a " swing state " in the 2008 presidential election , [ 374 ] Virginia's thirteen electoral votes were carried in that election and the four since then by Democratic candidates, suggesting the state has shifted to being reliably Democratic in presidential elections. Virginia was the only former Confederate state to vote for the Democrats in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections. Virginia had previously voted for Republican presidential candidates in thirteen out of fourteen presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including ten in a row from 1968 to 2004.

[ 375 ] Virginia currently holds its presidential open primary election on Super Tuesday , the same day as fourteen other states, with the most recent held on March 5, 2024.

[ 376 ] Virginia's two U.S. senators are in classes 1 and 2 . Virginia has had eleven U.S. House of Representatives seats since 1993, and control of the majority has flipped four times since then, often as part of " wave elections ". Currently, Democrats and Republicans each hold five seats, with one vacant following the death of Gerald Connolly .

Education Main article: Education in Virginia Middle school students in Albemarle County participate in an engineering program in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution .

Hispanic students had the highest dropout rate , at 13.95%, with high rates being correlated with students listed as English learners .

[ 385 ] Despite ending school segregation in the 1960s, seven percent of Virginia's public schools were rated as "intensely segregated" by The Civil Rights Project at UCLA in 2019, and the number has risen since 1989, when only three percent were.

[ 387 ] Virginia has comparatively large public school districts, typically comprising entire counties or cities, and this helps mitigate funding gaps seen in other states such that non-white districts average slightly more funding, $255 per student as of 2019 [update] , than majority white districts.

[ 388 ] Elementary schools, with Virginia's smallest districts, were found to be more segregated than state middle or high schools by a 2019 VCU study.

[ 389 ] Colleges and universities See also: List of colleges and universities in Virginia The University of Virginia guarantees full tuition scholarships to all in-state Virginia students with family incomes of $80,000 or less.
