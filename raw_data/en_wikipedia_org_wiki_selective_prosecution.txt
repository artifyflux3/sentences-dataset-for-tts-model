jurisprudence , selective prosecution is a procedural defense in which defendants argue that they should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law because the criminal justice system discriminated against them by choosing to prosecute . In claims of selective prosecution, defendants essentially argue that it is irrelevant whether they are guilty of violating a law, but that the fact of being prosecuted is based upon forbidden reasons. Such a claim might, for example, entail an argument that persons of different age, race , religion , sex, gender , or political alignment, were engaged in the same illegal acts for which the defendant is being tried yet were not prosecuted, and that the defendant is being prosecuted specifically because of a bias as to that class.

In the United States [ edit ] In the United States , this defense is based upon the 14th Amendment , which stipulates, "nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." The U.S. Supreme Court has defined the term as: "A selective prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution." [ 1 ] The defense is rarely successful; some authorities claim, for example, that there are no reported cases in at least the past century in which a court dismissed a criminal prosecution because the defendant had been targeted based on race.

[ 2 ] In United States v. Armstrong (1996), the Supreme Court ruled the Attorney General and United States Attorneys "retain 'broad discretion' to enforce the Nation's criminal laws" [ 3 ] and that "in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties." [ 4 ] Therefore, the defendant must present "clear evidence to the contrary", [ 4 ] which demonstrates "the federal prosecutorial policy 'had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.'" [ 5 ] Selective prosecution has been raised as a possible defense in the election obstruction case of Donald Trump , [ 6 ] and as a possible motivation for tax and firearms charges against Hunter Biden .
