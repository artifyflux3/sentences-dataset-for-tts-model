It focuses more on individualism , rather than communitarianism ; a common feature of conservatism in China . Prominent liberals were attacked in the early years of the People's Republic of China but liberal ideas became influential after the end of the Cultural Revolution .

In the People's Republic of China, liberal thought covers a significant range of intellectual currents. Among others, varieties of liberal thought in the PRC include the liberal Marxists of the 1980s and the neoliberals of the 1990s.

History [ edit ] Some scholars see a liberal tradition in Confucian thought.

[ 1 ] However, Confucian thought is generally more closely related to the Chinese conservatism .

Taoism and Laozi philosophy are similar to today's liberalism and libertarianism . James A. Dorn wrote that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, "argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony." [ 2 ] In the People's Republic of China, liberal thought covers a significant range of intellectual currents.

[ 3 ] : 9 Among others, varieties of liberal thought in the PRC include the liberal Marxists of the 1980s (who opposed ultra-leftism and supported a reformist socialism) and the neoliberals of the 1990s (who sought market reform  and contended that this would necessarily increase political rights).

[ 3 ] : 9 Academic Hang Tu summarizes, "[A] common thread that runs through these heterogenous intellectual dynamics is the call for the condemnation of Mao's revolutionary legacy in particular and the abandonment of radical approaches to Chinese history and politics in general." [ 3 ] : 9 Republic of China [ edit ] Hu Shih, a leading Chinese liberal writer of the Republic of China Classical liberalism was introduced into China during the later years of the Qing dynasty and the Republican period.

[ 4 ] In the years leading up to  the Republic of China in 1912, thinkers such as Yan Fu and Liang Qichao translated works of John Stuart Mill , Herbert Spencer , Immanuel Kant , Jean-Jacques Rousseau and many others. These writers had a cumulative effect, as did the ascendancy of liberalism in world powers like Britain, France and the United States. The establishment a republic signaled the acceptance (at least in principle) of these models and the liberal values with which they identified, such as constitutionalism and the separation of powers .

The writings of Liang Qichao (1873–1929) played a major role, despite his leanings to a conservative outlook in latter years. The New Culture Movement (1915) and its immediate successor the May Fourth Movement (1919) initially were strongly liberal in character, with key figures like Hu Shih (1891–1962) as the preeminent exponent of liberal values.

[ 5 ] Other important liberals were Zhang Dongsun (1886–1973) and Zhang Junmai (1887–1969).

Liberalism declined after the growth of the Chinese Communist Revolution and the impacts on the China from Japanese militarism. By the 1930s, liberalism was increasingly to admonishing the Left ( Maoism ) and Right ( Chiangism ).

Writers such as Chu Anping , however, made a strong case against the Kuomintang ; educators and scholars such as Fei Xiaotong and Tao Xingzhi made a case for revolution as a cause worthy of liberal support; while many more liberals left China, including the rural reformer James Yen , the university president Chiang Monlin , and many less well known figures.

Later under its newly adopted 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China , the 1947 National Assembly election , 1948 Legislative Yuan election , and 1948 presidential election took place in China.

Ideological attacks were organized against the followers of Hu Shih, [ 6 ] and their values were ceaselessly derided as bourgeois delusions which could only weaken the nation.

Late 1970s-1980s [ edit ] See also: New Enlightenment (China) Liberal ideas increased their influence in China after the end of the Cultural Revolution .

[ 7 ] In the late 1970s, liberalism developed as a loose intellectual faction including proponents of humanist Marxism , critics of the government, and humanist writers.

[ 3 ] : 85 These intellectuals generally sought to emphasize the cosmopolitan aspects of the May Fourth legacy in support of Deng Xiaoping's reforms.

[ 3 ] : 85–86 After the end of the Mao-era, ideals like intellectual freedom , the separation of powers, civil society and the rule of law were reexamined in the light of the destruction wrought by the Chinese Communist Party which had been so vociferous in denigrating them. Starting in the Cultural Revolution , many younger people experienced virtual conversions to liberalism. This process was given further impetus by the Tiananmen Square protests leading up to the massacre of June 4, 1989 . The democracy movement espoused (however imperfectly) many liberal doctrines. Among the key figures were Wang Ruoshui (1926–2002), who while remaining a Marxist humanist reconfigured this doctrine along liberal lines, [ 8 ] and Liu Xiaobo (1955–2017), initially a literary critic, who broke with Marxism to combine existentialist themes with liberalism.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Since the 1990s [ edit ] In the 1990s the liberal wing of the remnant of the pro-democracy movement re-emerged following the Tiananmen crackdown, including figures like Qin Hui , [ 11 ] Li Shenzhi , [ 12 ] Wang Yuanhua , [ 13 ] Zhu Xueqin , Xu Youyu , Liu Junning and many others. The writings of Gu Zhun (1915–1974) were rediscovered, providing evidence of a stubborn core of liberal values that the communist movement had failed to extinguish. Ranged against the liberals are the Chinese New Left and populist nationalism.

[ 14 ] After the Tiananmen Square crackdown, support among intellectuals for liberal reform and liberal democracy decreased, while support for cultural conservatism increased.

[ 3 ] : 106–107 Post-crackdown, some liberals increasingly emphasized neoliberalism and the belief that the market was the most effective guarantor of political liberty.

[ 3 ] : 86 Chinese liberalism itself tends to divide into market liberalism , impressed by the US as a political model and adhering to the doctrines of Hayek and other neoliberals, and left-liberalism , more aligned with European social democracy and the welfare state . These tendencies continue to develop in a state of tension.

Li Keqiang is viewed as a liberal in China's ruling elite, advocating for economic liberty .

[ 15 ] Wang Yang is viewed as a liberal in China's ruling elite, representing a school of thought that advocates for gradual political liberalization.

[ 16 ] A 2010s study shows the Chinese people with higher level of education tend to favor liberalism. Chinese citizens have a range of opinions about individual rights and political freedoms that do not always match existing policies or state propaganda. There are plenty of nationalists, but there is also a silent majority in favor of economic reform and political liberalism.

[ 17 ] [ need quotation to verify ] From the Chinese leftist perspective, Chinese liberalism places too great of an emphasis on elite experiences and memory and minimizes the experience of the underprivileged, for whom the socialist state brought improvements in standard of living and cultural dignity.

[ 3 ] : 119-120 In Hong Kong [ edit ] Main article: Liberalism in Hong Kong Liberalism in Hong Kong has become the driving force of the democratic movement since the 1980s which is mainly represented by the pro-democracy camp which strives for the universal suffrage , human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong. It is one of two major political ideologies of the Hong Kong , with the other being conservatism .
