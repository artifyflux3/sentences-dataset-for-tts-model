[Tracy Caldwell Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson "Tracy Caldwell Dyson") in the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station")'s [Cupola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS_module) "Cupola (ISS module)")

**Spaceflight** (or **space flight**) is an application of [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics") to fly objects, usually [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), into or through [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"), either [with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") or [without humans on board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spaceflight "Uncrewed spaceflight"). Most spaceflight is uncrewed and conducted mainly with spacecraft such as [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") in [orbit around Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit"), but also includes [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") for flights beyond Earth orbit. Such spaceflights operate either by [telerobotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telerobotic "Telerobotic") or [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot "Autonomous robot") control. The first spaceflights began in the 1950s with the launches of the Soviet [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_program "Sputnik program") satellites and American [Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorers_Program "Explorers Program") and [Vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Vanguard "Project Vanguard") missions. [Human spaceflight programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight_programs "Human spaceflight programs") include the [Soyuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_programme "Soyuz programme"), [Shenzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Manned_Space_Program "China Manned Space Program"), the past [Apollo Moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") and the [Space Shuttle programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program"). Other current spaceflight are conducted to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") and to China's [Tiangong Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_Space_Station "Tiangong Space Station").

Spaceflights include the launches of [Earth observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite") and [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") satellites, [interplanetary missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight "Interplanetary spaceflight"), the rendezvouses and dockings with [space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station"), and [crewed spaceflights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") on [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science") or [tourist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism "Space tourism") missions.

Spaceflight can be achieved conventionally via [multistage rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket"), which provide the thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propel spacecraft onto [suborbital trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight"). If the mission is [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight "Orbital spaceflight"), the spacecraft usually separates the [first stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_stage_(rocketry) "First stage (rocketry)") and ignites the [second stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket"), which propels the spacecraft to high enough speeds that it reaches orbit. Once in orbit, spacecraft are at high enough speeds that they fall around the Earth rather than fall back to the surface.

Most spacecraft, and all crewed spacecraft, are designed to [deorbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deorbit "Deorbit") themselves or, in the case of uncrewed spacecraft in high-energy orbits, to boost themselves into [graveyard orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit"). Used upper stages or failed spacecraft, however, often lack the ability to deorbit themselves. This becomes a major issue when large numbers of uncontrollable spacecraft exist in frequently used orbits, increasing the risk of [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") colliding with functional satellites. This problem is exacerbated when large objects, often upper stages, break up in orbit or collide with other objects, creating often hundreds of small, hard to find pieces of debris. This problem of continuous collisions is known as [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome").

There are several terms that refer to a flight into or through [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").

A **space mission** refers to a spaceflight intended to achieve an objective. Objectives for space missions may include [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration"), [space research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_research "Space research"), and national firsts in spaceflight.

**Space transport** is the use of spacecraft to transport people or cargo into or through outer space. This may include [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") and [cargo spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft#Cargo_spacecraft "Uncrewed spacecraft") flight.

The first theoretical proposal of space travel using [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") was published by Scottish astronomer and mathematician [William Leitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Leitch_(scientist) "William Leitch (scientist)"), in an 1861 essay "A Journey Through Space".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-1) More well-known is [Konstantin Tsiolkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky "Konstantin Tsiolkovsky")'s work, "Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами" (_The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices_), published in 1903. In his work, Tsiolkovsky describes the fundamental rocket equation:

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{e}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{f}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d94313cffa903df048564e8d230a00ca8756ea22)

Where:

This equation, known as the [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation "Tsiolkovsky rocket equation"), can be used to find the total ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \Delta v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e18b43e4225eeaafeeb25aefc4ee90bd86f004dc), or potential change in velocity. This formula, which is still used by engineers, is a key concept of spaceflight.

Spaceflight became a practical possibility with the work of [Robert H. Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard "Robert H. Goddard")'s publication in 1919 of his paper _[A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_H.\_Goddard#A\_Method\_of\_Reaching\_Extreme\_Altitudes "Robert H. Goddard")_. His application of the [de Laval nozzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle "De Laval nozzle") to [liquid-fuel rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket "Liquid-propellant rocket") improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible. After further research, Goddard attempted to secure an Army contract for a rocket-propelled weapon in the [first World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") but his plans were foiled by the [November 11, 1918 armistice with Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_11_November_1918 "Armistice of 11 November 1918"). After choosing to work with private financial support, he was the first to launch a liquid-fueled rocket on March 16, 1926.

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the first guided rocket, the [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2 "V-2"), was developed and employed as a weapon by [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"). During a test flight in June 1944, one such rocket reached space at an altitude of 189 kilometers (102 nautical miles), becoming the first human-made object to reach space.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-2) At the end of World War II, most of the V-2 rocket team, including its head, [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun "Wernher von Braun"), surrendered to the United States, and were expatriated to work on American missiles at what became the [Army Ballistic Missile Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Ballistic_Missile_Agency "Army Ballistic Missile Agency"), producing missiles such as [Juno I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_I "Juno I") and [Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65_Atlas "SM-65 Atlas"). The [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), in turn, captured several V2 production facilities and built several replicas, with 5 of their 11 rockets successfully reaching their targets. (This was relatively consistent with Nazi Germany's success rate.)

The [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") developed [intercontinental ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile") to carry [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") as a counter measure to United States bomber planes in the 1950s. The Tsiolkovsky-influenced [Sergey Korolev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Korolev "Sergey Korolev") became the chief rocket designer, and derivatives of his [R-7 Semyorka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_Semyorka "R-7 Semyorka") missiles were used to launch the world's first artificial Earth [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), on October 4, 1957.

The U.S., after the launch of Sputnik and two embarrassing failures of [Vanguard rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_(rocket) "Vanguard (rocket)"), launched [Explorer 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_1 "Explorer 1") on February 1, 1958. Three years later, the USSR launched Vostok 1, carrying cosmonaut [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin") into orbit. The US responded with the suborbital launch of [Alan Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard "Alan Shepard") on May 5, 1961, and the orbital launch of [John Glenn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_6 "Mercury-Atlas 6") on February 20, 1962. These events were followed by a pledge from U.S. [President John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_John_F._Kennedy "President John F. Kennedy") to [go to the moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon "We choose to go to the Moon") and the creation of the [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_program "Gemini program") and [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") programs. After successfully performing a rendezvous and docking and an [EVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity"), the Gemini program ended just before the [Apollo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1") tragedy. Following multiple uncrewed test flights of the [Saturn 1B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_IB "Saturn IB") and the [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V"), the U.S. launched the crewed [Apollo 7 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7 "Apollo 7") into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). Shortly after its successful completion, the U.S. launched [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") (first mission to orbit the Moon), [Apollo 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_9 "Apollo 9") (first Apollo mission to launch with both the [CSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_CSM "Apollo CSM") and the [LEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Excursion_Module "Lunar Excursion Module")) and [Apollo 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10 "Apollo 10") (first mission to nearly land on the Moon). These events culminated with the first crewed Moon landing, [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11"), and six subsequent missions, five of which successfully landed on the Moon.

Spaceflight has been widely employed by numerous government and commercial entities for placing satellites into orbit around Earth for a broad range of purposes. Certain government agencies have also sent uncrewed spacecraft exploring space beyond the Moon and developed continuous crewed [human presence in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_presence_in_space "Human presence in space") with a series of [space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station"), ranging from the [_Salyut_ program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program "Salyut program") to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").

Rockets are the only means currently capable of reaching orbit or beyond. Other [non-rocket spacelaunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch "Non-rocket spacelaunch") technologies have yet to be built, or remain short of orbital speeds. A [rocket launch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launch "Rocket launch") for a spaceflight usually starts from a [spaceport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceport "Spaceport") (cosmodrome), which may be equipped with launch complexes and [launch pads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad "Launch pad") for vertical rocket launches and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft. Spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons. [ICBMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile") have various special launching facilities.

A launch is often restricted to certain [launch windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window "Launch window"). These windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site. The biggest influence is often the rotation of the Earth. Once launched, orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the Earth, and the Earth rotates within this orbit.

A [launch pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad "Launch pad") is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles. It generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench. It is surrounded by equipment used to erect, fuel, and maintain launch vehicles. Before launch, the rocket can weigh hundreds of tons. The [Space Shuttle _Columbia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia"), on [STS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1 "STS-1"), weighed 2030 metric tons (4,480,000 lb) at takeoff.

The most commonly used definition of [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") is everything beyond the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line"), which is 100 kilometers (62 mi) above the Earth's surface. (The United States defines outer space as everything beyond 50 miles (80 km) in altitude.)

[Rocket engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engines "Rocket engines") remain the only currently practical means of reaching space, with planes and [high-altitude balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloons "High-altitude balloons") failing due to lack of atmosphere and alternatives such as space elevators not yet being built. Chemical propulsion, or the acceleration of gases at high velocities, is effective mainly because of its ability to sustain thrust even as the atmosphere thins.

Many ways to reach space other than rocket engines have been proposed. Ideas such as the [space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator "Space elevator"), and [momentum exchange tethers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_exchange_tether "Momentum exchange tether") like [rotovators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotovator_(tether_propulsion) "Rotovator (tether propulsion)") or [skyhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure) "Skyhook (structure)") require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Electromagnetic launchers such as [launch loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop "Launch loop") might be feasible with current technology. Other ideas include rocket-assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as [Reaction Engines Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines_Skylon "Reaction Engines Skylon") (currently in early stage development), [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet "Scramjet") powered spaceplanes, and [RBCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket-based_combined_cycle "Rocket-based combined cycle") powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.

On some missions beyond [LEO (Low Earth Orbit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"), spacecraft are inserted into parking orbits, or lower intermediary orbits. The parking orbit approach greatly simplified Apollo mission planning in several important ways. It acted as a "time buffer" and substantially widened the allowable [launch windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window "Launch window"). The parking orbit gave the crew and controllers time to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it for a long journey to the Moon.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-lauwin-3)

Launched in 1959, [Luna 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_1 "Luna 1") was the first known artificial object to achieve escape velocity from the Earth _(replica pictured)_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-4)

Robotic missions do not require an abort capability and require radiation minimalization only for delicate electronics, and because modern launchers routinely meet "instantaneous" launch windows, space probes to the Moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance by limiting the boil off of [cryogenic propellants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_propellant "Cryogenic propellant"). Although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence, they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an Earth escape trajectory.

The escape velocity from a celestial body decreases as the distance from the body increases. However, it is more fuel-efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close as possible to its [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") (lowest point); see [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect "Oberth effect").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-Escape_Velocity_of_Earth-5)

Astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. Astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use. An [orbital maneuvering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuvering_system "Orbital maneuvering system") may be needed to maintain or change orbits.

Non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include [solar sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail "Solar sail"), [magnetic sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_sail "Magnetic sail"), [plasma-bubble magnetic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-magnetospheric_plasma_propulsion "Mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion"), and using [gravitational slingshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_slingshot "Gravitational slingshot") effects.

The term "transfer energy" means the total amount of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") imparted by a rocket stage to its payload. This can be the energy imparted by a [first stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_stage_(rocketry) "First stage (rocketry)") of a [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") to an upper stage plus payload, or by an upper stage or spacecraft [kick motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee_kick_motor "Apogee kick motor") to a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-7)

### Reaching space station

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceflight&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Reaching space station")]

In order to reach a [space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station"), a spacecraft would have to arrive at the same [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). This is done by a set of orbital maneuvers called [space rendezvous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous "Space rendezvous").

After rendezvousing with the space station, the space vehicle then docks or berths with the station. Docking refers to joining of two separate free-flying space vehicles,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-her-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-nasa20090317-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-ARDS-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-AdvanDock-11) while berthing refers to mating operations where an inactive vehicle is placed into the mating interface of another space vehicle by using a [robotic arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_arm "Robotic arm").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-her-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-ARDS-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-AdvanDock-11)

Vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy. This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against [aerodynamic heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_heating "Aerodynamic heating"). The theory behind reentry was developed by [Harry Julian Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Julian_Allen "Harry Julian Allen"). Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat reaching the vehicle, and the remainder heats the atmosphere.

### Landing and recovery

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceflight&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Landing and recovery")]

The [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury "Project Mercury"), [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini"), and [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_module "Apollo command module") capsules [splashed down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown "Splashdown") in the sea. These capsules were designed to land at relatively low speeds with the help of a parachute. Soviet/Russian capsules for [Soyuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft) "Soyuz (spacecraft)") make use of a big parachute and braking rockets to touch down on land. [Spaceplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") like the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") land like a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)").

After a successful landing, the spacecraft, its occupants, and cargo can be recovered. In some cases, recovery has occurred before landing: while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute, it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft. This [mid-air retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-air_retrieval "Mid-air retrieval") technique was used to recover the film canisters from the [Corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_(satellite) "Corona (satellite)") spy satellites.

_[Sojourner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner\_(rover) "Sojourner (rover)")_ takes its [Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle_X-ray_spectrometer "Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer") measurement of [Yogi Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Rock "Yogi Rock") on Mars.

The _[MESSENGER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER "MESSENGER")_ spacecraft at Mercury (artist's interpretation)

[Uncrewed spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft "Uncrewed spacecraft") or robotic spacecraft are [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") without [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People "People") on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input, such as [remote control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_vehicle "Remotely operated vehicle"), or remote guidance. They may also be [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_vehicle "Autonomous vehicle"), in which they have a pre-programmed list of operations that will be executed unless otherwise instructed. A robotic spacecraft for scientific measurements is often called a space probe or [space observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_observatory "Space observatory").

Many space missions are more suited to [telerobotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telerobotic "Telerobotic") rather than [crewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") operation, due to lower cost and risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") or the vicinity of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"), and [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune") are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit.

The first uncrewed space mission was _[Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik "Sputnik")_, launched October 4, 1957 to orbit the Earth. Nearly all [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), [landers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft) "Lander (spacecraft)") and [rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration) "Rover (space exploration)") are robotic spacecraft. Not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft; for example, a reflector ball is a non-robotic uncrewed spacecraft. Space missions where other [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_space "Animals in space") but no humans are on-board are called uncrewed missions.

Many habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic features. For example, the space stations [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7") and [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir"), and the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") module [Zarya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarya_(ISS_module) "Zarya (ISS module)"), were capable of remote guided station-keeping and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. [Uncrewed resupply spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_resupply_spacecraft "Uncrewed resupply spacecraft") are increasingly used for crewed [space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station").

The first human spaceflight was [Vostok 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1 "Vostok 1") on April 12, 1961, on which [cosmonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut")[Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin") of the [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR") made one orbit around the Earth. In official Soviet documents, there is no mention of the fact that Gagarin parachuted the final seven miles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-12) As of 2020, the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are [Soyuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_spacecraft "Soyuz spacecraft"), [Shenzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_spacecraft "Shenzhou spacecraft"), and [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon "Crew Dragon"). The U.S. [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") fleet operated from April 1981 until July 2011. [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne") has conducted three human suborbital space flights.

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/X-15_flying.jpg/250px-X-15_flying.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X-15_flying.jpg)

The [North American X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15") in flight. X-15 flew above 100 km (62 mi) twice and both of the flights were piloted by [Joe Walker (astronaut)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_A._Walker "Joseph A. Walker").

On a [sub-orbital spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight") the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a (primarily) ballistic trajectory. This is usually because of insufficient [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy"), in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes, but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the Earth's atmosphere, sometimes after many hours. [Pioneer 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_1 "Pioneer 1") was NASA's first [space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") intended to reach the Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of 113,854 kilometers (70,746 mi) before reentering the Earth's atmosphere 43 hours after launch.

The most generally recognized boundary of space is the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") 100 km (62 mi) above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than 80 km (50 mi) above sea level.) It is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the Kármán line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible Earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the Kármán line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, [Civilian Space eXploration Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Space_eXploration_Team "Civilian Space eXploration Team") launched the GoFast rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne") was used for the first [privately funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight")[human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight").

Point-to-point, or Earth to Earth transportation, is a category of [sub-orbital spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight") in which a spacecraft provides rapid transport between two terrestrial locations.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-nsp_ete-13) A conventional airline route between [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") and [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney "Sydney"), a flight that normally lasts [over twenty hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stop_flight#Future_of_ultra_long-haul "Non-stop flight"), could be traversed in less than one hour.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-14) While no company offers this type of transportation today, [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") has revealed plans to do so as early as the 2020s using [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship"). Suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low Earth orbit.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-15) If rockets are used, the size of the rocket relative to the payload is similar to an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmospheric re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight.

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/S68-27366.jpg/250px-S68-27366.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:S68-27366.jpg)

Apollo 6 heads into orbit.

A minimal [orbital spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight "Orbital spaceflight") requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub-orbital flight, and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve. To achieve orbital spaceflight, the tangential velocity around the Earth is as important as altitude. In order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space, the spacecraft must reach the minimal [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") required for a [closed orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit").

[Interplanetary spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight "Interplanetary spaceflight") is flight between planets within a single [planetary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system"). In practice, the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). Plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in Earth orbit, such as NASA's [Constellation program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program "Constellation program") and Russia's [Kliper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliper "Kliper")/[Parom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parom "Parom") tandem.

_[New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Horizons "New Horizons")_ is the fifth spacecraft put on an escape trajectory leaving the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). _Voyager 1_, _Voyager 2_, _Pioneer 10_, _Pioneer 11_ are the earlier ones. The one farthest from the Sun is _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_, which is more than 100 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") distant and is moving at 3.6 AU per year.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-16) In comparison, [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri "Proxima Centauri"), the closest star other than the Sun, is 267,000 AU distant. It will take _Voyager 1_ over 74,000 years to reach this distance. Vehicle designs using other techniques, such as [nuclear pulse propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion "Nuclear pulse propulsion") are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster. Another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"), as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little, in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time. However, attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new, advanced method of [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion"). [Dynamic soaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_soaring "Dynamic soaring") as a way to travel across interstellar space has been proposed as well.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-SA-20221206-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-FST-20221128-18)

Intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies, and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and, by current engineering terms, is considered [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"). However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible. To date several academics have studied intergalactic travel in a serious manner.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-burruss-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-21)

An Apollo Lunar Module on the lunar surface

Spacecraft are vehicles designed to operate in space.

The first 'true spacecraft' is sometimes said to be [Apollo Lunar Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-22) since this was the only crewed vehicle to have been designed for, and operated only in space; and is notable for its non-aerodynamic shape.

Spacecraft today predominantly use [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") for [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion"), but other propulsion techniques such as [ion drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_drive "Ion drive") are becoming more common, particularly for uncrewed vehicles, and this can significantly reduce the vehicle's mass and increase its [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v").

Launch systems are used to carry a payload from Earth's surface into outer space.

Most current spaceflight uses [multi-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket") expendable launch systems to reach space.

The first reusable spacecraft, the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15 "X-15"), was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on 19 July 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin")'s flight, on 12 April 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which flown in the atmosphere and five of which flown in space. The _[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Enterprise "Space Shuttle Enterprise")_ was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") and gliding to deadstick landings at [Edwards AFB, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_AFB,_California "Edwards AFB, California"). The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the _[Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia")_, followed by the _[Challenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Challenger "Space Shuttle Challenger")_, _[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")_, _[Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Atlantis "Space Shuttle Atlantis")_, and _[Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Endeavour "Space Shuttle Endeavour")_. The _Endeavour_ was built to replace the _Challenger_, which was [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-L "STS-51-L") in January 1986. The _Columbia_[broke up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster") during reentry in February 2003.

The first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the _[Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle\_Buran "Shuttle Buran")_ (_Snowstorm_), launched by the USSR on 15 November 1988, although it made only one flight. This [spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the US Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran.

The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by the [SpaceX Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2 "SpaceX Dragon 2") and [CST-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CST-100 "CST-100") in the 2020s. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is now done by commercial launch vehicles.

[Scaled Composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites "Scaled Composites")[SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne") was a reusable [suborbital spaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suborbital_spaceplane "Suborbital spaceplane") that carried pilots [Mike Melvill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Melvill "Mike Melvill") and [Brian Binnie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Binnie "Brian Binnie") on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the [Ansari X Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansari_X_Prize "Ansari X Prize"). [The Spaceship Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spaceship_Company "The Spaceship Company") has built its successor [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo"). A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic") planned to begin reusable [private spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight") carrying paying passengers ([space tourists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism "Space tourism")) in 2008, but this was delayed due to an accident in the propulsion development.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-23)

[SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") achieved the first vertical soft landing of a reusable orbital rocket stage on December 21, 2015, after delivering 11 [Orbcomm OG-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbcomm_OG-2 "Orbcomm OG-2") commercial satellites into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-24)

The first Falcon 9 reflight occurred on 30 March 2017.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-25) SpaceX now routinely recovers and reuses [their first stages and fairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program "SpaceX reusable launch system development program").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-26) SpaceX is now developing a fully reusable super heavy lift rocket known as [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship"), with the goal of drastically reducing the price of space exploration.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-cnn-20190929-27) As of April 2025, three Super Heavy boosters, the first stage of Starship, have been recovered.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-NSF-B12-rollback-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-:2-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-30)

All launch vehicles contain a huge amount of energy that is needed for some part of it to reach orbit. There is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly, with significant effects. When a [Delta II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_II "Delta II") rocket exploded 13 seconds after launch on January 17, 1997, there were reports of store windows 10 miles (16 km) away being broken by the blast.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-31)

Space is a fairly predictable environment, but there are still risks of accidental depressurization and the potential failure of equipment, some of which may be very newly developed.

In April 2004 the [International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Space_Safety "International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety") was established in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-32)

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Foale_ZeroG.jpg/330px-Foale_ZeroG.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foale_ZeroG.jpg)

In a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth, humans experience a sense of "weightlessness." Short-term exposure to microgravity causes [space adaptation syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_adaptation_syndrome "Space adaptation syndrome"), a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the [vestibular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system "Vestibular system"). Long-term exposure causes multiple health issues. The most significant is bone loss, some of which is permanent, but microgravity also leads to significant [deconditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconditioning "Deconditioning") of muscular and cardiovascular tissues.

Once above the atmosphere, radiation due to the [Van Allen belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_belts "Van Allen belts"), [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation "Solar radiation") and [cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_radiation "Cosmic radiation") issues occur and increase. Further away from the Earth, [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare "Solar flare") can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes, and the [health threat from cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays "Health threat from cosmic rays") significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-33)

In human spaceflight, the [life support system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support_system "Life support system") is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space. [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") often uses the phrase Environmental Control and Life Support System or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems for its [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") missions.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-34) The life support system may supply: [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") and [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food "Food"). It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life support system are [life-critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-critical_system "Life-critical system"), and are designed and constructed using [safety engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_engineering "Safety engineering") techniques.

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg/330px-Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg)

Space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). It is distinct from the concept of [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") within a [planetary atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_body_atmosphere "Celestial body atmosphere"), and deals with phenomena involving ambient [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), magnetic fields, [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") and other [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") in space (generally close to Earth but also in [interplanetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_space "Interplanetary space"), and occasionally [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium")). "Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems. Our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the Sun, the nature of Earth's magnetic field, and our location in the Solar System."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-35)

Space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development. Changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). Geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors onboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for crewed spacecraft.

### Environmental considerations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceflight&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Environmental considerations")]

Exhaust pollution of rockets depends on the produced exhausts by the propellants reactions and the location of exhaustion. They mostly exhaust [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas") and sometimes toxic components. Particularly at higher levels of the atmosphere the potency of exhausted gases as greenhouse gases increases considerably.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-Gammon_2021-36) Many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of [perchlorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchlorate "Perchlorate") or other chemicals, and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer. Re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer. Most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction. While spaceflight altogether pollutes at a fraction of other human activities, it still does pollute heavily if calculated per passenger.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-Gammon_2021-36)

In addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") caused by [spalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalling "Spalling") of satellites and vehicles ([Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome")). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.

A wide range of issues such as [space traffic management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_traffic_management "Space traffic management") or [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_Convention "Liability Convention") have been issues of spaceflight regulation.

Participation and representation of all humanity in spaceflight is an issue of international [space law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law") ever since the first phase of space exploration.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-Durrani-37) Even though some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been secured, sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as [imperialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") and lacking, understanding spaceflight as a resource.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-Durrani-37)

Inclusion has been a national and international issue, resulting in 1967 in the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") and its claim of outer space as the "[province of all mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind "Common heritage of mankind")". Furthermore social inclusion in human spaceflight has been demanded, with [women to fly to space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space "Women in space") being limited, and minorities, like people with disability, only having been selected in [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency")'s [2022 astronaut group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Space_Agency_Astronaut_Group "2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group").

The dominating issue about access in most recent years has been the issue of [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") and [space sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability "Space sustainability"), since established spacefaring countries endanger access to outer space with their orbital space polluting activity.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-v399-38)

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/S74-15583skylabsunview.jpg/500px-S74-15583skylabsunview.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:S74-15583skylabsunview.jpg)

This shows an extreme ultraviolet view of the Sun (the Apollo Telescope Mount SO82A Experiment) taken during [Skylab 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab_3 "Skylab 3"), with the Earth added for scale. On the right an image of the Sun shows a helium emissions, and there is an image on the left showing emissions from iron. One application for spaceflight is to take observation hindered or made more difficult by being on Earth's surface. Skylab included a massive crewed solar observatory that revolutionized solar science in the early 1970s using the Apollo-based space station in conjunction with crewed spaceflights to it.

Current and proposed applications for spaceflight include:

*   [Earth observation satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite") such as [spy satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_satellite "Spy satellite"), [weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite")
*   [Space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration")
*   [Communication satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_satellite "Communication satellite")
*   [Satellite television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television "Satellite television")
*   [Satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation")
*   [Space telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescopes "Space telescopes")
*   [Space tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism "Space tourism")
*   Protecting Earth from [potentially hazardous objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_hazardous_object "Potentially hazardous object")
*   [Space colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization "Space colonization")

Most early spaceflight development was paid for by governments. However, today major launch markets such as communication satellites and satellite television are purely commercial, though many of the launchers were originally funded by governments.

[Private spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight") is a rapidly developing area: space flight that is not only paid for by corporations or even private individuals, but often provided by [private spaceflight companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_spaceflight_companies "List of private spaceflight companies"). These companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid. This assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private space launch vehicles such as [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") developed with private financing. Lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as space tourism and especially space colonization to become feasible for expansion.

To be **spacefaring** is to be capable of and active in the operation of [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). It involves a knowledge of a variety of topics and development of specialised skills including: [aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics"); [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics"); programs to train [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut"); [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather") and forecasting; spacecraft operations; operation of various equipment; spacecraft design and construction; atmospheric takeoff and reentry; [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics "Orbital mechanics") (a.k.a. astrodynamics); communications; engines and rockets; execution of evolutions such as towing, [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgravity "Microgravity") construction, and [space docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_docking "Space docking"); cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargos and cargo storage; [spacewalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewalk "Spacewalk"); dealing with emergencies; [survival at space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_survival "Space survival") and first aid; fire fighting; [life support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support "Life support"). The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed. "Spacefaring" is analogous to [seafaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafaring "Seafaring").

There has never been a crewed mission outside the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")–[Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") system. However, the United States, Russia, China, [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") (ESA) countries, and a few corporations and enterprises have plans in various stages to travel to [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") (see [Human mission to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars "Human mission to Mars")).

Spacefaring entities can be [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state"), supranational entities, and private [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"). Spacefaring nations are those capable of independently building and launching craft into space.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-41) A growing number of private entities have become or are becoming spacefaring.

### Global coordination

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceflight&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Global coordination")]

The [United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Outer_Space_Affairs "United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs") (UNOOSA) has been the main multilateral body servicing international contact and exchange on space activity among spacefaring and non-spacefaring states.

### Crewed spacefaring nations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceflight&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Crewed spacefaring nations")]

Currently [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") are the only crewed spacefaring [nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation"). Spacefaring nations listed by date of first crewed launch:

1.   [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") ([Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia")) (1961)

Also several countries, such as Canada, Italy, and Australia, had semi-independent spacefaring capability, launching locally built satellites on foreign launchers. Canada had designed and built satellites (_[Alouette 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alouette\_1 "Alouette 1")_ and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alouette_2 "Alouette 2")) in 1962 and 1965 which were orbited using U.S. launch vehicles. Italy has designed and built several satellites, as well as pressurized modules for the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"). Early Italian satellites were launched using vehicles provided by NASA, first from [Wallops Flight Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Flight_Facility "Wallops Flight Facility") in 1964 and then from a spaceport in Kenya ([San Marco Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marco_Platform "San Marco Platform")) between 1967 and 1988;[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Italy has led the development of the [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_(launcher) "Vega (launcher)") rocket programme within the European Space Agency since 1998.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-ESA_Vega_Programme-47) The [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") abandoned its independent space launch program in 1972 in favour of co-operating with the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) on launch technologies until 1974. Australia abandoned its launcher program shortly after the successful launch of [WRESAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRESAT "WRESAT"), and became the only non-European member of ELDO.

Considering merely launching an object beyond the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") to be the minimum requirement of spacefaring, [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), with the [V-2 rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket "V-2 rocket"), became the first spacefaring nation in 1944.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#cite_note-48) The following nations have only achieved [suborbital spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suborbital_spaceflight "Suborbital spaceflight") capability by launching indigenous [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") or [missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile "Missile") or both into suborbital space:

The spacecraft docking mechanisms typically enter what is called soft capture, followed by a load attenuation phase, and then the hard docked position which establishes an air-tight structural connection between spacecraft. Berthing, by contrast, is when an incoming spacecraft is grappled by a robotic arm and its interface mechanism is placed close to the stationary interface mechanism. Then typically there is a capture process, coarse alignment and fine alignment, and then structural attachment.
