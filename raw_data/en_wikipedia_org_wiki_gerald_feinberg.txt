He spent a year as a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study , and two years at the Brookhaven Laboratories .

[ 1 ] Feinberg went to Bronx High School of Science with Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow and obtained his bachelor's and graduate degrees from Columbia University .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] His father was Yiddish poet and journalist Leon Feinberg .

[ 4 ] Among his students were Scott Dodelson , physicist at Carnegie Mellon University .

Research [ edit ] He coined the term tachyon for hypothetical faster-than-light particles and analysed their quantum field properties, [ 5 ] predicted the existence of the muon neutrino [ 6 ] and advocated cryonics as a public service.

[ 7 ] He was a member of the Foresight Institute 's advisory panel.

[ 8 ] Parapsychology [ edit ] Feinberg wrote a foreword to Edgar Mitchell 's book Psychic Explorations (1974) in which he endorsed psychic phenomena . His concept of a tachyon, a theoretical particle that travels faster than the speed of light has been advocated by some parapsychologists who claim that it could explain precognition or psychokinesis . However, there is no scientific evidence tachyon particles exist and such paranormal claims have been described as pseudoscientific.
