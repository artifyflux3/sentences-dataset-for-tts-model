The next larger category is medium-lift launch vehicles .

[ 2 ] The first small-lift launch vehicle was the Sputnik rocket, launched by the Soviet Union, which was derived from the R-7 Semyorka ICBM . On 4 October 1957, the Sputnik rocket was used to perform the world's first satellite launch, placing the Sputnik 1 satellite into a low Earth orbit .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The US responded by attempting to launch the Vanguard rocket.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] However, the Vanguard TV3 launch attempt failed, with the 31 January 1958 launch of the Explorer 1 satellite using the Juno I rocket being the first successful US orbital launch. The Vanguard I mission was the second successful US orbital launch. This was the start of the space race .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Since the late 1950s, small-lift launch vehicles have continued launching payloads into orbits including LEO, Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

Medium-lift launch vehicles , heavy-lift launch vehicles , and super heavy-lift launch vehicles have also been extensively developed but have not completely superseded small launch vehicles. Small launch vehicles can meet the requirements of some spacecraft, and can be less expensive than a larger launch vehicle would be.
