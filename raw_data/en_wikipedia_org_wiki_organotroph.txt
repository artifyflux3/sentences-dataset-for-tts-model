This term is used in microbiology to classify and describe organisms based on how they obtain electrons for their respiration processes.  Some organotrophs such as animals and many bacteria , are also heterotrophs . Organotrophs can be either anaerobic or aerobic.

Antonym: Lithotroph , Adjective: Organotrophic .

History [ edit ] The term was suggested in 1946 by Lwoff and collaborators.
