Double oblique hyphen in a Fraktur typeface

In [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script"), the **double hyphen**⹀ is a [punctuation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") that consists of two parallel [hyphens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") (‐). It was a development of the earlier **double oblique hyphen**⸗, which developed from a [Central European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") variant of the [virgule slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#History "Slash (punctuation)"), originally a form of [scratch comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_(punctuation) "Comma (punctuation)"). Similar marks (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen#Similar_marks)) are used in other scripts.

In order to avoid it being confused with the [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign")=, the double hyphen is often shown as a double oblique hyphen in modern typography. The double hyphen is also not to be confused with [two consecutive hyphens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_consecutive_hyphens "Two consecutive hyphens") (--), which are often used to represent an [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash")— or [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash")– due to the limitations of typewriters and keyboards that do not have distinct hyphen and dash keys.

The double hyphen is used for several different purposes throughout the world:

*   Some [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface"), such as [Fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_(typeface) "Fraktur (typeface)") faces, use the double hyphen as a [glyphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") variant of the single hyphen. (With Fraktur faces, such a double hyphen is usually oblique.)
*   It may be also used for artistic or commercial purposes to achieve a distinctive visual effect. For example, the name of [The Waldorf⹀Astoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_Astoria_New_York "Waldorf Astoria New York") hotel was officially written with a double hyphen from 1949 to 2009.
*   In [Merriam-Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster "Merriam-Webster") dictionaries if a word is divided at the end of the line, and the division point happens to be a hyphen, it is replaced with a double hyphen to graphically indicate that the divided word is normally hyphenated, for example _cross⸗

country_.
*   In several dictionaries published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all such compound words are linked with double hyphens, whether at the end of the line or not, and the normal use of the single hyphen for non-compound words is retained. An example from the first or second page of such dictionaries is _[Aaron's⸗rod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron%27s\_rod "Aaron's rod")_. Examples include the [Century Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Dictionary "Century Dictionary") and [Funk & Wagnalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_%26_Wagnalls "Funk & Wagnalls") New Standard Dictionary of the English Language.
*   It is used by [Coptic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language "Coptic language") scholars to denote the form of the verb used before [pronominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun "Pronoun") suffixes, e.g. ⲕⲟⲧ⸗ _kot⹀_ 'to build'.
*   It is used by scholars of the [Hittite language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language "Hittite language") to separate [clitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic "Clitic") from the word to which they attach; this usage has been adopted by the [Leipzig Glossing Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_Glossing_Rules "Leipzig Glossing Rules").
*   It is used as a distinct punctuation mark in [Ojibwe language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language "Ojibwe language") publications in the Fiero Roman orthography, as a hyphen is used to separate compound preverb units regardless of their line position, while a double hyphen is used to divide a word at the end of a line and can be treated as a [soft hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen "Soft hyphen"). However, due to lack of availability of a double hyphen in most fonts, an equal sign is often used as a substitute.
*   In Ojibwe, [Cree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cree_language "Cree language") and other languages using [Unified Canadian syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Canadian_syllabics "Unified Canadian syllabics"), because final _c_ (U+1428 ᐨ CANADIAN SYLLABICS FINAL SHORT HORIZONTAL STROKE) resembles a hyphen, a double hyphen (U+1400᐀CANADIAN SYLLABICS HYPHEN) is used to distinguish the punctuation from the syllabics letter.
*   In [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), the double hyphen (ダブルハイフン, _daburu haifun_) (U+30A0゠KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN) in rare cases replaces an English en dash or hyphen when writing foreign words in [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") due to their potential confusion with the [prolonged sound mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu "Chōonpu") (_ー_). It may be used to separate a person's given and family names, such as transcribing the name of [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") as: ガリレオ゠ガリレイ.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen#cite_note-3) The [middle dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_dot "Middle dot") (_・_) is however much more commonly used for these purposes. (For foreign names that include both spaces and hyphens, both the middle dot and double hyphen may appear together as in [Catherine Zeta-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Zeta-Jones "Catherine Zeta-Jones"): キャサリン・ゼタ゠ジョーンズ.) The double hyphen is part of the [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") standard, but is not included in more commonly used character encodings, such as [Shift-JIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-JIS "Shift-JIS") and [EUC-JP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUC-JP "EUC-JP"). For this reason, the equals sign is frequently used in its place.
*   In [Volapük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volap%C3%BCk "Volapük") the double oblique hyphen (_teilamalül_) has to be used instead of the simple hyphen (_yümamalül_) to cut a word at the end of a line or in the compound words.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen#cite_note-4)

Stylistic variant of the single hyphen
--------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_hyphen&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Stylistic variant of the single hyphen")]

When the double hyphen is used as a functionally equivalent graphical variant ([allograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allograph "Allograph")) of the single hyphen, it has the same [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")[code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") as a conventional hyphen (since how it is displayed/printed is a font choice on that occasion).

Other forms of double hyphen are given unique [codepoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepoint "Codepoint") in Unicode:
