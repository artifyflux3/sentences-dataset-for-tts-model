For the same problem but for deterministic models see Euler method and Ordinary differential equation .

In Itô calculus , the Euler–Maruyama method (also simply called the Euler method ) is a method for the approximate numerical solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). It is an extension of the Euler method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations named after Leonhard Euler and Gisiro Maruyama . The same generalization cannot be done for any arbitrary deterministic method.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] Consider the stochastic differential equation (see Itô calculus ) d X t = a ( X t , t ) d t + b ( X t , t ) d W t , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} X_{t}=a(X_{t},t)\,\mathrm {d} t+b(X_{t},t)\,\mathrm {d} W_{t},} with initial condition X 0 = x 0 , where W t denotes the Wiener process , and suppose that we wish to solve this SDE on some interval of time [0, T ]. Then the Euler–Maruyama approximation to the true solution X is the Markov chain Y defined as follows: Partition the interval [0, T ] into N equal subintervals of width Δ Δ t > 0 {\displaystyle \Delta t>0} : 0 = τ τ 0 < τ τ 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < τ τ N = T and Δ Δ t = T / N ; {\displaystyle 0=\tau _{0}<\tau _{1}<\cdots <\tau _{N}=T{\text{ and }}\Delta t=T/N;} Set Y 0 = x 0 Recursively define Y n for 0 ≤ n ≤ N-1 by Y n + 1 = Y n + a ( Y n , τ τ n ) Δ Δ t + b ( Y n , τ τ n ) Δ Δ W n , {\displaystyle \,Y_{n+1}=Y_{n}+a(Y_{n},\tau _{n})\,\Delta t+b(Y_{n},\tau _{n})\,\Delta W_{n},} where Δ Δ W n = W τ τ n + 1 − − W τ τ n .

{\displaystyle \Delta W_{n}=W_{\tau _{n+1}}-W_{\tau _{n}}.} The random variables Δ W n are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance Δ t .

Derivation [ edit ] The Euler-Maruyama formula can be derived by considering the integral form of the Itô SDE X τ τ n + 1 = X τ τ n + ∫ ∫ τ τ n τ τ n + 1 a ( X s , s ) d s + ∫ ∫ τ τ n τ τ n + 1 b ( X s , s ) d W s {\displaystyle X_{\tau _{n+1}}=X_{\tau _{n}}+\int _{\tau _{n}}^{\tau _{n+1}}a(X_{s},s)\,ds+\int _{\tau _{n}}^{\tau _{n+1}}b(X_{s},s)\,dW_{s}} and approximating a ( X s , s ) ≈ ≈ a ( X n , τ τ n ) {\displaystyle a(X_{s},s)\approx a(X_{n},\tau _{n})} and b ( X s , s ) ≈ ≈ b ( X n , τ τ n ) {\displaystyle b(X_{s},s)\approx b(X_{n},\tau _{n})} on the small time interval [ τ τ n , τ τ n + 1 ] {\displaystyle [\tau _{n},\tau _{n+1}]} .

Strong and weak convergence [ edit ] Like other approximation methods, the accuracy of the Euler–Maruyama scheme is analyzed through comparison to an underlying continuous solution.
Let X {\displaystyle X} denote an Itô process over [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle [0,T]} , equal to X t = X 0 + ∫ ∫ 0 t μ μ ( s , X s ) d s + ∫ ∫ 0 t σ σ ( s , X s ) d W s {\displaystyle X_{t}=X_{0}+\int _{0}^{t}\mu (s,X_{s})ds+\int _{0}^{t}\sigma (s,X_{s})dW_{s}} at time t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle t\in [0,T]} , where μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } and σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } denote deterministic "drift" and "diffusion" functions, respectively, and W t {\displaystyle W_{t}} is the Wiener process .
As discrete approximations of continuous processes are typically assessed through comparison between their respective final states at T > 0 {\displaystyle T>0} , a natural convergence criterion for such discrete processes is lim N → → ∞ ∞ E [ | X ^ ^ N − − X T | ] = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{N\to \infty }\mathbb {E} \left[\left|{\hat {X}}_{N}-X_{T}\right|\right]=0.} Here, X ^ ^ N {\displaystyle {\hat {X}}_{N}} corresponds to the final state of the discrete process X ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {X}}} , which approximates X T {\displaystyle X_{T}} by taking N {\displaystyle N} steps of length Δ Δ t = T / N {\displaystyle \Delta t=T/N} .

[ 2 ] Iterative schemes satisfying the above condition are said to strongly converge to the continuous process X {\displaystyle X} , which automatically implies their satisfaction of the weak convergence criterion, lim N → → ∞ ∞ E [ | g ( X ^ ^ N ) − − g ( X T ) | ] = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{N\to \infty }\mathbb {E} \left[\left|g({\hat {X}}_{N})-g(X_{T})\right|\right]=0,} for any smooth function g {\displaystyle g} .

[ 3 ] More specifically, if there exists a constant K {\displaystyle K} and γ γ s , δ δ 0 > 0 {\displaystyle \gamma _{s},\delta _{0}>0} such that E [ | X ^ ^ N − − X T | ] ≤ ≤ K δ δ 0 γ γ s {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \left[\left|{\hat {X}}_{N}-X_{T}\right|\right]\leq K\delta _{0}^{\gamma _{s}}} for any δ δ ∈ ∈ ( 0 , δ δ 0 ) {\displaystyle \delta \in (0,\delta _{0})} , the approximation converges strongly with order γ γ s {\displaystyle \gamma _{s}} to the continuous process X {\displaystyle X} ; 
likewise, X ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {X}}} converges weakly to X {\displaystyle X} with order γ γ w {\displaystyle \gamma _{w}} if the same inequality holds with g ( X ^ ^ N ) − − g ( X T ) {\displaystyle g({\hat {X}}_{N})-g(X_{T})} in place of X ^ ^ N − − X T {\displaystyle {\hat {X}}_{N}-X_{T}} .
Strong order γ γ s {\displaystyle \gamma _{s}} convergence implies weak order γ γ w ≥ ≥ γ γ s {\displaystyle \gamma _{w}\geq \gamma _{s}} convergence:
exemplifying this, it was shown in 1972 [ 4 ] that the Euler–Maruyama method strongly converges with order γ γ s = 1 / 2 {\displaystyle \gamma _{s}=1/2} to any Itô process, provided μ μ , σ σ {\displaystyle \mu ,\sigma } satisfy Lipschitz continuity and linear growth conditions with respect to x {\displaystyle x} , and in 1974, the Euler–Maruyama scheme was proven to converge weakly with order γ γ w = 1 {\displaystyle \gamma _{w}=1} to Itô processes governed by the same such μ μ , σ σ {\displaystyle \mu ,\sigma } , [ 5 ] provided that their derivatives also satisfy similar conditions.

A simple case to analyze is geometric Brownian motion , which satisfies the SDE d X t = λ λ X t d t + σ σ X t d W t {\displaystyle dX_{t}=\lambda X_{t}\,dt+\sigma X_{t}\,dW_{t}} for fixed λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } and σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } .  
Applying Itô’s lemma to ln ⁡ ⁡ X t {\displaystyle \ln X_{t}} yields the closed-form solution X t = X 0 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ( λ λ − − 1 2 σ σ 2 ) t + σ σ W t ) {\displaystyle X_{t}=X_{0}\exp \left(\left(\lambda -{\tfrac {1}{2}}\sigma ^{2}\right)t+\sigma W_{t}\right)} Discretising with Euler–Maruyama gives the time-step updates Y n + 1 = ( 1 + λ λ Δ Δ t + σ σ Δ Δ W n ) Y n = Y 0 ∏ ∏ k = 0 n ( 1 + λ λ Δ Δ t + σ σ Δ Δ W k ) {\displaystyle Y_{n+1}=\left(1+\lambda \Delta t+\sigma \Delta W_{n}\right)Y_{n}=Y_{0}\prod _{k=0}^{n}\left(1+\lambda \Delta t+\sigma \Delta W_{k}\right)} By using a Taylor series expansion of the exponential function in the analytic solution, we can get a formula for the exact update in a time-step.

X τ τ k + 1 = X τ τ k exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ( λ λ − − 1 2 σ σ 2 ) Δ Δ t + σ σ Δ Δ W k ) = X τ τ k [ 1 + λ λ Δ Δ t + σ σ Δ Δ W k + 1 2 σ σ 2 ( ( Δ Δ W k ) 2 − − Δ Δ t ) + O ( Δ Δ t 3 / 2 ) ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X_{\tau _{k+1}}&=X_{\tau _{k}}\exp \left((\lambda -{\tfrac {1}{2}}\sigma ^{2})\Delta t+\sigma \Delta W_{k}\right)\\&=X_{\tau _{k}}\left[1+\lambda \Delta t+\sigma \Delta W_{k}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\sigma ^{2}\left((\Delta W_{k})^{2}-\Delta t\right)+O\left(\Delta t^{3/2}\right)\right]\\\end{aligned}}} Summing the local errors between the analytic and Euler-Maruyama solutions over each of the N = T / Δ Δ t {\displaystyle N=T/\Delta t} steps gives the strong error estimate E [ | X T − − Y N | ] = O ( Δ Δ t ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \left[\,|X_{T}-Y_{N}|\,\right]=O\left({\sqrt {\Delta t}}\right)} confirming strong order 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} convergence.

Another numerical aspect to consider is stability. The path's second moment is E | X t | 2 ∝ ∝ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ( 2 λ λ + σ σ 2 ) t ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} |X_{t}|^{2}\propto \exp \left((2\lambda +\sigma ^{2})t\right)} ,  
so long-time decay of the solution occurs only when 2 λ λ + σ σ 2 < 0 {\displaystyle 2\lambda +\sigma ^{2}<0} .  
The Euler–Maruyama scheme preserves variance decay in this case provided that Δ Δ t ≤ ≤ − − 1 λ λ 2 ( 2 λ λ + σ σ 2 ) {\displaystyle \Delta t\leq {\frac {-1}{\lambda ^{2}}}\left(2\lambda +\sigma ^{2}\right)} .

Application [ edit ] Gene expression modelled as a stochastic process.

An area that has benefited significantly from SDEs is mathematical biology . As many biological processes are both stochastic and continuous in nature, numerical methods of solving SDEs are highly valuable in the field.
