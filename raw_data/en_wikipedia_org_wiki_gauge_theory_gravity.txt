To those familiar with general relativity , it is highly reminiscent of the tetrad formalism although there are significant conceptual differences.  Most notably, the background in GTG is flat, Minkowski spacetime .  The equivalence principle is not assumed, but instead follows from the fact that the gauge covariant derivative is minimally coupled .  As in general relativity, equations structurally identical to the Einstein field equations are derivable from a variational principle .  A spin tensor can also be supported in a manner similar to Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory .  GTG was first proposed by Lasenby, Doran , and Gull in 1998 [ 1 ] as a fulfillment of partial results presented in 1993.

[ 2 ] The theory has not been widely adopted by the rest of the physics community, who have mostly opted for differential geometry approaches like that of the related gauge gravitation theory .

Mathematical foundation [ edit ] The foundation of GTG comes from two principles.  First, position-gauge invariance demands that arbitrary local displacements of fields not affect the physical content of the field equations.  Second, rotation-gauge invariance demands that arbitrary local rotations of fields not affect the physical content of the field equations.  These principles lead to the introduction of a new pair of linear functions, the position-gauge field and the rotation-gauge field.  A displacement by some arbitrary function f x ↦ ↦ x ′ = f ( x ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto x'=f(x)} gives rise to the position-gauge field defined by the mapping on its adjoint, h ¯ ¯ ( a , x ) ↦ ↦ h ¯ ¯ ′ ( a , x ) = h ¯ ¯ ( f ¯ ¯ − − 1 ( a ) , f ( x ) ) , {\displaystyle {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(a,x)\mapsto {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}'(a,x)={\bar {\mathsf {h}}}({\bar {\mathsf {f}}}^{-1}(a),f(x)),} which is linear in its first argument and a is a constant vector.  Similarly, a rotation by some arbitrary rotor R gives rise to the rotation-gauge field Ω Ω ¯ ¯ ( a , x ) ↦ ↦ Ω Ω ¯ ¯ ′ ( a , x ) = R Ω Ω ¯ ¯ ( a , x ) R † † − − 2 a ⋅ ⋅ ∇ ∇ R R † † .

{\displaystyle {\bar {\mathsf {\Omega }}}(a,x)\mapsto {\bar {\mathsf {\Omega }}}'(a,x)=R{\bar {\mathsf {\Omega }}}(a,x)R^{\dagger }-2a\cdot \nabla RR^{\dagger }.} We can define two different covariant directional derivatives a ⋅ ⋅ D = a ⋅ ⋅ h ¯ ¯ ( ∇ ∇ ) + 1 2 Ω Ω ( h ( a ) ) {\displaystyle a\cdot D=a\cdot {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(\nabla )+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{\mathsf {\Omega }}({\mathsf {h}}(a))} a ⋅ ⋅ D = a ⋅ ⋅ h ¯ ¯ ( ∇ ∇ ) + Ω Ω ( h ( a ) ) × × {\displaystyle a\cdot {\mathcal {D}}=a\cdot {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(\nabla )+{\mathsf {\Omega }}({\mathsf {h}}(a))\times } or with the specification of a coordinate system D μ μ = ∂ ∂ μ μ + 1 2 Ω Ω μ μ {\displaystyle D_{\mu }=\partial _{\mu }+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\Omega _{\mu }} D μ μ = ∂ ∂ μ μ + Ω Ω μ μ × × , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}_{\mu }=\partial _{\mu }+\Omega _{\mu }\times ,} where × denotes the commutator product.

The first of these derivatives is better suited for dealing directly with spinors whereas the second is better suited for observables .  The GTG analog of the Riemann tensor is built from the commutation rules of these derivatives.

[ D μ μ , D ν ν ] ψ ψ = 1 2 R μ μ ν ν ψ ψ {\displaystyle [D_{\mu },D_{\nu }]\psi ={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\mathsf {R}}_{\mu \nu }\psi } R ( a ∧ ∧ b ) = R ( h ( a ∧ ∧ b ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}(a\wedge b)={\mathsf {R}}({\mathsf {h}}(a\wedge b))} Field equations [ edit ] The field equations are derived by postulating the Einstein–Hilbert action governs the evolution of the gauge fields, i.e.

S = ∫ ∫ [ 1 2 κ κ ( R − − 2 Λ Λ ) + L M ] ( det h ) − − 1 d 4 x .

{\displaystyle S=\int \left[{1 \over 2\kappa }\left({\mathcal {R}}-2\Lambda \right)+{\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {M} }\right](\det {\mathsf {h}})^{-1}\,\mathrm {d} ^{4}x.} Minimizing variation of the action with respect to the two gauge fields results in the field equations G ( a ) − − Λ Λ a = κ κ T ( a ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}(a)-\Lambda a=\kappa {\mathcal {T}}(a)} D ∧ ∧ h ¯ ¯ ( a ) = κ κ S ⋅ ⋅ h ¯ ¯ ( a ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}\wedge {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(a)=\kappa {\mathcal {S}}\cdot {\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(a),} where T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} is the covariant energy–momentum tensor and S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} is the covariant spin tensor .  Importantly, these equations do not give an evolving curvature of spacetime but rather merely give the evolution of the gauge fields within the flat spacetime.

Relation to general relativity [ edit ] For those more familiar with general relativity, it is possible to define a metric tensor from the position-gauge field in a manner similar to tetrads.  In the tetrad formalism, a set of four vectors { e ( a ) μ μ } {\displaystyle \{{e_{(a)}}^{\mu }\}} are introduced.  The Greek index μ is raised or lowered by multiplying and contracting with the spacetime's metric tensor.  The parenthetical Latin index (a) is a label for each of the four tetrads, which is raised and lowered as if it were multiplied and contracted with a separate Minkowski metric tensor.  GTG, roughly, reverses the roles of these indices.  The metric is implicitly assumed to be Minkowski in the selection of the spacetime algebra .  The information contained in the other set of indices gets subsumed by the behavior of the gauge fields.

We can make the associations g μ μ = h − − 1 ( e μ μ ) {\displaystyle g_{\mu }={\mathsf {h}}^{-1}(e_{\mu })} g μ μ = h ¯ ¯ ( e μ μ ) {\displaystyle g^{\mu }={\bar {\mathsf {h}}}(e^{\mu })} for a covariant vector and contravariant vector in a curved spacetime, where now the unit vectors { e μ μ } {\displaystyle \{e_{\mu }\}} are the chosen coordinate basis.  These can define the metric using the rule g μ μ ν ν = g μ μ ⋅ ⋅ g ν ν .

{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }=g_{\mu }\cdot g_{\nu }.} Following this procedure, it is possible to show that for the most part the observable predictions of GTG agree with Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory for non-vanishing spin and reduce to general relativity for vanishing spin.  GTG does, however, make different predictions about global solutions.  For example, in the study of a point mass, the choice of a "Newtonian gauge" yields a solution similar to the Schwarzschild metric in Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates .  General relativity permits an extension known as the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates .  GTG, on the other hand, forbids any such extension.
