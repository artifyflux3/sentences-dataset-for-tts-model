Holocaust studies , or sometimes Holocaust research , is a scholarly discipline that encompasses the historical research and study of the Holocaust . Institutions dedicated to Holocaust research investigate the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary aspects of Holocaust methodology, demography, sociology, and psychology. It also covers the study of Nazi Germany , World War II , Jewish history , antisemitism , religion , Christian-Jewish relations , Holocaust theology , ethics , social responsibility , and genocide on a global scale. Exploring trauma, memories, and testimonies of the experiences of Holocaust survivors , [ 1 ] human rights , international relations , Jewish life, Judaism , and Jewish identity in the post-Holocaust world are also covered in this type of research.

[ 2 ] Debates in the field [ edit ] The field of Holocaust studies has seen many debates, some acrimonious, such as the Holocaust uniqueness debate , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] functionalism–intentionalism debate , [ 3 ] [ 5 ] and debates over perpetrator-focused versus victim-focused research.

[ 6 ] During the Gaza war , the field found itself in a state of crisis. While some Holocaust researchers suggested a continuity between the 7 October attacks and the Holocaust, others expressed concerns about the mass violence committed by Israelis in the form of the Gaza genocide .

[ 4 ] [ 3 ] Political scientist Ernesto Verdeja writes that "the crisis reflects more profound normative disagreements over who is a legitimate victim worth grieving, how and when – if at all – mass violence can be justified , and over the (exceptional) moral status of the state of Israel".
