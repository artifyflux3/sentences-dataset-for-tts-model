The **Alessi Brothers**, also known as **Alessi**, are an American [pop rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock "Pop rock") singer-songwriter [duo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet_(music) "Duet (music)") who first came to international prominence with their 1977 [hit single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_single "Hit single") "Oh, Lori". The duo are identical twin [brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling "Sibling"), Billy and Bobby Alessi (born July 12, 1953, [West Hempstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island "Long Island"), New York).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_Brothers#cite_note-Larkin-1)

In their early teens, the brothers attended [West Hempstead High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hempstead_High_School "West Hempstead High School") and formed the band The Country Gentlemen with schoolmate Don Droege and drummer Bob Pelicane. The band often played at a teen club called The Mod Scene and [Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island "Long Island") summer beach club gigs, as well as playing at other venues which included Murray the K's World in [Roosevelt Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Field "Roosevelt Field"), the [Raleigh Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh_Hotel_(South_Fallsburg,_New_York) "Raleigh Hotel (South Fallsburg, New York)") in the [Catskills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskills "Catskills"), and The Café Wha? in [Greenwich Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village "Greenwich Village").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_Brothers#cite_note-2) The band released one 45 single entitled "Saturday Night" which was credited to William Alessi.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_Brothers#cite_note-3)

The Country Gentlemen in 1967 evolved into The Look and recorded the single "If I were A Carpenter" b/w "Can You Do" on Verve Records.

In 1970, the Alessis were working in the [Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre") cast of _[Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair\_(musical) "Hair (musical)")_, when former [Blues Magoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Magoos "Blues Magoos") guitarist Peppy Castro joined the show. The three formed the band [Barnaby Bye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Bye "Barnaby Bye")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_Brothers#cite_note-Larkin-1) and, with Mike Ricciardella on drums, the band were signed to [Atlantic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records "Atlantic Records") and released albums in 1972 (_Room to Grow_) and 1973 (_Touch_). The next Barnaby Bye album (_Thrice Upon a Time_) was not released until 2008, after the band reformed.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_Brothers#cite_note-barnabybye.com-4)

After the early years with Barnaby Bye, the brothers continued writing, recording and performing as the duo, Alessi.
