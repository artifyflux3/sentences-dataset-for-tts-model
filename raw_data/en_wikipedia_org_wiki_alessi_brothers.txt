In 1970, the Alessis were working in the Broadway cast of Hair , when former Blues Magoos guitarist Peppy Castro joined the show. The three formed the band Barnaby Bye [ 1 ] and, with Mike Ricciardella on drums, the band were signed to Atlantic Records and released albums in 1972 ( Room to Grow ) and 1973 ( Touch ).
