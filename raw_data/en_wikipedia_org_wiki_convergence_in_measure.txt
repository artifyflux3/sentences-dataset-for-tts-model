Convergence in measure is either of two distinct mathematical concepts both of which generalize
the concept of convergence in probability .

Definitions [ edit ] Let f , f n ( n ∈ ∈ N ) : X → → R {\displaystyle f,f_{n}\ (n\in \mathbb {N} ):X\to \mathbb {R} } be measurable functions on a measure space ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) .

{\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu ).} The sequence f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} is said to converge globally in measure to f {\displaystyle f} if for every ε ε > 0 , {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0,} lim n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ ( { x ∈ ∈ X : | f ( x ) − − f n ( x ) | ≥ ≥ ε ε } ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\mu (\{x\in X:|f(x)-f_{n}(x)|\geq \varepsilon \})=0,} and to converge locally in measure to f {\displaystyle f} if for every ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} and every F ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle F\in \Sigma } with μ μ ( F ) < ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \mu (F)<\infty ,} lim n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ ( { x ∈ ∈ F : | f ( x ) − − f n ( x ) | ≥ ≥ ε ε } ) = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\mu (\{x\in F:|f(x)-f_{n}(x)|\geq \varepsilon \})=0.} On a finite measure space, both notions are equivalent.  Otherwise, convergence in measure can refer to either global convergence in measure [ 1 ] : 2.2.3 or local convergence in measure, depending on the author.

Properties [ edit ] Throughout, f {\displaystyle f} and f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} ( n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } ) are measurable functions X → → R {\displaystyle X\to \mathbb {R} } .

Global convergence in measure implies local convergence in measure.  The converse, however, is false; i.e.

, local convergence in measure is strictly weaker than global convergence in measure, in general.

If, however, μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } or, more generally, if f {\displaystyle f} and all the f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} vanish outside some set of finite measure, then the distinction between local and global convergence in measure disappears.

If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is σ -finite and ( f n ) converges (locally or globally) to f {\displaystyle f} in measure, there is a subsequence converging to f {\displaystyle f} almost everywhere .

[ 1 ] : 2.2.5 The assumption of σ -finiteness is not necessary in the case of global convergence in measure.

If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite, ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} locally in measure if and only if every subsequence has in turn a subsequence that converges to f {\displaystyle f} almost everywhere.

In particular, if ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} almost everywhere, then ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} locally in measure.  The converse is false.

Fatou's lemma and the monotone convergence theorem hold if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure.

If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite, Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem also holds if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure.

[ 1 ] : 2.8.6 If X = [ a , b ] ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle X=[a,b]\subseteq \mathbb {R} } and μ is Lebesgue measure , there are sequences ( g n ) {\displaystyle (g_{n})} of step functions and ( h n ) {\displaystyle (h_{n})} of continuous functions converging globally in measure to f {\displaystyle f} .

If f {\displaystyle f} and f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} are in L p ( μ ) for some p > 0 {\displaystyle p>0} and ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} in the p {\displaystyle p} -norm, then ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} globally in measure. The converse is false.

If f n {\displaystyle f_{n}} converges to f {\displaystyle f} in measure and g n {\displaystyle g_{n}} converges to g {\displaystyle g} in measure then f n + g n {\displaystyle f_{n}+g_{n}} converges to f + g {\displaystyle f+g} in measure. Additionally, if the measure space is finite, f n g n {\displaystyle f_{n}g_{n}} also converges to f g {\displaystyle fg} .

Counterexamples [ edit ] Let X = R {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} } , μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be Lebesgue measure, and f {\displaystyle f} the constant function with value zero.

The sequence f n = χ χ [ n , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle f_{n}=\chi _{[n,\infty )}} converges to f {\displaystyle f} locally in measure, but does not converge to f {\displaystyle f} globally in measure.

The sequence f n = χ χ [ j 2 k , j + 1 2 k ] , {\displaystyle f_{n}=\chi _{\left[{\frac {j}{2^{k}}},{\frac {j+1}{2^{k}}}\right]},} where k = ⌊ ⌊ log 2 ⁡ ⁡ n ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle k=\lfloor \log _{2}n\rfloor } and j = n − − 2 k {\displaystyle j=n-2^{k}} , the first five terms of which are χ χ [ 0 , 1 ] , χ χ [ 0 , 1 2 ] , χ χ [ 1 2 , 1 ] , χ χ [ 0 , 1 4 ] , χ χ [ 1 4 , 1 2 ] , {\displaystyle \chi _{\left[0,1\right]},\;\chi _{\left[0,{\frac {1}{2}}\right]},\;\chi _{\left[{\frac {1}{2}},1\right]},\;\chi _{\left[0,{\frac {1}{4}}\right]},\;\chi _{\left[{\frac {1}{4}},{\frac {1}{2}}\right]},} converges to 0 {\displaystyle 0} globally in measure; but for no x {\displaystyle x} does f n ( x ) {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)} converge to zero. Hence ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} fails to converge to f {\displaystyle f} almost everywhere.

[ 1 ] : 2.2.4 The sequence f n = n χ χ [ 0 , 1 n ] {\displaystyle f_{n}=n\chi _{\left[0,{\frac {1}{n}}\right]}} converges to f {\displaystyle f} almost everywhere and globally in measure, but not in the p {\displaystyle p} -norm for any p ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle p\geq 1} .

Topology [ edit ] There is a topology , called the topology of (local) convergence in measure , on the collection of measurable functions from X such that local convergence in measure corresponds to convergence on that topology.
This topology is defined by the family of pseudometrics { ρ ρ F : F ∈ ∈ Σ Σ , μ μ ( F ) < ∞ ∞ } , {\displaystyle \{\rho _{F}:F\in \Sigma ,\ \mu (F)<\infty \},} where ρ ρ F ( f , g ) = ∫ ∫ F min { | f − − g | , 1 } d μ μ .

{\displaystyle \rho _{F}(f,g)=\int _{F}\min\{|f-g|,1\}\,d\mu .} In general, one may restrict oneself to some subfamily of sets F (instead of all possible subsets of finite measure). It suffices that for each G ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle G\subset X} of finite measure and ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} there exists F in the family such that μ μ ( G ∖ ∖ F ) < ε ε .

{\displaystyle \mu (G\setminus F)<\varepsilon .} When μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } , we may consider only one metric ρ ρ X {\displaystyle \rho _{X}} , so the topology of convergence in finite measure is metrizable. If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is an arbitrary measure finite or not, then d ( f , g ) := inf δ δ > 0 μ μ ( { | f − − g | ≥ ≥ δ δ } ) + δ δ {\displaystyle d(f,g):=\inf \limits _{\delta >0}\mu (\{|f-g|\geq \delta \})+\delta } still defines a metric that generates the global convergence in measure.

[ 2 ] Because this topology is generated by a family of pseudometrics, it is uniformizable .
Working with uniform structures instead of topologies allows us to formulate uniform properties such as Cauchyness .
