Common usage places this range between 33 and 50 GHz , but may vary depending on the source using the term.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The foregoing range corresponds to the recommended frequency band of operation of WR22 waveguides. These frequencies are equivalent to wavelengths between 6 mm and 9.1 mm in air/vacuum. The Q band is in the EHF range of the radio spectrum .

The term "Q band" does not have a consistently precise usage in the technical literature, but tends to be a concurrent subset of both the IEEE designated K a band (26.5–40 GHz) and V band (40–75 GHz). Neither the IEEE nor the ITU-R recognize the Q band in their standards, which define the nomenclature of bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The ISO recognizes the Q band; however, the range therefore defined is  36 to 46 GHz. Other ISO frequency band definitions do not precisely match the concurrent definitions of the IEEE and ITU-R.

[ 5 ] The Q band is mainly used for satellite communications, terrestrial microwave communications and for radio astronomy studies such as the QUIET telescope .  It is also used in automotive radar and in radar investigating the properties of the Earth's surface.
