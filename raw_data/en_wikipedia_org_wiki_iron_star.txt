a hypothetical type of compact star .

Blue supergiant [ edit ] An iron star is a type of blue supergiant which has a forest of forbidden Fe II lines in its spectrum . They are potentially quiescent hot luminous blue variables .

Eta Carinae has been described as a prototypical example.

The premise behind the formation of iron stars states that muon-catalyzed fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into iron-56 nuclei, due to its nature as the atomic nucleus with the lowest mass per nucleon.

[ 3 ] Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of iron.

[ 4 ] The formation of these stars is only a possibility if protons do not decay . Though the surface of a neutron star may be iron according to some predictions, it is distinct from an iron star.

By the end of 10 10 26 to 10 10 76 years, iron stars would have collapsed into neutron stars and black holes .

[ 4 ] In popular culture [ edit ] The Soviet film The Andromeda Nebula is about a starship low on fuel caught by an iron star's gravity, with the star itself being so dim that it can only be seen in the infrared. It is based on the novel Andromeda Nebula by Ivan Yefremov written when steady state theory was dominant and iron stars were expected to exist in the Milky Way.
