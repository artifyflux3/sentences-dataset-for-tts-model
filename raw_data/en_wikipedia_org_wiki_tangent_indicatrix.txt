Let γ γ ( t ) {\displaystyle \gamma (t)} be a closed curve with nowhere-vanishing tangent vector γ γ ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}} . Then the tangent indicatrix T ( t ) {\displaystyle T(t)} of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the closed curve on the unit sphere given by T = γ γ ˙ ˙ | γ γ ˙ ˙ | {\displaystyle T={\frac {\dot {\gamma }}{|{\dot {\gamma }}|}}} .

The total curvature of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } (the integral of curvature with respect to arc length along the curve) is equal to the arc length of T {\displaystyle T} .
