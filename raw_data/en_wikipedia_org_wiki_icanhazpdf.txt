[ 1 ] It began in 2011 [ 2 ] by scientist Andrea Kuszewski.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The name is derived from the meme I Can Has Cheezburger?

[ 4 ] Process [ edit ] Users request articles by tweeting an article's title, DOI or other linked information like a publisher's link, [ 5 ] their email address, and the hashtag "#ICanHazPDF". Someone who has access to the article might then email it to them. The user then deletes the original tweet.

[ 6 ] Alternatively, users who do not wish to post their email address in the clear can use direct messaging to exchange contact information with a volunteer who has offered to share the article of interest.

Use and popularity [ edit ] The practice amounts to copyright infringement in numerous countries, [ 6 ] and so is arguably part of the ' black open access ' trend.

[ 7 ] The majority of requests are for articles published in the last five years, and most users are from English-speaking countries.

[ 1 ] Requests for biology papers are more common than papers in other fields, despite subscription prices for chemistry, physics, and astronomy being, on average, higher than for biology.

[ 1 ] Possible reasons for people to use the hashtag include the reluctance of readers to pay for article access and the speed of the process compared to most university interlibrary loans .
