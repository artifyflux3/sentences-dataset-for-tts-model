The **prime** symbol ′, **double prime** symbol ″, **triple prime** symbol ‴, and **quadruple prime** symbol ⁗ are used to designate units and for other purposes in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics") and [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music").

Although the characters differ little in appearance from those of the [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") and single and double [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), the uses of the prime symbol are quite different.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-1) While an apostrophe is now often used in place of the prime, and a double quote in place of the double prime (due to the lack of prime symbols on everyday writing keyboards), such substitutions are not considered appropriate in formal materials or in [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting").

Designation of units
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prime_(symbol)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Designation of units")]

The prime symbol ′ is commonly used to represent [feet (ft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length) "Foot (length)"), and the double prime ″ is used to represent [inches (in)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-2) The triple prime ‴, as used in [watchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaking "Watchmaking"), represents a _[ligne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne "Ligne")_ (1⁄12 of a "French" inch, or _[pouce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouce "Pouce")_, about 2.26 millimetres or 0.089 inches).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-3)

Primes are also used for [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"). The prime symbol ′ is used for [arcminutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcminute "Arcminute") (1⁄60 of a degree), and the double prime ″ for [arcseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond") (1⁄60 of an arcminute).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-Las_Cumbres-4) As an angular measurement, 3°5′30″ means 3 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"), 5 arcminutes and 30 arcseconds. In historical astronomical works, the triple prime was used to denote "[thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_(angle) "Third (angle)")" (1⁄60 of an arcsecond)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-Schultz_1797-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-6) and a quadruple prime ⁗ "[fourths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_(angle) "Fourth (angle)")" (1⁄60 of a third of arc),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-8) but modern usage has replaced this with [decimal fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal#Decimal_fractions "Decimal") of an arcsecond.

Primes are sometimes used to indicate minutes, and double primes to indicate seconds of time, as in the [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage "John Cage") composition _[4′33″](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3 "4′33″")_ (spoken as "four thirty-three"), a composition that lasts exactly 4 minutes 33 seconds. This notation only applies to duration, and is seldom used for durations longer than 60 minutes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-9)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

Use in mathematics, statistics, and science
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prime_(symbol)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Use in mathematics, statistics, and science")]

In mathematics, the prime is generally used to generate more variable names for similar things without resorting to subscripts, with _x′_ generally meaning something related to (or derived from) _x_. For example, if a point is represented by the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates")(_x_, _y_), then that point rotated, translated or reflected might be represented as (_x′_, _y′_).

Usually, the meaning of _x′_ is defined when it is first used, but sometimes, its meaning is assumed to be understood:

*   A [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") or differentiated function: in [Lagrange's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_notation "Lagrange's notation"), _f′_(_x_) and _f″_(_x_) are the first and second derivatives of the function _f_(_x_) with respect to x. The pattern may be continued, such as in _f_‴(_x_) and _f_⁗(_x_), with each additional prime denoting the next higher derivative. Similarly, if _y_ = _f_(_x_), then _y′_ and _y″_ denote the first and second derivatives of _y_ with respect to _x_. Other notations for derivatives also exist (see [Notation for differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation "Notation for differentiation")).
*   [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)")[complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) "Complement (set theory)"): _A′_ is the complement of the set _A_ (other notations also exist).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-10)
*   The negation of an [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory) "Event (probability theory)") in probability theory: Pr(_A′_) = 1 − Pr(_A_) (other notations also exist).
*   The result of a [transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(mathematics) "Transformation (mathematics)"): _Tx_ = _x′_
*   The [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose "Transpose") of a matrix (other notations also exist)
*   The [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space") of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")

The prime is said to "decorate" the letter to which it applies. The same convention is adopted in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming"), particularly in [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)").

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), prime and double prime are used as abbreviations for [minute and second of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc") (and thus [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"), [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"), [elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation "Elevation") and [right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension")).

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), the prime is used to denote variables after an event. For example, _v_ A′ may indicate the velocity of object A after an event. It is also commonly used in relativity: the event at (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) in [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference")_S_, has coordinates (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _t′_) in frame _S′_.

In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), it is used to distinguish between different functional groups connected to an atom in a molecule, such as R and R′, representing different [alkyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkyl "Alkyl") groups in an [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound"). The [carbonyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl "Carbonyl") carbon in proteins is denoted as C′, which distinguishes it from the other [backbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein#Biochemistry "Protein") carbon, the [alpha carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_and_beta_carbon "Alpha and beta carbon"), which is denoted as C α. In [physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry "Physical chemistry"), it is used to distinguish between the lower state and the upper state of a [quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number "Quantum number") during a transition. For example, _J′_ denotes the upper state of the quantum number _J_ while _J″_ denotes the lower state of the quantum number _J_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-11)

In [molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology"), the prime is used to denote the positions of carbon on a ring of [deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose "Deoxyribose") or [ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose "Ribose"). The prime distinguishes places on these two chemicals, rather than places on other parts of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") or [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA"), like [phosphate groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_group "Phosphate group") or [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid "Nucleic acid"). Thus, when indicating the direction of movement of an [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme") along a string of DNA, biologists will say that it moves from the 5′ end to the 3′ end, because these carbons are on the ends of the DNA molecule. The chemistry of this reaction demands that the 3′ OH be extended by DNA synthesis. Prime can also be used to indicate which position a molecule has attached to, such as 5′-monophosphate.

The prime can be used in the [transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration") of some [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), such as [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages"), to denote [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics) "Palatalization (phonetics)"). Prime and double prime are used to transliterate Cyrillic [yeri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_sign "Soft sign") (the soft sign, ь) and [yer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yer "Yer") (the hard sign, ъ).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-12) However, in [ISO 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9 "ISO 9"), the corresponding modifier letters are used instead.

Originally, [X-bar theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory "X-bar theory") used a bar over syntactic units to indicate bar-levels in [syntactic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_structure "Syntactic structure"), generally rendered as an [overbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbar "Overbar"). While easy to write, the bar notation proved difficult to typeset, leading to the adoption of the prime symbol to indicate a bar. (Despite the lack of bar, the unit would still be read as "X bar", as opposed to "X prime".) With contemporary development of typesetting software such as [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX"), typesetting bars is considerably simpler; nevertheless, both prime and bar markups are accepted usages.

Some X-bar notations use a double prime (standing in for a double-bar) to indicate a phrasal level, indicated in most notations by "XP".

Prime, double prime and triple prime

The prime symbol is used in combination with lower case letters in the [Helmholtz pitch notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_pitch_notation "Helmholtz pitch notation") system to distinguish notes in different [octaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave "Octave") from [middle C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_C "Middle C") upwards. Thus c represents the ⟨C⟩ below middle C, c′ represents middle C, c″ represents the ⟨C⟩ in the octave above middle C, and c‴ the ⟨C⟩ in the octave two octaves above middle C. A combination of upper case letters and sub-prime symbols is used to represent notes in lower octaves. Thus C represents the ⟨C⟩ below the bass stave, while C ͵ represents the ⟨C⟩ in the octave below that.

In some musical scores, the double prime ″ is used to indicate a length of time in seconds. It is used over a [fermata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermata "Fermata")𝄐 denoting a long note or rest.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#cite_note-13)

Unicode and HTML representations of the prime and related symbols are as follows.

*   U+2032′PRIME (&prime;) (lower case p)
*   U+2033″DOUBLE PRIME (&Prime;) (upper case P)
*   U+2034‴TRIPLE PRIME (&tprime;)
*   U+2035‵REVERSED PRIME (&backprime;, &bprime;)
*   U+2036‶REVERSED DOUBLE PRIME
*   U+2037‷REVERSED TRIPLE PRIME
*   U+2057⁗QUADRUPLE PRIME (&qprime;)
*   U+02B9 ʹ MODIFIER LETTER PRIME
*   U+02BA ʺ MODIFIER LETTER DOUBLE PRIME

The "[modifier letter prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter_prime "Modifier letter prime")" and "modifier letter double prime" characters are intended for linguistic purposes, such as the indication of [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics) "Stress (linguistics)") or the transliteration of certain [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic "Cyrillic") characters.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In a context when the character set used does not include the prime or double prime character (e.g., in an online discussion context where only ASCII or [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1") [ISO Latin 1] is expected), they are often respectively approximated by ASCII apostrophe (U+0027) or quotation mark (U+0022).

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX") provides an oversized prime symbol, `\prime` (![Image 2: {\displaystyle \prime }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27d146977597718c98f491fc7569636c2ee9e4e4)), which, when used in super- or sub-scripts, renders appropriately; e.g., `f_\prime^\prime` appears as ![Image 3: {\displaystyle f_{\prime }^{\prime }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c179bdbb5dff21da15559fabfc6325c8bdad862). When in math mode, an apostrophe, `'`, is a shortcut for a superscript prime; e.g., `f'` appears as ![Image 4: {\displaystyle f'\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef89c054fc04588ddc396cd9af02c516dee09fa8).
