Founded in 1854, the university focuses primarily on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and architecture .

Like its sister institution EPFL , ETH Zurich is part of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain , a consortium of universities and research institutes under the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research .

[ 7 ] As of 2023 [update] , ETH Zurich enrolled 25,380 students from over 120 countries, of which 4,425 were pursuing doctoral degrees.

[ 8 ] Students, faculty, and researchers affiliated with ETH Zurich include 22 Nobel laureates , including Albert Einstein , two Fields Medalists , three Pritzker Prize winners , and one Turing Award recipient .

[ 9 ] It is a founding member of the IDEA League and the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), and a member of the CESAER and League of European Research Universities (LERU) networks and the ENHANCE Alliance.

ETH Zurich class=notpageimage| Location: ETH Zurich, Switzerland History [ edit ] ETH Zurich was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute ( eidgenössische polytechnische Schule ) at various sites throughout the city of Zurich.

[ 1 ] It was initially composed of six faculties: architecture, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry , forestry , and an integrated department for the fields of mathematics, natural sciences, literature, and social and political sciences .

It is locally still known as Polytechnikum , or simply as Poly , derived from the original name eidgenössische polytechnische Schule , [ 10 ] which translates to "federal polytechnic school".

[ 11 ] ETH Zurich is a federal institute (i.e. under direct administration by the Swiss government). The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had.

[ 12 ] In the beginning, it was co-located in the buildings of the University of Zurich .

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of Jérôme Franel , the course program of ETH Zurich was restructured to that of a real university and ETH Zurich was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909, the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule . In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. It now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the " ETH Domain " with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.

[ 13 ] Campus [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Find sources: "ETH Zurich" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ETH Zurich has two campuses, namely Zentrum and Hönggerberg . The Zentrum campus grew around the main building, which was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but which is nowadays located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, ETH Zurich spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH Zurich, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the Hönggerberg , a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003.

[ 10 ] Zentrum campus [ edit ] The Zentrum campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout the city of Zurich.

The Zentrum campus houses the: [ 14 ] Department of Mathematics (D-MATH) Department of Computer Science (D-INFK) Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences (D-GESS) Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET) Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (D-MAVT) Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS) Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (D-EAPS) Department of Management, Technology, and Economics (D-MTEC) Department of Health Sciences and Technology (D-HEST) View onto the main building from the Polyterrasse The main building of ETH Zurich was built from 1858 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner ; the architect, however, was Gottfried Semper , who was a professor of architecture at ETH Zurich at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a neoclassical style that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the Semperoper in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of Andrea Palladio and Donato Bramante . During the construction of the University of Zurich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH Zurich building was enlarged and received its cupola .

[ 10 ] ETH Zurich's main building at night The main building stands directly across the street from the University Hospital of Zurich and, right alongside the main building of the University of Zurich .

Hönggerberg campus [ edit ] The Hönggerberg campus is a more classical university campus, [ 15 ] consisting mainly of university buildings and student accommodation.

The Hönggerberg campus houses the: [ 16 ] Department of Architecture (D-ARCH) Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (D-BAUG) Department of Materials (D-MATL) Department of Biology (D-BIOL) Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences (D-CHAB) Department of Physics (D-PHYS) There is also an ASVZ sports centre which is accessible to all students and faculty, and includes a gym, beach volleyball court, football field, and martial-arts rooms.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In 2005, ETH Zurich's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called "Science City" for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.

Research and education [ edit ] Undergraduate education at ETH Zurich is marked by the distinctive Basisprüfungen ("base examinations"), intensive first-year examination blocks, typically encompassing foundational subjects in mathematics, physics, and engineering disciplines. These exams serve both as a filter and as preparation for advanced, research-oriented coursework. Students must pass these examinations within two attempts, with failure rates in mathematics-intensive programmes often reaching between 50% and 60%. Doctoral education at ETH emphasizes hands-on research experience, where PhD candidates are hired directly as paid employees in professors' laboratories, conducting independent research and actively contributing to teaching. Many departments further structure doctoral training through thematic graduate schools, promoting collaborative research with multiple advisers and international cooperation, notably with the University of Zurich.

[ 10 ] Its research is especially focused on the STEM areas and ETH hosts several research hubs.

ETH AI Center [ edit ] The ETH AI Center is ETH Zurich's central hub for artificial intelligence research. It is an active member of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), hosting the ELLIS unit in Zurich and offering ELLIS PhD fellowships. Through the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS), it cooperates closely with the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems , jointly funding research and supervising doctoral students.

Swiss National Supercomputing Center [ edit ] The Swiss National Supercomputing Center is an autonomous organizational unit of the ETH Zurich. It is a national facility based in Lugano -Cornaredo, [ 19 ] offering high-performance computing services for Swiss-based scientists.

[ 20 ] In 2024 it deployed the Alps Supercomputer, existing of over 10,000 H100 Nvidia GPUs , making it one of the largest academic supercomputers in the world.

ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics [ edit ] The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and the use of ion beam based techniques with applications in archeology , earth sciences , life sciences , material sciences and fundamental physics .

Spin-offs [ edit ] ETH Zurich promotes technology and knowledge transfer through an entrepreneurial ecosystem to foster spin-offs and start-ups.

[ 21 ] As of 2022,  527 ETH Zurich spin-off companies had been created.

Student associations [ edit ] ETH Zurich has well over 100 student associations .

[ 37 ] Most notable is the VSETH ( Verband der Studierenden an der ETH ) which forms the umbrella organization of all field of study specific student associations and comprises a large variety of committees such as the Student Sustainability Committee and the ETH Model United Nations . The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zurich are well-attended by ETH Zurich students and vice versa.

The largest career fair on campus is the Polymesse which is organized by students in the Forum und Contact committee of VSETH. Many student associations however organize career fairs specifically for the students in their departments. The VSETH is also the official representation of the student body towards the school and has been working with ETH on various projects with the aim of improving the students' experience at ETH. The representation towards the various departments is handled by the respective student associations.

ETH Juniors is another student organization. It forms a bridge between industry and ETH Zurich and offers many services for students and companies alike as a student-led consulting group.

[ 39 ] The biggest annual sports event is the SOLA-Stafette (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometres (87 mi).

[ 40 ] Student Project House [ edit ] In 2017, ETH Zurich board approved the creation of a "Student Project House" to encourage student projects and foster innovation. A test consisting of a "makerspace" and co-working space was established on the Hönggerberg campus, [ 41 ] [ 42 ] followed by a 6-story space near the ETH Zurich main building. Both locations function as a unified entity for the purpose of qualifications, staffing and decision making. While both makerspaces offer similar tools, the central one is significantly larger and also hosts a rentable auditorium, intended for pitching projects to faculty to gain funding, and a bar.

Both makerspaces include workspaces for wood- and metalworking, electronics fabrication, as well as an array of 3D-printers for students to use at a little over material cost. Both also feature a shop for students to buy items such as resistors in lower quantities than ordinarily, while passing down the savings of bulk purchases.

[ 43 ] The makerspaces are managed and staffed entirely by students. A new space is expected to open on the Hönggerberg campus in 2024.

[ 44 ] [ needs update ] Engineering competitions [ edit ] The Swiss Academic Spaceflight Initiative (ARIS) [ 45 ] (German: Akademische Raumfahrt Initiative Schweiz ) is an organisation at ETH Zurich that focuses on the development of space related technologies. The most prominent area of research is in the development of a sounding rocket that is flown yearly at the Spaceport America Cup . The AMZ - Academic Motorsports Association [ 46 ] (German: Akademischer Motorsportverein Zürich ) is the ETH Zurich's Formula Student team.

Swissloop is ETH Zurich's newest competition team that is working on the development of a hyperloop system.

Traditions [ edit ] The Polyball , which is the biggest decorated ball in Europe, [ citation needed ] takes places annually in the main building of ETH and is organized by students and former students in the KOSTA foundation. It has been taking place since the 1880s.

The amicable rivalry between ETH Zurich and its neighbor, the University of Zurich, has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual rowing match between teams from the two institutions on the river Limmat .

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH Zurich, most notably the annual Wolfgang Pauli Lectures , in honor of former ETH Zurich Professor Wolfgang Pauli . Distinct lecturers, among them 24 Nobel laureates, have held lectures of the various fields of natural sciences at this conference since 1962.
