Bergeret was Advocate General to the Metz Parliament in 1672, and became the first deputy of Charles Colbert, marquis de Croissy , the Secretary of State and younger brother of Jean Baptiste Colbert , and then the King's Cabinet Secretary .

When Bergeret was presented for election to  the Academy, he had the support of all of the Colbert family, against Gilles Ménage , by then an octogenarian, who though much more senior had previously displeased the Academy with his Requête des Dictionnaires ("Requirements for Dictionaries").

Bergeret was elected on 4 December 1684 to replace Géraud de Cordemoy , who had killed himself in October of that year, and was received on 2 January 1685 by Jean Racine , the same day as Thomas Corneille .

Little is known of him beyond his election and acceptance speech, and that he received into the Academy François-Timoléon de Choisy and François Fénelon . The Abbé d'Olivet remarked "Nobody knows how he got through the doors of the Academy".

[ 1 ] He left no writing nor, it seems, anything memorable to his contemporaries.
