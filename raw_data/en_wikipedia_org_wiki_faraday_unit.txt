Faraday constant Michael Faraday , the constant's namesake Common symbols F SI unit coulomb per mole (C/mol) In SI base units s⋅A⋅mol −1 Derivations from other quantities F = eN A Value 96 485 .332 123 310 0184 C/mol In physical chemistry , the Faraday constant (symbol F , sometimes stylized as ℱ) is a physical constant defined as the quotient of the total electric charge ( q ) by the amount ( n ) of elementary charge carriers in any given sample of matter: F = q / n ; it is expressed in units of coulombs per mole (C/mol). 
As such, it represents the " molar elementary charge ", [ 1 ] that is, the electric charge of one mole of elementary carriers (e.g., protons).  It is named after the English scientist Michael Faraday . Since the 2019 revision of the SI , [ 1 ] the Faraday constant has an exactly defined value, the product of the elementary charge ( e , in coulombs) and the Avogadro constant ( N A , in reciprocal moles): F = e × N A = 9.648 533 212 331 001 84 × 10 4 C/mol .

Derivation [ edit ] The Faraday constant can be thought of as the proportionality factor between the charge in coulombs (used in physics and in practical electrical measurements) and the amount of substance in moles (used in chemistry), and is therefore of particular use in electrochemistry , particularly in electrolysis calculations. Because the elementary charge is exactly 1.602 176 634 × 10 −19 C , [ 1 ] and there are exactly N A = 6.022 140 76 × 10 23 entities per mole, [ 1 ] the Faraday constant is given by the product of these two quantities: F = e × N A = 1.602 176 634 × 10 −19 C × 6.022 140 76 × 10 23 mol −1 = 9.648 533 212 331 001 84 × 10 4 C/mol .

The value of F was first determined in the 1800s by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction, in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday's law of electrolysis .

[ 2 ] Until about 1970, the most reliable value of the Faraday constant was determined by a related method of electro-dissolving silver metal in perchloric acid .

[ 3 ] Other common units [ edit ] 96.485 kJ per volt–gram-equivalent 23.061 kcal per volt–gram-equivalent 26.801 A·h/mol Faraday – a unit of charge [ edit ] Related to the Faraday constant is the "faraday", a unit of electrical charge . Its use is much less common than of the coulomb , but is sometimes used in electrochemistry.

[ 4 ] One faraday of charge is the charge of one mole of elementary charges (or of negative one mole of electrons), that is, 1 faraday = F × 1 mol = 9.648 533 212 331 001 84 × 10 4 C = 6.022 140 76 × 10 23 e .

Conversely, the Faraday constant F equals 1 faraday per mole.

The faraday is not to be confused with the farad , an unrelated unit of capacitance ( 1 farad = 1 coulomb / 1 volt ).
