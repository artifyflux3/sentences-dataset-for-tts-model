( April 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Vesta family (adj.

Vestian ; FIN : 401 ) is a family of asteroids . The cratering family is located in the inner asteroid belt in the vicinity of its namesake and principal body, 4 Vesta . It is one of the largest asteroid families with more than 15,000 known members and consists of mostly bright V-type asteroids , so-called "vestoids".

Characteristics [ edit ] Location and structure of the Vesta family. The graphs plot asteroids by inclination and semi-major axis ( left ) and by inclination and eccentricity ( right ) The Vestian asteroids consist of 4 Vesta , the second-most-massive of all asteroids ( mean diameter of 530 km), and many small asteroids below 10 km diameter. The brightest of these, 1929 Kollaa and 2045 Peking , have an absolute magnitude of 12.2, which would give them a radius of about 7.5 km assuming the same high albedo as 4 Vesta .

The family originated from an impact on asteroid 4 Vesta , with the giant south-polar crater the likely impact site. The family are thought to be the source of the HED meteorites .

The Vesta family also includes a few J-type asteroids (related to the V-type ), which are thought to have come from the deeper layers of Vesta's crust, and are similar to the diogenite meteorites.

A HCM numerical analysis (by Zappala 1995) determined a large group of 'core' family members, whose proper orbital elements lie in the approximate ranges: a p e p i p min 2.26 AU 0.075 5.6° max 2.48 AU 0.122 7.9° This gives the approximate boundaries of the family. At the present epoch , the range of osculating orbital elements of these core members is: a e i min 2.26 AU 0.035 5.0° max 2.48 AU 0.162 8.3° The Zappala 1995 analysis found 235 core members. A search of a recent proper-element database ( AstDys ) for 96,944 minor planets in 2005 yielded 6,051 objects (about 6% of the total) lying within the Vesta-family region as per the first table above.

They are not of the V or J spectral class, but have similar orbital elements by coincidence. These include 306 Unitas , 442 Eichsfeldia , 1697 Koskenniemi , 1781 Van Biesbroeck , 2024 McLaughlin , 2029 Binomi , 2086 Newell , 2346 Lilio , and others.
