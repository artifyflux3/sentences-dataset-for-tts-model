John C. Baez Baez in August 2009 Born John Carlos Baez ( 1961-06-12 ) June 12, 1961 (age 64) San Francisco, California, U.S.

Education Princeton University ( AB ) Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( PhD ) Spouse Lisa Raphals Awards Levi L. Conant Prize (2013) [ 1 ] Scientific career Fields Mathematics , mathematical physics Institutions University of California, Riverside Thesis Conformally Invariant Quantum Fields (1986) Doctoral advisor Irving Segal Doctoral students Alissa Crans John Carlos Baez ( / ˈ b aɪ .

ɛ z / BY -ez ; [ 2 ] born June 12, 1961) is an American mathematical physicist and a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) [ 3 ] in Riverside , California. He has worked on spin foams in loop quantum gravity , applications of higher categories to physics, and applied category theory . Additionally, Baez is known on the World Wide Web as the author of the crackpot index .

Education [ edit ] John C. Baez attended Princeton University where he graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1982; his senior thesis was titled "Recursivity in quantum mechanics", under the supervision of John P. Burgess .

[ 4 ] He earned his doctorate in 1986 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the direction of Irving Segal .

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Baez was a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University . Since 1989, he has been a faculty member at UC Riverside . From 2010 to 2012, he was a visiting professor at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore and continued working there in the summers until at least 2016.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Research [ edit ] His research includes work on spin foams in loop quantum gravity .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] He also worked on applications of higher categories to physics, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] such as the cobordism hypothesis . He has also dedicated many efforts towards applied category theory , including network theory [ 12 ] and has published over 105 papers.

[ 13 ] Recognition [ edit ] Baez won the 2013 Levi L. Conant Prize for his expository paper with John Huerta, "The algebra of grand unified theories".

[ 1 ] He was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society , in the 2022 class of fellows, "for contributions to higher category theory and mathematical physics, and for popularization of these subjects".

[ 14 ] Forums [ edit ] Baez is the author of This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics , [ 15 ] an irregular column on the internet featuring mathematical exposition and criticism. He started This Week's Finds in 1993 for the Usenet community, and it now has a following in its new form, the blog Azimuth .

This Week's Finds anticipated the concept of a personal weblog .

[ 16 ] Baez creates blog posts about topics or questions he wants to understand more through his column publishings.

[ 17 ] Azimuth also covers other topics that include combating climate change and various other environmental issues.

[ 18 ] He is also co-founder of the n -Category Café (or n -Café ), a group blog concerning higher category theory and its applications, as well as its philosophical repercussions. The founders of the blog are Baez, David Corfield and Urs Schreiber , and the list of blog authors has extended since. The n -Café community is associated with the n Lab wiki and n Forum forum, which now run independently of n -Café. It is hosted on The University of Texas at Austin 's official website.

Family [ edit ] Baez's uncle Albert Baez was a physicist and a co-inventor of the X-ray microscope ; Albert interested him in physics as a child.

[ 19 ] Through Albert, he is cousins with singers Joan Baez and Mimi Fariña .

John Baez is married to Lisa Raphals who is a professor of Chinese and comparative literature from ancient Greece at UCR .
