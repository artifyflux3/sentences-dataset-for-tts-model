A **protist** ( [_PROH-tist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) or **protoctist** is any [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote")[organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism") that is not an [animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"), [land plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte"), or [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"). Protists do not form a [natural group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade "Clade"), or clade, but are a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly "Paraphyly") grouping of all descendants of the [last eukaryotic common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor") excluding land plants, animals, and fungi.

Protists were historically regarded as a separate [taxonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank "Taxonomic rank")[kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology) "Kingdom (biology)") known as **Protista** or **Protoctista**. With the advent of [phylogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic "Phylogenetic") analysis and [electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscopy "Electron microscopy") studies, the use of Protista as a formal [taxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon "Taxon") was gradually abandoned. In modern classifications, protists are spread across several eukaryotic clades called [supergroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(biology) "Supergroup (biology)"), such as [Archaeplastida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeplastida "Archaeplastida") ([photoautotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoautotroph "Photoautotroph") that includes land plants), [SAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAR_supergroup "SAR supergroup"), [Obazoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obazoa "Obazoa") (which includes fungi and animals), [Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa") and "[Excavata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavata "Excavata")".

Protists represent an extremely large [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity "Genetic diversity") and [ecological diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_diversity "Ecological diversity") in all environments, including extreme habitats. Their [diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"), larger than for all other eukaryotes, has only been discovered in recent decades through the study of [environmental DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA") and is still in the process of being fully described. They are present in all [ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem") as important components of the [biogeochemical cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle "Biogeochemical cycle") and [trophic webs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_web "Trophic web"). They exist abundantly and ubiquitously in a variety of mostly unicellular forms that evolved multiple times independently, such as free-living [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae"), [amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebae "Amoebae") and [slime moulds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mould "Slime mould"), or as important [parasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite "Parasite"). Together, they compose an amount of biomass that doubles that of animals. They exhibit varied types of nutrition (such as [phototrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototrophy "Phototrophy"), [phagotrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagotrophy "Phagotrophy") or [osmotrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotrophy "Osmotrophy")), sometimes combining them (in [mixotrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixotrophy "Mixotrophy")). They present unique adaptations not present in multicellular animals, fungi or land plants. The study of protists is termed [protistology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protistology "Protistology").

The [tree of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology) "Tree of life (biology)") showing the position of protists, from which all other eukaryotes evolved.

Protists are a diverse group of [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") that are primarily [single-celled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-celled "Single-celled") and microscopic and exhibit a wide variety of shapes and life strategies. They have different [life cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle "Biological life cycle"), [trophic levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level "Trophic level"), [modes of locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist_locomotion "Protist locomotion"), and [cellular structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle "Organelle").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simonite-2005-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Harper-2009-5) Although most protists are [unicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicellular "Unicellular"), there is a considerable range of [multicellularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellularity "Multicellularity") amongst them; some form colonies or [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular "Multicellular") structures visible to the naked eye. The term 'protist' refers to all eukaryotes that are not [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"), land plants or [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi"), the three traditional eukaryotic [kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology) "Kingdom (biology)").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-kingdoms-13)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-O'Malley-2012-14) Because of this definition by exclusion, protists compose a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic "Paraphyletic") group that includes the ancestors of those three kingdoms.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Seb%C3%A9-Pedr%C3%B3s-2017-15)

The names of some protists (called [ambiregnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiregnal "Ambiregnal") protists), because of their mixture of traits similar to both animals and land plants or fungi (e.g., [slime molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_molds "Slime molds") and [flagellated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellate "Flagellate") algae like [euglenids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenid#Classification "Euglenid")), have been published under either or both of the botanical (_[ICNafp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Code\_of\_Nomenclature\_for\_algae,\_fungi,\_and\_plants "International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants")_) and the zoological (_[ICZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Code\_of\_Zoological\_Nomenclature "International Code of Zoological Nomenclature")_) [codes of nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_of_nomenclature "Codes of nomenclature").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Corliss-1995-16)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Barnes-2001-17)

Protists display a wide range of distinct [morphological types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology) "Morphology (biology)") that have been used to classify them for practical purposes, although most of these categories do not represent evolutionary cohesive lineages or [clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade "Clade") and have instead [evolved independently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_independently "Evolved independently") several times. The most recognizable types are:[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)

*   [Amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebae "Amoebae"). Characterized by their irregular, flexible shapes, these protists move by extending portions of their [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm "Cytoplasm"), known as [pseudopodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopodia "Pseudopodia"), to crawl along surfaces.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-De_Bruyn-1947-19) Many groups of amoebae are naked, but [testate amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testate_amoebae "Testate amoebae") and [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") grow a shell around their [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") made from digested material or surrounding debris. Some, known as [radiolarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria") and [heliozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliozoa "Heliozoa"), have special spherical shapes with microtubule-supported pseudopodia radiating from the cell.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Some amoebae are capable of producing stalked multicellular stages that bear spores, often by aggregating together; these are known as [slime molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold "Slime mold").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2012-20) The main clades containing amoebae are [Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa") (including various slime molds and testate amoebae) and [Rhizaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizaria "Rhizaria") (including famous groups such as [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") and radiolarians, as well as a few testate amoebae).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2008-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2009-22) Even some individual amoebae can grow to giant sizes visible to the naked eye.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-23)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-24)
*   [Flagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellates "Flagellates"). These protists are equipped with one or more whip-like appendages called [cilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilia "Cilia"), [undulipodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulipodia "Undulipodia") or [eukaryotic flagella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_flagellum "Eukaryotic flagellum"),[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-cilia-28) which enable them to swim or [glide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_motility "Gliding motility") freely through the environment. Flagellates are found in all lineages, reflecting that the [common ancestor of all living eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor") was a flagellate. They usually exhibit two cilia (e.g., in [Provora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provora "Provora"), [Telonemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telonemia "Telonemia"), [Stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramenopiles "Stramenopiles"), [Alveolata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolata "Alveolata"), [Obazoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obazoa "Obazoa") and most [excavates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavata "Excavata")), but there are a number of flagellate groups with a high number of cilia (such as [Hemimastigophora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemimastigophora "Hemimastigophora") and other excavates).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Some groups, such as the well-known [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate") and the parasitic [opalinids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opalinid "Opalinid"), have a cell surface covered in rows of cilia that beat rhythmically. A few groups of amoebae have retained their flagella, making them [amoeboflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeboflagellates "Amoeboflagellates").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brunet-2021-29)
*   [Algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae"). They are the [photosynthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic "Photosynthetic") protists, and can be found in most of the main clades, completely intermingled with [heterotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrophic "Heterotrophic") protists which are traditionally called _[protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa")_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30) Algae exhibit the most diverse range of morphologies, from single flagellated or coccoid cells (e.g., [cryptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophytes "Cryptophytes"), [haptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte "Haptophyte"), [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellates "Dinoflagellates"), [chromerids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromerid "Chromerid"), many [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), [ochrophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochrophyte "Ochrophyte"), [euglenophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenophyte "Euglenophyte")) to amoeboid cells ([chlorarachniophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorarachniophyte "Chlorarachniophyte")) to colonial and multicellular macroscopic forms (e.g., [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae"), some [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), and some [ochrophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochrophyte "Ochrophyte") such as [kelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp "Kelp")).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-31)
*   Fungus-like protists. Several clades of protists have evolved an appearance similar to [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi") through [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphae "Hyphae")-like structures and a [saprophytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprophytic "Saprophytic") nutrition. They have evolved multiple times, often very distantly from true fungi (e.g., the [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycete "Oomycete"), [labyrinthulomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinthulomycetes "Labyrinthulomycetes") and [hyphochytrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphochytrid "Hyphochytrid"), in Stramenopiles; the [myxomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxomycete "Myxomycete"), in Amoebozoa; the [phytomyxeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytomyxea "Phytomyxea"), in Rhizaria; the [perkinsozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkinsozoa "Perkinsozoa"), in Alveolata).[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-32)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-33)
*   [Sporozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporozoa "Sporozoa"). This category traditionally included [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic "Parasitic") protists that reproduced via spores (the [apicomplexans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa"), [microsporidians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia "Microsporidia"), [myxozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxozoa "Myxozoa") and [ascetosporeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetosporea "Ascetosporea")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levine-1980-6) Its current use is restricted to the apicomplexans,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-1993-34) such as _[Plasmodium falciparum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium\_falciparum "Plasmodium falciparum")_, the cause of [malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-35)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Eukaryotic_diversity_morphological_vs_genetic.png/330px-Eukaryotic_diversity_morphological_vs_genetic.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eukaryotic_diversity_morphological_vs_genetic.png)

Difference between morphological (A) and genetic (B) view of total eukaryotic diversity. Protists dominate [DNA barcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_barcoding "DNA barcoding") analyses, but constitute a minority of catalogued species.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2012-36)

The [species diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_diversity "Species diversity") of protists is severely underestimated by traditional methods that differentiate species based on [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology) "Morphology (biology)") characteristics. The number of described protist [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") is very low (ranging from 26,000[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Mora-2011-37) to over 76,000)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-39) in comparison to the [diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") of land plants, animals and fungi, which are historically and biologically well-known and studied. The predicted number of species also varies greatly, ranging from 140,000 to 1,600,000, and in several groups the number of predicted species is arbitrarily doubled. Most of these predictions are highly subjective. Molecular techniques such as [environmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA")[DNA barcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_barcoding "DNA barcoding") have revealed a vast diversity of undescribed protists that accounts for the majority of eukaryotic sequences or [operational taxonomic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit "Operational taxonomic unit") (OTUs), dwarfing those from land plants, animals and fungi.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2012-36) As such, it is considered that protists dominate eukaryotic diversity.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Burki-2021-40)

Protist phylogeny

One possible topology for the eukaryotic tree of life, with uncertain positions of [ancyromonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancyromonad "Ancyromonad"), [excavates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavata "Excavata"), [provorans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provora "Provora") and [hemimastigotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemimastigote "Hemimastigote").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2018-41)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tikhonenkov-2022a-3)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yazaki-2022-42)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eglit-2024-43) Excavate groups are shown in green. 1 Includes land plants. 2 Includes animals and fungi.

The evolutionary relationships of protists have been explained through [molecular phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics "Molecular phylogenetics"), the [sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing "DNA sequencing") of entire [genomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome "Genome") and [transcriptomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome "Transcriptome"), and [electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscopy "Electron microscopy") studies of the [flagellar apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum "Flagellum") and [cytoskeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton "Cytoskeleton"). New major lineages of protists and novel [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") continue to be discovered, resulting in dramatic changes to the eukaryotic tree of life. The newest classification systems of eukaryotes do not recognize the formal [taxonomic ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank "Taxonomic rank") (kingdom, phylum, class, order...) and instead only recognize [clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clades "Clades") of related organisms, making the classification more stable in the long term and easier to update. In this new [cladistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistic "Cladistic") scheme, the protists are divided into various branches informally named [supergroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(biology) "Supergroup (biology)"). Most photosynthetic eukaryotes fall under the [Diaphoretickes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphoretickes "Diaphoretickes") clade, which contains the supergroups [Archaeplastida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeplastida "Archaeplastida") (which includes land plants) and [SAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAR_supergroup "SAR supergroup") (including, [Stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramenopiles "Stramenopiles"), [Alveolata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolata "Alveolata") and [Rhizaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizaria "Rhizaria")), as well as the phyla [Telonemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telonemia "Telonemia"), [Cryptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptista "Cryptista") and [Haptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptista "Haptista").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-44) The animals and fungi fall into the [Amorphea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphea "Amorphea") supergroup, which contains the phylum [Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa") and several other protist lineages. Various groups of eukaryotes with primitive cell architecture are collectively known as the "Excavata".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)

"[Excavata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excavata "Excavata")" is a group that encompasses diverse protists, mostly flagellates, ranging from aerobic and anaerobic predators to phototrophs and heterotrophs.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Madigan-2019-45): 597  The common name 'excavate' refers to the common characteristic of a ventral groove in the cell used for [suspension feeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_feeding "Suspension feeding"), which is considered to be an ancestral trait present in the [last eukaryotic common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-46) The "Excavata" is composed of three clades: [Discoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoba "Discoba"), [Metamonada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamonada "Metamonada") and [Malawimonadida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawimonadida "Malawimonadida"), each including 'typical excavates' that are free-living phagotrophic flagellates with the characteristic ventral groove.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-47) According to most phylogenetic analyses, this group is [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic "Paraphyletic"),[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eglit-2024-43) with some analyses placing the root of the eukaryote tree within Metamonada.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-48)

Discoba includes three major groups: [Jakobida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobida "Jakobida"), [Euglenozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenozoa "Euglenozoa") and [Percolozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolozoa "Percolozoa").[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Percolozoa-50) Jakobida are a small group (~20 species) of free-living heterotrophic flagellates, with two cilia, that primarily eat bacteria through suspension feeding; most are aquatic aerobes, with some anaerobic species, found in marine, brackish or fresh water.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017b-51) They are best known for their bacterial-like mitochondrial genomes.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Euglenozoa is a rich (>2,000 species)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) group of flagellates with very different lifestyles, including: the free-living heterotrophic (both osmo- and phagotrophic)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Madigan-2019-45) and photosynthetic [euglenids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenid "Euglenid") (e.g., the [euglenophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenophyte "Euglenophyte"), with chloroplasts originated from green algae); the free-living and parasitic [kinetoplastids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoplastid "Kinetoplastid") (such as _[Trypanosoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma "Trypanosoma")_); the deep-sea anaerobic [symbiontids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiontida "Symbiontida"); and the elusive [diplonemids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplonemid "Diplonemid").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Kostygov-2021-53) Percolozoa[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Percolozoa-50) (~150 species) are a collection of amoebae, flagellates and amoeboflagellates with complex life cycles, among which are some slime molds ([acrasids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrasid "Acrasid")).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-P%C3%A1nek-2017-49) The two clades Euglenozoa and Percolozoa are [sister taxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_group "Sister group"), united under the name [Discicristata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discicristata "Discicristata"), in reference to their [mitochondrial cristae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crista "Crista") shaped like discs.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2022-9) The species _[Tsukubamonas globosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukubamonas\_globosa "Tsukubamonas globosa")_ is a free-living flagellate whose precise position within Discoba is not yet settled, but is probably more closely related to Discicristata than to Jakobida.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017b-51)

The [metamonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamonad "Metamonad") (Metamonada) are a phylum of completely [anaerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobe "Anaerobe") or [microaerophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaerophilic "Microaerophilic") protozoa, primarily [flagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellate "Flagellate"). Some are [gut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract") symbionts of animals such as [termites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite "Termite"), others are free-living, and others are parasitic. They include three main clades: [Fornicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornicata "Fornicata"), [Parabasalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabasalia "Parabasalia") and [Preaxostyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preaxostyla "Preaxostyla").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Fornicata (>140 species)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2007-38) encompasses the [diplomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomonad "Diplomonad"), with two [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus "Cell nucleus") (e.g., _[Giardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardia "Giardia")_), and several smaller groups of free-living, commensal and parasitic protists (e.g., _[Carpediemonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpediemonas "Carpediemonas")_, [retortamonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retortamonad "Retortamonad")).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Parabasalia (>460 species)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2007-38) is a varied group of anaerobic, mostly endobiotic organisms, ranging from small parasites (like _[Trichomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomonas "Trichomonas")_) to giant intestinal symbionts with numerous flagella and nuclei found in wood-eating termites and [cockroaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach "Cockroach").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Preaxostyla (~140 species) includes the anaerobic and endobiotic [oxymonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymonad "Oxymonad"), with modified (or completely lost)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-54)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Nov%C3%A1k-2023-55)[mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria "Mitochondria"), and two genera of free-living microaerophilic bacterivorous flagellates _[Trimastix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimastix "Trimastix")_ and _[Paratrimastix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrimastix "Paratrimastix")_, with typical excavate morphology.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Nov%C3%A1k-2023-55)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-56) Two genera of anaerobic flagellates of recent description and unique cell architecture, _[Barthelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barthelona "Barthelona")_ and _[Skoliomonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skoliomonas "Skoliomonas")_, are closely related to the Fornicata.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-57)

The [malawimonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawimonad "Malawimonad") (Malawimonadida) are a small group (three species) of freshwater or marine suspension-feeding bacterivorous flagellates[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Heiss-2020-58) with typical excavate appearance, closely resembling Jakobida and some metamonads but not phylogenetically close to either in most analyses.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)

[Diaphoretickes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphoretickes "Diaphoretickes") includes nearly all photosynthetic eukaryotes. The [SAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAR_supergroup "SAR supergroup") supergroup gathers a colossal diversity of protists. It includes [Stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramenopile "Stramenopile"), [Alveolata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolate "Alveolate") and [Stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizaria "Rhizaria").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tikhonenkov-2022b-59) Another highly diverse clade within Diaphoretickes is [Archaeplastida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeplastida "Archaeplastida"), which houses [land plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte") and a variety of algae. In addition, three smaller groups, [Telonemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telonemia "Telonemia"), [Haptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptista "Haptista") and [Cryptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptista "Cryptista"), also belong to Diaphoretickes.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)[TSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAR_supergroup#Internal_phylogeny "SAR supergroup") is a possible clade that would comprise Telonemia and SAR,[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-60) although Telonemia may branch with Haptista instead of SAR.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-61)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-62) Telonemia shares some cellular similarities with the SAR supergroup.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tikhonenkov-2022b-59)

The stramenopiles, also known as Heterokonta, are characterized by the presence of two cilia, one of which bears many short, straw-like hairs ([mastigonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastigoneme "Mastigoneme")). They include one clade of phototrophs and numerous clades of heterotrophs, present in virtually all habitats. Stramenopiles include two usually well-supported clades, [Bigyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigyra "Bigyra") and [Gyrista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrista "Gyrista"), although the [monophyly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly "Monophyly") of Bigyra is being questioned.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Jirsov%C3%A1-2024-63) Branching outside both Bigyra and Gyrista is a single species of enigmatic heterotrophic flagellates, _[Platysulcus tardus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platysulcus\_tardus "Platysulcus tardus")_.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Jirsov%C3%A1-2024-63) Much of the diversity of heterotrophic stramenopiles is still uncharacterized, known almost entirely from lineages of genetic sequences known as MASTs (MArine STramenopiles),[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Jirsov%C3%A1-2024-63) of which only a few species have been described.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-64)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-65)

The phylum Gyrista includes the photosynthetic [Ochrophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochrophyta "Ochrophyta") or Heterokontophyta (>23,000 species),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) which contain chloroplasts originated from a [red alga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_alga "Red alga"). Among these are many lineages of algae that encompass a wide range of structures and morphologies. The three most diverse ochrophyte classes are: the [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom"), unicellular or colonial organisms encased in silica cell walls ([frustules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustule "Frustule")) that exhibit widely different shapes and ornamentations and comprise much of the [marine phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_phytoplankton "Marine phytoplankton");[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Mann-2017-66) the [brown algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae"), filamentous or 'truly' multicellular (with differentiated tissues) macroalgae that constitute the basis of many temperate and cold marine ecosystems, such as [kelp forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_forest "Kelp forest");[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Kawai-2017-67) and the [golden algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_algae "Golden algae"), unicellular or colonial flagellates that are mostly present in freshwater habitats.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Kristiansen-2017-68) Inside Gyrista, the sister clade to Ochrophyta are the predominantly [osmotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotroph "Osmotroph") and filamentous [pseudofungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudofungi "Pseudofungi") (>1,200 species),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Thines-2018-69) which include three distinct lineages: the parasitic [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycetes "Oomycetes") or water moulds (e.g., _[Phytophthora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora "Phytophthora")_), which encompass most of the pseudofungi species; the less diverse non-parasitic [hyphochytrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphochytrid "Hyphochytrid") that maintain a fungus-like lifestyle; and the [bigyromonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigyromonad "Bigyromonad"), a group of bacterivorous or eukaryovorous phagotrophs.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Jirsov%C3%A1-2024-63) A small group of heliozoan-like heterotrophic amoebae, [Actinophryida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinophryida "Actinophryida"), has an uncertain position, either within or as the sister taxon of Ochrophyta.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Azuma-2022-70)

The little studied phylum Bigyra is an assemblage of exclusively heterotrophic organisms, most of which are free-living. It includes the [labyrinthulomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinthulomycetes "Labyrinthulomycetes"), among which are single-celled amoeboid phagotrophs, mixotrophs, and fungus-like filamentous heterotrophs that create slime networks to move and absorb nutrients, as well as some parasites and a few testate amoebae ([Amphitremida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitremida "Amphitremida")). Also included in Bigyra are the [bicosoecids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicosoecid "Bicosoecid"), phagotrophic flagellates that consume bacteria, and the closely related [Placidozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placidozoa "Placidozoa"), which consists of several groups of heterotrophic flagellates (e.g., the deep-sea halophilic [Placididea](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Placididea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Placididea (page does not exist)")) as well as the intestinal [commensals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensal "Commensal") known as [Opalinata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opalinata "Opalinata") (e.g., the human parasite _[Blastocystis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocystis "Blastocystis")_, and the highly unusual [opalinids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opalinid "Opalinid"), composed of giant cells with numerous nuclei and cilia, originally misclassified as ciliates).[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Jirsov%C3%A1-2024-63)

The [alveolates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolate "Alveolate") (Alveolata) are characterized by the presence of [cortical alveoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_alveoli "Cortical alveoli"), cytoplasmic sacs underlying the [cell membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane") of unknown physiological function.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Madigan-2019-45): 599  Among them are three of the most well-known groups of protists: apicomplexans, dinoflagellates and ciliates. The ciliates ([Ciliophora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliophora "Ciliophora")) are a highly diverse (>8,000 species) and probably the most thoroughly studied[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) group of protists. They are mostly free-living microbes characterized by large cells covered in rows of cilia and containing two kinds of nuclei, micronucleus and macronucleus. Free-living ciliates are usually the top heterotrophs and predators in microbial food webs, feeding on bacteria and smaller eukaryotes, present in a variety of ecosystems, although a few species are [kleptoplastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoplastic "Kleptoplastic"). Others are parasitic of numerous animals.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lynn-2017-71) Ciliates have a basal position in the evolution of alveolates, together with a few species of heterotrophic flagellates with two cilia collectively known as [colponemids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colponemid "Colponemid").[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Janou%C5%A1kovec-2013-72)

The remaining alveolates are grouped under the clade [Myzozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myzozoa "Myzozoa"), whose common ancestor acquired chloroplasts through a secondary endosymbiosis from a red alga.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Janou%C5%A1kovec-2015-73) One branch of Myzozoa contains the apicomplexans and their closest relatives, a small clade of flagellates known as [Chrompodellida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrompodellida "Chrompodellida") where phototrophic and heterotrophic flagellates, called [chromerids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromerid "Chromerid") and [colpodellids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colpodellid "Colpodellid") respectively, are evolutionarily intermingled.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Janou%C5%A1kovec-2015-73) In contrast, the apicomplexans ([Apicomplexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa")) are a large (>6,000 species) and highly specialized group of obligate parasites who have all secondarily lost their photosynthetic ability (e.g., _[Plasmodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium "Plasmodium")_). Their adult stages absorb nutrients from the host through the cell membrane, and they reproduce between hosts via sporozoites, which exhibit an [organelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle "Organelle") complex (the [apicoplast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicoplast "Apicoplast")) evolved from non-photosynthetic chloroplasts.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Vot%C3%BDpka-2017-74)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Madigan-2019-45): 600

The other branch of Myzozoa contains the dinoflagellates and their closest relatives, the perkinsids ([Perkinsozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkinsozoa "Perkinsozoa")), a small group (26 species) of aquatic intracellular parasites which have lost their photosynthetic ability similarly to apicomplexans.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Janou%C5%A1kovec-2015-73) They reproduce through flagellated spores that infect dinoflagellates, [molluscs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusc "Mollusc") and [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish").[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-75) In contrast, the dinoflagellates ([Dinoflagellata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellata "Dinoflagellata")) are a highly diversified (~4,500 species)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Saldarriaga-2017-76) group of aquatic algae that have mostly retained their chloroplasts, although many lineages have lost their own and instead either live as heterotrophs or reacquire new chloroplasts from other sources, including tertiary endosymbiosis and [kleptoplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoplasty "Kleptoplasty").[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-77) Most dinoflagellates are free-living and compose an important portion of phytoplankton, as well as a major cause of [harmful algal blooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_algal_bloom "Harmful algal bloom") due to their toxicity; some live as symbionts of corals, allowing the creation of coral reefs. Dinoflagellates exhibit a diversity of cellular structures, such as complex eyelike ocelli, specialized vacuoles, bioluminescent organelles, and a wall surrounding the cell known as the [theca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theca "Theca").[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Saldarriaga-2017-76)

[Rhizaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizaria "Rhizaria") is a lineage of morphologically diverse organisms, composed almost entirely of unicellular heterotrophic amoebae, flagellates and amoeboflagellates,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) commonly with reticulose (net-like) or filose (thread-like) [pseudopodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopodia "Pseudopodia") for feeding and locomotion.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2018-79)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Madigan-2019-45): 604  It was the last supergroup to be described, because it lacks any [defining characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy "Synapomorphy") and was discovered exclusively through [molecular phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics "Molecular phylogenetics").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Burki-2014-80) Three major clades are included, namely the phyla [Cercozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cercozoa "Cercozoa"), [Endomyxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomyxa "Endomyxa") and [Retaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retaria "Retaria").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)

Retaria contains the most familiar rhizarians: [forams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foram "Foram") and [radiolarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria"), two groups of large free-living marine amoebae with pseudopodia supported by [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule "Microtubule"), many of which are macroscopic.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) The radiolarians (Radiolaria) are a diverse group (>1,000 living species) of amoebae, often bearing delicate and intricate siliceous skeletons.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Biard-2022-81) The forams (Foraminifera) are also diverse (>6,700 living species),[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2014-82) and most of them are encased in multichambered tests constructed from calcium carbonate or agglutinated mineral particles.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Both groups have a rich fossil record, with tens of thousands of described fossil species.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2014-82)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Boltovskoy-2017-83)

Cercozoa (also known as [Filosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filosa "Filosa")) is an assemblage of free-living protists with very different morphologies. Cercozoan amoeboflagellates are important predators of other microbes in terrestrial habitats and the plant microbiota (e.g., [cercomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cercomonad "Cercomonad") and [paracercomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracercomonad "Paracercomonad") and [glissomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glissomonad "Glissomonad"), collectively known as class [SARcomonadea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomonadea "Sarcomonadea")),[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Dumack-2017-84) and a few can generate slime molds (e.g., [Helkesea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helkesea "Helkesea")).[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-85) Many cercozoans are testate or scale-bearing amoebae, namely the elusive _[Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken\_(genus) "Kraken (genus)")_ and the two classes [Imbricatea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbricatea "Imbricatea") (e.g., the [euglyphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglyphid "Euglyphid")) and [Thecofilosea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thecofilosea "Thecofilosea").[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Dumack-2017-84) Thecofilosea also contains the [Phaeodaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeodaria "Phaeodaria") (~400–500 species), a group of skeleton-bearing marine amoebae previously classified as radiolarians,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Boltovskoy-2017-83) and both classes include some non-scaly naked flagellates (e.g., [spongomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spongomonad "Spongomonad") in Imbricatea and [thaumatomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaumatomonad "Thaumatomonad") in Thecofilosea).[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Howe-2011-86) Among the basal-branching cercozoans are the pseudopodia-lacking thecate flagellates of [Metromonadea](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metromonadea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Metromonadea (page does not exist)"), the heliozoan-like [Granofilosea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granofilosea "Granofilosea")[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Howe-2011-86) and the photosynthetic [chlorarachniophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorarachniophyte "Chlorarachniophyte"), whose chloroplasts originated from a secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18)

Endomyxa contains two major clades of parasitic protists: [Ascetosporea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetosporea "Ascetosporea") are sporozoan-type parasites of marine invertebrates,[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-87) while [Phytomyxea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytomyxea "Phytomyxea") are obligate pathogens of plants and algae, divided into the terrestrial [plasmodiophorids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodiophorid "Plasmodiophorid") and the marine [phagomyxids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagomyxid "Phagomyxid").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-88) Also included in Endomyxa are the order of predatory amoebae [Vampyrellida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampyrellida "Vampyrellida") (48 species)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hess-2022-89) and two genera of marine amoebae, the thecate _[Gromia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromia "Gromia")_ and the naked _[Filoreta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoreta "Filoreta")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)

Besides these three phyla, Rhizaria includes numerous enigmatic and understudied lineages of uncertain evolutionary position. One such clade is the [Gymnosphaerida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosphaerida "Gymnosphaerida"), which includes heliozoan-type protists.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gast-2017-90) Several clades labeled as Novel Clades (NC) are entirely composed of [environmental DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA") from uncultured protists, although a few have slowly been resolved over the decades with the description of new taxa (e.g., [Tremulida](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tremulida&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tremulida (page does not exist)") and [Aquavolonida](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aquavolonida&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aquavolonida (page does not exist)"), formerly NC11 and NC10 respectively, with a deep-branching position in Rhizaria).[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Bass-2018-91)

#### Haptista and Cryptista

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Haptista and Cryptista")]

[Haptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptista "Haptista") and [Cryptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptista "Cryptista") are two similar phyla of single-celled protists previously thought to be closely related, and collectively known as [Hacrobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacrobia "Hacrobia").[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2015-92) However, the monophyly of Hacrobia was disproven, as the two groups originated independently.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-93) Molecular analyses place Cryptista next to Archaeplastida, forming the hypothesized [CAM clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAM_clade "CAM clade"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yazaki-2022-42) and Haptista next to the Telonemia and the SAR clade[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eglit-2024-43) (Telonemia may either be the sister group to SAR, forming the hypothesized TSAR clade,[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Burki-2020-94) or to Haptista, forming a common sister clade to SAR[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Torruella-2025-95)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yazaki-2022-42)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Williamson-2025-96)). Within the CAM clade, the closest relative of Cryptista is the species _[Microheliella maris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microheliella\_maris "Microheliella maris")_, together composing the clade [Pancryptista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancryptista "Pancryptista").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yazaki-2022-42)

The phylum Haptista includes two distinct clades with mineralized scales: [haptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte "Haptophyte") and [centrohelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrohelid "Centrohelid").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) The haptophytes (Haptophyta) are a group of over 500 living species[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) of flagellated or coccoid algae that have acquired chloroplasts from a secondary endosymbiosis. They are mostly marine, comprise an important portion of oceanic plankton, and include the [coccolithophores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophore "Coccolithophore"), whose calcified scales ('[coccoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolith "Coccolith")') contribute to the formation of sedimentary rocks and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and calcium. Some species are capable of forming toxic blooms.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eikrem-2017-97) The centrohelids (Centroplasthelida) are a small (~95 species)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2007-98) but widespread group of heterotrophic heliozoan-type amoebae, usually covered in scale-bearing mucous, that form an important component of benthic food webs of aquatic habitats, both marine and freshwater.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Zagumyonnyi-2022-99)

The phylum Cryptista is a clade of three distinct groups of unicellular protists: [cryptomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomonad "Cryptomonad"), [katablepharids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katablepharid "Katablepharid"), and the species _[Palpitomonas bilix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitomonas\_bilix "Palpitomonas bilix")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) The cryptomonads (>100 species), also known as cryptophytes, are flagellated algae found in aquatic habitats of diverse salinity, characterized by extrusive organelles or [extrusomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusome "Extrusome") called ejectisomes. Their chloroplasts, of red algal origin, contain a [nucleomorph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleomorph "Nucleomorph"), a remnant of the eukaryotic nucleus belonging to the endosymbiotic red alga.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hoef-Emden-2017-100) The katablepharids, the closest relatives of cryptomonads, are heterotrophic flagellates with two cilia, also characterized by ejectisomes.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2015-92)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) The species _Palpitomonas bilix_ is the most basal-branching member of Cryptista, a marine heterotrophic flagellate with two cilia, but unlike the remaining members it lacks ejectisomes.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-101)

Archaeplastida is the clade containing those photosynthetic groups whose [plastids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastid "Plastid") were likely obtained through a single event of primary [endosymbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiosis "Endosymbiosis") with a [cyanobacterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacterium "Cyanobacterium"). It contains [land plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte") (Embryophyta) and a big portion of the diversity of algae, most of which are the [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), from which plants evolved, and the [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae").[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-De_Clerck-2012-102) A third lineage of algae, the [glaucophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucophyte "Glaucophyte") (25 species),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) contains rare and obscure species found in surfaces of freshwater and terrestrial habitats.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-De_Clerck-2012-102)

The red algae or Rhodophyta (>7,100 species) are a group of diverse morphologies, ranging from single cells to [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular "Multicellular") filaments to giant [pseudoparenchymatous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoparenchyma "Pseudoparenchyma")[thalli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalli "Thalli"), all without flagella. They lack [chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll "Chlorophyll") and only harvest light energy through [phycobiliproteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycobiliprotein "Phycobiliprotein"). Their life cycles are varied and may include two or three generations. They are present in terrestrial, freshwater and primarily marine habitats, from the intertidal zone to deep waters; some are calcified and are vital components of marine ecosystems such as [coral reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef").[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yoon-2017-103) Closely related to the red algae are two small lineages of non-photosynthetic predatory flagellates: the freshwater and marine [Rhodelphidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodelphidia "Rhodelphidia") (3 species),[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Prokina-2023-104) which still retain genetic evidence of relic plastids;[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gawryluk-2019-105) and the marine [Picozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picozoa "Picozoa") (1 species), which lack any remains of plastids. The evolutionary position of Picozoa may indicate that there have been two separate events of primary endosymbiosis, as opposed to one.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Sch%C3%B6n-2021-106)

The green algae, unlike the [monophyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly "Monophyly") glaucophytes and rhodophytes, are a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly "Paraphyly") group from which land plants evolved. Together they compose the [Chloroplastida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplastida "Chloroplastida") or Viridiplantae clade.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) The earliest branching member is the phylum [Prasinodermophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinodermophyta "Prasinodermophyta") (ten species), whose members are exclusively marine coccoid cells or small macroscopic thalli.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Prasinodermophyta-107) The remaining green algae are distributed in two major clades. One clade is the phylum [Chlorophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyta "Chlorophyta") (>7,900 species),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) which includes numerous lineages of scaly unicellular flagellate algae known collectively as [prasinophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinophyte "Prasinophyte") along with the Prasinodermophyta, but also includes a variety of morphologies such as coccoids, palmelloids, colonies, and macroscopic filamentous, foliose or tubular thalli, present in aquatic and terrestrial habitats.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) The opposed clade is [Streptophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptophyta "Streptophyta"), which contains the land plants and a paraphyletic group of green algae collectively known as phylum [Charophyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charophyta "Charophyta"), composed of several classes: [Zygnematophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygnematophyceae "Zygnematophyceae") (>4,300 species),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) containing unicellular, colonial and filamentous flagella-lacking organisms found almost exclusively in freshwater habitats;[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hall-2017-108)[Charophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charophyceae "Charophyceae") (450 living species),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52) also known as stoneworts, consisting of complex multicellular thalli only found in freshwater habitats;[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-McCourt-2017-109)[Klebsormidiophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsormidiophyceae "Klebsormidiophyceae") (52 species), with unbranched filamentous thalli; [Coleochaetophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleochaetophyceae "Coleochaetophyceae") (36 species), containing branched filamentous thalli; [Mesostigmatophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesostigmatophyceae "Mesostigmatophyceae"), composed of a single species of scaly flagellates; and [Chlorokybophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorokybophyceae "Chlorokybophyceae") (five species), with sarcinoid forms.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cook-2017-110)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Guiry-2024-52)

[Amorphea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphea "Amorphea") is a group of exclusively heterotrophic organisms. It contains the fungi and animals, as well as most slime moulds, many amoebae and some flagellates.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Heiss-2018-111) Many of its protist members exhibit complex life cycles with different levels of multicellularity.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lam%C5%BCa-2023-112) Amorphea is roughly equivalent to the concept of 'unikonts', meaning 'single cilium', although it currently contains several organisms with more cilia.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2013-113) It is defined as the smallest clade containing the groups [Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa") (containing mostly slime moulds and amoebae) and [Opisthokonta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthokonta "Opisthokonta") (containing fungi, animals, and their closest relatives).[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Heiss-2018-111)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) The closest relatives of Opisthokonta are two small lineages of single-celled protists with two cilia: the flagellate [Apusomonadida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apusomonadida "Apusomonadida") (28 species)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Torruella-2022-114) and the amoeboflagellate anaerobic [Breviatea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breviatea "Breviatea") (four species).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Together with opisthokonts, these two groups form the clade [Obazoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obazoa "Obazoa"), the sister clade to Amoebozoa.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2013-113)

The phylum [Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa") (2,400 species)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2012-36) is a large group of morphologically diverse phagotrophic protists, mostly amoebae. A considerable portion of amoebozoans are [lobose amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobosa "Lobosa"), meaning they produce round, blunt-ended pseudopods.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Smirnov-2005-115) It includes the 'archetypal' amoebae, known as the naked lobose amoebae or 'gymnamoebae'[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Page-1987-116) (such as _[Amoeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba\_(genus) "Amoeba (genus)")_ itself),[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tekle-2022-117) among which is a genus of sorocarp-forming slime moulds, _[Copromyxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copromyxa "Copromyxa")_.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2010a-118) Some gymnamoebae are important pathogens to animals (e.g., _[Acanthamoeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthamoeba "Acanthamoeba")_).[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-119) Other relevant lobose amoebae are the [Arcellinida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcellinida "Arcellinida"), a diverse order of testate amoebae and one of the most conspicuous protist groups overall.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gonz%C3%A1lez-Migu%C3%A9ns-2022-120) The remaining, non-lobose amoebozoans include the [Eumycetozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumycetozoa "Eumycetozoa") or 'true slime moulds', comprising the sorocarp-producing bacterivorous [dictyostelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelid "Dictyostelid") and the sporocarp-producing omnivorous [myxogastrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxogastrid "Myxogastrid") and [protosporangiids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protosporangiida "Protosporangiida").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) Due to the fungus-like appearance of their fruiting bodies, eumycetozoans are often studied by mycologists.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) Closely related to the eumycetozoans are two lineages: the [Variosea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variosea "Variosea"), a heterogeneous assortment of amoeboid, reticulate or flagellated organisms[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tekle-2022-117) (including some sorocarp-producing organisms);[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Berney-2015-121) and the anaerobic [Archamoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archamoebae "Archamoebae"), some of which live as intestinal symbionts of some animals (e.g., _[Entamoeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba "Entamoeba")_).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)

Opisthokonta includes the animal and fungal kingdoms,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-kingdoms-13) as well as their closest protist relatives. The branch leading to the fungi is known as [Nucletmycea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucletmycea "Nucletmycea") or Holomycota, while the branch leading to the animals is called [Holozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holozoa "Holozoa").[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Galindo-2021-122) The Holomycota includes the closest relatives of fungi, the [nucleariids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleariid "Nucleariid"), a small group (~50 species) of free-living naked or scale-bearing phagotrophic amoebae with filose pseudopodia, some of which can aggregate into slime moulds.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gabald%C3%B3n-2022-123) Within the wider definition of fungi, three groups are studied as protists by some authors: [Aphelida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelida "Aphelida") (15 species),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wijayawardene-2022-12)[Rozellida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozellida "Rozellida") (27 species)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lechter-2018-124) and [Microsporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia "Microsporidia") (~1,300 species),[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cali-2017-125) collectively known as [Opisthosporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthosporidia "Opisthosporidia"), as opposed to the 'true' or osmotrophic fungi. Both aphelids and rozellids are single-celled phagotrophic flagellates that feed in an endobiotic manner, penetrating the cells of their respective hosts. Microsporidians are obligate intracellular parasites that feed through osmotrophy, much like true fungi. Aphelids and true fungi are closest relatives, and generally feed on cellulose-walled organisms (many algae and plants). Conversely, rozellids and microsporidians form a separate clade, and generally feed on chitin-walled organisms (fungi and animals).[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Galindo-2022-126)

The Holozoa includes various lineages with complex life cycles involving different cell types and associated with the origin of animal multicellularity.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Simpson-2017a-18) The closest relatives to animals are the [choanoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate "Choanoflagellate") (~360 species), free-living flagellates that feed through a collar of microvilli surrounding a larger cilium and often form colonies.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Richter-2017-127) The [Ichthyosporea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosporea "Ichthyosporea") (>40 species), otherwise known as mesomycetozoans, are a group of fungus-like pathogenic holozoans specialized in infecting fish and other animals.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Glockling-2013-128) The [Filasterea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filasterea "Filasterea") (six species) are a heterogeneous group of free-living, endosymbiotic, or parasitic amoebae or flagellates.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-129) Lastly, the [Pluriformea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluriformea "Pluriformea") are two species of free-living holozoans with life cycles that include multicellular aggregates.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hehenberger-2017-130) An elusive flagellate species _[Tunicaraptor unikontum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunicaraptor\_unikontum "Tunicaraptor unikontum")_ has an uncertain evolutionary position among these holozoan groups.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tikhonenkov-2020-131)

Several smaller lineages do not belong to any of the three main supergroups, and instead have a deep-branching "kingdom-level" position in eukaryote evolution. They are usually poorly known groups with limited data and few species, often referred to as "orphan groups".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eglit-2024-43) The [CRuMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRuMs "CRuMs") clade, containing the free-swimming [Collodictyonidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodictyonidae "Collodictyonidae") (seven species) with two to four cilia, the amoeboid [Rigifilida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigifilida "Rigifilida") (two species) with filose pseudopodia, and the gliding [Mantamonadidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantamonadidae "Mantamonadidae") (three species)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Blaz-2021-132) and [Glissandridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glissandridae "Glissandridae") (two species)[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yazaki-2025-133)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Patterson_1996-134) with two cilia, are the sister clade of Amorphea.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2018-41) The [Ancyromonadida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancyromonadida "Ancyromonadida") (35 species)[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Yubuki_2023-135) are aquatic gliding flagellates with two cilia, positioned near Amorphea and CRuMs.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2018-41) The [Hemimastigophora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemimastigophora "Hemimastigophora") (ten species), or hemimastigotes, are predatory flagellates with a distinctive cell morphology and two rows of around a dozen flagella.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lax-2018-136) The [Provora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provora "Provora") (eight species)[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Belyaev-2024-137) are predatory flagellates with an unremarkable morphology similar to that of excavates and other flagellates with two cilia. Both Hemimastigophora and Provora were thought to be related to or within Diaphoretickes,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tikhonenkov-2022a-3) although further analyses have placed them in a separate clade along with a mysterious species of predatory protists, _[Meteora sporadica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora\_sporadica "Meteora sporadica")_. This species has a remarkable morphology: they lack flagella, are bilaterally symmetrical, project a pair of lateral "arms" that swing back and forth, and contain a system of motility unlike any other.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Eglit-2024-43)

There are also many [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera "Genera") of uncertain affiliation among eukaryotes because their DNA has not been [sequenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing "DNA sequencing"), and consequently their phylogenetic affinities are unknown.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) One enigmatic heliozoan species is so large that it does not match the description of any known genus, and was consequently transferred to a separate genus _[Berkeleyaesol](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berkeleyaesol&action=edit&redlink=1 "Berkeleyaesol (page does not exist)")_ with an unclear position, although it probably belongs to Diaphoretickes along with all other heliozoa.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Shishkin-2021-138) The organism _[Parakaryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parakaryon "Parakaryon")_ is harder to place, as it shares traits from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-yamaguchi-139)

In general, protists have typical [eukaryotic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_cell "Eukaryotic cell") that follow the same principles of [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") described for those cells within the "higher" eukaryotes (animals, fungi and land plants).[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-140) However, many have evolved a variety of unique physiological adaptations that do not appear in the remaining eukaryotes,[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levandowsky-2012-141) and in fact protists encompass almost all of the broad spectrum of [biological characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_trait "Biological trait") expected in eukaryotes.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Burki-2021-40)

Protists display a wide variety of food preferences and feeding mechanisms.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142) According to the source of their nutrients, they can be divided into _[autotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph "Autotroph")_ (producers, traditionally [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae")) and _[heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph "Heterotroph")_ (consumers, traditionally [protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa")). Autotrophic protists [synthesize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis "Biosynthesis") their own organic compounds from inorganic substrates through the process of [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis"), using light as the source of energy;[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hickman-2017-143): 217  accordingly, they are also known as _[phototrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph "Phototroph")_.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lwoff-1946-144)

Heterotrophic protists obtain organic molecules synthesized by other organisms, and can be further divided according to the size of their nutrients. Those that feed on soluble molecules[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hickman-2017-143): 218  or macromolecules under 0.5 μm in size are called _[osmotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotroph "Osmotroph")_,[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142) and they absorb them by [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion "Diffusion"), ciliary pits, [transport proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_protein "Transport protein") of the cell membrane, and a type of [endocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis "Endocytosis") (i.e., invagination of the cell membrane into [vacuoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole "Vacuole"), called [endosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosome "Endosome")) known as [pinocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocytosis "Pinocytosis")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) or fluid-phase endocytosis.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142) Those that feed on organic particles over 0.5 μm in size or entire cells are called _[phagotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagotroph "Phagotroph")_, and they ingest them through a type of endocytosis known as [phagocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis "Phagocytosis").[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hickman-2017-143): 218  Endocytosis is considered one of the most important [adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_adaptation "Evolutionary adaptation") in the origin of eukaryotes because it increased the potential food supply, and phagocytosis allowed the [endosymbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiosis "Endosymbiosis") and development of [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria "Mitochondria") and [chloroplasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast "Chloroplast"). In both osmotrophs and phagotrophs, endocytosis is often restricted to a specific region of the cell membrane, known as the [cytostome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytostome "Cytostome"), which may be followed by a cytopharynx, a specialized tract supported by [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule "Microtubule").[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142)

Osmotrophic protists acquire soluble nutrients through [membrane channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_channel "Membrane channel") and [carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_carrier "Membrane carrier"), but also through different types of pinocytosis. Macropinocytosis involves the folding of membrane into ruffles,[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-145) which creates large (0.2 to 1.0 μm) vacuoles. Micropinocytosis involves smaller vesicles that are usually formed by [clathrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin "Clathrin"). In both scenarios, the vesicles merge into a digestive vacuole or [endosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosome "Endosome") where digestion takes place.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142) Some osmotrophs, called _[saprotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotroph "Saprotroph")_ or _lysotrophs_, perform external digestion by releasing enzymes into the environment and decomposing organic matter[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) into simpler molecules that can be absorbed. This external digestion has a distinct advantage: it allows greater control over the substances that are allowed to enter the cell, thus minimizing the intake of harmful substances or infection.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Richards-2013-146)

Probably all eukaryotes are capable of osmotrophy, but some have no alternative of acquiring nutrients. Obligate osmotrophs and saprotrophs include some [euglenids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenid "Euglenid"), some [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), the human parasite _[Blastocystis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocystis "Blastocystis")_, some [metamonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamonad "Metamonad"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) the parasitic [trypanosomatids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomatid "Trypanosomatid"),[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-147) and the fungus-like [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycetes "Oomycetes") and [hyphochytrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphochytrid "Hyphochytrid").[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Richards-2013-146)

Structure of the cytostome-cytopharynx complex in _[Trypanosoma cruzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma\_cruzi "Trypanosoma cruzi")_. The food travels the pre-oral ridge from the flagellar pocket until it reaches the cytostome and enters the cell through the cytopharynx, where nutrients are presumably transported by [myosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin "Myosin") proteins until they are enclosed in vesicles. The cytopharynx is supported by specific sets of microtubules.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-148)

[![Image 40](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/A_sol_mit_Paramecium.jpg/250px-A_sol_mit_Paramecium.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_sol_mit_Paramecium.jpg)

The heliozoan _[Actinophrys sol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinophrys "Actinophrys")_ phagocyting a _[Paramecium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium "Paramecium")_ ciliate

Phagotrophic feeding consists of two phases: the concentration of food particles in the environment, and the phagocytosis, which encloses the food particle in a vacuole (the [phagosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagosome "Phagosome"))[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wiser-2024-142) where digestion takes place. In [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate") and most phagotrophic [flagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellate "Flagellate"), digestion occurs at the oral region or cytostome, which is covered by a single membrane from which vacuoles are formed; the phagosomes then may be shuttled to the interior of the cell along the cytopharynx.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149) In amoebae, phagocytosis takes place anywhere on the cell surface. The average food particle size is around one tenth the size of the protist cell.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Esteban-2020-150)

Phagotrophic protists can be further classified according to how they approach the nutrients. The _filter feeders_ acquire small, suspended food particles or prokaryotic cells and accumulate them by filtration into the cytostome (e.g., [choanoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate "Choanoflagellate"), some [chrysomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysomonad "Chrysomonad"), most ciliates);[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) filter-feeding flagellates accumulate particles by propelling them with a flagellum through a collar of rigid tentacles or pseudopodia that act as a filter, while filter-feeding ciliates generate water currents through cilia and membranelle zones surrounding the cytostome. The _raptorial feeders_ (e.g., [bicosoecids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicosoecid "Bicosoecid"), chrysomonads, [kinetoplastids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoplastid "Kinetoplastid"), some euglenids, many [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate "Dinoflagellate") and ciliates), instead of retaining all particles in bulk, capture each particle individually.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Esteban-2020-150) Among raptorial protists, the _grazers_ search and ingest prey from surfaces covered with potential food items such as [bacterial lawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_lawn "Bacterial lawn"), while the _[predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation "Predation")_ actively pursue scarce prey.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) Predators that feed on filamentous algae or fungal [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphae "Hyphae") either swallow the filaments entirely or penetrate the cell wall and ingest the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm "Cytoplasm") (e.g., [Viridiraptoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viridiraptoridae "Viridiraptoridae")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2) Predators may have adaptations to hunt prey, such as 'toxicysts' that immobilize prey cells. Certain ciliates have developed a specialized kind of raptorial feeding called _histophagy_, where they attack damaged but live animals (e.g., annelids and small crustaceans), enter the wounds, and ingest animal tissue. Large raptorial amoebae enclose their prey in a "food cup" of pseudopodia, prior to the formation of the food vacuole.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Esteban-2020-150) Lastly, _diffusion feeders_ (e.g., [heliozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliozoa "Heliozoa"), [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") and many other amoebae, [suctorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suctoria "Suctoria") ciliates) engulf prey that happen to collide with their pseudopods or, in the case of ciliates, tentacles that carry toxicysts or extrusomes to immobilize the prey.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Esteban-2020-150)

Consumers of prokaryotes are popularly called _[bacterivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterivore "Bacterivore")_ (e.g., most amoebae), while consumers (including osmotrophic parasites) of eukaryotes are known as _eukaryovores_. In particular, eukaryovores that feed on unicellular protists are _cytotrophs_ (e.g., [colponemids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colponemid "Colponemid"), [colpodellids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colpodellid "Colpodellid"), many amoebae, some ciliates); those that feed on fungi are _mycophages_ or _mycotrophs_ (e.g., the ciliate family [Grossglockneriidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grossglockneriidae&action=edit&redlink=1 "Grossglockneriidae (page does not exist)") of obligate mycophages);[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2016-151) those that prey on [nematodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode "Nematode") are _nematophages_;[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2015-152) and those that feed on algae are _phycotrophs_ (e.g., [vampyrellids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampyrellid "Vampyrellid")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)

_[Rapaza viridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapaza\_viridis "Rapaza viridis")_ is a species of obligate specialist mixotrophs: it survives through the predation of _[Tetraselmis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraselmis "Tetraselmis")_ algae and acquisition of their chloroplasts. It rejects any other prey cells. Even when well fed, it cannot survive without a light source, as it needs to photosynthesize with those chloroplasts.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Karnkowska-2023-153)

Most autotrophic protists are _[mixotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixotroph "Mixotroph")_[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Sanders-2011-154) and combine photosynthesis with phagocytosis.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-156) They are classified into various functional groups or 'mixotypes'.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Mitra-2016-157)[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Faure-2019-158)_Constitutive_ mixotrophs have the innate ability to [photosynthesize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesize "Photosynthesize") through already present chloroplasts, and have diverse feeding behaviors, as some require phototrophy, others phagotrophy, and others are obligate mixotrophs (e.g., nanoflagellates such as some [haptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte "Haptophyte") and dinoflagellates). _Non-constitutive_ mixotrophs acquire the ability to photosynthesize by stealing chloroplasts from their prey, a process known as [kleptoplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptoplasty "Kleptoplasty"). Non-constitutives can be divided into two: _generalists_, which can steal chloroplasts from a variety of prey (e.g., [oligotrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligotrich "Oligotrich") ciliates), or _specialists_, which can only acquire chloroplasts from a few specific prey (e.g., _[Rapaza viridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapaza\_viridis "Rapaza viridis")_ can only steal from _[Tetraselmis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraselmis "Tetraselmis")_ cells).[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Karnkowska-2023-153) The specialists are further divided into two types: _plastidic_, which contain differentiated [plastids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastid "Plastid") (e.g., _[Mesodinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesodinium "Mesodinium")_, _[Dinophysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinophysis "Dinophysis")_), and _endosymbiotic_, which contain whole [endosymbionts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont "Endosymbiont") (e.g., mixotrophic [Rhizaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizaria "Rhizaria") such as [Foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") and [Radiolaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria"), dinoflagellates like _[Noctiluca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca "Noctiluca")_).[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Mitra-2016-157)

Among exclusively heterotrophic protists, variation of nutritional modes is also observed. The [diplonemids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplonemid "Diplonemid"), which inhabit deep waters where photosynthesis is absent, can flexibly switch between osmotrophy and bacterivory depending on the environmental conditions.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Prokopchuk-2022-159)

[![Image 45](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Paramecium_contractile_vacuoles.jpg/250px-Paramecium_contractile_vacuoles.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paramecium_contractile_vacuoles.jpg)

_[Paramecium aurelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium\_aurelia "Paramecium aurelia")_ with [contractile vacuoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractile_vacuole "Contractile vacuole")

Many [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater") protists need to [osmoregulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation "Osmoregulation") (i.e., remove excess water volume to adjust the ion concentrations) because non-saline water enters in excess by [osmosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis "Osmosis") from the environment[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Patterson-1980-160) and by endocytosis when feeding.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149) Osmoregulation is done through active ion transporters of the cell membrane and through [contractile vacuoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractile_vacuole "Contractile vacuole"), specialized [organelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle "Organelle") that periodically excrete fluid high in [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium "Potassium") and [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") through a cycle of diastole and systole. The cycle stops when the cells are placed in a medium with different salinity, until the cell adapts.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levandowsky-2012-141)

The contractile vacuoles are surrounded by the [spongiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spongiome "Spongiome"), an array of cytoplasmic vesicles or tubes that slowly collect fluid from the cytoplasm into the vacuole. The vacuoles then contract and discharge the fluid outside of the cell through a pore. The contractile mechanism varies depending on the protist: in ciliates, the spongiome is composed of irregular tubules and [actin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin "Actin") filaments wind around the pore and over the vacuole surface, together with microtubules; in most flagellates and amoebae, the spongiome is composed of both vesicles and tubules; in dinoflagellates, a flagellar rootlet branches to form a contractile sheath around the vacuole (known as pusule).[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149) The location and amount also varies: unicellular flagellated algae (cryptomonads, euglenids, prasinophytes, golden algae, haptophytes, etc.) typically have a single contractile vacuole in a fixed position; naked amoebae have numerous small vesicles that fuse into one vacuole and then split again after excretion. Marine or parasitic protists (e.g., metamonads), as well as those with rigid cell walls, lack these vacuoles.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Patterson-1980-160)

The [last eukaryotic common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor") was [aerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism "Aerobic organism"), bearing [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria "Mitochondria") for [oxidative metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_metabolism "Oxidative metabolism"). Many lineages of free-living and parasitic protists have independently evolved and adapted to inhabit [anaerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental) "Hypoxia (environmental)") or [microaerophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaerophilic "Microaerophilic") habitats, by modifying the early mitochondria into [hydrogenosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenosome "Hydrogenosome"), organelles that generate [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate") anaerobically through [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation "Fermentation") of [pyruvate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate "Pyruvate"). In a parallel manner, in the microaerophilic [trypanosomatid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomatid "Trypanosomatid") protists, the fermentative [glycosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosome "Glycosome") evolved from the [peroxisome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome "Peroxisome").[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levandowsky-2012-141)

Many flagellates and probably all motile algae exhibit a positive [phototaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototaxis "Phototaxis") (i.e. they swim or glide toward a source of light). For this purpose, they exhibit three kinds of [photoreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptors,_microbial "Photoreceptors, microbial") or "[eyespots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_apparatus "Eyespot apparatus")": (1) receptors with light antennae, found in many [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellates "Dinoflagellates") and [cryptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophytes "Cryptophytes"); (2) receptors with opaque screens; and (3) complex [ocelloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelloid "Ocelloid") with intracellular lenses, found in one group of predatory [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate "Dinoflagellate"), the [Warnowiaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnowiaceae "Warnowiaceae"). Additionally, some [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliates "Ciliates") orient themselves in relation to the Earth's [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") while moving ([geotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotaxis "Geotaxis")), and others swim in relation to the concentration of dissolved [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") in the water.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levandowsky-2012-141)

Protists have an accentuated tendency to include [endosymbionts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont "Endosymbiont") in their cells, and these have produced new physiological opportunities. Some associations are more permanent, such as _[Paramecium bursaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium\_bursaria "Paramecium bursaria")_ and its endosymbiont _[Chlorella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella "Chlorella")_; others more transient. Many protists contain captured chloroplasts, chloroplast-mitochondrial complexes, and even eyespots from algae. The [xenosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosome "Xenosome") are [bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial "Bacterial") endosymbionts found in ciliates, sometimes with a [methanogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenic "Methanogenic") role inside anaerobic ciliates.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levandowsky-2012-141)

Life cycle and reproduction
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Life cycle and reproduction")]

[![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Protist-life-cycles-consensus.png/500px-Protist-life-cycles-consensus.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Protist-life-cycles-consensus.png)

Consensus life cycle of free-living protists, including [sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction "Sexual reproduction") (red arrows), [asexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction "Asexual reproduction") (green arrows), [colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_organism "Colonial organism") stages (blue), and formation of [cysts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_cyst "Microbial cyst"). Each protist group has a different sexual cycle (light purple) as well as different means of exiting the colonial stage.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162)

Protists exhibit a large range of [life cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle "Biological life cycle") and [strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_strategy "Life strategy") involving multiple stages of different morphologies which have allowed them to thrive in most environments. Nevertheless, most of the knowledge concerning protist life cycles concerns [model organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism "Model organism") and important parasites. Free-living uncultivated protists represent the majority, but knowledge on their life cycles remains fragmentary.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162)

### Asexual reproduction

Protists typically reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions,[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Bernstein-2012-163) allowing for rapid exponential population growth with minimal genetic diversification. This [asexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction "Asexual reproduction"), occurs through [mitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis "Mitosis") and has historically been regarded as the primary reproductive mode in protists.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) This process is also known as [vegetative reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_reproduction "Vegetative reproduction"), as it is only performed by the 'vegetative stage' or individual.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cecere-2011-164)

Unicellular protists often multiply via [binary fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_fission "Binary fission"), similarly to bacteria.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) They can also divide through [budding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budding "Budding"), similarly to [yeasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast "Yeast"), or through multiple fissions, a process known as [schizogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizogony "Schizogony").[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Milgroom-2023-165) In multicellular protists, vegetative reproduction can take the form of [fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(reproduction) "Fragmentation (reproduction)") of body parts, or specialized [propagules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagules "Propagules") composed of numerous cells (e.g., in [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae")).[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cecere-2011-164)

### Sexual reproduction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Sexual reproduction")]

While asexual reproduction remains the most common strategy among protists, [sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction "Sexual reproduction") is also a fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-H%C3%B6randl-2020-166)[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gibson-2021-167) Sexual reproduction involves [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis "Meiosis") (a specialized nuclear division enabling [genetic recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination "Genetic recombination")) and [syngamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngamy "Syngamy") (the fusion of nuclei from two parents).[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) These processes are thought to have been present in the [last eukaryotic common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor"),[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Malik-2007-168) which likely had the ability to reproduce sexually on a facultative (non-obligate) basis.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-169) Even protists that no longer reproduce sexually still retain a core set of meiosis-related genes, reflecting their descent from sexual ancestors.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-170)[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-171) For example, although [amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebae "Amoebae") are traditionally considered asexual organisms, most asexual amoebae likely arose recently and independently from sexually reproducing amoeboid ancestors.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lahr-2011-172) Even in the early 20th century, some researchers interpreted phenomena related to chromidia ([chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin "Chromatin") granules free in the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm "Cytoplasm")) in amoebae as sexual reproduction.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Dobell-1909-173)

#### Basic sexual cycles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Basic sexual cycles")]

Every sexual cycle involves the events of syngamy and meiosis, which increase or decrease the [ploidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy "Ploidy") (i.e., number of [chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome "Chromosome") sets, represented by the letter _n_), respectively. Syngamy implies the fusion of two haploid (1 _n_) reproductive cells, known as [gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametes "Gametes"), which generates a diploid (2 _n_) cell called [zygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote "Zygote"). The diploid cell then undergoes meiosis to generate haploid cells. Depending on which cells compose the individual or vegetative stage (i.e., the stage that grows by mitosis), there are three distinguishable sexual cycles observed in free-living protists:[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162)

*   In the [haploid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle#Haplontic_life_cycle "Biological life cycle"), the individual is haploid and [differentiates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_differentiation "Cell differentiation") into haploid gametes through mitosis. The gametes fuse into a zygote which immediately undergoes meiosis to generate new haploid individuals.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) This is the case for some [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae") (namely [Volvocales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvocales "Volvocales")), many [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate "Dinoflagellate"), some [metamonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamonad "Metamonad"), and [apicomplexans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149): 26 

[![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Coleps-Konjugation.jpg/150px-Coleps-Konjugation.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coleps-Konjugation.jpg)

Two ciliates join during conjugation to exchange their haploid nuclei via a cytoplasm bridge.

*   In the [diploid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle#Diplontic_life_cycle "Biological life cycle"), the individual is diploid and undergoes meiosis to generate haploid gametes, which in turn fuse with others to form a zygote that develops into a new individual.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) This is the case for some metamonads, [heliozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliozoa "Heliozoa"), many green algae, [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom"), and [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate"), as well as [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149): 26  Instead of generating gametes, ciliates divide their diploid [micronucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus "Micronucleus") into two haploid nuclei, exchange one of them by [conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_conjugation "Sexual conjugation") with another ciliate, and fuse the two nuclei into a new diploid nucleus.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Lynn-2017-71)
*   In the [haplo-diploid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle#Haplodiplontic_life_cycle "Biological life cycle"), there are two [alternating generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_generations "Alternating generations") of individuals. One generation is the diploid 'agamont', which undergoes meiosis to generate haploid cells (spores) that develop into the other generation, the haploid 'gamont'. The gamont then generates gametes by mitosis, which in turn fuse to form the zygote that develops into the agamont.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rizos-2024-162) This is the case for many [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") and many algae, as well as [land plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruppert-2004-149): 26  There are three modes of this cycle depending on the relative growth and lifespan of one generation compared to the other: haploid-dominant, diploid-dominant, or equally dominant generations. [Brown algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae") exhibit the full range of these modes.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Heesch-2021-174)

Free-living protists tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock. [Oxidative stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress "Oxidative stress"), which leads to [DNA damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair#DNA_damage "DNA repair"), also appears to be an important factor in the induction of sex in protists.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Bernstein-2012-163)

#### Sexual cycles in pathogenic protists

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Sexual cycles in pathogenic protists")]

Pathogenic protists tend to have extremely complex life cycles that involve multiple forms of the organism, some of which reproduce sexually and others asexually.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-175) The stages that feed and multiply inside the [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology) "Host (biology)") are generally known as _[trophozoites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophozoite "Trophozoite")_ (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language")_trophos_'nutrition' and _zoia_'animals'), but the names of each stage vary depending on the protist group.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Milgroom-2023-165) For example:

*   In apicomplexans, a haploid _sporozoite_ is released into the host, penetrates a host cell, begins the infection and transforms into a _meront_ that grows and asexually divides into numerous _merozoites_ (a schizogony called _merogony_); each merozoite continues the infection by multiplying. Eventually, the merozoites differentiate (_gamogony_) into female (_macrogametocytes_) and male (_microgametocytes_) that generate gametes, which in turn fuse (_sporogony_) into a diploid zygote that grows into a _sporocyst_. The sporocyst then undergoes meiosis to form sporozoites that transmit the infection.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Vot%C3%BDpka-2017-74)[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gibson-2021-167)
*   In phytomyxeans, the diploid _primary zoospores_ enter the host, encyst, and penetrate cells as a uninucleate _protoplast_ or _plasmodium_. Inside the cells, the protoplast grows into a multinucleate zoosporangium, which then divides into _secondary zoospores_ that infect more cells. These multiply into thick-walled resting spores that begin meiosis and divide into binucleate resting spores; one nucleus is lost, and the spores hatch as primary zoospores.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-176)

Some protist pathogens undergo asexual reproduction in a wide variety of organisms – which act as secondary or intermediate hosts – but can undergo sexual reproduction only in the primary or definitive host (e.g., _[Toxoplasma gondii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma\_gondii "Toxoplasma gondii")_ in [felids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felid "Felid") such as [domestic cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_cat "Domestic cat")).[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-177) Others, such as _[Leishmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania "Leishmania")_, are capable of performing syngamy in the secondary vector.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-178) In apicomplexans, sexual reproduction is obligatory for parasite transmission.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-da_Silva-2022-179)

Despite undergoing sexual reproduction, it is unclear how frequently there is genetic exchange between different strains of pathogenic protists, as most populations may be clonal lines that rarely exchange genes with other members of their species.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-180)

Protists are indispensable to modern [ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem") worldwide. They also have been the only eukaryotic component of all ecosystems for much of [Earth's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_history "Earth's history"), which allowed them to evolve a vast functional diversity that explains their critical ecological significance. They are essential as [primary producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_producer "Primary producer"), as intermediates in multiple [trophic levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level "Trophic level"), as key regulating [parasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite "Parasite") or [parasitoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid "Parasitoid"), and as partners in diverse [symbioses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbioses "Symbioses").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Burki-2021-40)

Protists are abundant and diverse in nearly all habitats. They contribute 4 gigatons (Gt) to Earth's biomass—double that of animals (2 Gt), but less than 1% of the total. Combined, protists, animals, archaea (7 Gt), and fungi (12 Gt) make up less than 10% of global biomass, with plants (450 Gt) and bacteria (70 Gt) dominating.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Bar-On-2018-181) Protist diversity, as detected through [environmental DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA") surveys, is vast in every sampled environment, but it is mostly undescribed.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Epstein-2007-182) The richest protist communities appear in [soils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil"), followed by [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") and lastly [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater") habitats, mostly as part of the [plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton "Plankton").[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183) Freshwater protist communities are characterized by a higher "beta diversity" (i.e. highly heterogeneous between samples) than soil and marine plankton. The high diversity can be a result of the hydrological dynamic of recruiting organisms from different habitats through extreme [floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood "Flood").[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Metz-2022-184)[Soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil")-dwelling protist communities are ecologically the richest, possibly be due to the complex and highly dynamic distribution of water in the [sediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment "Sediment"), which creates extremely heterogenous environmental conditions. The constantly changing environment promotes the activity of only one part of the community at a time, while the rest remains inactive; this phenomenon promotes high microbial diversity in [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotes "Prokaryotes") as well as protists.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183)

Microscopic phototrophic protists (or [microalgae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microalgae "Microalgae")) are the main contributors to the [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") and [primary production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_production "Primary production") in nearly all aquatic environments, where they are collectively known as [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton") (together with [cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria "Cyanobacteria")). In marine phytoplankton, the smallest fractions, the picoplankton (<2 μm) and nanoplankton (2–20 μm), are dominated by several different algae ([prymnesiophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prymnesiophyte "Prymnesiophyte"), [pelagophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagophyte "Pelagophyte"), [prasinophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinophyte "Prasinophyte")); fractions larger than 5 μm are instead dominated by [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom") and [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate "Dinoflagellate").[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Epstein-2007-182) In freshwater phytoplankton, [golden algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_algae "Golden algae"), [cryptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophyte "Cryptophyte") and dinoflagellates are the most abundant groups.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183) Altogether, they are responsible for almost half of the global primary production.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Thor%C3%A9-2023-185) They are the main providers of much of the energy and organic matter used by [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria"), [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), and higher trophic levels ([zooplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton "Zooplankton") and [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish")), including essential nutrients such as [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid "Fatty acid").[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Caron-2009-186) Their abundance in the oceans depends mostly on the availability of inorganic nutrients, rather than temperature or sunlight; they are most abundant in coastal waters that receive nutrient-rich run-off from land, and areas where nutrient-rich deep ocean water reaches the surface, namely the upwelling zones in the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean") and along [continental margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_margin "Continental margin").[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Thor%C3%A9-2023-185) In freshwater habitats, most phototrophic protists are [mixotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixotroph "Mixotroph"), meaning they also behave as consumers, while strict consumers (heterotrophs) are less abundant.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183)

[Macroalgae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroalgae "Macroalgae") (namely [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae"), [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae") and [brown algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae")), unlike phytoplankton, generally require a fixation point, which limits their marine distribution to coastal waters, and particularly to rocky substrates. They support numerous herbivorous animals, especially [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") ones, as both food and refuge from predators. Some communities of [seaweeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed "Seaweed") exist adrift on the ocean surface, serving as a refuge and means of dispersal for associated organisms.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-187)[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-188)

Phototrophic protists are as abundant in soils as their aquatic counterparts. Given the importance of aquatic algae, soil algae may provide a larger contribution to the global [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle") than previously thought, but the magnitude of their carbon fixation has yet to be quantified.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183) Most soil algae are [stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramenopiles "Stramenopiles") ([diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom"), [xanthophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthophyte "Xanthophyte") and [eustigmatophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustigmatophyte "Eustigmatophyte")) and [archaeplastids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeplastid "Archaeplastid") ([green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae")). There is also presence of [environmental DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA") from [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate "Dinoflagellate") and [haptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte "Haptophyte") in soil, but no living forms have been seen.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189)

[Phagotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagotroph "Phagotroph") protists are the most diverse functional group in all ecosystems, primarily represented by [cercozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cercozoa "Cercozoa") (dominant in freshwater and soils), [radiolarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria") (dominant in oceans), non-photosynthetic [stramenopiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramenopile "Stramenopile") (with higher abundance in soils than in oceans), and [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate").[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183)

Contrary to the common division between phytoplankton and zooplankton, much of the marine plankton is composed of [mixotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixotrophic "Mixotrophic") protists, which pose a largely underestimated importance and abundance (around 12% of all marine [environmental DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_DNA "Environmental DNA") sequences). Mixotrophs have varied presence due to [seasonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") abundance[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Leles-2017-190) and depending on their specific type of mixotrophy. Constitutive mixotrophs are present in almost the entire range of oceanic conditions, from eutrophic shallow habitats to oligotrophic subtropical waters but mostly dominating the [photic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone "Photic zone"), and they account for most of the predation of bacteria. They are also responsible for [harmful algal blooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_algal_bloom "Harmful algal bloom"). Plastidic and generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs have similar biogeographies and low abundance, mostly found in eutrophic coastal waters, with generalist [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate") dominating up to half of ciliate communities in the photic zone. Lastly, endosymbiotic mixotrophs are by far the most widespread and abundant non-constitutive type, representing over 90% of all mixotroph sequences (mostly [radiolarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria")).[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Faure-2019-158)[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Mitra-2016-157)

Diagram of the soil food web, taking into account the diverse roles of protists as not just bacterivores, but also mycophages and omnivores.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2016-151) Arrows show the flow of nutrients.

In the [trophic webs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_web "Trophic web") of soils, protists are the main consumers of both [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") and [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi"), the two main pathways of nutrient flow towards higher trophic levels.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Harder-2016-191) Amoeboflagellates like the [glissomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glissomonad "Glissomonad") and [cercomonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cercomonad "Cercomonad") are among the most abundant soil protists: they possess both flagella and pseudopodia, a morphological variability well suited for foraging between soil particles. Testate amoebae are also acclimated to the soil environment, as their shells protect against [desiccation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiccation "Desiccation").[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189) As bacterial grazers, they have a significant role in the foodweb: they excrete [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") in the form of [NH 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"), making it available to plants and other microbes.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Harder-2016-191) Traditionally, protists were considered primarily bacterivorous due to biases in cultivation techniques, but many (e.g., [vampyrellids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampyrellid "Vampyrellid"), cercomonads, gymnamoebae, [testate amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testate_amoebae "Testate amoebae"), small flagellates) are omnivores that feed on a wide range of soil eukaryotes, including fungi and even some animals such as [nematodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode "Nematode"). Bacterivorous and mycophagous protists amount to similar biomasses.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2016-151)

[Necrophagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrophagy "Necrophagy") (the degradation of dead biomass) among microbes is mainly attributed to bacteria and fungi, but protists have a still poorly recognized role as [decomposers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposer "Decomposer") with specialized [lytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis "Lysis")[enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme").[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Moye-2024-192) In soils, [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus")-like protists and [slime molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold "Slime mold") (e.g., [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycete "Oomycete"), [myxomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxomycete "Myxomycete"), [acrasids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrasid "Acrasid")) are present abundantly as [osmotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotroph "Osmotroph") and [saprotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotroph "Saprotroph").[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189) In marine and estuarine environments, the well-studied [thraustochytrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thraustochytrid "Thraustochytrid") (part of [labyrinthulomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinthulomycetes "Labyrinthulomycetes")) are relevant saprotrophs that decompose various substrates, including dead plant and animal tissue. Various ciliates and testate amoebae scavenge on dead animals. Some [nucleariid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleariid "Nucleariid") amoebae specifically consume the contents of dead or damaged cells, but not healthy cells. However, all these examples are only facultative necrophages that also feed on live prey. In contrast, the algivorous cercozoan family [Viridiraptoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viridiraptoridae "Viridiraptoridae"), present in shallow bog waters, are broad-range but sophisticated necrophages that feed on a variety of exclusively dead algae, potentially fulfilling an important role in cleaning up the environment and releasing nutrients for live microbes.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Moye-2024-192)

### Parasites and pathogens

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Parasites and pathogens")]

[Parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic "Parasitic") protists occupy around 15–20% of all environmental DNA in marine and soil systems, but only around 5% in freshwater systems, where [chytrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytrid "Chytrid") fungi likely fill that [ecological niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche"). In oceanic systems, [parasitoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid "Parasitoid") (i.e. those which kill their hosts, e.g. [Syndiniales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndiniales "Syndiniales")) are more abundant. In freshwater ecosystems, parasitoids are mainly [Perkinsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkinsea "Perkinsea") and [Syndiniales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndiniales "Syndiniales") (Alveolata), while true parasites (i.e. those which do not kill their hosts) in freshwater are mostly [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycetes "Oomycetes"), [Apicomplexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa") and [Ichthyosporea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosporea "Ichthyosporea").[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183) In soil ecosystems, true parasites are primarily animal-hosted [apicomplexans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa") and plant-hosted [oomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycetes "Oomycetes") and [plasmodiophorids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodiophorid "Plasmodiophorid").[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189) In [Neotropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropical "Neotropical") forest soils, apicomplexans dominate eukaryotic diversity and have an important role as parasites of small invertebrates, while oomycetes are very scarce in contrast.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-193)

Some protists are significant parasites of animals (e.g.; five species of the parasitic genus _[Plasmodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium "Plasmodium")_ cause [malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria") in humans and many others cause similar diseases in other vertebrates), land plants[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-194)[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-195) (the [oomycete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomycete "Oomycete")_[Phytophthora infestans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora\_infestans "Phytophthora infestans")_ causes [late blight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_blight "Late blight") in potatoes)[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-196) or even of other protists.[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-197)[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-198) Around 100 protist species can infect humans.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189)

### Biogeochemical cycles

[Marine protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_protists "Marine protists") have a fundamental impact on [biogeochemical cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle "Biogeochemical cycle"), particularly the [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle").[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Keeling-2017-199) As phytoplankton, they [fix as much carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation "Carbon fixation") as all [terrestrial plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_plant "Terrestrial plant") combined.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Singer-2021-183) Soil protists, particularly [testate amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testate_amoebae "Testate amoebae"), contribute to the [silica cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica_cycle "Silica cycle") as much as forest trees through the biomineralization of their shells.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Geisen-2018-189)

### Early classification

[![Image 50](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Egg_tree_of_animals_Goldfuss_1820.jpg/250px-Egg_tree_of_animals_Goldfuss_1820.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Egg_tree_of_animals_Goldfuss_1820.jpg)

[Goldfuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_August_Goldfuss "Georg August Goldfuss")' system of life, introducing the Protozoa within animals.

From the start of the 18th century, the popular term "infusion animals" (later [infusoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusoria "Infusoria")) was used for protists, [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") and small [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate "Invertebrate"). In the mid-18th century, while Swedish biologist [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus "Carl Linnaeus") largely ignored the protists,[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-201) his Danish contemporary [Otto Friedrich Müller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Friedrich_M%C3%BCller "Otto Friedrich Müller") was the first to introduce protists to the [binomial nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature "Binomial nomenclature") system.[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Leadbeater-2000-200)[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ratcliff-2009-202)

In 1820, German naturalist [Georg August Goldfuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_August_Goldfuss "Georg August Goldfuss") coined the term "[Protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa")" (meaning 'early animals') as a class within Kingdom Animalia[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Goldfu%C3%9F-1818-203) that consisted of four groups: [Infusoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusoria "Infusoria") ([ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliates "Ciliates")), Lithozoa ([corals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral "Coral")), Phytozoa, and Medusinae ([jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish")). Later, in 1845, [Carl Theodor von Siebold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Theodor_von_Siebold "Carl Theodor von Siebold") used the term "[Protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa")" as a phylum of exclusively unicellular animals consisting of two classes: Infusoria (ciliates) and [Rhizopoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizopoda "Rhizopoda") ([amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebae "Amoebae"), [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera")).[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Siebold-1848-204) Other scientists did not consider all protozoans part of the animal kingdom, and by the middle of the century most biologists grouped microorganisms into Protozoa, Protophyta (primitive plants), Phytozoa (animal-like plants), and [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") (mostly considered plants). In 1860, palaeontolgist [Richard Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen "Richard Owen") was the first to define Protozoa as its own kingdom of eukaryotes, although he also included [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges "Sponges") within his group.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)

[![Image 51](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/John_Hogg_--_Primigenum_or_Protoctista.jpg/500px-John_Hogg_--_Primigenum_or_Protoctista.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Hogg_--_Primigenum_or_Protoctista.jpg)

[John Hogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hogg_(biologist) "John Hogg (biologist)")'s illustration of the Four Kingdoms of Nature, showing _"Regnum Primigenum"_ (Protoctista) as a greenish haze at the base of the Animals and Plants, 1860

In 1860, British naturalist [John Hogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hogg_(biologist) "John Hogg (biologist)") proposed "Protoctista" as the name for a fourth kingdom, (the other kingdoms being plant, animal and mineral) which he described as containing "all the lower creatures, or the primary organic beings", which included Protophyta, Protozoa and [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge "Sponge").[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hogg-1860-205)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)

[Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel "Ernst Haeckel")'s 1866 tree of life, with the third kingdom Protista.

In 1866, the 'father of protistology', German scientist [Ernst Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel "Ernst Haeckel"), addressed the problem of classifying all these organisms as a mixture of animal and vegetable characters, and proposed _Protistenreich_[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Haeckel-1878-206) (Kingdom Protista) as the [third kingdom of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)#Three_kingdoms_of_life "Kingdom (biology)"), comprising primitive forms that were "neither animals nor plants". He grouped both bacteria[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Taylor-2003-207) and eukaryotes, both unicellular and multicellular organisms, as Protista. He retained the [Infusoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusoria "Infusoria") in the animal kingdom, until German zoologist [Otto Bütschli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_B%C3%BCtschli "Otto Bütschli") demonstrated that they were unicellular.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Haeckel-1866-208)[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Rothschild-1989-209) At first, he included [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges "Sponges") and fungi, but in later publications he explicitly restricted Protista to predominantly unicellular organisms or colonies incapable of forming [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)"). He clearly separated Protista from [true animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metazoa "Metazoa") on the basis that the defining character of protists was the absence of [sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction "Sexual reproduction"), while the defining character of animals was the [blastula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastula "Blastula") stage of animal development. He also returned the terms _Protozoa_ and _Protophyta_ as subkingdoms of Protista.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)

### End of the animal-plant dichotomy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: End of the animal-plant dichotomy")]

Bütschli considered the kingdom to be too [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyletic "Polyphyletic") and rejected the inclusion of bacteria. He fragmented the kingdom into _protozoa_ (only nucleated, unicellular animal-like organisms), while bacteria and the _protophyta_ were a separate grouping. This strengthened the old dichotomy of _protozoa_/_protophyta_ from German scientist [Carl Theodor von Siebold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Theodor_von_Siebold "Carl Theodor von Siebold"), and the German naturalists asserted this view over the worldwide scientific community by the turn of the century. However, British biologist [C. Clifford Dobell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Clifford_Dobell "C. Clifford Dobell") in 1911 brought attention to the fact that protists functioned very differently compared to the animal and vegetable cellular organization, and gave importance to Protista as a group with a different organization that he called "acellularity", shifting away from the dogma of German cell theory. He coined the term [protistology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protistology "Protistology") and solidified it as a branch of study independent from [zoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology "Zoology") and [botany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany "Botany").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)

In 1938, American biologist [Herbert Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Copeland_(biologist) "Herbert Copeland (biologist)") resurrected Hogg's label, arguing that Haeckel's term _Protista_ included anucleated microbes such as bacteria, which the term _Protoctista_ (meaning "first established beings") did not. Under his [four-kingdom classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)#Four_kingdoms "Kingdom (biology)") ([Monera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monera "Monera"), _Protoctista_, [Plantae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantae "Plantae"), [Animalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia "Animalia")), the protists and bacteria were finally split apart, recognizing the difference between anucleate ([prokaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic "Prokaryotic")) and nucleate ([eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic "Eukaryotic")) organisms. To firmly separate protists from plants, he followed Haeckel's blastular definition of true animals, and proposed defining [true plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyta "Embryophyta") as those with [chlorophyll _a_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_a "Chlorophyll a") and [_b_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_b "Chlorophyll b"), [carotene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene "Carotene"), [xanthophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthophyll "Xanthophyll") and production of [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch "Starch"). He also was the first to recognize that the unicellular/multicellular dichotomy was invalid. Still, he kept fungi within Protoctista, together with [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae"), [brown algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae") and [protozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Copeland-1938-210) This classification was the basis for Whittaker's later definition of Fungi, [Animalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia "Animalia"), [Plantae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantae "Plantae") and Protista as the four kingdoms of life.[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Whittaker-1959-211)

In the popular [five-kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)#Five_kingdoms "Kingdom (biology)") scheme published by American plant ecologist [Robert Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whittaker_(ecologist) "Robert Whittaker (ecologist)") in 1969, Protista was defined as eukaryotic "organisms which are [unicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicellular_organism "Unicellular organism") or unicellular-colonial and which form no [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)")". Just as the prokaryotic/eukaryotic division was becoming mainstream, Whittaker, after a decade from Copeland's system,[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Whittaker-1959-211) recognized the fundamental division of life between the prokaryotic Monera and the eukaryotic kingdoms: Animalia (ingestion), Plantae (photosynthesis), Fungi (absorption) and the remaining Protista.[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Whittaker-1969-212)[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Hagen-2012-213)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Scamardella-1999-30)

In the five-kingdom system of American evolutionary biologist [Lynn Margulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis "Lynn Margulis"), the term "protist" was reserved for [microscopic organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_organisms "Microscopic organisms"), while the more inclusive kingdom Protoctista (or **protoctists**) included certain large [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism "Multicellular organism") eukaryotes, such as [kelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp "Kelp"), [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae"), and [slime molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold "Slime mold").[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-214) Some use the term _protist_ interchangeably with Margulis' _protoctist_, to encompass both single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including those that form specialized tissues but do not fit into any of the other traditional kingdoms.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Archibald-2017-215)

### Advances in electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protist&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Advances in electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetics")]

Phylogenomic tree of eukaryotes, as regarded in 2020. [Supergroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(biology) "Supergroup (biology)") are in color.

The five-kingdom model remained the accepted classification until the development of [molecular phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetic "Molecular phylogenetic") in the late 20th century, when it became apparent that protists are a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly "Paraphyly") group from which animals, fungi and land plants evolved, and the [three-domain system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-domain_system "Three-domain system") (Bacteria, [Archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), [Eukarya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukarya "Eukarya")) became prevalent.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Stechmann-2003-216) Today, protists are not treated as a formal [taxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon "Taxon"), but the term is commonly used for convenience in two ways:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-O'Malley-2012-14)

*   [Phylogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic "Phylogenetic") definition: protists are a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly "Paraphyly") group.[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Schlegel-2007-217) A protist is any [eukaryote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") that is not an animal, land plant or fungus,[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-microbeworld-218) thus excluding many unicellular groups like the fungal [Microsporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia "Microsporidia"), [Chytridiomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycetes "Chytridiomycetes") and [yeasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast "Yeast"), and the non-unicellular [Myxozoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxozoa "Myxozoa") animals included in Protista in the past.[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-219)
*   Functional definition: protists are essentially those eukaryotes that are never [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular "Multicellular"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-O'Malley-2012-14) that either exist as independent cells, or if they occur in [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_organism "Colonial organism"), do not show differentiation into tissues.[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2005-220) While in popular usage, this definition excludes the variety of non-colonial multicellularity types that protists exhibit, such as aggregative (e.g., [choanoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellates "Choanoflagellates")) or complex multicellularity (e.g., [brown algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_algae "Brown algae")).[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-O'Malley-2022-221)

There is, however, one classification of protists based on traditional ranks that lasted until the 21st century. The British protozoologist [Thomas Cavalier-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cavalier-Smith "Thomas Cavalier-Smith"), since 1998, developed a [six-kingdom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)#Six_kingdoms_(1998) "Kingdom (biology)"):[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-223) Bacteria, [Animalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia "Animalia"), [Plantae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantae "Plantae"), Fungi, _[Protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa")_ and _[Chromista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromista "Chromista")_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-1998-10)[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Ruggiero-2015-222) In his context, paraphyletic groups take preference over clades:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-1998-10) both protist kingdoms _Protozoa_ and _Chromista_ contain paraphyletic [phyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum "Phylum") such as [Apusozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apusozoa "Apusozoa"), [Eolouka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eolouka "Eolouka") or [Opisthosporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthosporidia "Opisthosporidia"). Additionally, [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae") and [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae") are considered true plants, while the [fungal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal "Fungal") groups [Microsporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia "Microsporidia"), [Rozellida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozellida "Rozellida") and [Aphelida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelida "Aphelida") are considered protozoans under the phylum [Opisthosporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthosporidia "Opisthosporidia"). This scheme endured until 2021, the year of his last publication.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2022-9)

Before the existence of [land plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte"), [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal") and [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"), all [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") were protists. As a result, the early fossil record of protists is equivalent to the early record of eukaryotic life.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-da_Silva-2022-179) The protist fossil record is mainly represented by protists with fossilizable coverings, such as foraminifera, radiolaria, testate amoebae and diatoms, as well as multicellular algae.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)

### Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic

Modern or _[crown-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-group "Crown-group")_ eukaryotes originated from the [last eukaryotic common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_eukaryotic_common_ancestor "Last eukaryotic common ancestor") (LECA) and emerged between 1600 and 2400 million years ago (Ma), during the [Paleoproterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic "Paleoproterozoic") and [Mesoproterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoproterozoic "Mesoproterozoic") eras.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Strassert-2021-1) However, the [fossil record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_record "Fossil record") through this time is scarce and dominated by _[stem-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-group "Stem-group")_ eukaryotes, extinct lineages preceding LECA. These lineages displayed early eukaryotic traits like flexible [cell membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane") and complex [cell wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall "Cell wall") ornamentations, which require a flexible [endomembrane system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomembrane_system "Endomembrane system"), but they lacked crown-group eukaryotes' advanced sterols (e.g., [cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol "Cholesterol")), and instead produced simpler [protosterols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protosterol_biota "Protosterol biota") that require less [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") during [biosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis "Biosynthesis").[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) Examples of these are: _[Trachyhystrichosphaera](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trachyhystrichosphaera&action=edit&redlink=1 "Trachyhystrichosphaera (page does not exist)")_ and _[Leiosphaeridia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiosphaeridia "Leiosphaeridia")_ dated at 1100 Ma,[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-226)_[Satka](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Satka\_(genus)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Satka (genus) (page does not exist)")_ dated at 1300 Ma,[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-227)_[Tappania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappania "Tappania")_ and _[Shuiyousphaeridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuiyousphaeridium "Shuiyousphaeridium")_ dated at 1600 Ma,[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-228)_[Grypania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grypania "Grypania")_ dated at 1800–1900 Ma, and _Valeria_ which ranges from 1650 to 700 Ma.[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Xiao-2013-229)

Crown-group eukaryotes achieved significant [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology) "Morphology (biology)") and [ecological diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_diversity "Ecological diversity") before 1000 Ma, with multicellular algae capable of sexual reproduction and unicellular protists exhibiting modern [phagocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis "Phagocytosis") and [locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist_locomotion "Protist locomotion"). Their advanced but metabolically expensive sterols likely provided numerous [evolutionary advantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation") due to the increased membrane flexibility, including resilience to [osmotic shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_shock "Osmotic shock") during desiccation and rehydration cycles, extreme temperatures, [UV light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_light "UV light") exposure, and protection against [changing oxygen levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event "Great Oxidation Event"). These adaptations allowed crown-group eukaryotes to colonize diverse and harsh environments (e.g., [mudflats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflat "Mudflat"), rivers, agitated shorelines and land). In contrast, stem-group eukaryotes occupied the low-oxygen marine waters as [anaerobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobe "Anaerobe").[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) The oldest definitive crown-group eukaryotic fossils include _[Rafatazmia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafatazmia "Rafatazmia")_ and _[Ramathallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramathallus "Ramathallus")_, both putative red algae, dated at 1600 Ma.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Strassert-2021-1)

As oxygen levels rose during the [Tonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonian "Tonian") period, crown-group eukaryotes outcompeted stem-group eukaryotes, expanding into oxygen-rich marine environments that supported an [aerobic metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_metabolism "Aerobic metabolism") enabled by their [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria "Mitochondria"). Stem-group eukaryotes may have gone extinct due to competition and the extreme climatic changes of the [Cryogenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenian "Cryogenian")[glaciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciations "Glaciations") and subsequent [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), cementing the dominance of crown-group eukaryotes.[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) Crown-group eukaryotes began to appear abundantly in this era, fueled by the proliferation of [red algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae"). The oldest fossils firmly assigned to existing protist groups include three multicellular algae: the [rhodophyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodophyte "Rhodophyte")_[Bangiomorpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangiomorpha "Bangiomorpha")_ (1047 Ma),[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Gibson-2017-230) the [chlorophyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyte "Chlorophyte")_[Proterocladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterocladus "Proterocladus")_ (1000 Ma),[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) and the [xanthophyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthophyceae "Xanthophyceae")_[Paleovaucheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paleovaucheria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Paleovaucheria (page does not exist)")_ (1000 Ma).[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Butterfield-2004-231)[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-232) Also included are the oldest fossils of [Opisthokonta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthokonta "Opisthokonta"): _[Ourasphaira giraldae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ourasphaira\_giraldae "Ourasphaira giraldae")_ (1010–890 Ma), interpreted as the earliest [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"),[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) and _[Bicellum brasieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicellum\_brasieri "Bicellum brasieri")_ (1000 Ma), the earliest [holozoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holozoan "Holozoan"), showing traits associated with complex [multicellularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellularity "Multicellularity").[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Strother-2021-233)

Abundant fossils of [heterotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrophic "Heterotrophic") protists appear significantly later, parallel to the emergence of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi").[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brocks-2023-225) Vase-shaped microfossils (VSMs), widespread rocks dated at 780–720 Ma (Tonian to Cryogenian), have been described as a variety of organisms across the decades (e.g., algae, [chitinozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitinozoa "Chitinozoa"), [tintinnids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintinnid "Tintinnid")), but current scientific consensus relates most VSMs to marine [testate amoebae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testate_amoebae "Testate amoebae").[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Chai-2021-234) As such, VSMs comprise the oldest known fossils of both filose ([Cercozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cercozoa "Cercozoa")) and lobose ([Amoebozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoebozoa "Amoebozoa")) testate amoebae.[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Porter-2003-235)[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Parfrey-2011-236)

After the [Gaskiers glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaskiers_glaciation "Gaskiers glaciation") of the [Late Ediacaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran "Ediacaran") (~579 Ma), fossils of heterotrophic protists undergo diversification. Some fossils similar to VSMs are interpreted as the oldest fossils of [Foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera "Foraminifera") dated at 548 Ma (e.g., _[Protolagena](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Protolagena&action=edit&redlink=1 "Protolagena (page does not exist)")_),[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Chai-2021-234) but their foraminiferal affinity is doubtful. Other microfossils that are possibly foraminifera include some poorly preserved tubular shells from 716–635 Ma rocks.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Xiao-2021-237)

[Radiolarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria "Radiolaria") shells appear abundantly in the fossil record since the [Cambrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian "Cambrian"), with the first definitive radiolarian fossils found at the very start of this period (~540 Ma) together with the first [small shelly fauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_shelly_fauna "Small shelly fauna").[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Braun-2007-238) Radiolarian records from older [Precambrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian "Precambrian") rocks have been disregarded due to the lack of reliable fossils.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Chang-2018-239)[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Zhang-2019-240)[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Maletz-2017-241) Around this time, between 540 and 510 Ma, the oldest Foraminifera shells appear, first multi-chambered and later tubular.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Pawlowski-2003-242)[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Xiao-2021-237)

Following the [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion "Cambrian explosion") and rapid diversification of animals, the Precambrian microbe-dominated ecosystems were replaced by primarily [benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic "Benthic") and nekto-benthic communities, with most marine organisms (animals, foraminifers, radiolarians) limited to the depths of shallow water environments.[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Servais-2016-243) Mirroring the animal [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_radiation "Evolutionary radiation"), there was a radiation of phytoplanktonic protists (i.e., acritarchs)[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Vecoli-2004-244) around 520–510 Ma, followed by a decrease in diversity around 500 Ma.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-245) Later, the surviving acritarchs expanded in diversity and morphological innovation[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Vecoli-2004-244) due to a decrease in predation from benthic animals (particularly [trilobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite "Trilobite") and [brachiopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiopod "Brachiopod")), which suffered extinction due to various proposed environmental factors such as [anoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxic_event "Anoxic event").[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Zhang-2023-246) Both phytoplankton and zooplankton (e.g., radiolarians) flourished, as signaled by an increase of organic carbon buried in the sediment known as the [SPICE event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steptoean_positive_carbon_isotope_excursion "Steptoean positive carbon isotope excursion") (~497 Ma).[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Servais-2016-243)[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Zhang-2023-246) This abundant [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") supported a second animal radiation known as the [Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ordovician_Biodiversification_Event "Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event") (GOBE), where many animals switched to a planktonic lifestyle and pelagic predators first appeared (e.g., [cephalopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod "Cephalopod"), swimming [arthropods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod")). This event is also known as the 'Ordovician Plankton Revolution' due to the significant diversification of planktonic protists, and it spanned from the late Cambrian well into the [Ordovician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician "Ordovician").[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Servais-2016-243)

The Ordovician also includes the oldest [euglenid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglenid "Euglenid") fossil, known as _[Moyeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moyeria "Moyeria")_, which is found in rocks spanning from the middle Ordovician (~471 Ma) to the [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian "Silurian").[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Strother-2020-247) There are putative records of calcareous foraminifera from the Early Ordovician to the Silurian, but these are not widely accepted; the oldest trusted and well-known calcaerous foraminifera appear in the Middle [Devonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian "Devonian"), the next geological period.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-248)

In Early Devonian terrestrial ecosystems the first fossils of freshwater arcellinid testate amoebae are found (e.g., _Palaeoleptochlamys_, _Cangweulla_),[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-249) as well as various types of freshwater [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae"), including [charophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charophyte "Charophyte"), [volvocaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvocaceae "Volvocaceae") and [desmids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmid "Desmid"),[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-250) and some putative algal fossils that might represent [glaucophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucophyte "Glaucophyte").[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-251) During the Devonian some benthic foraminifera acquired the ability of calcifying, and particularly the giant [fusulinids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusulinida "Fusulinida") became the dominant fossilizable protists. This time interval is also considered the molecular origin of [haptophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptophyte "Haptophyte") (~310 Ma) and [silicoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicoflagellate "Silicoflagellate") (397–382 Ma), which did not leave fossil traces until later in the [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic"). After the [Late Devonian extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Devonian_extinction "Late Devonian extinction") (372 Ma), [nassellarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassellaria "Nassellaria")-like radiolarians appeared for the first time, with a unique [body plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_plan "Body plan") among marine protists.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)

During the [Carboniferous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous "Carboniferous") period, no new fossilizable protists originated despite the major environmental changes. However, starting in the Late Carboniferous, radiolarian diversity and productivity increased, causing a large amount of biosiliceous sediment ([chert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert "Chert")) to be accumulated worldwide; this is known as the Radiolarian Optimum Event, which lasted primarily from the Middle [Permian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian "Permian") until the Early [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous").[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wever-2007-252)[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-253)[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-254) Around the [Capitanian mass extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitanian_mass_extinction_event "Capitanian mass extinction event") (262–259 Ma) of the Permian period, [coccolithophores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophore "Coccolithophore") genetically diverged from the rest of haptophytes, possibly as a response to a reduction in atmospheric oxygen, and there was a faunal turnover from larger to smaller fusulinids.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)[Spumellarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spumellaria "Spumellaria") radiolarians appear in the latest Permian.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wever-2007-252)

The [Permian-Triassic extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian-Triassic_extinction_event "Permian-Triassic extinction event") (~251.9 Ma) caused the extinction of many radiolarians, which manifests as a gap in the chert record.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wever-2007-252) The extinction is hypothesized as resulting in the molecular origin of [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatoms "Diatoms") and modern coccolithophores.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224) The Middle to Late [Triassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic "Triassic") period saw the acceleration of radiolarian diversity[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wever-2007-252) and the appearance of several groups of calcaerous nannofossils. First, various nannofossils, some of which belonged to [dinocysts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinocysts "Dinocysts"), appeared early at around 235 Ma. Later originated the oldest identifiable coccolithophore, _[Crucirhabdus minutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crucirhabdus\_minutus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Crucirhabdus minutus (page does not exist)")_ (205–201 Ma), as well as the oldest fossils of [Phaeodaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeodaria "Phaeodaria").[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224) There's a variety of protozoa, including soft-bodied [ciliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliate "Ciliate"), and filamentous algae found in [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber "Amber") from the Late Triassic (220–230 Ma).[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Poinar-1993-255)

Around the Early–Middle [Jurassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic "Jurassic"), after the global [Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toarcian_Oceanic_Anoxic_Event "Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event") there was a diversification of dinoflagellates and coccolithophores, in both species and abundance. This interval also saw the completion of a symbiosis between [Acantharia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acantharia "Acantharia") radiolarians and lineages of _[Phaeocystis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeocystis "Phaeocystis")_ haptophytes, as well as the appearance of planktonic foraminifera.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224) The period of low atmospheric oxygen ends in the [Aptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptian "Aptian")-[Albian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albian "Albian") boundary during the Early [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous"), and the first fossils of diatoms and silicoflagellates appear.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224) Samples of [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber "Amber") from around 100 Ma contain the oldest fossil records of [apicomplexans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa "Apicomplexa") (particularly [malarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria") agents and [gregarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregarine "Gregarine")), [trypanosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomatida "Trypanosomatida"),[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Leung-2017-256) and [metamonads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamonad "Metamonad")—particularly mutualistic [parabasalids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabasalid "Parabasalid") of [cockroaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroaches "Cockroaches"), representing the earliest record of mutualism between protists and animals.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Poinar-2009-257)[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Poinar-2009b-258)

The diversification of coccolithophores, mixotrophic dinoflagellates, and later diatoms across the Mesozoic era caused an accelerated transfer of primary production into higher trophic levels. This evolutionary radiation of phytoplankton was, in turn, responsible for the animal "Mesozoic marine revolution", characterized by the appearance of widespread predation among most invertebrate phyla. Coccolithophores, dinoflagellates and especially diatoms became the dominating eukaryotic producers in oceans until today, as opposed to [cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria "Cyanobacteria") and green algae which dominated earlier.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-259)

The [Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous-Paleogene_extinction_event "Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event") (~66 Ma) caused the extinction of many marine dinoflagellates, foraminifers, coccolithophores, and silicoflagellates; mesozoic types of these groups were substituted with types that dominate marine habitats today. Right after this event, putative [ebridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebriid "Ebriid") begin appearing in the fossil record (e.g., _[Ammodochium](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ammodochium&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ammodochium (page does not exist)")_), but the oldest reliable ebridian fossils belong to the upper middle [Eocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene") (42–33.7 Ma).[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224) Around this time, the oldest fossils of [Synurophyceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synurophyceae "Synurophyceae") appear (~49–40 Ma).[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Brown-2010-260) Following the [Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eocene_Climatic_Optimum "Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum") (~40 Ma), diatoms became the dominant agents of marine silicon precipitation as opposed to radiolarians, and the fossil record shows the first raphid diatoms and [collodarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodaria "Collodaria").[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Suzuki-2015-224)

Historically, the [heterotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph "Heterotroph") protists, known as [protozoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa "Protozoa"), were considered part of the [animal kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"), while the [phototrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph "Phototroph") ones, called [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae "Algae"), were studied as part of the [plant kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_kingdom "Plant kingdom"). Even after the creation of a separate protist kingdom, some minuscule animals (the [myxozoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxozoa "Myxozoa"))[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Levine-1980-6) and 'lower' [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi") (namely the [aphelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelida "Aphelida"), [rozellids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozellida "Rozellida") and [microsporidians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsporidia "Microsporidia"), collectively known as [Opisthosporidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthosporidia "Opisthosporidia")) were studied as protists,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2022-9) and some algae (particularly [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_algae "Red algae") and [green algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_algae "Green algae")) remained classified as plants.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-1998-10) According to the current consensus, the label 'protist' specifically excludes animals, [embryophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryophyte "Embryophyte") (land plants) —meaning that all algae fall under this label— and all fungi. Opisthosporidians are considered part of a larger fungal kingdom, although they are often studied by [protistologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protistologist "Protistologist") and [mycologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycologist "Mycologist") alike.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2019-2)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Tedersoo-2018-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Wijayawardene-2022-12)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_ref-cilia_28-0)**The terms '[cilium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium "Cilium")' and '[eukaryotic flagellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_flagellum "Eukaryotic flagellum")' are interchangeable from a biological perspective. However, their usage depends on the author: some prefer to reserve cilia for shorter appendages and flagella for longer ones, while others prefer cilia for eukaryotes and flagella for prokaryotes. The term '[undulipodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulipodium "Undulipodium")' was proposed to unify the two concepts, as it refers specifically to the [homologous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology) "Homology (biology)")[microtubular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubular "Microtubular") structure found in both, but not found in [prokaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic "Prokaryotic") flagella.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-25)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-26)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-27)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_ref-39)**A 2007 report on protist diversity included a table listing the described number of species for protist and fungal groups. The total sum of the listed species, excluding fungi, is 76,144.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Adl-2007-38)

The name Percolozoa encompasses these and other related single-celled protists, not just the 'true' heteroloboseans.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Cavalier-Smith-2022-9)
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_ref-156)**The terms "mixotroph" and "mixoplankton" almost exclusively refer to protists that perform photosynthesis and phagocytosis (photo-phagotrophs). Osmotrophy is always present, but not taken into account. As such, "pure" phototrophs (incapable of phagocytosis) and "pure" phagotrophs (incapable of photosynthesis) are technically mixotrophic due to their innate ability for osmotrophy, but are not usually reported in this sense.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-155)
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_ref-201)**[Carl von Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Linnaeus "Carl von Linnaeus") did not mention a single protist genus until the tenth edition of _[Systema Naturae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema\_Naturae "Systema Naturae")_ of 1758, where _[Volvox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvox "Volvox")_ was recorded.[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist#cite_note-Leadbeater-2000-200)
