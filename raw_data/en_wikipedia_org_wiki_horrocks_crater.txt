Its diameter is 30 kilometres (19 mi). It was named after the 17th-century English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] To the south of Horrocks are the craters Halley and Hind , Rhaeticus is to the north, and Pickering to the northeast.

Gyldén and Saunder lie to the west and east, respectively.

The rim of Horrocks is somewhat irregular and polygonal , particularly with an outward  protrusion on the eastern rim. It has a small outer ridge. The inner wall is slumped, particularly along the northwest where it forms a heap of talus . The interior floor is uneven, and it has a central mountain and hills. The crater is approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter and 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) deep. It is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

[ 2 ] Satellite craters [ edit ] By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Horrocks.
