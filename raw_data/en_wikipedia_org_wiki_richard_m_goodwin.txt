Goodwin Born ( 1913-02-24 ) February 24, 1913 New Castle, Indiana Died August 13, 1996 (1996-08-13) (aged 83) Alma mater Harvard Richard M. Goodwin (February 24, 1913 – August 13, 1996) was an American mathematician and economist .

Background [ edit ] Goodwin was born in New Castle, Indiana .

[ 1 ] He received his BA and PhD at Harvard and taught there from 1942 until 1950. He fled the United States during the McCarthy era , [ 1 ] then taught at the University of Cambridge until 1979 and the University of Siena until 1984.

[ 2 ] Although he became a university lecturer in the Cambridge faculty of economics and politics in 1951, it was not until five years later that he agreed to join the fellowship of a college, choosing that of Peterhouse .

Christopher Calladine thinks that this unusual situation may have been because Goodwin initially had ideological opposition to the notion of the college system, which he may have considered to be anachronistic. Later, after retiring from Cambridge, [ 3 ] Goodwin was the first non-Italian professor of economics at Siena.

[ 4 ] Goodwin described himself as "a lifelong but wayward Marxist", [ 5 ] joining the Communist Party of Great Britain while a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford in the 1930s and then its American counterpart when he got back to the United States. However, Goodwin left after the announcement of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact .

[ 6 ] Work [ edit ] Goodwin worked on the interaction between long run growth and business cycles. His article on matrix multiplier was one of the earliest uses of the Perron–Frobenius theorem in economics, although his reasoning had an error that was diagnosed by Frank H. Hahn .

[ citation needed ] He returned to the Perron–Frobenius theorem with his book The Dynamics of A Capitalist Economy .

Goodwin's interest in applying the theory of nonlinear systems to macroeconomics was sparked by Philippe Le Corbeiller , who taught applied physics at Harvard. Following an early suggestion of Le Corbeiller's, Goodwin characterized the business cycle as a non-linear self-oscillation . Goodwin credited Le Corbeiller with teaching him nonlinear dynamics while Le Corbeiller credited Goodwin with the discovery of the two-stroke oscillator.

[ 7 ] Goodwin adopted the Lotka–Volterra equations for the population dynamics of a predator and a prey species as the basis of the Goodwin model (or Goodwin's class struggle model) of economic growth . In his model, employed workers have the role of predators as their wage demands squeeze profits and hence investment, causing a subsequent increase in unemployment.

[ citation needed ] Another model, Goodwin's non-linear accelerator, is also a model of endogenous cycles in economic activity in which the cycles do not rely on outside shocks or structurally unstable parameters .

[ citation needed ] "A Growth Cycle" (1967) saw Goodwin utilise Volterra's equations to formalise Karl Marx 's theory of economic cycles.
