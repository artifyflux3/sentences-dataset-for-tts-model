He was also an author who wrote textbooks on cosmology, popular science books, and science fiction novels and short stories.

Narlikar studied at Banaras Hindu University and Cambridge University , where he obtained his PhD in 1963 working with Fred Hoyle . After postdoctoral work in Cambridge, in 1972 he was appointed a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research . In 1988, he became the first director of the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA).

[ 1 ] Early life [ edit ] Narlikar was born in Kolhapur , India, on 19 July 1938, into an academic family. His father, Vishnu Vasudev Narlikar , was a mathematician and theoretical physicist who was a professor and head of department at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi. His mother, Sumati Narlikar , was a scholar of Sanskrit .

[ citation needed ] His maternal uncle, V. S. Huzurbazar , was a statistician.

[ 2 ] Narlikar went to school at Central Hindu College (now Central Hindu Boys School ) in Varanasi . He then studied at BHU, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1957. He continued his education at Cambridge University , where he was a member of Fitzwilliam College (as his father had been).

[ 3 ] He completed the mathematical tripos in 1959, for which he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and was Senior Wrangler .

[ 4 ] This degree was converted to an Oxbridge MA in 1964, without further study.

Career [ edit ] Narlikar began his research career as a doctoral student in theoretical cosmology , under the guidance of Fred Hoyle in Cambridge. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1963. He was then a postdoctoral fellow at King's College in Cambridge. In 1966, Hoyle established the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy in Cambridge; Narlikar was a founding member of the institute, [ citation needed ] while remaining a fellow at King's College.

A dispute with university leadership led Hoyle to resign in 1972, [ 5 ] and it was decided that his institute would merge into the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge . Narlikar left Cambridge that year, returning to India as a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai , where he led its theoretical astrophysics group. In 1981, Narlikar became a founding member of the World Cultural Council .

[ 6 ] In 1988, he was appointed the founding director of the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. From 1994–1997, he was the president of the International Astronomical Union commission for cosmology.

[ citation needed ] The National Council of Educational Research and Training appointed Narlikar as chairperson of its committee responsible for developing textbooks in science and mathematics.

[ 7 ] Narlikar publicly criticised pseudoscience , including astrology , arguing instead for evidence-based thinking.

[ 8 ] Research [ edit ] Narlikar's research involved Mach's principle , quantum cosmology , and action-at-a-distance physics. Dissatisfied with the standard Big Bang model of cosmology, Narilkar investigated alternative models, a field known as non-standard cosmology .

[ 9 ] With Fred Hoyle , he proposed a conformal gravity model now known as Hoyle–Narlikar theory , which attempted to produce an alternative theory of gravity that is consistent with Mach's principle .

[ 8 ] It proposes that the inertial mass of a particle is a function of the masses of all other particles, multiplied by a coupling constant, which is a function of cosmic time .

[ citation needed ] The theory was not accepted by mainstream cosmology.

[ 8 ] Narlikar collaborated with other critics of Big Bang cosmology, including Halton Arp , Geoffrey Burbidge , Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe .

[ 10 ] In 1993, Hoyle, Burbidge and Narlikar proposed the quasi-steady state cosmological model.

[ 11 ] That model was incompatible with the accelerating expansion of the Universe , discovered in 1997, so Narilkar proposed another model in 2002.

[ 12 ] These alternative cosmology models did not receive widespread support.

Narlikar worked with Wickramasinghe, Hoyle and other collaborators on a high-altitude balloon flight that collected samples of microorganisms from the stratosphere , at altitudes up to 41 km.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Narlikar married Mangala Narlikar (née Rajwade), a mathematics researcher and professor. The couple had three daughters: Geeta, a biomedical researcher at the University of California, San Francisco , Girija and Leelavati who both work in computer science.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] He was the uncle of Amrita Narlikar , a social sciences academic at Cambridge University.

[ citation needed ] His wife, Mangala, died on 17 July 2023.

[ 17 ] Narlikar died on 20 May 2025, at the age of 87.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Honours [ edit ] Narlikar received many national and international awards and honorary doctorates. India's second-highest civilian honour, Padma Vibhushan , was awarded to him in 2004 for his research work.

[ 20 ] Prior to this, in 1965, he was conferred Padma Bhushan .

[ 20 ] He was awarded 'Rashtra Bhushan' in 1981 by FIE Foundation , Ichalkaranji .

[ 21 ] He received Maharashtra Bhushan Award for the year 2010.

[ 22 ] He was a recipient of Bhatnagar Award , M.P. Birla Award, and the Prix Jules Janssen of the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society). He was an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of London , and a Fellow of the three Indian National Science Academies and the Third World Academy of Sciences . Apart from his scientific research, Narlikar was well known as a communicator of science through his books, articles, and radio and television programmes. For these efforts, he was honoured in 1996 by UNESCO with the Kalinga Prize .

[ 23 ] He was featured on Carl Sagan 's TV show Cosmos: A Personal Voyage in the late 1980s. In 1989, he received the Atmaram Award by Central Hindi Directorate .

[ 24 ] He received the Indira Gandhi Award of the Indian National Science Academy in 1990.

[ 25 ] He also served on the Physical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2009.

[ 26 ] In 2014, he received a Sahitya Akademi Award for his autobiography in Marathi, Chaar Nagarantale Maze Vishwa .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] He presided over the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan held at Nashik in January 2021.

[ 29 ] In 1960, he won the Tyson Medal for astronomy.

[ citation needed ] During his doctoral studies at Cambridge, he won the Smith's Prize in 1962.

[ citation needed ] Books [ edit ] Besides scientific papers and books and popular science literature, Narlikar wrote science fiction, novels, and short stories in English, Hindi , and Marathi . He was also the consultant for the Science and Mathematics textbooks of NCERT ( National Council of Educational Research and Training , India).
