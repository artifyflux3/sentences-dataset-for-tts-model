Germ cells are set aside in the embryo at the blastula stage, and are incorporated into the gonads during organogenesis . The germ layers form during the gastrulation of the blastula. The term triploblast may refer to any egg cell in which the blastoderm splits into three layers.

[ 1 ] All bilaterians , which are the animals with bilaterally symmetrical embryos, are triploblastic. Other animal taxa, namely the ctenophores , placozoans , and cnidarians , are diploblastic , which means that their embryos contain only two germ layers.

Sponges are even less developmentally specialized, because they lack both true tissues [ 2 ] and organs .

[ 3 ] The earliest triploblasts are thought to have evolved from the diploblasts at some time during the Proterozoic era, establishing themselves as a group prior to their diversification during the Cambrian explosion .
