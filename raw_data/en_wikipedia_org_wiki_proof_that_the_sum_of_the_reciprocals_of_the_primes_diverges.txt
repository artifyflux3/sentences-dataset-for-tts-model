All instances of log( x ) without a subscript base should be interpreted as a natural logarithm , also commonly written as ln( x ) or log e ( x ) .

The sum of the reciprocal of the primes increasing without bound. The x axis is in log scale, showing that the divergence is very slow. The blue function is a lower bound that also diverges.

The sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers diverges ; that is: ∑ ∑ p prime 1 p = 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 11 + 1 13 + 1 17 + ⋯ ⋯ = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sum _{p{\text{ prime}}}{\frac {1}{p}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{5}}+{\frac {1}{7}}+{\frac {1}{11}}+{\frac {1}{13}}+{\frac {1}{17}}+\cdots =\infty } This was proved by Leonhard Euler in 1737, [ 1 ] and strengthens Euclid 's 3rd-century-BC result that there are infinitely many prime numbers and Nicole Oresme 's 14th-century proof of the divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the integers (harmonic series) .

There are a variety of proofs of Euler's result, including a lower bound for the partial sums stating that ∑ ∑ p prime p ≤ ≤ n 1 p ≥ ≥ log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ ( n + 1 ) − − log ⁡ ⁡ π π 2 6 {\displaystyle \sum _{\scriptstyle p{\text{ prime}} \atop \scriptstyle p\leq n}{\frac {1}{p}}\geq \log \log(n+1)-\log {\frac {\pi ^{2}}{6}}} for all natural numbers n . The double natural logarithm ( log log ) indicates that the divergence might be very slow, which is indeed the case.

See also: Meissel–Mertens constant The harmonic series [ edit ] First, we will describe how Euler originally discovered the result. He was considering the harmonic series ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + ⋯ ⋯ = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n}}=1+{\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{4}}+\cdots =\infty } He had already used the following " product formula " to show the existence of infinitely many primes.

∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n = ∏ ∏ p ( 1 + 1 p + 1 p 2 + ⋯ ⋯ ) = ∏ ∏ p 1 1 − − p − − 1 {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n}}=\prod _{p}\left(1+{\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{p^{2}}}+\cdots \right)=\prod _{p}{\frac {1}{1-p^{-1}}}} Here the product is taken over the set of all primes.

Such infinite products are today called Euler products . The product above is a reflection of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . Euler noted that if there were only a finite number of primes, then the product on the right would clearly converge, contradicting the divergence of the harmonic series.

Proofs [ edit ] Euler's proof [ edit ] Euler's proof works by first taking the natural logarithm of each side, then using the Taylor series expansion for log x as well as the sum of a converging series: log ⁡ ⁡ ( ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n ) = log ⁡ ⁡ ( ∏ ∏ p 1 1 − − p − − 1 ) = − − ∑ ∑ p log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − 1 p ) = ∑ ∑ p ( 1 p + 1 2 p 2 + 1 3 p 3 + ⋯ ⋯ ) = ∑ ∑ p 1 p + 1 2 ∑ ∑ p 1 p 2 + 1 3 ∑ ∑ p 1 p 3 + 1 4 ∑ ∑ p 1 p 4 + ⋯ ⋯ = A + 1 2 B + 1 3 C + 1 4 D + ⋯ ⋯ = A + K {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\log \left(\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n}}\right)&{}=\log \left(\prod _{p}{\frac {1}{1-p^{-1}}}\right)=-\sum _{p}\log \left(1-{\frac {1}{p}}\right)\\[5pt]&=\sum _{p}\left({\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{2p^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{3p^{3}}}+\cdots \right)\\[5pt]&=\sum _{p}{\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{p}{\frac {1}{p^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{3}}\sum _{p}{\frac {1}{p^{3}}}+{\frac {1}{4}}\sum _{p}{\frac {1}{p^{4}}}+\cdots \\[5pt]&=A+{\frac {1}{2}}B+{\frac {1}{3}}C+{\frac {1}{4}}D+\cdots \\[5pt]&=A+K\end{aligned}}} for a fixed constant K < 1 . Then, by using the following relation: ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n = log ⁡ ⁡ ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n}}=\log \infty ,} of which, as shown in a later 1748 work, [ 2 ] the right hand side can be obtained by setting x = 1 in the Taylor series expansion log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 1 − − x ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ x n n .

{\displaystyle \log \left({\frac {1}{1-x}}\right)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n}}.} Thus, A = 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 5 + 1 7 + 1 11 + ⋯ ⋯ = log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{5}}+{\frac {1}{7}}+{\frac {1}{11}}+\cdots =\log \log \infty .} It is almost certain that Euler meant that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes less than n is asymptotic to log log n as n approaches infinity. It turns out this is indeed the case, and a more precise version of this fact was rigorously proved by Franz Mertens in 1874.

[ 3 ] Thus Euler obtained a correct result by questionable means.

Erdős's proof by upper and lower estimates [ edit ] The following proof by contradiction comes from Paul Erdős .

Let p i denote the i th prime number.  Assume that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges .

Then there exists a smallest positive integer k such that ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 ∞ ∞ 1 p i < 1 2 ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \sum _{i=k+1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{p_{i}}}<{\frac {1}{2}}\qquad (1)} For a positive integer x , let M x denote the set of those n in {1, 2, ..., x } which are not divisible by any prime greater than p k (or equivalently all n ≤ x which are a product of powers of primes p i ≤ p k ). We will now derive an upper and a lower estimate for | M x | , the number of elements in M x . For large x , these bounds will turn out to be contradictory.

Upper estimate Every n in M x can be written as n = m 2 r with positive integers m and r , where r is square-free . Since only the k primes p 1 , ..., p k can show up (with exponent 1) in the prime factorization of r , there are at most 2 k different possibilities for r . Furthermore, there are at most √ x possible values for m . This gives us the upper estimate | M x | ≤ ≤ 2 k x ( 2 ) {\displaystyle |M_{x}|\leq 2^{k}{\sqrt {x}}\qquad (2)} Lower estimate The remaining x − | M x | numbers in the set difference {1, 2, ..., x } \ M x are all divisible by a prime greater than p k . Let N i , x denote the set of those n in {1, 2, ..., x } which are divisible by the i th prime p i . Then { 1 , 2 , … … , x } ∖ ∖ M x = ⋃ ⋃ i = k + 1 ∞ ∞ N i , x {\displaystyle \{1,2,\ldots ,x\}\setminus M_{x}=\bigcup _{i=k+1}^{\infty }N_{i,x}} Since the number of integers in N i , x is at most ⁠ x / p i ⁠ (actually zero for p i > x ), we get x − − | M x | ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 ∞ ∞ | N i , x | < ∑ ∑ i = k + 1 ∞ ∞ x p i {\displaystyle x-|M_{x}|\leq \sum _{i=k+1}^{\infty }|N_{i,x}|<\sum _{i=k+1}^{\infty }{\frac {x}{p_{i}}}} Using (1), this implies x 2 < | M x | ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {x}{2}}<|M_{x}|\qquad (3)} This produces a contradiction: when x ≥ 2 2 k + 2 , the estimates (2) and (3) cannot both hold, because ⁠ x / 2 ⁠ ≥ 2 k √ x .

Proof that the series exhibits log-log growth [ edit ] Here is another proof that actually gives a lower estimate for the partial sums; in particular, it shows that these sums grow at least as fast as log log n . The proof is due to Ivan Niven, [ 4 ] adapted from the product expansion idea of Euler .  In the following, a sum or product taken over p always represents a sum or product taken over a specified set of primes.

The proof rests upon the following four inequalities: Every positive integer i can be uniquely expressed as the product of a square-free integer and a square as a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . Start with i = q 1 2 α α 1 + β β 1 ⋅ ⋅ q 2 2 α α 2 + β β 2 ⋯ ⋯ q r 2 α α r + β β r , {\displaystyle i=q_{1}^{2{\alpha }_{1}+{\beta }_{1}}\cdot q_{2}^{2{\alpha }_{2}+{\beta }_{2}}\cdots q_{r}^{2{\alpha }_{r}+{\beta }_{r}},} where the β s are 0 (the corresponding power of prime q is even) or 1 (the corresponding power of prime q is odd). Factor out one copy of all the primes whose β is 1, leaving a product of primes to even powers, itself a square. Relabeling: i = ( p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p s ) ⋅ ⋅ b 2 , {\displaystyle i=(p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{s})\cdot b^{2},} where the first factor, a product of primes to the first power, is square free. Inverting all the i s gives the inequality ∑ ∑ i = 1 n 1 i ≤ ≤ ( ∏ ∏ p ≤ ≤ n ( 1 + 1 p ) ) ⋅ ⋅ ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 n 1 k 2 ) = A ⋅ ⋅ B .

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{i}}\leq \left(\prod _{p\leq n}\left(1+{\frac {1}{p}}\right)\right)\cdot \left(\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{k^{2}}}\right)=A\cdot B.} To see this, note that 1 i = 1 p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p s ⋅ ⋅ 1 b 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{i}}={\frac {1}{p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{s}}}\cdot {\frac {1}{b^{2}}},} and ( 1 + 1 p 1 ) ( 1 + 1 p 2 ) … … ( 1 + 1 p s ) = ( 1 p 1 ) ( 1 p 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( 1 p s ) + … … = 1 p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p s + … … .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(1+{\frac {1}{p_{1}}}\right)\left(1+{\frac {1}{p_{2}}}\right)\ldots \left(1+{\frac {1}{p_{s}}}\right)&=\left({\frac {1}{p_{1}}}\right)\left({\frac {1}{p_{2}}}\right)\cdots \left({\frac {1}{p_{s}}}\right)+\ldots \\&={\frac {1}{p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{s}}}+\ldots .\end{aligned}}} That is, 1 / ( p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p s ) {\displaystyle 1/(p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{s})} is one of the summands in the expanded product A . And since 1 / b 2 {\displaystyle 1/b^{2}} is one of the summands of B , every summand 1 / i {\displaystyle 1/i} is represented in one of the terms of AB when multiplied out. The inequality follows.

The upper estimate for the natural logarithm log ⁡ ⁡ ( n + 1 ) = ∫ ∫ 1 n + 1 d x x = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∫ ∫ i i + 1 d x x ⏟ ⏟ < 1 i < ∑ ∑ i = 1 n 1 i {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\log(n+1)&=\int _{1}^{n+1}{\frac {dx}{x}}\\&=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\underbrace {\int _{i}^{i+1}{\frac {dx}{x}}} _{{}\,<\,{\frac {1}{i}}}\\&<\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{i}}\end{aligned}}} The lower estimate 1 + x < exp( x ) for the exponential function , which holds for all x > 0 .

Let n ≥ 2 .  The upper bound (using a telescoping sum ) for the partial sums (convergence is all we really need) ∑ ∑ k = 1 n 1 k 2 < 1 + ∑ ∑ k = 2 n ( 1 k − − 1 2 − − 1 k + 1 2 ) ⏟ ⏟ = 1 k 2 − − 1 4 > 1 k 2 = 1 + 2 3 − − 1 n + 1 2 < 5 3 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{k^{2}}}&<1+\sum _{k=2}^{n}\underbrace {\left({\frac {1}{k-{\frac {1}{2}}}}-{\frac {1}{k+{\frac {1}{2}}}}\right)} _{=\,{\frac {1}{k^{2}-{\frac {1}{4}}}}\,>\,{\frac {1}{k^{2}}}}\\&=1+{\frac {2}{3}}-{\frac {1}{n+{\frac {1}{2}}}}<{\frac {5}{3}}\end{aligned}}} Combining all these inequalities, we see that log ⁡ ⁡ ( n + 1 ) < ∑ ∑ i = 1 n 1 i ≤ ≤ ∏ ∏ p ≤ ≤ n ( 1 + 1 p ) ∑ ∑ k = 1 n 1 k 2 < 5 3 ∏ ∏ p ≤ ≤ n exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 p ) = 5 3 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ∑ ∑ p ≤ ≤ n 1 p ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\log(n+1)&<\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{i}}\\&\leq \prod _{p\leq n}\left(1+{\frac {1}{p}}\right)\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\frac {1}{k^{2}}}\\&<{\frac {5}{3}}\prod _{p\leq n}\exp \left({\frac {1}{p}}\right)\\&={\frac {5}{3}}\exp \left(\sum _{p\leq n}{\frac {1}{p}}\right)\end{aligned}}} Dividing through by ⁠ 5 / 3 ⁠ and taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ ( n + 1 ) − − log ⁡ ⁡ 5 3 < ∑ ∑ p ≤ ≤ n 1 p {\displaystyle \log \log(n+1)-\log {\frac {5}{3}}<\sum _{p\leq n}{\frac {1}{p}}} as desired.

Q.E.D.

Using ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 k 2 = π π 2 6 {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{k^{2}}}={\frac {\pi ^{2}}{6}}} (see the Basel problem ), the above constant log ⁠ 5 / 3 ⁠ = 0.51082...

; in fact it turns out that lim n → → ∞ ∞ ( ∑ ∑ p ≤ ≤ n 1 p − − log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n ) = M {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\left(\sum _{p\leq n}{\frac {1}{p}}-\log \log n\right)=M} where M = 0.261497...

is the Meissel–Mertens constant (somewhat analogous to the much more famous Euler–Mascheroni constant ).

Proof from Dusart's inequality [ edit ] From Dusart's inequality , we get p n < n log ⁡ ⁡ n + n log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n for n ≥ ≥ 6 {\displaystyle p_{n}<n\log n+n\log \log n\quad {\mbox{for }}n\geq 6} Then ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 p n ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ n = 6 ∞ ∞ 1 p n ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ n = 6 ∞ ∞ 1 n log ⁡ ⁡ n + n log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ n = 6 ∞ ∞ 1 2 n log ⁡ ⁡ n = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{p_{n}}}&\geq \sum _{n=6}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{p_{n}}}\\&\geq \sum _{n=6}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n\log n+n\log \log n}}\\&\geq \sum _{n=6}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{2n\log n}}=\infty \end{aligned}}} by the integral test for convergence . This shows that the series on the left diverges.

Geometric and harmonic-series proof [ edit ] The following proof is modified from James A. Clarkson .

[ 5 ] Define the k -th tail x k = ∑ ∑ n = k + 1 ∞ ∞ 1 p n .

{\displaystyle x_{k}=\sum _{n=k+1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{p_{n}}}.} Then for i ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle i\geq 0} , the expansion of ( x k ) i {\displaystyle (x_{k})^{i}} contains at least one term for each reciprocal of a positive integer with exactly i {\displaystyle i} prime factors (counting multiplicities) only from the set { p k + 1 , p k + 2 , ⋯ ⋯ } {\displaystyle \{p_{k+1},p_{k+2},\cdots \}} . It follows that the geometric series ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ ( x k ) i {\textstyle \sum _{i=0}^{\infty }(x_{k})^{i}} contains at least one term for each reciprocal of a positive integer not divisible by any p n , n ≤ ≤ k {\displaystyle p_{n},n\leq k} . But since 1 + j ( p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p k ) {\displaystyle 1+j(p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{k})} always satisfies this criterion, ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ ( x k ) i > ∑ ∑ j = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 1 + j ( p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p k ) > 1 1 + p 1 p 2 ⋯ ⋯ p k ∑ ∑ j = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 j = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{\infty }(x_{k})^{i}>\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{1+j(p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{k})}}>{\frac {1}{1+p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{k}}}\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{j}}=\infty } by the divergence of the harmonic series . This shows that x k ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle x_{k}\geq 1} for all k {\displaystyle k} , and since the tails of a convergent series must themselves converge to zero, this proves divergence.

Partial sums [ edit ] While the partial sums of the reciprocals of the primes eventually exceed any integer value, they never equal an integer.

One proof [ 6 ] is by induction: The first partial sum is ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ , which has the form ⁠ odd / even ⁠ . If the n th partial sum (for n ≥ 1 ) has the form ⁠ odd / even ⁠ , then the ( n + 1) st sum is odd even + 1 p n + 1 = odd ⋅ ⋅ p n + 1 + even even ⋅ ⋅ p n + 1 = odd + even even = odd even {\displaystyle {\frac {\text{odd}}{\text{even}}}+{\frac {1}{p_{n+1}}}={\frac {{\text{odd}}\cdot p_{n+1}+{\text{even}}}{{\text{even}}\cdot p_{n+1}}}={\frac {{\text{odd}}+{\text{even}}}{\text{even}}}={\frac {\text{odd}}{\text{even}}}} as the ( n + 1) st prime p n + 1 is odd; since this sum also has an ⁠ odd / even ⁠ form, this partial sum cannot be an integer (because 2 divides the denominator but not the numerator), and the induction continues.

Another proof rewrites the expression for the sum of the first n reciprocals of primes (or indeed the sum of the reciprocals of any finite set of primes) in terms of the least common denominator , which is the product of all these primes. Then each of these primes divides all but one of the numerator terms and hence does not divide the numerator itself; but each prime does divide the denominator. Thus the expression is irreducible and is non-integer.
