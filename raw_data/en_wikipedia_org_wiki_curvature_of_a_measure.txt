( June 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , the curvature of a measure defined on the Euclidean plane R 2 is a quantification of how much the measure's "distribution of mass" is "curved". It is related to notions of curvature in geometry . In the form presented below, the concept was introduced in 1995 by the mathematician Mark S. Melnikov ; accordingly, it may be referred to as the Melnikov curvature or Menger-Melnikov curvature . Melnikov and Verdera (1995) established a powerful connection between the curvature of measures and the Cauchy kernel .

Definition [ edit ] Let μ be a Borel measure on the Euclidean plane R 2 . Given three (distinct) points x , y and z in R 2 , let R ( x , y , z ) be the radius of the Euclidean circle that joins all three of them, or +∞ if they are collinear . The Menger curvature c ( x , y , z ) is defined to be c ( x , y , z ) = 1 R ( x , y , z ) , {\displaystyle c(x,y,z)={\frac {1}{R(x,y,z)}},} with the natural convention that c ( x , y , z ) = 0 if x , y and z are collinear. It is also conventional to extend this definition by setting c ( x , y , z ) = 0 if any of the points x , y and z coincide. The Menger-Melnikov curvature c 2 ( μ ) of μ is defined to be c 2 ( μ μ ) = ∭ ∭ R 2 c ( x , y , z ) 2 d μ μ ( x ) d μ μ ( y ) d μ μ ( z ) .

{\displaystyle c^{2}(\mu )=\iiint _{\mathbb {R} ^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\mathrm {d} \mu (y)\mathrm {d} \mu (z).} More generally, for α ≥ 0, define c 2 α ( μ ) by c 2 α α ( μ μ ) = ∭ ∭ R 2 c ( x , y , z ) 2 α α d μ μ ( x ) d μ μ ( y ) d μ μ ( z ) .

{\displaystyle c^{2\alpha }(\mu )=\iiint _{\mathbb {R} ^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2\alpha }\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\mathrm {d} \mu (y)\mathrm {d} \mu (z).} One may also refer to the curvature of μ at a given point x : c 2 ( μ μ ; x ) = ∬ ∬ R 2 c ( x , y , z ) 2 d μ μ ( y ) d μ μ ( z ) , {\displaystyle c^{2}(\mu ;x)=\iint _{\mathbb {R} ^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (y)\mathrm {d} \mu (z),} in which case c 2 ( μ μ ) = ∫ ∫ R 2 c 2 ( μ μ ; x ) d μ μ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle c^{2}(\mu )=\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{2}}c^{2}(\mu ;x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x).} Examples [ edit ] The trivial measure has zero curvature.

A Dirac measure δ a supported at any point a has zero curvature.

If μ is any measure whose support is contained within a Euclidean line L , then μ has zero curvature. For example, one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on any line (or line segment) has zero curvature.

The Lebesgue measure defined on all of R 2 has infinite curvature.

If μ is the uniform one-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a circle C r or radius r , then μ has curvature 1/ r .

Relationship to the Cauchy kernel [ edit ] In this section, R 2 is thought of as the complex plane C . Melnikov and Verdera (1995) showed the precise relation of the boundedness of the Cauchy kernel to the curvature of measures. They proved that if there is some constant C 0 such that μ μ ( B r ( x ) ) ≤ ≤ C 0 r {\displaystyle \mu (B_{r}(x))\leq C_{0}r} for all x in C and all r > 0, then there is another constant C , depending only on C 0 , such that | 6 ∫ ∫ C | C ε ε ( μ μ ) ( z ) | 2 d μ μ ( z ) − − c ε ε 2 ( μ μ ) | ≤ ≤ C ‖ ‖ μ μ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \left|6\int _{\mathbb {C} }|{\mathcal {C}}_{\varepsilon }(\mu )(z)|^{2}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (z)-c_{\varepsilon }^{2}(\mu )\right|\leq C\|\mu \|} for all ε > 0. Here c ε denotes a truncated version of the Menger-Melnikov curvature in which the integral is taken only over those points x , y and z such that | x − − y | > ε ε ; {\displaystyle |x-y|>\varepsilon ;} | y − − z | > ε ε ; {\displaystyle |y-z|>\varepsilon ;} | z − − x | > ε ε .

{\displaystyle |z-x|>\varepsilon .} Similarly, C ε ε {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{\varepsilon }} denotes a truncated Cauchy integral operator: for a measure μ on C and a point z in C , define C ε ε ( μ μ ) ( z ) = ∫ ∫ 1 ξ ξ − − z d μ μ ( ξ ξ ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{\varepsilon }(\mu )(z)=\int {\frac {1}{\xi -z}}\,\mathrm {d} \mu (\xi ),} where the integral is taken over those points ξ in C with | ξ ξ − − z | > ε ε .

{\displaystyle |\xi -z|>\varepsilon .} References [ edit ] Mel'nikov, Mark S. (1995). "Analytic capacity: a discrete approach and the curvature of measure".
