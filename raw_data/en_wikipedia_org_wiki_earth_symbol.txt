A circle representing the round world, with the rivers of Garden of Eden separating the four corners of the world , or rotated 45¬∞ to suggest the four continents , remains a common pictographic convention to express the notion of "worldwide". The current astronomical symbols for the planet are a circle with an intersecting cross, , [ 1 ] and a globus cruciger , . Although the International Astronomical Union (IAU) now discourages the use of planetary symbols , this is an exception, being used in abbreviations such as M üú® or M ‚ôÅ for Earth mass .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The earliest type of symbols are allegories , personifications or deifications, mostly in the form of an Earth goddess (in the case of Egyptian mythology a god, Geb ).

[ 3 ] Before the recognition of the spherical shape of the Earth in the Hellenistic period , the main attribute of the Earth was its being flat .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Egyptian hieroglyph for "earth, land" depicts a stretch of flat alluvial land with grains of sand ( Gardiner N16: ìáæ). The Sumerian cuneiform sign for "earth, place" KI (íÜ†) originates as a picture of a "threshing floor", and the Chinese character (Âúü) originated as a lump of clay on a potting wheel.

Earth, the classical element [ edit ] In Chinese mysticism, the classical element "Earth" is represented by the trigram of three broken lines in the I Ching (‚ò∑).

[ 6 ] The Western (early modern) alchemical symbol for earth is a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line (üúÉ).

[ 7 ] Other symbols for the earth in alchemy or mysticism include the square and the serpent .

[ 8 ] The planet [ edit ] In the Roman period , the globe , a representation of the spherical Earth, became the main symbol representing the concept.
The globe depicted the "universe" (pictured as the celestial sphere ) as well as the Earth.

[ 9 ] 12th-century T-and-O representation of the world.

Byzantine Solidus coin with a Byzantine Emperor holding a globus cruciger in his right hand.

The globus cruciger (‚ôÅ) is the globe surmounted by a Christian cross , held by Byzantine Emperors on the one hand to represent the Christian ecumene , on the other hand the akakia represented the mortal nature of all men.

In the medieval period, the known world was also represented by the T-and-O figure, representing an extremely simplified world map of the three classical continents of the Old World , viz.

Asia , Europe and Africa (in various orientations: , , , ).
