Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and will occur later in the red frame.

Events A, B, and C occur in different order depending on the motion of the observer. The white line represents a plane of simultaneity being moved from the past to the future.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), the **relativity of simultaneity** is the concept that _distant [simultaneity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simultaneity "wikt:simultaneity")_– whether two spatially separated events occur at the same [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics")– is not [absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_time_and_space "Absolute time and space"), but depends on the [observer's reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer%27s_reference_frame "Observer's reference frame"). This possibility was raised by mathematician [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") in 1900, and thereafter became a central idea in the [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity").

According to the special theory of relativity introduced by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), it is impossible to say in an _absolute_ sense that two distinct [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(relativity) "Event (relativity)") occur at the same time if those events are separated in space. If one reference frame assigns precisely the same time to two events that are at different points in space, a reference frame that is moving relative to the first will generally assign different times to the two events (the only exception being when motion is exactly perpendicular to the line connecting the locations of both events).

For example, a car crash in London and another in New York that appear to happen at the same time to an observer on Earth will appear to have occurred at slightly different times to an observer on an airplane flying between London and New York. Furthermore, if the two events cannot be causally connected, depending on the state of motion, the crash in London may appear to occur first in a given frame, and the New York crash may appear to occur first in another. However, if the events can be causally connected, precedence order is preserved in all frames of reference.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-1)

In 1892 and 1895, [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz") used a mathematical method called "local time" _t' = t – v x/c_ 2 for explaining the negative [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether") drift experiments.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-2) However, Lorentz gave no physical explanation of this effect. This was done by [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") who already emphasized in 1898 the conventional nature of simultaneity and who argued that it is convenient to postulate the constancy of the speed of light in all directions. However, this paper did not contain any discussion of Lorentz's theory or the possible difference in defining simultaneity for observers in different states of motion.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-4) This was done in 1900, when Poincaré derived local time by assuming that the speed of light is invariant within the aether. Due to the "principle of relative motion", moving observers within the aether also assume that they are at rest and that the speed of light is constant in all directions (only to first order in _v/c_). Therefore, if they synchronize their clocks by using light signals, they will only consider the transit time for the signals, but not their motion in respect to the aether. So the moving clocks are not synchronous and do not indicate the "true" time. Poincaré calculated that this synchronization error corresponds to Lorentz's local time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-6) In 1904, Poincaré emphasized the connection between the principle of relativity, "local time", and light speed invariance; however, the reasoning in that paper was presented in a qualitative and conjectural manner.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-8)

[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") used a similar method in 1905 to derive the time transformation for all orders in _v/c_, i.e., the complete Lorentz transformation. Poincaré obtained the full transformation earlier in 1905 but in the papers of that year he did not mention his synchronization procedure. This derivation was completely based on light speed invariance and the relativity principle, so Einstein noted that for the electrodynamics of moving bodies the aether is superfluous. Thus, the separation into "true" and "local" times of Lorentz and Poincaré vanishes– all times are equally valid and therefore the relativity of length and time is a natural consequence.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-11)

In 1908, [Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski") introduced the concept of a [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line "World line") of a particle[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-12) in his model of the cosmos called [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"). In Minkowski's view, the naïve notion of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") is replaced with [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity"), and the ordinary sense of simultaneity becomes dependent on [hyperbolic orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_orthogonality "Hyperbolic orthogonality") of spatial directions to the worldline associated to the rapidity. Then every [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") has a rapidity and a [simultaneous hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line#Simultaneous_hyperplane "World line").

In 1990, [Robert Goldblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goldblatt "Robert Goldblatt") wrote _Orthogonality and Spacetime Geometry_, directly addressing the structure Minkowski had put in place for simultaneity.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-13) In 2006, [Max Jammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Jammer "Max Jammer"), through [Project MUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MUSE "Project MUSE"), published _Concepts of Simultaneity: from antiquity to Einstein and beyond_. The book culminates in chapter 6, "The transition to the relativistic conception of simultaneity". Jammer indicates that [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach "Ernst Mach") demythologized the absolute time of Newtonian physics.

Naturally the mathematical notions preceded physical interpretation. For instance, [conjugate diameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_diameters "Conjugate diameters") of [conjugate hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_hyperbola "Conjugate hyperbola") are related as space and time. The [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity") can be expressed as the arbitrariness of which pair are taken to represent space and time in a plane.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-14)

Thought experiments
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relativity_of_simultaneity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Thought experiments")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Einstein_train_relativity_of_simultaneity.png/250px-Einstein_train_relativity_of_simultaneity.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein_train_relativity_of_simultaneity.png)

Einstein imagined a stationary observer who witnessed two lightning bolts simultaneously striking both ends of a moving train. He concluded that an observer standing on the train would measure the bolts to strike at different times.

Einstein's version of the experiment[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-Einsteins_train-15) presumed that one observer was sitting midway inside a speeding traincar and another was standing on a platform as the train moved past. As measured by the standing observer, the train is struck by two bolts of lightning simultaneously, but at different positions along the axis of train movement (back and front of the train car). In the inertial frame of the standing observer, there are three events which are spatially dislocated, but simultaneous: standing observer facing the moving observer (i.e., the center of the train), lightning striking the front of the train car, and lightning striking the back of the car.

Since the events are placed along the axis of train movement, their time coordinates become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's inertial frame. Events which occurred at space coordinates in the direction of train movement happen _earlier_ than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of train movement. In the moving train's inertial frame, this means that lightning will strike the front of the train car _before_ the two observers align (face each other).

### The train-and-platform

Reference frame of an observer standing on the platform (length contraction not depicted)

A popular picture for understanding this idea is provided by a thought experiment similar to those suggested by [Daniel Frost Comstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Frost_Comstock "Daniel Frost Comstock") in 1910[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-16) and Einstein in 1917.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-17)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-Einsteins_train-15) It also consists of one observer midway inside a speeding traincar and another observer standing on a platform as the train moves past.

A flash of light is given off at the center of the traincar just as the two observers pass each other. For the observer on board the train, the front and back of the traincar are at fixed distances from the light source and as such, according to this observer, the light will reach the front and back of the traincar at the same time.

For the observer standing on the platform, on the other hand, the rear of the traincar is moving (catching up) toward the point at which the flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is, according to the second [postulate of special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulates_of_special_relativity#Postulates_of_special_relativity "Postulates of special relativity"), same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light will strike the ends of the traincar at different times.

The spacetime diagram in the frame of the observer on the train

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/TrainAndPlatformDiagram2.svg/250px-TrainAndPlatformDiagram2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TrainAndPlatformDiagram2.svg)

The same diagram in the frame of an observer who sees the train moving to the right

It may be helpful to visualize this situation using [spacetime diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram "Spacetime diagram"). For a given observer, the _t_-axis is defined to be a point traced out in time by the origin of the spatial coordinate _x_, and is drawn vertically. The _x_-axis is defined as the set of all points in space at the time _t_ = 0, and is drawn horizontally. The statement that the speed of light is the same for all observers is represented by drawing a light ray as a 45° line, regardless of the speed of the source relative to the speed of the observer.

In the first diagram, the two ends of the train are drawn as grey lines. Because the ends of the train are stationary with respect to the observer on the train, these lines are just vertical lines, showing their motion through time but not space. The flash of light is shown as the 45° red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of the train are at the same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous.

In the second diagram, the two ends of the train moving to the right, are shown by parallel lines. The flash of light is given off at a point exactly halfway between the two ends of the train, and again form two 45° lines, expressing the constancy of the speed of light. In this picture, however, the points at which the light flashes hit the ends of the train are _not_ at the same level; they are _not_ simultaneous.

Lorentz transformation
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relativity_of_simultaneity&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lorentz transformation")]

The relativity of simultaneity can be demonstrated using the Lorentz transformation, which relates the coordinates used by one observer to coordinates used by another in uniform relative motion with respect to the first.

Assume that the first observer uses coordinates labeled _t_, _x_, _y_, and _z_, while the second observer uses coordinates labeled _t′_, _x′_, _y′_, and _z′_. Now suppose that the first observer sees the second observer moving in the _x_-direction at a velocity _v_. And suppose that the observers' coordinate axes are parallel and that they have the same origin. Then the Lorentz transformation expresses how the coordinates are related: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle t'={\frac {t-{v\,x/c^{2}}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/798061909b6ceb7f04b6d98e813bcb65380f5c6f)![Image 10: {\displaystyle x'={\frac {x-v\,t}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61e1640a844869189560d28f0ef887c03d014d0d)![Image 11: {\displaystyle y'=y\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1aacab207d1fe8c407abd11907187abc61a8eeae)![Image 12: {\displaystyle z'=z\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/311ca6193d0a8eaf4218bf4d96d2c80ac9f4a068) where _c_ is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). If two events happen at the same time in the frame of the first observer, they will have identical values of the _t_-coordinate. However, if they have different values of the _x_-coordinate (different positions in the _x_-direction), they will have different values of the _t'_ coordinate, so they will happen at different times in that frame. The term that accounts for the failure of absolute simultaneity is the _vx_/_c_ 2.

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Simultaneity_Lines.svg/250px-Simultaneity_Lines.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simultaneity_Lines.svg)

A spacetime diagram showing the set of points regarded as simultaneous by a stationary observer (horizontal dotted line) and the set of points regarded as simultaneous by an observer moving at v = 0.25c (dashed line)

The equation _t′_ = constant defines a "line of simultaneity" in the (_x′_, _t′_) coordinate system for the second (moving) observer, just as the equation _t_ = constant defines the "line of simultaneity" for the first (stationary) observer in the (_x_, _t_) coordinate system. From the above equations for the Lorentz transform it can be seen that _t'_ is constant if and only if _t_ − _vx_/_c_ 2 = constant. Thus the set of points that make _t_ constant are different from the set of points that makes _t'_ constant. That is, the set of events which are regarded as simultaneous depends on the frame of reference used to make the comparison.

Graphically, this can be represented on a spacetime diagram by the fact that a plot of the set of points regarded as simultaneous generates a line which depends on the observer. In the spacetime diagram, the dashed line represents a set of points considered to be simultaneous with the origin by an observer moving with a velocity _v_ of one-quarter of the speed of light. The dotted horizontal line represents the set of points regarded as simultaneous with the origin by a stationary observer. This diagram is drawn using the (_x_, _t_) coordinates of the stationary observer, and is scaled so that the speed of light is one, i.e., so that a ray of light would be represented by a line with a 45° angle from the _x_ axis. From our previous analysis, given that _v_ = 0.25 and _c_ = 1, the equation of the dashed line of simultaneity is _t_ − 0.25 _x_ = 0 and with _v_ = 0, the equation of the dotted line of simultaneity is _t_ = 0.

In general the second observer traces out a [worldline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldline "Worldline") in the spacetime of the first observer described by _t_ = _x_/_v_, and the set of simultaneous events for the second observer (at the origin) is described by the line _t_ = _vx_. Note the [multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") relation of the [slopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the worldline and simultaneous events, in accord with the principle of [hyperbolic orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_orthogonality "Hyperbolic orthogonality").

Accelerated observers

Roundtrip radar-time isocontours

The Lorentz-transform calculation above uses a definition of extended-simultaneity (i.e. of when and where events occur _at which you were not present_) that might be referred to as the co-moving or "tangent free-float-frame" definition. This definition is naturally extrapolated to events in gravitationally-curved spacetimes, and to accelerated observers, through use of a radar-time/distance definition that (unlike the tangent free-float-frame definition for accelerated frames) assigns a unique time and position to any event.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#cite_note-Dolby2001-18)

The radar-time definition of extended-simultaneity further facilitates visualization of the way that acceleration curves spacetime for travelers in the absence of any gravitating objects. This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by a traveler (red trajectory) taking a constant [proper-acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration "Proper acceleration") roundtrip. One caveat of this approach is that the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to reach our traveler.
