The columns represent the groups . Groups 1, 2 and 13 to 18 constitute the main group. Sometimes groups 3 and 12, as well as the lanthanides and actinides (the two rows at the bottom), are also included in the main group.

In chemistry and atomic physics , the main group is the group of elements (sometimes called the representative elements ) whose lightest members are represented by helium , lithium , beryllium , boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and fluorine as arranged in the periodic table of the elements. The main group includes the elements (except hydrogen , which is sometimes not included [ citation needed ] ) in groups 1 and 2 ( s-block ), and groups 13 to 18 ( p-block ). The s-block elements are primarily characterised by one main oxidation state, and the p-block elements, when they have multiple oxidation states, often have common oxidation states separated by two units.

Main-group elements (with some of the lighter transition metals ) are the most abundant elements on Earth , in the Solar System , and in the universe .

Group 12 elements are often considered to be transition metals; however, zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) share some properties of both groups, and some scientists believe they should be included in the main group.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Occasionally, even the group 3 elements as well as the lanthanides and actinides have been included, because especially the group 3 elements and many lanthanides are electropositive elements with only one main oxidation state like the group 1 and 2 elements. The position of the actinides is more questionable, but the most common and stable of them, thorium (Th) and uranium (U), are similar to main-group elements as thorium is an electropositive element with only one main oxidation state (+4), and uranium has two main ones separated by two oxidation units (+4 and +6).

[ 3 ] In older nomenclature, the main-group elements are groups IA and IIA, and groups IIIB to 0 (CAS groups IIIA to VIIIA). Group 12 is labelled as group IIB in both systems. Group 3 is labelled as group IIIA in the older nomenclature (CAS group IIIB).In the Uranium has two main ones separated by two oxidation units  (+4 and +6) See also [ edit ] Abundance of elements in Earth's crust Main group organometallic chemistry References [ edit ] ^ "Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry" .
