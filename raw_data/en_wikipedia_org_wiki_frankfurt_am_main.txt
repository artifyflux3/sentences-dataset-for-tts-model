' Frank ford on the [ b ] Main ' ) is the most populous city in the German state of Hesse . Its 773,068 inhabitants as of 2022 make it the fifth-most populous city in Germany .

[ c ] Located in the foreland of the Taunus on its namesake Main , it forms a continuous conurbation with Offenbach am Main ; its urban area has a population of over 2.7 million. The city is the heart of the larger Rhine-Main metropolitan region, which has a population of more than 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region and the fourth largest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union (EU). Frankfurt is one of the de facto four main capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg ), as it is home to the European Central Bank , one of the institutional seats of the European Union, while Frankfurt's central business district lies about 90 km (56 mi) northwest of the geographic center of the EU at Gadheim in Lower Franconia . Like France and Franconia , the city is named after the Franks . Frankfurt is the largest city in the Rhenish Franconian dialect area.

Frankfurt was a city state , the Free City of Frankfurt , for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire , as a site of Imperial coronations ; it lost its sovereignty upon the collapse of the empire in 1806, regained it in 1815 and then lost it again in 1866, when it was annexed (though neutral) by the Kingdom of Prussia . It has been part of the state of Hesse since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of its young people, having a migrant background . A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many expatriates . In 2015, Frankfurt was home to 1,909 ultra high-net-worth individuals , the sixth-highest number of any city. As of 2023, Frankfurt is the 13th-wealthiest city in the world and the third-wealthiest city in Europe (after London and Paris ).

[ 8 ] Frankfurt is a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation, and is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters.

Its renowned cultural venues include the concert hall Alte Oper , continental Europe's largest English theater and many museums, 26 of which line up along the Museumsufer , including the Städel , Liebieghaus , German Film Museum , Senckenberg Natural Museum , Goethe House and Schirn art venue.

Frankfurt's skyline is shaped by some of Europe's tallest skyscrapers, which has led to the term Mainhattan .

Frankfurt is the seat of the German Football Association , is home to the first division association football club Eintracht Frankfurt , the Löwen Frankfurt ice hockey team, and the basketball club Frankfurt Skyliners , and is the venue of the Frankfurt Marathon and the Ironman Germany .

Distinctions [ edit ] Frankfurt is the largest financial hub in continental Europe . It is home to the European Central Bank , Deutsche Bundesbank , Frankfurt Stock Exchange and several large commercial banks. Frankfurt has many high-rise buildings that form its renowned Frankfurt skyline . In fact, it is one of the few cities in the European Union (EU) to have such a skyline.

[ 12 ] Frankfurt is considered a global city as listed by the GaWC group's 2012 inventory.

[ 13 ] Among global cities it was ranked tenth by the Global Power City Index 2011 and 11th by the Global City Competitiveness Index 2012 . Among financial hubs, the city was ranked eighth by the International Financial Centers Development Index 2013 and ninth in the 2013 Global Financial Centres Index .

Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international airports by passenger traffic and the main hub for Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa .

Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest rail stations in Europe and the busiest junction operated by Deutsche Bahn , the German national railway company, with 342 trains a day to domestic and European destinations.

[ 14 ] Frankfurter Kreuz , also known as the Autobahn interchange and located close to the airport, is the most-heavily used interchange in the EU, used by 320,000 cars daily.

[ 15 ] In 2011 human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Frankfurt as seventh in its annual 'Quality of Living' survey of cities around the world.

[ 16 ] According to The Economist cost-of-living survey, Frankfurt is Germany's most expensive city and the world's tenth most expensive.

[ 17 ] Etymology [ edit ] Frankonovurd (in Old High German ) or Vadum Francorum (in Latin ) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to Frankenfort during the Middle Ages and then to Franckfort and Franckfurth in the modern era . The name is derived from the Franconofurd of the Germanic tribe of the Franks ; Furt ( cf.

English ford ) where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.

"The Discovery of Frankfurt by Charlemagne" by Leopold Bode (1888) Thietmar of Merseburg in the 11th century reported a founding legend in which Charlemagne and his army of Franks discovered the ford at Frankfurt when a doe crossed over it, showing them the way; in honor of this the city was named "ford of the Franks".

By the 19th century, the name Frankfurt had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of Frankfort is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling, including Frankfort, Kentucky , Frankfort, New York , and Frankfort, Illinois .

The New York Times first used the Frankfurt spelling for Frankfurt am Main on 24 October 1953 and last used the Frankfort spelling on 10 June 1954.

The suffix am Main has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of Frankfurt am Main means "Frankfurt on the Main" (pronounced like English mine or German mein ). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: Furt ) on the river Main . As a part of early Franconia , the inhabitants were the early Franks , thus the city's name reveals its legacy as "the ford of the Franks on the Main".

[ 18 ] Among English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of Frankfurt an der Oder in the Land of Brandenburg on the Polish border.

The city district Bonames has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from bona me(n)sa (good table).

The common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are Frankfurt (Main) , Frankfurt (M) , Frankfurt a. M.

, Frankfurt/Main or Frankfurt/M . The common abbreviation for the name of the city is "FFM". Also in use is "FRA", the IATA code for Frankfurt Airport.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Frankfurt am Main For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Frankfurt .

Timeline of Frankfurt am Main historical affiliations Roman Empire , pre 475 Francia , ca. 475–843 East Francia , 843–962 Holy Roman Empire , 962–1806 Free City of Frankfurt , 1372–1806 Grand Duchy of Frankfurt , 1806–1813 Free City of Frankfurt , 1813–1866 Kingdom of Prussia , 1866–1918 German Empire , 1871–1918 Weimar Republic , 1918–1933 German Reich , 1933–1945 American occupation zone , 1945–1949 West Germany , 1949–1990 Germany , 1990–present Early history and Holy Roman Empire [ edit ] At the western borders of Frankfurt lies the Kapellenberg as part of the Taunus with one of the first Stone Age cities in Europe.

[ 19 ] The Celts had different settlements in the Taunus mountains north of Frankfurt, the biggest one the Heidetrank Oppidum . The first traces of Roman settlements established in the area of the river Nidda date to the reign of Emperor Vespasian in the years 69 to 79 AD.

Nida (modern Heddernheim , Praunheim ) was a Roman civitas capital ( Civitas Taunensium ).

Alemanni and Franks lived there , and by 794, Charlemagne presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which Franconofurd (alternative spellings end with -furt and -vurd) was first mentioned. It was one of the two capitals of Charlemagne's grandson Louis the German , together with Regensburg . Louis founded the collegiate church , rededicated in 1239 to Bartholomew the Apostle and now Frankfurt Cathedral .

[ 20 ] Frankfurt was one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire . From 855, the German kings were elected and crowned in Aachen . From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned and elected in Frankfurt, initiated for Maximilian II . This tradition ended in 1792, when Francis II was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on Bastille Day , 14 July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille . The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholomäus Cathedral , known as the Kaiserdom (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.

The Frankfurter Messe ('Frankfurt Trade Fair') was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380.

Book trade fairs began in 1478.

In 1372, Frankfurt became a Reichsstadt ( Imperial Free City ), i.e., directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.

In 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of exchange rates for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

Frankfurt managed to remain neutral during the Thirty Years' War , but suffered from the bubonic plague that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theater principal Abel Seyler was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.

[ 21 ] Frankfurt in 1612 Frankfurt in 1872 Kaiserplatz, c.

1880 Impact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars [ edit ] Following the French Revolution , Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a Free city until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the Fürstprimas ( Prince-Primate ), Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg . This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the Confederation of the Rhine . In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt .

Napoleon intended to make his adopted son Eugène de Beauharnais , already Prince de Venise (" prince of Venice ", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813 when the military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian-led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favor of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.

Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state [ edit ] After Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city-state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its Bundestag , the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian "presidential envoy".

After the ill-fated revolution of 1848 , Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament , which met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king, Frederick William IV , declared that he would not accept "a crown from the gutter".

Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty [ edit ] View of Frankfurt am Main , including the Alte Brücke (Old Bridge), by Gustave Courbet (1858) Frankfurt lost its independence following the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, when Prussia annexed several smaller states, including the Free City of Frankfurt . The city was subsequently incorporated into the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau . The occupation and annexation were widely regarded in Frankfurt as a grave injustice, yet the city retained its distinctly Western European, urban, and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in 1890.

In 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named Goethe University Frankfurt . This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.

From 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the Ruhr uprising , Frankfurt was occupied by French troops .

[ 22 ] The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarization of the Rhineland had been broken.

[ 23 ] In 1924, Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. During the Nazi era , the synagogues of the city were destroyed and the vast majority of the Jewish population fled or was killed.

[ 24 ] During World War II , Frankfurt was the location of a Nazi prison for underage girls with several forced labour camps, [ 25 ] a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see Romani Holocaust ), [ 26 ] the Dulag Luft West transit camp for Allied prisoners of war, [ 27 ] and a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp .

[ 28 ] Frankfurt was severely bombed in World War II (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous medieval city center , by that time one of the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a ground battlefield on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The 5th Infantry Division and the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.

[ 29 ] Frankfurt consists to over 40% of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.

[ 30 ] After the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. The city was part of the American Zone of Occupation of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building , intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.

Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of West Germany in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of Hessischer Rundfunk ). In the end, Konrad Adenauer , the first postwar Chancellor , preferred the town of Bonn , for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a reunification with East Germany and the eventual return of the capital to Berlin .

Postwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., Römer , St. Paul's Church , and Goethe House ). The collection of historically significant Cairo Genizah documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to Arabist and Genizah scholar S.D. Goitein , "not even handlists indicating its contents have survived." [ 31 ] The Frankfurt Parliament at St. Paul's Church in 1848 Aerial view of the cathedral in May 1945 Reconstruction (1981–1984) of six houses at the east side of the Römerberg which were destroyed in World War II The end of the war marked Frankfurt's comeback as Germany's leading financial hub, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into four sectors , could no longer rival it. In 1948, the Allies founded the Bank deutscher Länder , the forerunner of Deutsche Bundesbank . Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g.

Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank . In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.

Frankfurt also reemerged as Germany's transportation hub and Frankfurt Airport became Europe's second-busiest airport behind London Heathrow Airport in 1961.

During the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.

[ 32 ] That system includes a suburban rail system ( S-Bahn ) linking outlying communities with the city center, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ( U-Bahn ) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.

In 1998, the European Central Bank was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board in 2011.

Geography [ edit ] Frankfurt on the mouth of the Nidda into the Main , which flows into the Rhine between the Rhineland-Palatine capital of Mainz and the Hessian (historically Nassauian ) capital of Wiesbaden . Also visible the Taunus suburbs of the districts of High Taunus and Main-Taunus , two of the wealthiest districts in Germany.

Frankfurt as seen by the European Space Agency 's Sentinel-2A The central Innenstadt district, as seen by a SkySat satellite Frankfurt is the largest city in the state of Hesse in the western part of Germany.

Site [ edit ] Frankfurt is located on both sides of the river Main , south-east of the Taunus mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the Frankfurt City Forest , Germany's largest city forest. The city area is 248.31 km 2 (95.87 sq mi) and extends over 23.4 km (14.54 mi) east to west and 23.3 km (14.48 mi) north to south. Its downtown is north of the river Main in Altstadt district (the historical center) and the surrounding Innenstadt district. The geographical center is in Bockenheim district near Frankfurt West station .

Frankfurt at the heart of the densely populated Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region with a population of 5.5 million. Other important cities in the region are Wiesbaden (capital of Hesse ), Mainz (capital of Rhineland-Palatinate ), Darmstadt , Offenbach am Main , Hanau , Aschaffenburg , Bad Homburg vor der Höhe , Rüsselsheim , Wetzlar and Marburg .

Districts [ edit ] The 46 Stadtteile (city districts) of central Frankfurt, 2010 The city is divided into 46 city districts ( Stadtteile ), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs ( Stadtbezirke ) and 448 electoral districts ( Wahlbezirke ). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts ( Ortsbezirke ), which each have a district committee and chairperson.

The largest city district by population and area is Sachsenhausen , while the smallest is Altstadt , Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, Westend and Nordend ) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern ( -Nord ) and a southern ( -Süd ) part, respectively a western ( -West ) and an eastern ( -Ost ) part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city's official website).

[ 33 ] Some larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of Niederursel , Heddernheim and Praunheim ), Goldstein (part of Schwanheim ), Riedberg (part of Kalbach-Riedberg ) and Europaviertel (part of Gallus ). The Bankenviertel ( banking district ), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western Innenstadt district, the southern Westend district and the eastern Bahnhofsviertel district).

Many city districts are incorporated suburbs ( Vororte ) or were previously independent cities, such as Höchst . Some like Nordend and Westend arose during the rapid growth of the city in the Gründerzeit following the Unification of Germany , while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district(s), such as Dornbusch and Riederwald .

History of incorporations [ edit ] Until the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of Altstadt , Innenstadt , Bahnhofsviertel , Gutleutviertel , Gallus , Westend , Nordend , Ostend and Sachsenhausen .

Bornheim was part of an administrative district called Landkreis Frankfurt , before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by Bockenheim on 1 April 1895.

Seckbach , Niederrad and Oberrad followed on 1 July 1900. The Landkreis Frankfurt was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore Berkersheim , Bonames , Eckenheim , Eschersheim , Ginnheim , Hausen , Heddernheim , Niederursel , Praunheim , Preungesheim and Rödelheim joined the city. In the same year a new city district, Riederwald , was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.

On 1 April 1928 the City of Höchst became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts Sindlingen , Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim . Simultaneously the Landkreis Höchst was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ( Fechenheim , Griesheim , Nied , Schwanheim , Sossenheim ) or joining the newly established Landkreis of Main-Taunus-Kreis .

Dornbusch became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.

On 1 August 1972, Hesse's smaller suburbs of Harheim , Kalbach , Nieder-Erlenbach , and Nieder-Eschbach became districts while other neighboring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the Landkreis Offenbach , the Kreis Groß-Gerau , the Hochtaunuskreis , the Main-Kinzig-Kreis or the Wetteraukreis .

Bergen-Enkheim was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.

Flughafen became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighboring city of Mörfelden-Walldorf .

Frankfurt's youngest city district is Frankfurter Berg . It was part of Bonames until 1996.

Kalbach was officially renamed Kalbach-Riedberg in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.

Neighboring districts and cities [ edit ] Frankfurt urban area within Hesse To the west Frankfurt borders the administrative district ( Landkreis ) of Main-Taunus-Kreis with towns such as Hattersheim am Main , Kriftel , Hofheim am Taunus , Kelkheim , Liederbach am Taunus , Sulzbach , Schwalbach am Taunus and Eschborn ; to the northwest the Hochtaunuskreis with Steinbach , Oberursel (Taunus) and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe ; to the north the Wetteraukreis with Karben and Bad Vilbel ; to the northeast the Main-Kinzig-Kreis with Niederdorfelden and Maintal ; to the southeast the city of Offenbach am Main ; to the south the Kreis Offenbach with Neu-Isenburg and to the southwest the Kreis Groß-Gerau with Mörfelden-Walldorf , Rüsselsheim and Kelsterbach .

Together with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., Hanau , Rodgau , Dreieich , Langen ) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called Stadtregion Frankfurt which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3 million in 2010, and is the 13th-largest urban area in the EU .

Climate [ edit ] Frankfurt has a temperate oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb , Trewartha : Dobk ). Its climate features cool winters with frequent rain showers and overcast skies, and warm summers. The average annual temperature is 11.4 °C (52.5 °F), with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 2.7 °C (36.9 °F) in January to 20.8 °C (69.4 °F) in July. The city is one of the warmest in Germany in winter.

[ 34 ] The growing season is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region, with trees typically leafing out already toward the end of March.

Winters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year.

[ 35 ] The temperature falls below 0 °C on about 64 days and the daily maximum stays below freezing for about 10 days on average per year.

Because of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions in the vicinity such as Rhenish Hesse , Rheingau , Franconia (wine region) and Bergstraße (route) . There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the river Main which allows palms , fig trees , lemon trees and southern European plants to grow in that area. The area is called the " Nizza " (the German word for the southern French town Nice ) and is one of the biggest parks with Mediterranean vegetation north of the Alps .

Central Frankfurt has been a Großstadt (a city with at least 100,000 residents by definition) since 1875. With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before World War II . After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 813,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2035 [ 44 ] and more than 2.5 million inhabitants in its urban area.

As of 2015, Frankfurt had 1909 ultra high-net-worth individuals , the sixth-highest number of any city in the world.

[ 45 ] It is also the world's 14th-richest city by total wealth , as of 2017.

[ 46 ] During the 1970s, the state government of Hesse wanted to expand the city's administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.

[ 47 ] However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area.

Moroccan community [ edit ] Frankfurt has the largest Moroccan community in Germany, numbering about 8,000 people, and the Rhine-Main area has about 20,000. Many Moroccans came as guest workers in the 1970s. Today Frankfurt has many Moroccan restaurants, companies, shops, mosques and hamams. Due to the popularity of Moroccan culture in Frankfurt, it also led many people from the Maghreb and other African countries to move to Frankfurt. Famous singer Namika was born in Frankfurt to Moroccan parents.

For the first time, a majority of the city residents had an at least part non-German background.

[ 50 ] Moreover, three of four children in the city under the age of six had full or partial immigrant backgrounds, [ 51 ] and 27.7% of residents had a foreign citizenship.

[ 52 ] According to statistics, 46.7% of immigrants in Frankfurt come from other countries in the EU; 24.5% come from European countries that are not part of the EU; 15.7% come from Asia (including Western Asia and South Asia); 7.3% come from Africa; 3.4% come from North America (including the Caribbean and Central America); 0.2% come from Australia and New Zealand ; 2.3% come from South America; and 1.1% come from Pacific island nations. Because of this the city is often considered to be a multicultural city, and has been compared to New York City and London .

[ 53 ] Religion [ edit ] Frankfurt was historically a Protestant -dominated city. However, during the 19th century, an increasing number of Catholics moved to Frankfurt. As of 2013 [update] , the largest Christian denominations were Catholicism (22.7% of the population) and Protestantism, especially Lutheranism (19.4%).

[ 54 ] Main article: Jewish community of Frankfurt am Main The Jewish community has a history dating back to medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Germany. Over 7,200 inhabitants are affiliated with the Jewish community, making it the third largest in Germany after Berlin and Munich .

[ 24 ] Frankfurt has four active synagogues.

[ 55 ] Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Frankfurt has a large Muslim community, estimated at 12% in 2006.

[ 56 ] According to calculations based on census data for 21 countries of origin, the number of Muslim migrants in Frankfurt amounted to about 84,000 in 2011, making up 12.6% of the population.

[ 57 ] The most prevalent countries of origin were Turkey and Morocco . The Ahmadiyya Noor Mosque, constructed in 1959, is the city's largest mosque and the third largest in Germany. In 2020, the number of Muslims in Frankfurt's total population was estimated at 18%.

[ 61 ] The city's importance as a financial hub has risen since the eurozone crisis . Indications are the establishment of two institutions of the European System of Financial Supervisors ( European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board ) in 2011, and the entry into force in 2014 of European Banking Supervision , by which the European Central Bank has become the central supervisory authority for the euro area banking sector.

According to an annual study by Cushman & Wakefield , the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, after London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990.

[ 62 ] It is the only German city considered to be an alpha world city (category 3) as listed by the Loughborough University group's 2010 inventory, [ 63 ] which was a promotion from the group's 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).

The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometers away from downtown and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen ( East Harbor ), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.

The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 EU member states.

The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbors. The Kaisersaal ("Emperor's Hall") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.

The New Frankfurt Old Town was completed in 2018, including 15 reconstructed historical buildings.

The former Altstadt (old town) quarter between the Römer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was redeveloped as the Dom-Römer Quarter from 2012 to 2018, including 15 reconstructions of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.

German National Library [ edit ] DNB building in Frankfurt Frankfurt is one of two sites of the German National Library ( Deutsche Nationalbibliothek ), the other being Leipzig . The Deutsche Nationalbibliothek is a universal library in Germany. Its task, unique in Germany, is to collect, permanently archive, comprehensively document and record bibliographically all German and German-language publications from 1913 on, foreign publications about Germany, translations of German works and the works of German-speaking emigrants published abroad between 1933 and 1945, and to make them available to the public.

[ 89 ] Frankfurt Cathedral [ edit ] Frankfurt Cathedral ( Frankfurter Dom ) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew . The Gothic building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the Merovingian time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the Holy Roman Empire were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, Roman-German emperors were crowned there.

Since the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called Dom , although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in World War II and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 m (312 ft). The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 m (217 ft), accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.

Frankfurt Cathedral Römerberg St. Paul's Church St. Paul's Church [ edit ] St. Paul's Church is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a Protestant church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the Frankfurt Parliament , which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of Prussia and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved; the building was once more used for religious services.

St. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II with its interior significantly damaged. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war albeit with modern alterations particularly to the interior; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.

Archäologischer Garten Frankfurt [ edit ] The Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace ( Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt ) from the sixth century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and the cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. From 2013 until 2015 an event building, the Stadthaus ("City house"), has been built on top of the garden, but it remains open to the public free of charge.

Haus Wertheim [ edit ] Wertheim House is the only timbered house in the Altstadt district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.

Saalhof [ edit ] The Saalhof is the oldest conserved building in the Altstadt district and dates to the 12th century.

Today it serves as a part of the Historical Museum .

Eiserner Steg [ edit ] The Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the Wehrmacht , it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.

Alte Oper [ edit ] Alte Oper , now a concert hall, at Opernplatz The Alte Oper is a former opera house , hence the name "Old Opera". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed "Germany's most beautiful ruin". Former Frankfurt Lord Mayor Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname "Dynamite-Rudi". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.) Public pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the "new" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the frieze of the Alte Oper says: " Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten " ("To the true, the beautiful, the good").

Frankfurt skyline in June 2013, view from south-west History of high-rise buildings [ edit ] See also: List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt The original Henninger Turm in 2007 Skyline at dusk, seen from Deutschherrnbrücke (2014) Bridges over River Main in Frankfurt 2023 For centuries, St. Bartholomeus's Cathedral was the tallest structure. The first building to exceed the 95-meter-high cathedral was not an office building but a grain silo 120 m-high (390 ft) high.

[ citation needed ] The Henninger Turm was opened in the 1960s and the silo was topped by a revolving restaurant designed to be a landmark. The Henninger Turm was extensively refurbished and is now a residential high-rise.

[ 96 ] The first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when Westend Gate (then called Plaza Büro Center ) and Silberturm were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 meters and 166.3 meters, respectively. Around the same time, Frankfurter Büro Center and City-Haus (142.4 meters and 142.1 meters) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and Eurotower (148.0 meters) and Garden Tower (127.0 meters; then called Helaba-Hochhaus ) were constructed in the financial district.

None of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 meters tall.

The 1990s featured a second wave.

Messeturm , built on the trade fair site, reached a height of 256.5 meters (842 ft) and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the 259 m-high (850 ft) Commerzbank Tower in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are Westendstrasse 1 (208 meters (682 ft)), Main Tower (200 meters (660 ft)) and Trianon (186 meters (610 ft)).

In 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., Skyper , Opernturm , Tower 185 , Seat of the European Central Bank , Taunusturm ) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.

The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140 m (459 ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and construction was completed in summer 2017. The new tower offers 207 luxury flats [ 97 ] and houses the non-rotating restaurant "Franziska".

The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as "Central Park" (a reference to the famous park in Manhattan ), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.

Nizza Park – At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls Nice in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly mediterranean climate .

Culinary specialties [ edit ] See also: Hessian cuisine "Bembel" (jug) and "Geripptes" (glass) Original Frankfurter Würstchen served with potato salad Apfelwein – Apple wine or hard cider is regionally known as "Ebbelwoi", "Äppler" or "Stöffsche". It has an alcohol content of 5.5%–7% and a tart, sour taste. It is traditionally served in a glass, typically decorated with lozenges, called "Geripptes", a full glass is then called "Schoppen". Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as "Bembel". A group normally orders a "Bembel" and shares the contents. Apfelwein can be ordered as "sauergespritzer", which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as "süssgespritzer", which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in Sachsenhausen , which is therefore known as "Ebbelwoi district". Due to its national drink Frankfurt is sometimes called "Big Ebbel" (pronunciation with Hessian dialect ), an homage to Big Apple , the famous nickname of New York City.

Grüne Soße – Green sauce is a sauce made with hard-boiled eggs, oil, vinegar, salt and a generous amount of seven fresh herbs, namely borage, sorrel, garden cress, chervil, chives, parsley and salad burnet.

Bethmännchen – "A little Bethmann" is a pastry made from marzipan with almond, powdered sugar, rosewater, flour, and egg. It is usually baked for Christmas.

Quality of life [ edit ] In a 2001 ranking by the University of Liverpool , Frankfurt was rated the richest city in Europe by GDP per capita , followed by Karlsruhe , Paris and Munich .

[ 108 ] Frankfurt was voted the seventh in the Mercer Quality of Living Survey by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey (2012), [ 109 ] seventh in the Mercer Quality of Living Survey (2010) and 18th at the Economist's World's Most Liveable Cities Survey (2011).

[ 110 ] According to an annual citizen survey (2010), arranged by the city council, 66 percent inhabitants are satisfied or highly satisfied with the city, while only 6 percent said that they are dissatisfied. Compared to the 1993's survey the number of satisfied inhabitants has grown about 22 percent while the number of dissatisfied inhabitants was reduced by 8 percent. 84 percent of the inhabitants like to live in Frankfurt, 13 percent would rather choose to live somewhere else. 37 percent are satisfied with the public safety (1993: only 9 percent), 22 percent are dissatisfied (1993: 64 percent).

[ 111 ] Frankfurt consistently has the highest levels of crime per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany (15.976 crimes per annum in 2008) and is therefore dubbed the German "crime capital".

[ 112 ] However, this statistic is often criticized [ citation needed ] because it ignores major factors: It is calculated based on the administrative 680,000-inhabitant figure while the urban area has 2.5 M inhabitants and on weekdays adds another million people [ citation needed ] (not counting the 53 million passengers passing through the airport each year). The rate for personal safety-relevant crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape or bodily harm, is 3.4 percent, placing Frankfurt twelfth in the ranking (related to the official 680,000-inhabitant figure) or number 21 (related to the one-million-figure).

[ 113 ] In 2018, the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, was ranked the third-safest state in Germany.

[ 114 ] Transport [ edit ] Airports [ edit ] Frankfurt Airport [ edit ] Main article: Frankfurt Airport Frankfurt Airport (with the fourth runway under construction in 2010) and the Frankfurter Kreuz (lower right corner) The city can be accessed from around the world via Frankfurt Airport ( Flughafen Frankfurt am Main ) located 12 km (7 mi) southwest of downtown.

The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the northeast form a ring road around the inner city districts and define a Low-emission zone ( Umweltzone ; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.

The streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during rush hour . Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestraße and Freßgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

Railway stations [ edit ] Frankfurt Central Station [ edit ] Frankfurt Central Station S-Bahn at Central Station (underground) Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof ( often abbreviated as Frankfurt (Main) Hbf or F-Hbf ) is the largest railway station in Germany by railway traffic.

Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt City Tunnel and serve stations at Ostendstraße , Konstablerwache , Hauptwache , Taunusanlage and Frankfurt Central Station . When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground.

The S8/S9 runs 24/7.

U-Bahn [ edit ] Underground line U7 running as a Stadtbahn amidst Ludwig-Landmann -Straße in Frankfurt-Rödelheim Main article: Frankfurt U-Bahn The U-Bahn has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact light rail ( Stadtbahn ) as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5- to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3- and 5-minute intervals on downtown tracks shared by more than one line.

Tram [ edit ] Main article: Trams in Frankfurt am Main Frankfurt has ten tram lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes.

[ 124 ] Bicycles [ edit ] Velotaxi at the Zeil Deutsche Bahn makes bicycles available for hire through their Call a Bike service. The bicycles are stationed all over the city, including at selected railway stations. They can easily be spotted because of their eye-catching silver-red color. To rent a specific bike, riders either call a service number to get an unlock code or reserve the bike via the smartphone application. To return the bike, the rider locks it within a designated return area (and calls the service number, if not booked via the app).

[ 125 ] Nextbike also makes bicycles available for hire in Frankfurt. They are stationed all over the city. These can be spotted with their blue color scheme.

Cycle rickshaws (velotaxis), a type of tricycle designed to carry passengers in addition to the driver, are also available. These are allowed to operate in pedestrian-only areas and are therefore practical for sightseeing.

Frankfurt has a network of cycle routes. Many long-distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. A number of downtown roads are "bicycle streets" where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorized vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both directions. As of 2015 [update] , 15 percent of citizens used bicycles.

[ 126 ] E-Scooters [ edit ] Since 15 June 2019, the use of e-scooters was officially permitted by the German federal government. In Frankfurt, companies like Lime , TIER, Bird , voi., Dott or Bolt are offering their electric micro mobility vehicles for lease. However, their use is being regarded with increasing weariness due to frequent abuse (parking, speeding, vandalism, accidents) and has sparked a public debate about the need of further regulation of the e-scooter market.
