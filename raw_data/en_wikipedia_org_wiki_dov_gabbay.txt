Rabin [ 1 ] Dov M. Gabbay ( / ɡ ə ˈ b eɪ / , Hebrew : דב גבאי ; born October 26, 1945) is an Israeli logician. He is Augustus De Morgan Professor Emeritus of Logic at the Group of Logic , Language and Computation , Department of Computer Science , King's College London .

Work [ edit ] Gabbay has authored over four hundred and fifty research papers and over thirty research monographs. He is editor of several international journals, and of many reference works and handbooks of logic, including the Handbook of Philosophical Logic (with Franz Guenthner ), the Handbook of Logic in Computer Science (with Samson Abramsky and T. S. E. Maibaum ), the Handbook of the History of Logic (with John Woods ), the Handbook of Deontic Logic and Normative Systems (with John Horty, Xavier Parent, Ron van der Meyden and Leendert van der Torre ), and the Handbook of Logic in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming (with C.J. Hogger and J.A. Robinson ).

He is well-known for pioneering work on logic in computer science and artificial intelligence, especially the application of (executable) temporal logics in computer science, in particular formal verification , the logical foundations of non-monotonic reasoning and artificial intelligence, the introduction of fibring logics and the theory of labelled deductive systems.

He is Chairman and founder of several international conferences, executive of the European Foundation of  Logic, Language and Information and President of the International IGPL Logic Group. He is founder, and joint President of the International Federation of Computational Logic.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is also one of the four founders and council member for many years of FoLLI, the Association of Logic, Language and Information, from which he is now retired. He remains a life member.

He is co-founder with Jane Spurr of College Publications, a not-for-profit, start-up academic publisher , intended to compete with major expensive publishers at affordable prices, and not requiring copyright assignment from authors.

[ 4 ] A two volume Festschrift in his honor was published in 2005 by College Publications.
