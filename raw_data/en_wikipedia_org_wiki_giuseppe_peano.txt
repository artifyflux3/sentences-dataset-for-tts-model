**Giuseppe Peano** (;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-1)Italian:[[dʒuˈzɛppe peˈaːno]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian "Help:IPA/Italian"); 27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) was an Italian [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") and [glottologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottologist "Glottologist"). The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") and [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), to which he contributed much [notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_notation "Mathematical notation"). The standard [axiomatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatization "Axiomatization") of the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") is named the [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms "Peano axioms") in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"). He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the [University of Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Turin "University of Turin"). He also created an international auxiliary language, [Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione "Latino sine flexione") ("Latin without inflections"), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latino sine flexione, while others are in Italian.

Peano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to [Cuneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneo "Cuneo"), [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont "Piedmont"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"). He attended the [Liceo classico Cavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liceo_classico_Cavour "Liceo classico Cavour") in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin"), and enrolled at the [University of Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Turin "University of Turin") in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honours, after which the University employed him to assist first [Enrico D'Ovidio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_D%27Ovidio "Enrico D'Ovidio"), and then [Angelo Genocchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Genocchi "Angelo Genocchi"), the Chair of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus entitled _Calcolo differenziale, e principii di calcolo integrale_, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-3) A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") and [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of sets appeared for the first time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-4)

Peano joined [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry "Freemasonry"). It is not known where he was initiated, but on December 24, 1885, he was affiliated as [Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venerable_Master "Venerable Master") in the "[Dante Alighieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri")" Masonic Lodge in Turin.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-6) Here he knew the Italian socialist and freemason Giovanni Lerda (1853-1927),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-7) a close collaborator of [Cesare Lombroso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso "Cesare Lombroso").

Giuseppe Peano and his wife Carola Crosio in 1887

In 1887, Peano married Carola Crosio, the daughter of the Turin-based painter [Luigi Crosio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Crosio "Luigi Crosio"), known for painting the _[Refugium Peccatorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugium\_Peccatorum "Refugium Peccatorum")[Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna\_(art) "Madonna (art)")_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-8) In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the [Royal Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Military_Academy_(Italy)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Royal Military Academy (Italy) (page does not exist)"), and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms "Peano axioms"), a formal foundation for the collection of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. The [Peano curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve "Peano curve") was published in 1890 as the first example of a [space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve") which demonstrated that the unit interval and the unit square have the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality"). Today it is understood to be an early example of what is known as a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal").

In 1890 Peano founded the journal _Rivista di Matematica_, which published its first issue in January 1891.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-9) In 1891 Peano started the [Formulario Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulario_Project "Formulario Project"). It was to be an "Encyclopedia of Mathematics", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") was held in [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"). Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with _Formulario_ to the detriment of his other work.

In 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about [binary numeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system "Binary numeral system") and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.

Paris was the venue for the Second [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First [International Conference of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_of_Philosophy "International Conference of Philosophy") where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, _i.e._ "how do you define a definition?". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference, Peano met [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and gave him a copy of _Formulario_. Russell was struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols and after the conference, he retired to the country "to study quietly every word written by him or his disciples".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-10)

Peano's students [Mario Pieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Pieri "Mario Pieri") and [Alessandro Padoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Padoa "Alessandro Padoa") also had papers presented at the philosophy congress. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an "international auxiliary language" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.

By 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") and [vector analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_analysis "Vector analysis"). Peano played a key role in the [axiomatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatization "Axiomatization") of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the _Formulario_ project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-11)

In 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called _[Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino\_sine\_flexione "Latino sine flexione")_ ("[Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") without inflexion," later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua") of the [IALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Auxiliary_Language_Association "International Auxiliary Language Association")). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3 January 1908, he read a paper to the _Academia delle Scienze di Torino_ in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-12)

The year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the _Formulario_ project, titled _[Formulario mathematico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulario\_mathematico "Formulario mathematico")_, was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in _Latino sine flexione_.

Also in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of _[Academia pro Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia\_pro\_Interlingua "Academia pro Interlingua")_. Having previously created [Idiom Neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_Neutral "Idiom Neutral"), the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favour of Peano's [Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione "Latino sine flexione").

After his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other [auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language"), becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the _[Accademia dei Lincei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia\_dei\_Lincei "Accademia dei Lincei")_ to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).

During the years 1913–1918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various [numerical quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration "Numerical integration") formulas, and introduced the [Peano kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_kernel "Peano kernel").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano#cite_note-numericalMath-13)

In 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died when he suffered a fatal [heart attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction "Myocardial infarction").
