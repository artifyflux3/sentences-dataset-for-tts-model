It states that the products of the lengths of the line segments on each chord are equal. 
It is Proposition 35 of Book 3 of Euclid 's Elements .

More precisely, for two chords AC and BD intersecting in a point S the following equation holds: | A S | ⋅ ⋅ | S C | = | B S | ⋅ ⋅ | S D | {\displaystyle |AS|\cdot |SC|=|BS|\cdot |SD|} The converse is true as well. That is: If for two line segments AC and BD intersecting in S the equation above holds true, then their four endpoints A , B , C , D lie on a common circle. Or in other words, if the diagonals of a quadrilateral ABCD intersect in S and fulfill the equation above, then it is a cyclic quadrilateral .

The value of the two products in the chord theorem depends only on the distance of the intersection point S from the circle's center and is called the absolute value of the power of S ; more precisely, it can be stated that: | A S | ⋅ ⋅ | S C | = | B S | ⋅ ⋅ | S D | = r 2 − − d 2 , {\displaystyle |AS|\cdot |SC|=|BS|\cdot |SD|=r^{2}-d^{2},} where r is the radius of the circle, and d is the distance between the center of the circle and the intersection point S . This property follows directly from applying the chord theorem to a third chord (a diameter) going through S and the circle's center M (see drawing).

The theorem can be proven using similar triangles (via the inscribed-angle theorem ). Consider the angles of the triangles △ ASD and △ BSC : ∠ ∠ A D S = ∠ ∠ B C S ( inscribed angles over AB ) ∠ ∠ D A S = ∠ ∠ C B S ( inscribed angles over CD ) ∠ ∠ A S D = ∠ ∠ B S C ( opposing angles ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\angle ADS&=\angle BCS\,({\text{inscribed angles over AB}})\\\angle DAS&=\angle CBS\,({\text{inscribed angles over CD}})\\\angle ASD&=\angle BSC\,({\text{opposing angles}})\end{aligned}}} This means the triangles △ ASD and △ BSC are similar and therefore A S S D = B S S C ⇔ ⇔ | A S | ⋅ ⋅ | S C | = | B S | ⋅ ⋅ | S D | {\displaystyle {\frac {AS}{SD}}={\frac {BS}{SC}}\Leftrightarrow |AS|\cdot |SC|=|BS|\cdot |SD|} Next to the tangent-secant theorem and the intersecting secants theorem , the intersecting chords theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle - the power of a point theorem.
