A hyperoctahedral group is a type of mathematical group that arises as the group of symmetries of a hypercube or of a cross-polytope . It was named by Alfred Young in 1930. Groups of this type are identified by a parameter n , the dimension of the hypercube.

As a Coxeter group it is of type B n = C n , and as a Weyl group it is associated to the symplectic groups and with the orthogonal groups in odd dimensions.  As a wreath product it is S 2 ≀ ≀ S n {\displaystyle S_{2}\wr S_{n}} where S n is the symmetric group of degree n .  As a permutation group , the group is the signed symmetric group of permutations π either of the set ⁠ { − − n , − − n + 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , − − 1 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ ⋯ , n } {\displaystyle \{-n,-n+1,\cdots ,-1,1,2,\cdots ,n\}} ⁠ or of the set ⁠ { − − n , − − n + 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , n } {\displaystyle \{-n,-n+1,\cdots ,n\}} ⁠ such that ⁠ π π ( i ) = − − π π ( − − i ) {\displaystyle \pi (i)=-\pi (-i)} ⁠ for all i .  As a matrix group , it can be described as the group of n × n orthogonal matrices whose entries are all integers .  Equivalently, this is the set of n × n matrices with entries only 0, 1, or −1, which are invertible , and which have exactly one non-zero entry in each row or column. The representation theory of the hyperoctahedral group was described by ( Young 1930 ) according to ( Kerber 1971 , p. 2).

In three dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group is known as O × S 2 where O ≅ S 4 is the octahedral group , and S 2 is a symmetric group (here a cyclic group ) of order 2.  Geometric figures in three dimensions with this symmetry group are said to have octahedral symmetry , named after the regular octahedron , or 3- orthoplex . In 4-dimensions it is called a hexadecachoric symmetry , after the regular 16-cell , or 4- orthoplex . In two dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group structure is the abstract dihedral group of order eight , describing the symmetry of a square , or 2-orthoplex.

n 2 S 2 ≀ ≀ S n {\displaystyle S_{2}\wr S_{n}} hypercube , orthoplex Subgroups [ edit ] There is a notable index two subgroup, corresponding to the Coxeter group D n and the symmetries of the demihypercube . Viewed as a wreath product, there are two natural maps from the hyperoctahedral group to the cyclic group of order 2: one map coming from "multiply the signs of all the elements" (in the n copies of { ± ± 1 } {\displaystyle \{\pm 1\}} ), and one map coming from the parity of the permutation. Multiplying these together yields a third map C n → → { ± ± 1 } {\displaystyle C_{n}\to \{\pm 1\}} . The kernel of the first map is the Coxeter group D n .

{\displaystyle D_{n}.} In terms of signed permutations , thought of as matrices, this third map is simply the determinant, while the first two correspond to "multiplying the non-zero entries" and "parity of the underlying (unsigned) permutation", which are not generally meaningful for matrices, but are in the case due to the coincidence with a wreath product.

The kernels of these three maps are all three index two subgroups of the hyperoctahedral group, as discussed in H 1 : Abelianization below, and their intersection is the derived subgroup , of index 4 (quotient the Klein 4-group), which corresponds to the rotational symmetries of the demihypercube.

In the other direction, the center is the subgroup of scalar matrices, {±1}; geometrically, quotienting out by this corresponds to passing to the projective orthogonal group .

In dimension 2 these groups completely describe the hyperoctahedral group, which is the dihedral group Dih 4 of order 8 , and is an extension 2.V (of the 4-group by a cyclic group of order 2). In general, passing to the subquotient (derived subgroup, mod center) is the symmetry group of the projective demihypercube.

n Homology [ edit ] The group homology of the hyperoctahedral group is similar to that of the symmetric group, and exhibits stabilization, in the sense of stable homotopy theory .

H 1 : abelianization [ edit ] The first homology group, which agrees with the abelianization , stabilizes at the Klein four-group , and is given by: H 1 ( C n , Z ) = { 0 n = 0 Z / 2 n = 1 Z / 2 × × Z / 2 n ≥ ≥ 2 .

{\displaystyle H_{1}(C_{n},\mathbf {Z} )={\begin{cases}0&n=0\\\mathbf {Z} /2&n=1\\\mathbf {Z} /2\times \mathbf {Z} /2&n\geq 2\end{cases}}.} This is easily seen directly: the − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} elements are order 2 (which is non-empty for n ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle n\geq 1} ), and all conjugate, as are the transpositions in S n {\displaystyle S_{n}} (which is non-empty for n ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n\geq 2} ), and these are two separate classes. These elements generate the group, so the only non-trivial abelianizations are to 2-groups, and either of these classes can be sent independently to − − 1 ∈ ∈ { ± ± 1 } , {\displaystyle -1\in \{\pm 1\},} as they are two separate classes. The maps are explicitly given as "the product of the signs of all the elements" (in the n copies of { ± ± 1 } {\displaystyle \{\pm 1\}} ), and the sign of the permutation. Multiplying these together yields a third non-trivial map (the determinant of the matrix, which sends both these classes to − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} ), and together with the trivial map these form the 4-group.

H 2 : Schur multipliers [ edit ] The second homology groups, known classically as the Schur multipliers , were computed in ( Ihara & Yokonuma 1965 ).

They are: H 2 ( C n , Z ) = { 0 n = 0 , 1 Z / 2 n = 2 ( Z / 2 ) 2 n = 3 ( Z / 2 ) 3 n ≥ ≥ 4 .

{\displaystyle H_{2}(C_{n},\mathbf {Z} )={\begin{cases}0&n=0,1\\\mathbf {Z} /2&n=2\\(\mathbf {Z} /2)^{2}&n=3\\(\mathbf {Z} /2)^{3}&n\geq 4\end{cases}}.} Notes [ edit ] ^ a b c d Conway & Smith 2003 ^ du Val 1964 , #47 ^ du Val 1964 , #42 ^ du Val 1964 , #27 ^ Coxeter 1999 , p. 121, Essay 5 Regular skew polyhedra ^ du Val 1964 , #41 References [ edit ] Miller, G.
