The two particles "share" coat proteins , therefore each has a similar assortment of identifying surface proteins, while having different genetic material.
In other words; non-genetic interaction in which virus particles released from a cell that is infected with two different viruses have components from both the infecting agents, but with a genome from one of them.

[ 1 ] It is also possible for a virus particle to hold copies of the genome from different parent viruses. This would be called genotype mixing .
