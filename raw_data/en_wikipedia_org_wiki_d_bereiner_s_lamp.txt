W. Döbereiner Döbereiner's lamp.

Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (1825) Döbereiner's lamp , also called a "tinderbox" ("Feuerzeug"), is a lighter invented in 1823 by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner . The lighter is based on the Fürstenberger lighter (invented in Basel in 1780; in which hydrogen gas is ignited by an electrostatically generated spark). Döbereiner's lamp was in production until ca. 1880. In the jar, similar to the Kipp's apparatus , zinc metal reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to produce hydrogen gas. When a valve is opened, a jet of hydrogen is released onto a platinum sponge . The sponge catalyzes a reaction with atmospheric oxygen, which heats the catalyst and ignites the hydrogen, producing a gentle flame.

The world's largest manufacturer of these lighters was Heinrich Gottfried Piegler from Schleiz in Thuringia (Germany).

[ 2 ] It is said that in the 1820s over a million of the "tinderboxes" were sold.

Piegler, 1830) In Great Britain examples of the lighter are exhibited in the Science Museum in London, in Germany in the Deutsches Museum , the old pharmacy at Heidelberg Castle , the Kulturhistorisches Museum Schloss Merseburg , the Municipal Museum in Braunschweig , the Goethe National Museum in Weimar, the Museum Gunnar-Wester-Haus in Schweinfurt , the Astronomisch-Physikalisches Kabinett Kassel , the Regional Museum Bad Lobenstein , the Municipal Museum Zeulenroda , the Stadtmuseum Gera , the Mineralogical Collection in Jena , and at the Museum Bayerisches Vogtland in Hof , in the United States in the Amana Heritage Museum in Amana (CDP), Iowa .
