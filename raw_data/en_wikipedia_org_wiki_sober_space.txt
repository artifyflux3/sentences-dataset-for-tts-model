Definitions [ edit ] Sober spaces have a variety of cryptomorphic definitions, which are documented in this section.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In each case below, replacing "unique" with "at most one" gives an equivalent formulation of the T 0 axiom . Replacing it with "at least one" is equivalent to the property that the T 0 quotient of the space is sober, which is sometimes referred to as having "enough points" in the literature.

With irreducible closed sets [ edit ] A closed set is irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets. A space is sober if every nonempty irreducible closed subset is the closure of a unique point.

In terms of morphisms of frames and locales [ edit ] A topological space X is sober if every map from its partially ordered set of open subsets to { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} that preserves all joins and all finite meets is the inverse image of a unique continuous function from the one-point space to X .

This may be viewed as a correspondence between the notion of a point in a locale and a point in a topological space, which is the motivating definition.

Using completely prime filters [ edit ] A filter F of open sets is said to be completely prime if for any family O i {\displaystyle O_{i}} of open sets such that ⋃ ⋃ i O i ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i}O_{i}\in F} , we have that O i ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle O_{i}\in F} for some i . A space X is sober if each completely prime filter is the neighbourhood filter of a unique point in X .

In terms of nets [ edit ] A net x ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }} is self-convergent if it converges to every point x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} in x ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }} , or equivalently if its eventuality filter is completely prime. A net x ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }} that converges to x {\displaystyle x} converges strongly if it can only converge to points in the closure of x {\displaystyle x} . A space is sober if every self-convergent net x ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }} converges strongly to a unique point x {\displaystyle x} .

[ 2 ] In particular, a space is T 1 and sober precisely if every self-convergent net is constant.

As a property of sheaves on the space [ edit ] A space X is sober if every functor from the category of sheaves Sh(X) to Set that preserves all finite limits and all small colimits must be the stalk functor of a unique point x .

Properties and examples [ edit ] Any Hausdorff (T 2 ) space is sober (the only irreducible subsets being singletons), and all sober spaces are Kolmogorov (T 0 ), and both implications are strict.

[ 3 ] Sobriety is not comparable to the T 1 condition: an example of a T 1 space that is not sober is an infinite set with the cofinite topology , the whole space being an irreducible closed subset with no generic point; an example of a sober space that is not T 1 is the Sierpinski space .

Moreover, T 2 is strictly stronger than T 1 and sober, i.e., while every  T 2 space is at once T 1 and sober, there exist spaces that are simultaneously T 1 and sober, but not T 2 . One such example is the following: let X be the set of real numbers, with a new point p adjoined; the open sets being all real open sets, and all cofinite sets containing p .

Sobriety of X is precisely a condition that forces the lattice of open subsets of X to determine X up to homeomorphism , which is relevant to pointless topology .

Sobriety makes the specialization preorder a directed complete partial order .

Every continuous directed complete poset equipped with the Scott topology is sober.

Finite T 0 spaces are sober.

[ 4 ] The prime spectrum Spec( R ) of a commutative ring R with the Zariski topology is a compact sober space.

[ 3 ] In fact, every spectral space (i.e. a compact sober space for which the collection of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a base for the topology) is homeomorphic to Spec( R ) for some commutative ring R . This is a theorem of Melvin Hochster .

[ 5 ] More generally, the underlying topological space of any scheme is a sober space.

The subset of Spec( R ) consisting only of the maximal ideals , where R is a commutative ring, is not sober in general.

See also [ edit ] Stone duality , on the duality between topological spaces that are sober and frames (i.e.

complete Heyting algebras ) that are spatial.
