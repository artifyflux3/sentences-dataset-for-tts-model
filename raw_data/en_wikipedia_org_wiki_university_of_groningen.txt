Founded in 1614, the university is the second oldest in the country (after Leiden ).

The University of Groningen has eleven faculties , nine graduate schools , 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175-degree programmes. The university's alumni and faculty include Johann Bernoulli , Aletta Jacobs , four Nobel Prize winners, nine Spinoza Prize winners, one Stevin Prize winner, various members of the Dutch royal family , several politicians, the first president of the European Central Bank , and a secretary general of NATO .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] History [ edit ] Ubbo Emmius was the first rector magnificus of the University of Groningen The institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden , or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The coat of arms of the university was confirmed by The Estates of the City and County of Groningen in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris . The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.

In the first 75 years of its existence about 100 students enrolled every year.

[ citation needed ] Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first rector magnificus , Ubbo Emmius , came from East Frisia in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region.

[ citation needed ] The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the month-long siege of the city by the prince-bishop of Münster ‘ Bommen Berend (Bombing Bernhard) ’ in 1672 during which the university fielded a voluntary student company (VSC).

[ 14 ] On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period.

The 19th-century main building in 1858 The 20th-century main building in 2009 During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administered by the Imperial University of Paris . Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen ( Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen ). During this time period, it remained the only open university in the Kingdom of Holland .

[ 15 ] In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. A fire completely destroyed the building in 1906.

In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the " Rijksuniversiteit Groningen " (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin, and the university was given a research duty as well as an educational duty.

The University of Groningen developed during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students grew rapidly. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had grown to 1,000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. In recent times there are about 32,700 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly.

In March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the China Agricultural University to establish a campus in the Chinese city of Yantai . This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.

[ 16 ] The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by censorship in China .

[ 17 ] In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the "insufficient support for the project".

[ 18 ] Facts and figures [ edit ] Students numbers Key facts and figures about the University of Groningen are: [ 5 ] The university, as of 2020, has 34,000 students enrolled in various programs from the undergraduate level up to doctorate students. This includes 8,250 international students.

International cooperation [ edit ] The University of Groningen engages in many types of international cooperation throughout both teaching and research. The main networks and partners [ 48 ] of the university are: Enlight, [ 49 ] an alliance of nine European universities, The Guild [ 50 ] of European research-intensive universities and the Coimbra group , [ 51 ] a network of 37 long established European multidisciplinary universities.

Strategic partnerships (academic connection): Universität Hamburg (UHH) and Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg Global strategic partnerships: Nanyang Technological University (Singapore), Osaka University (Japan), Macquarie University (Australia), Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia), Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia), Universidad de Chile (Chile), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Mexico), Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil), Stellenbosch University (South Africa) Campus [ edit ] The various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the Broerstraat . The faculty of medical sciences is located close by at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after Nobel Prize winner Frits Zernike . The Zernike campus is also shared by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences , the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.

[ 52 ] The university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The university has also recently opened another campus in Leeuwarden, Friesland , referred to as "Campus Fryslân", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

[ 53 ] Student life [ edit ] The city of Groningen is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. The university, through ACLO, [ 54 ] offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.

[ 55 ] The university also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.

The use of bicycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as "The World Cycling City" because of this.

[ 56 ] Student housing [ edit ] The University of Groningen does not have student accommodation. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via SSH Student Housing , which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands.

[ 57 ] A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however, a recent addition to the housing options for students is The Student Hotel as well. In an effort to combat the annual housing shortage, the city of Groningen has incentivized the construction of short-term accommodation such as The Village which is made of shipping containers for international students.

[ 58 ] The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.

[ 59 ] In 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.

[ 60 ] Especially in the fall semester of 2021 the housing crisis hit its peak with hundreds of students reportedly not having any accommodation and resorting to emergency shelters.

[ 61 ] The housing shorting evoked a protest in the city centre which culminated in the Academy building being temporarily occupied by students to put pressure on the city to extend emergency housing.

[ 62 ] Research [ edit ] In 2023, 635 PhDs were awarded (12% of the total for the Netherlands). Around 60% of newly-admitted PhD students came from abroad.
