However, there are many New Zealand-born Samoans living in Australia, known as Samoan New Zealand Australians. Most Samoans in Australia live in Sydney , Brisbane and Melbourne . Most people of Samoan heritage speak Samoan as their first language.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] After Christian missionaries from Australia began visiting Samoa in 1857, Samoan ministers began traveling to Australia for more training and to find work. However, Samoan and other non-European immigration to Australia was halted due to the White Australia policy in 1901. The next significant wave of Samoans to move to Australia was in the 1970s, where Samoans participated in educational programs sponsored by the Australian Government.

[ 2 ] Demographics [ edit ] Samoan church in Thomastown , Melbourne According to the 2006 Australian census, 15,244 Australians were born in Samoa and 193 in American Samoa [ 3 ] while 39,992 claimed Samoan ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry.
