number of left cosets of H in G , or equivalently, the number of right cosets of H in G .
The index is denoted | G : H | {\displaystyle |G:H|} or [ G : H ] {\displaystyle [G:H]} or ( G : H ) {\displaystyle (G:H)} .
Because G is the disjoint union of the left cosets and because each left coset has the same size as H , the index is related to the orders of the two groups by the formula | G | = | G : H | | H | {\displaystyle |G|=|G:H||H|} (interpret the quantities as cardinal numbers if some of them are infinite).
Thus the index | G : H | {\displaystyle |G:H|} measures the "relative sizes" of G and H .

For example, let G = Z {\displaystyle G=\mathbb {Z} } be the group of integers under addition , and let H = 2 Z {\displaystyle H=2\mathbb {Z} } be the subgroup consisting of the even integers .  Then 2 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} } has two cosets in Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } , namely the set of even integers and the set of odd integers, so the index | Z : 2 Z | {\displaystyle |\mathbb {Z} :2\mathbb {Z} |} is 2.  More generally, | Z : n Z | = n {\displaystyle |\mathbb {Z} :n\mathbb {Z} |=n} for any positive integer n .

When G is finite , the formula may be written as | G : H | = | G | / | H | {\displaystyle |G:H|=|G|/|H|} , and it implies Lagrange's theorem that | H | {\displaystyle |H|} divides | G | {\displaystyle |G|} .

When G is infinite, | G : H | {\displaystyle |G:H|} is a nonzero cardinal number that may be finite or infinite.
For example, | Z : 2 Z | = 2 {\displaystyle |\mathbb {Z} :2\mathbb {Z} |=2} , but | R : Z | {\displaystyle |\mathbb {R} :\mathbb {Z} |} is infinite.

If N is a normal subgroup of G , then | G : N | {\displaystyle |G:N|} is equal to the order of the quotient group G / N {\displaystyle G/N} , since the underlying set of G / N {\displaystyle G/N} is the set of cosets of N in G .

Properties [ edit ] If H is a subgroup of G and K is a subgroup of H , then | G : K | = | G : H | | H : K | .

{\displaystyle |G:K|=|G:H|\,|H:K|.} If H and K are subgroups of G , then | G : H ∩ ∩ K | ≤ ≤ | G : H | | G : K | , {\displaystyle |G:H\cap K|\leq |G:H|\,|G:K|,} with equality if H K = G {\displaystyle HK=G} .  (If | G : H ∩ ∩ K | {\displaystyle |G:H\cap K|} is finite, then equality holds if and only if H K = G {\displaystyle HK=G} .) Equivalently, if H and K are subgroups of G , then | H : H ∩ ∩ K | ≤ ≤ | G : K | , {\displaystyle |H:H\cap K|\leq |G:K|,} with equality if H K = G {\displaystyle HK=G} .  (If | H : H ∩ ∩ K | {\displaystyle |H:H\cap K|} is finite, then equality holds if and only if H K = G {\displaystyle HK=G} .) If G and H are groups and φ φ : : G → → H {\displaystyle \varphi \colon G\to H} is a homomorphism , then the index of the kernel of φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } in G is equal to the order of the image: | G : ker φ φ | = | im φ φ | .

{\displaystyle |G:\operatorname {ker} \;\varphi |=|\operatorname {im} \;\varphi |.} Let G be a group acting on a set X , and let x ∈ X .  Then the cardinality of the orbit of x under G is equal to the index of the stabilizer of x : | G x | = | G : G x | .

{\displaystyle |Gx|=|G:G_{x}|.\!} This is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem .

As a special case of the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of conjugates g x g − − 1 {\displaystyle gxg^{-1}} of an element x ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle x\in G} is equal to the index of the centralizer of x in G .

Similarly, the number of conjugates g H g − − 1 {\displaystyle gHg^{-1}} of a subgroup H in G is equal to the index of the normalizer of H in G .

If H is a subgroup of G , the index of the normal core of H satisfies the following inequality: | G : Core ⁡ ⁡ ( H ) | ≤ ≤ | G : H | !

{\displaystyle |G:\operatorname {Core} (H)|\leq |G:H|!} where ! denotes the factorial function; this is discussed further below .

As a corollary, if the index of H in G is 2, or for a finite group the lowest prime p that divides the order of G, then H is normal, as the index of its core must also be p, and thus H equals its core, i.e., it is normal.

Note that a subgroup of lowest prime index may not exist, such as in any simple group of non-prime order, or more generally any perfect group .

Examples [ edit ] The alternating group A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} has index 2 in the symmetric group S n , {\displaystyle S_{n},} and thus is normal.

The special orthogonal group SO ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {SO} (n)} has index 2 in the orthogonal group O ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n)} , and thus is normal.

The free abelian group Z ⊕ ⊕ Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \oplus \mathbb {Z} } has three subgroups of index 2, namely { ( x , y ) ∣ ∣ x is even } , { ( x , y ) ∣ ∣ y is even } , and { ( x , y ) ∣ ∣ x + y is even } {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\mid x{\text{ is even}}\},\quad \{(x,y)\mid y{\text{ is even}}\},\quad {\text{and}}\quad \{(x,y)\mid x+y{\text{ is even}}\}} .

More generally, if p is prime then Z n {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}} has ( p n − − 1 ) / ( p − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (p^{n}-1)/(p-1)} subgroups of index p , corresponding to the ( p n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (p^{n}-1)} nontrivial homomorphisms Z n → → Z / p Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}\to \mathbb {Z} /p\mathbb {Z} } .

[ citation needed ] Similarly, the free group F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} has ( p n − − 1 ) / ( p − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (p^{n}-1)/(p-1)} subgroups of index p .

The infinite dihedral group has a cyclic subgroup of index 2, which is necessarily normal.

Infinite index [ edit ] If H has an infinite number of cosets in G , then the index of H in G is said to be infinite.  In this case, the index | G : H | {\displaystyle |G:H|} is actually a cardinal number .  For example, the index of H in G may be countable or uncountable , depending on whether H has a countable number of cosets in G . Note that the index of H is at most the order of G, which is realized for the trivial subgroup, or in fact any subgroup H of infinite cardinality less than that of G.

Finite index [ edit ] A subgroup H of finite index in a group G (finite or infinite) always contains a normal subgroup N (of G ), also of finite index. In fact, if H has index n , then the index of N will be some divisor of n ! and a multiple of n ; indeed, N can be taken to be the kernel of the natural homomorphism from G to the permutation group of the left (or right) cosets of H .
Let us explain this in more detail, using right cosets: The elements of G that leave all cosets the same form a group.

Proof If Hca ⊂ Hc ∀ c ∈ G and likewise Hcb ⊂ Hc ∀ c ∈ G , then Hcab ⊂ Hc ∀ c ∈ G . If h 1 ca = h 2 c for all c ∈ G (with h 1 , h 2 ∈ H) then h 2 ca −1 = h 1 c , so Hca −1 ⊂ Hc .

Let us call this group A . Note that A is a subgroup of H , since Ha ⊂ H by the definition of A . Let B be the set of elements of G which perform a given permutation on the cosets of H . Then B is a right coset of A .

Proof First let us show that if b 1 ∈ B , then any other element b 2 of B equals ab 1 for some a ∈ A . Assume that multiplying the coset Hc on the right by elements of B gives elements of the coset Hd . If cb 1 = d and cb 2 = hd , then cb 2 b 1 −1 = hc ∈ Hc , or in other words b 2 = ab 1 for some a ∈ A , as desired. Now we show that for any b ∈ B and a ∈ A , ab will be an element of B . This is because the coset Hc is the same as Hca , so Hcb = Hcab . Since this is true for any c (that is, for any coset), it shows that multiplying on the right by ab makes the same permutation of cosets as multiplying by b , and therefore ab ∈ B .

What we have said so far applies whether the index of H is finite or infinte. Now assume that it is the finite number n . Since the number of possible permutations of cosets is finite, namely n !, then there can only be a finite number of sets like B . (If G is infinite, then all such sets are therefore infinite.) The set of these sets forms a group isomorphic to a subset of the group of permutations, so the number of these sets must divide n !. Furthermore, it must be a multiple of n because each coset of H contains the same number of cosets of A . Finally, if for some c ∈ G and a ∈ A we have ca = xc , then for any d ∈ G dca = dxc , but also dca = hdc for some h ∈ H (by the definition of A ), so hd = dx . Since this is true for any d , x must be a member of A, so ca = xc implies that cac −1 ∈ A and therefore A is a normal subgroup.

The index of the normal subgroup not only has to be a divisor of n !, but must satisfy other criteria as well. Since the normal subgroup is a subgroup of H , its index in G must be n times its index inside H . Its index in G must also correspond to a subgroup of the symmetric group S n , the group of permutations of n objects. So for example if n is 5, the index cannot be 15 even though this divides 5!, because there is no subgroup of order 15 in S 5 .

In the case of n = 2 this gives the rather obvious result that a subgroup H of index 2 is a normal subgroup, because the normal subgroup of H must have index 2 in G and therefore be identical to H . (We can arrive at this fact also by noting that all the elements of G that are not in H constitute the right coset of H and also the left coset, so the two are identical.) More generally, a subgroup of index p where p is the smallest prime factor of the order of G (if G is finite) is necessarily normal, as the index of N divides p ! and thus must equal p, having no other prime factors. For example, the subgroup Z 7 of the non-abelian group of order 21 is normal (see List of small non-abelian groups and Frobenius group#Examples ).

An alternative proof of the result that a subgroup of index lowest prime p is normal, and other properties of subgroups of prime index are given in ( Lam 2004 ).

Examples [ edit ] The group O of chiral octahedral symmetry has 24 elements. It has a dihedral D 4 subgroup (in fact it has three such) of order 8, and thus of index 3 in O , which we shall call H . This dihedral group has a 4-member D 2 subgroup, which we may call A . Multiplying on the right any element of a right coset of H by an element of A gives a member of the same coset of H ( Hca = Hc ).

A is normal in O . There are six cosets of A , corresponding to the six elements of the symmetric group S 3 . All elements from any particular coset of A perform the same permutation of the cosets of H .

On the other hand, the group T h of pyritohedral symmetry also has 24 members and a subgroup of index 3 (this time it is a D 2h prismatic symmetry group, see point groups in three dimensions ), but in this case the whole subgroup is a normal subgroup. All members of a particular coset carry out the same permutation of these cosets, but in this case they represent only the 3-element alternating group in the 6-member S 3 symmetric group.

Normal subgroups of prime power index [ edit ] Normal subgroups of prime power index are kernels of surjective maps to p -groups and have interesting structure, as described at Focal subgroup theorem: Subgroups and elaborated at focal subgroup theorem .

There are three important normal subgroups of prime power index, each being the smallest normal subgroup in a certain class: E p ( G ) is the intersection of all index p normal subgroups; G / E p ( G ) is an elementary abelian group , and is the largest elementary abelian p -group onto which G surjects.

A p ( G ) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K such that G / K is an abelian p -group (i.e., K is an index p k {\displaystyle p^{k}} normal subgroup that contains the derived group [ G , G ] {\displaystyle [G,G]} ): G / A p ( G ) is the largest abelian p -group (not necessarily elementary) onto which G surjects.

O p ( G ) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K of G such that G / K is a (possibly non-abelian) p -group (i.e., K is an index p k {\displaystyle p^{k}} normal subgroup): G / O p ( G ) is the largest p -group (not necessarily abelian) onto which G surjects.

O p ( G ) is also known as the p -residual subgroup .

As these are weaker conditions on the groups K, one obtains the containments E p ( G ) ⊇ ⊇ A p ( G ) ⊇ ⊇ O p ( G ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ^{p}(G)\supseteq \mathbf {A} ^{p}(G)\supseteq \mathbf {O} ^{p}(G).} These groups have important connections to the Sylow subgroups and the transfer homomorphism, as discussed there.

Geometric structure [ edit ] An elementary observation is that one cannot have exactly 2 subgroups of index 2, as the complement of their symmetric difference yields a third. This is a simple corollary of the above discussion (namely the projectivization of the vector space structure of the elementary abelian group G / E p ( G ) ≅ ≅ ( Z / p ) k {\displaystyle G/\mathbf {E} ^{p}(G)\cong (\mathbf {Z} /p)^{k}} , and further, G does not act on this geometry, nor does it reflect any of the non-abelian structure (in both cases because the quotient is abelian).

However, it is an elementary result, which can be seen concretely as follows: the set of normal subgroups of a given index p form a projective space , namely the projective space P ( Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , Z / p ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\operatorname {Hom} (G,\mathbf {Z} /p)).} In detail, the space of homomorphisms from G to the (cyclic) group of order p, Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , Z / p ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (G,\mathbf {Z} /p),} is a vector space over the finite field F p = Z / p .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{p}=\mathbf {Z} /p.} A non-trivial such map has as kernel a normal subgroup of index p, and multiplying the map by an element of ( Z / p ) × × {\displaystyle (\mathbf {Z} /p)^{\times }} (a non-zero number mod p ) does not change the kernel; thus one obtains a map from P ( Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , Z / p ) ) := ( Hom ⁡ ⁡ ( G , Z / p ) ) ∖ ∖ { 0 } ) / ( Z / p ) × × {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (\operatorname {Hom} (G,\mathbf {Z} /p)):=(\operatorname {Hom} (G,\mathbf {Z} /p))\setminus \{0\})/(\mathbf {Z} /p)^{\times }} to normal index p subgroups. Conversely, a normal subgroup of index p determines a non-trivial map to Z / p {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /p} up to a choice of "which coset maps to 1 ∈ ∈ Z / p , {\displaystyle 1\in \mathbf {Z} /p,} which shows that this map is a bijection.

As a consequence, the number of normal subgroups of index p is ( p k + 1 − − 1 ) / ( p − − 1 ) = 1 + p + ⋯ ⋯ + p k {\displaystyle (p^{k+1}-1)/(p-1)=1+p+\cdots +p^{k}} for some k; k = − − 1 {\displaystyle k=-1} corresponds to no normal subgroups of index p . Further, given two distinct normal subgroups of index p, one obtains a projective line consisting of p + 1 {\displaystyle p+1} such subgroups.

For p = 2 , {\displaystyle p=2,} the symmetric difference of two distinct index 2 subgroups (which are necessarily normal) gives the third point on the projective line containing these subgroups, and a group must contain 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 15 , … … {\displaystyle 0,1,3,7,15,\ldots } index 2 subgroups – it cannot contain exactly 2 or 4 index 2 subgroups, for instance.
