This model is based on that a pyrolite source can produce mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) by partial melting.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It was first proposed by Ted Ringwood (1962) [ 3 ] as being 1 part basalt and 4 parts harzburgite , but later was revised to being 1 part tholeiitic basalt and 3 parts dunite .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] The term is derived from the mineral names PYR-oxene and OL-ivine .

[ 5 ] However, whether pyrolite is entirely representative of the Earth's mantle remains debated.

[ 6 ] Chemical composition and phase transition [ edit ] Fig.1 The mineral volume fraction in a pyrolitic mantle up to 1000 km depth.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Ol: olivine; Opx: orthopyroxene; Cpx: clinopyroxene; Gt: garnet; Wad: wadsleyite; Ring: ringwoodite; Pv: perovskite; Fp: ferropericlase; Ca-Pv: calcium perovskite.

The major elements composition of pyrolite is about 44.71 molar percent (mol%) SiO 2 , 3.98 % Al 2 O 3 , 8.18 % FeO, 3.17 % CaO, 38.73 % MgO, 0.13 % Na 2 O.

[ 9 ] 1) A pyrolitic Upper Mantle is mainly composed of olivine (~60 volume percent (vol%)), clinopyroxene , orthopyroxene , and garnet .

[ 7 ] Pyroxene would gradually dissolved into garnet and form majoritic garnet.

[ 10 ] 2) A pyrolitic Mantle Transition Zone is mainly composed of 60 vol% olivine-polymorphs ( wadsleyite , ringwoodite ) and ~40 vol% majoritic garnet. The top and bottom boundary of the Mantle Transition zone are mainly marked by olivine-wadsleyite transition and ringwoodite-perovskite transition, respectively.

3) A pyrolitic Lower Mantle is mainly composed of magnesium perovskite (~80 vol%), ferroperclase (~13 vol%), and calcium perovskite (~7%). In addition, post-perovskite may present at the bottom of the Lower Mantle.

Seismic velocity and density properties [ edit ] Fig. 2 Vp and Vs profiles of pyrolite along the 1600 K adiabatic geotherm [ 2 ] Fig. 3 Density profile of pyrolite along the 1600 K adiabatic geotherm [ 2 ] The P-wave and S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs) of pyrolite along the 1600 K adiabatic geotherm are shown in Fig. 2, [ 2 ] and its density profile is shown in Fig. 3.

[ 2 ] At the boundary between the Upper Mantle and the Mantle Transition Zone (~410 km), Vp, Vs, and density jump by ~6%, ~6%, and ~4% in a pyrolite model, [ 2 ] respectively, which are mainly attributed to the olivine-wadsleyite phase transition .

[ 11 ] At the boundary between the Mantle Transition Zone and the Lower Mantle, Vp, Vs, and density jump by ~3%, ~6%, and ~6% in a pyrolite model, respectively.

[ 2 ] With more elasticity parameters available, the Vp, Vs, and density profiles of pyrolite would be updated.

Shortcomings [ edit ] Whether pyrolite could represent the ambient mantle remains debated.

In the geochemical aspect, it does not satisfy trace elements or isotopic data of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts because the pyrolite hypothesis is based on major elements and some arbitrary assumptions (e.g. amounts of basalt and melting in the source).

[ 1 ] It may also violate mantle heterogeneity.

[ 12 ] In the geophysical aspect, some studies suggest that seismic velocities of pyrolite do not match well with the observed global seismic models (such as PREM ) in the Earth's interior, [ 6 ] whereas some studies support the pyrolite model.

[ 13 ] Other Mantle Rock models [ edit ] Fig. 4. Mineral proportion of a MORB-transformed eclogite at 250-500 km depth [ 14 ] There are other rock models for the Earth's mantle: (1) Piclogite: by contrast to the olivine-enriched pyrolite, piclogite is an olivine-poor model (~20% olivine) proposed to provide a better match to the seismic velocity observations in the transition zone.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The piclogite phase composition is similar as 20% olivine + 80% eclogite.

[ 17 ] (2) Eclogite , it is transformed from the Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt at a depth of ~60 km, [ citation needed ] exists in the Earth's mantle mainly within the subducted slabs. It is mainly composed of garnet and clinopyroxene (mainly omphacite ) up to ~500 km depth (Fig. 4).

(3) Harzburgite, it mainly exists under the Mid-Ocean Ridge basalt layer of the oceanic lithosphere , and can enter into the deep mantle along with the subducted oceanic lithosphere. Its phase composition is similar as pyrolite, but shows higher olivine proportion (~70 vol%) than pyrolite.

[ 18 ] Overall, pyrolite and piclogite are both rock models for the ambient mantle, eclogite and harzburgite are rock models for subducted oceanic lithosphere . Formed from partial melting of pyrolite, the oceanic lithosphere is mainly composed of the basalt layer, harzburgite layer, and depleted pyrolite from top to bottom.

[ 19 ] The subducted oceanic lithospheres contribute to the heterogeneity in the Earth's mantle because they have different composition (eclogite and harzburgite) from the ambient mantle (pyrolite).
