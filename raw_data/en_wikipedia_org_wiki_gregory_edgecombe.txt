[ 4 ] [ 5 ] He is a leading figure in understanding the evolution of arthropods , their position in animal evolution and the integration of fossil data into analyses of animal phylogeny .

[ 6 ] As a palaeontologist , he is also an authority on the systematics of centipedes – and a morphologist whose work contributes to the growth and methods of analysis of molecular datasets for inferring evolutionary relationships.

[ 6 ] [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Education [ edit ] Edgecombe was educated at Columbia University where he received a PhD in 1991 for systematic studies on the trilobite order Phacopida supervised by Niles Eldredge at the American Museum of Natural History .

[ 2 ] Career and research [ edit ] After his PhD, Edgecombe was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta , and worked as a researcher at the Australian Museum in Sydney for 14 years.

[ 6 ] In 2007, he took up the position of research leader at the Natural History Museum, London , where since 2013 he has been a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) merit researcher.

[ 6 ] With Gonzalo Giribet, he co-authored a textbook, The Invertebrate Tree of Life , published by Princeton University Press in March 2020.

Awards and honours [ edit ] Edgecombe was awarded the president's medal by the Palaeontological Association in 2011, and the Fenner Medal for distinguished research in biology by the Australian Academy of Science in 2004.

[ 6 ] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.

[ 6 ] In 2024, a new megacheiran arthropod, Lomankus edgecombei was named after Edgecombe.
