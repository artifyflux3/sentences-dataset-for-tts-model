Colorful plastic versions have become popular as children's toys: several toy sizes exist, with the original design capable of expanding from 5.9 inches (15 cm) in diameter to 30 inches (76 cm).

[ citation needed ] Description [ edit ] A Hoberman sphere typically consists of six great circles corresponding to the edges of an icosidodecahedron .  The Hoberman sphere can be unfolded by allowing certain members to spread apart.  The operation of each joint is linked to all the others in a scissors mechanism like those used to mount pantograph mirrors, or how a folding chair operates.  In larger models, this can be accomplished by feeding out a string or cable instead.

The largest existing Hoberman sphere is in the AHHAA Science Center in Tartu, Estonia . Fully expanded, it is 5.9 metres (19 ft) in diameter. The motorized sphere weighs 340 kilograms (750 lb), is constructed of aircraft-grade aluminum, and continually oscillates between its compact and expanded states. The sphere is suspended above the center's Science Court and is actuated with a computer-based motion control system. This system opens and closes the sphere in a programmed series of lyrical motions choreographed to music, lighting and special effects.

[ 1 ] An earlier, similar but slightly smaller Hoberman sphere is in the atrium of Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey . The 700-pound (320 kg) sphere, when fully expanded, measures 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter.

[ 2 ] In 1993 a smaller geodesic sphere was installed at the Swiss Science Center Technorama in Winterthur, Switzerland.
