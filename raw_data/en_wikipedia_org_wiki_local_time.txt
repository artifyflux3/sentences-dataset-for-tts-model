There is no canonical definition. Originally it was mean solar time , but since the introduction of time zones it is generally the time as determined by the time zone in effect, with daylight saving time where and when applicable.

[ 1 ] In some places this is known as standard time .

Some sources continue to use the term local time to mean solar time as opposed to standard time , but they are in the minority.  Terms such as local mean time also relate to solar time.

See also [ edit ] Local mean time Apparent solar time Local time (mathematics) Local time in the Lorentz ether theory Standard time UTC GMT References [ edit ] ^ Oxford English Dictionary . Oxford University Press.
