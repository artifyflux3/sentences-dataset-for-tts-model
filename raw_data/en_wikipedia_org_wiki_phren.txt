'mind'; plural phrenes , φρένες) is the location of thought or contemplation.

[ 1 ] The kind of mental activity conducted in the Phren involves what 20th and 21 Century Western thinkers consider both feeling and thinking; scholars have remarked that Ancient Greeks located this activity in the torso as opposed to the head .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] For example, phren is where Achilles considered his sadness about losing Briseis and his duty to join the Greeks against Troy .

[ 2 ] Phren , however, is not exclusively applied to humans. In Empedocles' system, Phren is a general psychological agent to which moral blame and praise can be extended, [ 4 ] that darts through the universe as effluences, steers and controls the cosmos in the process and is the measure of what is harmonious and what is fit to exist.

[ 5 ] It is said that it is strongest at the region found beyond the universe where strife reigns.
