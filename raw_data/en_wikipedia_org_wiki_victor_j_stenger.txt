Stenger Victor J. Stenger in 2011 Born January 29, 1935 [ 1 ] Bayonne, New Jersey , U.S.

Died August 25, 2014 (2014-08-25) (aged 79) [ 2 ] Honolulu, Hawaii , U.S.

Alma mater New Jersey Institute of Technology , UCLA Spouse Phylliss Marcia (Black) Stenger (m. 1962) Children Noelle Green, Victor Andrew Scientific career Fields Particle physics , philosophy Thesis Low Energy K + d Scattering and the I =0 KN Interaction (1963) Doctoral advisor Harold K. Ticho Victor John Stenger ( / ˈ s t ɛ ŋ ɡ ər / ; January 29, 1935 – August 25, 2014) was an American particle physicist , philosopher , author, and religious skeptic .

Following a career as a research scientist in the field of particle physics, Stenger was associated with New Atheism and he authored popular science books.

[ 3 ] He published twelve books for general audiences on physics , quantum mechanics , cosmology , philosophy , religion , atheism , and pseudoscience , including the 2007 best-seller God: The Failed Hypothesis : How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist . His final book was God and the Multiverse: Humanity's Expanding View of the Cosmos (2014). He was a regular featured science columnist for the Huffington Post .

[ 4 ] An advocate for removing the influence of religion from scientific research, commercial activity, and the political process, [ 5 ] Stenger coined the quote : "Science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings" (a reference to the September 11 attacks ).

[ 6 ] Personal life [ edit ] Victor J. Stenger was born on January 29, 1935, and raised in a working-class neighborhood of Bayonne, New Jersey . His father was a Lithuanian immigrant, and his mother was the daughter of Hungarian immigrants.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] He died on August 25, 2014, at the age of 79.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Education and employment [ edit ] Stenger attended public schools in Bayonne, New Jersey, and received a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now the New Jersey Institute of Technology ). He then moved to Los Angeles on a Hughes Aircraft Company fellowship, earning a Master of Science and PhD in physics from UCLA .

[ 9 ] He was a member of the Department of Physics at the University of Hawaii until his 2000 retirement.

[ 1 ] He held visiting positions on the faculties of the University of Heidelberg in Germany and Oxford University (twice) and was a visiting researcher at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory [ 10 ] in England , the National Nuclear Physics Laboratory in Frascati , Italy , and the University of Florence in Italy.

[ 11 ] He served as an adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado at Boulder .

[ 1 ] [ 12 ] Scientist [ edit ] Stenger's first peer-reviewed work was published in 1964, and his research career continued until his retirement in 2000. His research involved work that determined properties of gluons , quarks , strange particles, and neutrinos .

[ 9 ] [ 12 ] Stenger focused on neutrino astronomy and very high-energy gamma rays .

[ 1 ] [ 12 ] Philosopher and skeptic [ edit ] Stenger was an advocate of philosophical naturalism , skepticism , and atheism , and wrote several books and papers about the relationship between science and religion . He was a prominent critic of intelligent design and the aggressive use of the anthropic principle . He maintained that if consciousness and free will do exist, they will eventually be explained in a scientific manner that invokes neither the mystical nor the supernatural .

[ 3 ] He criticized those who invoke the perplexities of quantum mechanics in support of the paranormal , mysticism , or supernatural phenomena , writing several books and articles to debunk contemporary pseudoscience .

[ 13 ] Stenger took part in the 2008 "Origins Conference" hosted by the Skeptics Society at the California Institute of Technology [ 12 ] and debated Hugh Ross on the topic of whether science supports belief in existence of God .

[ 14 ] In 1992, Uri Geller sued Stenger and Prometheus Books for $4 million, claiming defamation for questioning his " psychic powers." The suit was dismissed and Geller was ordered to pay court costs .

[ 15 ] Astronomer Luke Barnes argued in a 2012 paper that many of Stenger's claims about fine-tuning were problematic and that his arguments were fallacious.

[ 16 ] Stenger responded that Barnes misunderstood and misrepresented his positions.

[ 17 ] Professional and community positions [ edit ] President, 1990–1994, Hawaiian Humanists Member of Editorial Board, Free Inquiry Member of Society of Humanist Philosophers Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry [ 18 ] Fellow of the Center for Inquiry President, 2002–2006, Colorado Citizens for Science Publications by Stenger [ edit ] Books for general audiences [ edit ] Not by Design: The Origin of the Universe , Prometheus Books, 1988, p. 202, ISBN 978-0-87975-451-8 , archived from the original on 2014-08-12 , retrieved 2014-07-18 Physics and Psychics: The Search for a World Beyond the Senses , Prometheus Books, 1990, p. 323, ISBN 978-0-87975-575-1 , archived from the original on 2014-10-19 , retrieved 2014-07-18 The Unconscious Quantum: Metaphysics in Modern Physics and Cosmology , Prometheus Books, 1995, pp.
