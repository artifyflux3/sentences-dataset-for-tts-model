The number density (symbol: n or ρ N ) is an intensive quantity used to describe the degree of concentration of countable objects ( particles , molecules , phonons , cells , galaxies , etc.) in physical space: three-dimensional volumetric number density , two-dimensional areal number density , or one-dimensional linear number density .

Population density is an example of areal number density. The term number concentration (symbol: lowercase n , or C , to avoid confusion with amount of substance indicated by uppercase N ) is sometimes used in chemistry for the same quantity, particularly when comparing with other concentrations .

Definition [ edit ] Volume number density is the number of specified objects per unit volume : [ 1 ] n = N V , {\displaystyle n={\frac {N}{V}},} where N is the total number of objects in a volume V .

Here it is assumed [ 2 ] that N is large enough that rounding of the count to the nearest integer does not introduce much of an error , however V is chosen to be small enough that the resulting n does not depend much on the size or shape of the volume V because of large-scale features.

Area number density is the number of specified objects per unit area , A : n ′ = N A , {\displaystyle n'={\frac {N}{A}},} Similarly, linear number density is the number of specified objects per unit length , L : n ″ = N L , {\displaystyle n''={\frac {N}{L}},} Column number density is a kind of areal density, the number or count of a substance per unit area, obtained integrating volumetric number density along a vertical path: n c ′ = ∫ ∫ n d s .

{\displaystyle n'_{c}=\int n\,\mathrm {d} s.} It's related to column mass density , with the volumetric number density replaced by the volume mass density.

Units [ edit ] In SI units, number density is measured in m −3 , although cm −3 is often used. However, these units are not quite practical when dealing with atoms or molecules of gases , liquids or solids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure , because the resulting numbers are extremely large (on the order of 10 20 ). Using the number density of an ideal gas at 0 °C and 1 atm as a yardstick : n 0 = 1 amg = 2.686 7774 × 10 25 m −3 is often introduced as a unit of number density, for any substances at any conditions (not necessarily limited to an ideal gas at 0 °C and 1 atm ).

[ 3 ] Usage [ edit ] Using the number density as a function of spatial coordinates , the total number of objects N in the entire volume V can be calculated as N = ∭ ∭ V n ( x , y , z ) d V , {\displaystyle N=\iiint _{V}n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm {d} V,} where d V = d x d y d z is a volume element. If each object possesses the same mass m 0 , the total mass m of all the objects in the volume V can be expressed as m = ∭ ∭ V m 0 n ( x , y , z ) d V .

{\displaystyle m=\iiint _{V}m_{0}n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm {d} V.} Similar expressions are valid for electric charge or any other extensive quantity associated with countable objects. For example, replacing m with q (total charge) and m 0 with q 0 (charge of each object) in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.

The number density of solute molecules in a solvent is sometimes called concentration , although usually concentration is expressed as a number of moles per unit volume (and thus called molar concentration ).

Relation to other quantities [ edit ] Molar concentration [ edit ] For any substance, the number density can be expressed in terms of its amount concentration c (in mol /m 3 ) as n = N A c {\displaystyle n=N_{\rm {A}}c} where N A is the Avogadro constant . This is still true if the spatial dimension unit, metre, in both n and c is consistently replaced by any other spatial dimension unit, e.g. if n is in cm −3 and c is in mol/cm 3 , or if n is in L −1 and c is in mol/L, etc.

Mass density [ edit ] For atoms or molecules of a well-defined molar mass M (in kg /mol), the number density can sometimes be expressed in terms of their mass density ρ m (in kg/m 3 ) as n = N A M ρ ρ m .

{\displaystyle n={\frac {N_{\rm {A}}}{M}}\rho _{\mathrm {m} }.} Note that the ratio M / N A is the mass of a single atom or molecule in kg.
