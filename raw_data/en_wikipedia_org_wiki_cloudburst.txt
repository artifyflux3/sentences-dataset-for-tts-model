Cloudbursts can quickly dump large amounts of water, e.g. 25 mm of the precipitation corresponds to 25,000 metric tons per square kilometre (1 inch corresponds to 72,300 short tons over one square mile). However, cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air, resulting in sudden condensation . At times, a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst. The term "cloudburst" arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst, resulting in rapid precipitation. Though this idea has since been disproven, the term remains in use.

Properties [ edit ] Rainfall rate equal to or greater than 100 millimetres (3.9 in) per hour is a cloudburst.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] However, different definitions are used, e.g. the Swedish weather service SMHI defines the corresponding Swedish term "skyfall" as 1 millimetre (0.039 in) per minute for short bursts and 50 millimetres (2.0 in) per hour for longer rainfalls. The associated convective cloud can extend up to a height of 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) above the ground.

[ 4 ] During a cloudburst, more than 20 millimetres (0.79 in) of rain may fall in a few minutes. The results of cloudbursts can be disastrous. Cloudbursts are also responsible for flash flood creation.

Rapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the Langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly. It is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain, they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation.

Detection and forecasting [ edit ] While satellites are extensively useful in detecting large-scale weather systems and rainfall, the resolution of the precipitation from these satellites are usually worse than the area of cloudbursts, and hence they go undetected.

[ 5 ] Weather forecast models also face a similar challenge in simulating the clouds at a high resolution. The skillful forecasting of rainfall in hilly regions remains challenging due to the uncertainties in the interaction between the moisture convergence and the hilly terrain, the cloud microphysics, and the heating-cooling mechanisms at different atmospheric levels.

[ 12 ] In July 1970, the Alaknanda valley witnessed a major flood, This was attributed to a cloudburst on the night of 20 July 1970 on the southern mountain front in the Alaknanda valley (between Joshimath and Chamoli). According to an estimate, floods transported about 15.9 × 10 6 tonnes of sediment within a day. The catastrophe was so large that it wiped out the leftover of the 1894 Gohna lake. In addition, a roadside settlement between Pipalkoti and Helong called Belakuchi in the Alaknanda valley was washed away along with a convoy of 30 buses, by the roaring Alaknanda river. However, around 400 pilgrims route to Badrinath, were saved due to the alertness of a police constable who guided them to run uphill.
