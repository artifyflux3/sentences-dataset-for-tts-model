The organization also encourages professional growth through certification, peer-reviewed publications, conferences, and working groups .

The Society supports the belief that wildlife, in its myriad forms, is basic to the maintenance of a human culture that provides quality living.

[ citation needed ] Overview [ edit ] The Wildlife Society, initially known as The Society of Wildlife Specialists, was launched at the North American Wildlife Conference in Washington, D.C., in 1936.  A year later, in St. Louis, Missouri , the Specialists became The Wildlife Society.  A constitution and bylaws were adopted in 1937, and the Society was incorporated on March 25, 1948.

[ 1 ] Over time, The Wildlife Society has broadened its programs beyond its original focus on scientific publications to include education and certification of wildlife biologists and advocacy.

Publications [ edit ] The society publishes three scientific journals: Journal of Wildlife Management , Wildlife Society Bulletin , and Wildlife Monographs . In addition to these scholarly journals, the Society publishes The Wildlife Professional , a popular magazine for members. Other important publications include technical reviews featuring analyses of current issues in wildlife conservation that are written by expert panels.
