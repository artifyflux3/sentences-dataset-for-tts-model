[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Work [ edit ] Page's work focuses on quantum cosmology and theoretical gravitational physics, and he is noted for being a doctoral student of Stephen Hawking , who was at Caltech during 1974-1975, in addition to publishing several journal articles with him.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Page got his BA at William Jewell College in the United States in 1971, attaining an MS in 1972 and a PhD in 1976 at Caltech .

[ 6 ] His professional career started as a research assistant in Cambridge from 1976-1979, followed by an assistant professorship at Penn State from 1979-1983, and then an associate professor at Penn State until 1986 before taking on the title of professor in 1986. Page spent four more years at Penn State before moving to become a professor at the University of Alberta in Canada in 1990.

In 1993, he argued that if a black hole starts in a pure quantum state and evaporates completely by a unitary process , the von Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation initially increases and then decreases back to zero when the black hole has disappeared.

[ 7 ] This is known as the Page curve, and the turnover point of the curve the Page time.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] For many researchers, deriving the Page curve is synonymous with solving the famous black hole information paradox .

[ 10 ] : 291 Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2012, Page became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada .

[ 11 ] Religious views [ edit ] Page is an Evangelical Christian . In commenting on the debate between William Lane Craig and Sean Carroll in 2014, he states in a guest post on Carroll's website that: "...in view of all the evidence, including both the elegance of the laws of physics, the existence of orderly sentient experiences, and the historical evidence, I do believe that God exists and think the world is actually simpler if it contains God than it would have been without God." [ 12 ] In the same post he criticises William Lane Craig's Kalam Cosmological Argument , saying that it "is highly dubious metaphysically, depending on contingent intuitions [i.e. the first premise] we have developed from living in a universe with relatively simple laws of physics and with a strong thermodynamic arrow of time."

Glossary. Page curve: Consider a spacetime with a black hole formed by the collapse of a pure state. Surround the black hole by an imaginary sphere whose radius is a few Schwarzschild radii. The Page curve is a plot of the fine-grained entropy outside of this imaginary sphere, where we subtract the contribution of the vacuum. Since the black hole Hawking radiates and the Hawking quanta enter this faraway region, this computes the fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation as a function of time. Notice that the regions inside and outside the imaginary sphere are open systems. The curve begins at zero when no Hawking quanta have entered the exterior region, and ends at zero when the black hole has completely evaporated and all of the Hawking quanta are in the exterior region. The "Page time" corresponds to the turnover point of the curve.
