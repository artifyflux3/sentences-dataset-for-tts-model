2010 [ 1 ] (l-r) US Navy Secretary (and Har­vard Over­seer ) George Meyer ; Prof.

Frank W. Taussig ; Pres.

Eliot (who dis­dained aca­dem­ic regal­ia); [ 2 ] Bishop (and Over­seer) William Lawrence (1911) What was originally called Harvard
Colledge [ 3 ] (around which Harvard University eventually grew) [ 4 ] held its first Commence­ment in September 1642, when nine degrees were conferred.

[ 5 ] Today some 1700 under­grad­uate degrees, and 5000 advanced degrees from the university's various graduate and professional schools, are conferred each Commence­ment Day.

As of 2024, [ 6 ] each degree candidate attends two ceremonies: the Morning Exercises, at which degrees are conferred verbally en masse ; a smaller midday ceremony (at the candidate's professional or graduate school, or undergraduate House) at which diplomas are given in hand.

The ceremonies shifted from late summer to late June in the nineteenth century, [ note 1 ] and are now held at the end of May.

[ 9 ] A number of unusual traditions have attached to them over the centuries, including the arrival of certain dignitaries on horseback, occupancy by Harvard's president of the Holyoke Chair (a "bizarre" sixteenth-century contraption prone to tipping over) and the welcoming of newly minted bachelors to "the fellowship of educated men and women." Commencement week [ edit ] Harvard's Commencement Day, on which degrees are conferred, is the highlight of several days of events such as receptions, dinners, concerts, literary exercises, miscellaneous ceremonies, a baccalaureate service , and Class Day events.

[ further explanation needed ] .

[ 10 ] The annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association, long convened on the afternoon of Commencement Day, was moved in 2022 to the week following.

[ 11 ] Daybreak rituals [ edit ] Seating for degree candidates in Tercentenary Theatre , with banners displaying arms of the various graduate and professional schools, and upperclass houses. Beyond the trees are the columns of Widener Library .

Most upperclass Houses have preliminary rituals of their own. At Lowell House , for example, a perambulating bagpiper alerts seniors at 6:15 am for a 6:30 breakfast in the House dining hall with members of the Senior Common Room , after which all process (along with members of Eliot House , who have been similarly roused) to Memorial Church for a chapel service at 7:45.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Morning Exercises [ edit ] Morning Exercises are held in the central green of Harvard Yard (known as Tercentenary Theatre ); [ citation needed ] the dais is before the steps of Memorial Church , facing Widener Library .

[ note 2 ] Some 32,000 people attend the event, including university officials, civic dignitaries, faculty, honorees, alumni, family and guests. Degree candidates wear cap and gown or other academic regalia (see Academic regalia of Harvard University ).

[ 16 ] Academic Parade [ edit ] The first to enter are candidates for graduate and professional degrees, followed by alumni and alumnae.
Candidates for under­grad­uate degrees enter next, traditionally removing headgear as they pass the John Harvard statue en route.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Finally comes the Presi­dent's Procession, as follows: [ 5 ] [ 19 ] the sheriffs of Middlesex and Suffolk counties [ note 3 ] (who have earlier entered the Yard‍—‌in morning coats , top hats , and striped pants with swords and scab­bards ‍—‌through the Johnston Gate , riding white horses); [ 20 ] [ 8 ] the University Marshal , [ note 4 ] escorting the Presi­dent and any former Harvard presi­dents in attendance; the Fellows of Harvard College ; the Honorable and Rever­end the Board of Overseers ; the Governor of the Common­wealth of Massa­chu­setts [ note 3 ] (who as of 1971 no longer arrives on horseback with armed, mounted escorts); [ note 5 ] candidates for honorary degrees (whose identities are announced only on the day itself) with their faculty escorts; the sundry deans and vice-presidents of the university; the faculty , according to rank ; remaining officers of the university; [ clarification needed ] former Fellows and Overseers, former faculty, former officers of the alumni/​alumnae associations; the Phi Beta Kappa Presi­dent and Orator; the Trustee of The Charity of Edward Hopkins ; the "teaching elders [ministers] of the sixe [historically] next adjoining townes, that is Cambridge , Water­towne , Char­les­towne , Boston , Roxberry , and Dorches­ter ", [ 28 ] and clergy of the "Old Cambridge" churches; [ clarification needed ] consuls to Boston; [ clarification needed ] state and federal judges; [ who?

] past recipients of honorary degrees; public officials; [ clarification needed ] other guests.

[ clarification needed ] Holyoke Chair [ edit ] The "bizarre" Holyoke Chair, reserved for Harvard's president At Cambridge. Is kept in the College there.

Seems but little the worse for wear.

That's remarkable when I say It was old in President Holyoke's day.

Oliver Wendell Holmes (1858) [ 29 ] [ 30 ] On the dais the Presi ­dent occupies the Holyoke Chair, an uncom­fort­able and treach­er­ous Elizabethan turned chair reserved for such ceremonies since at least 1770 (when it was already some two hundred years old).
Called "bizarre ... with a complex frame and top-heavy superstructure", its "square framework set on the single rear post makes [it] tip over easily to either side." [ 31 ] A stabilizing "fin" was added at the rear sometime in the 20th century.

[ 32 ] "It was just uncomfortable. I don’t know how to describe it," recalled Derek Bok , Harvard's 25th president (1971–1991), whose mother embroidered a "much-needed" cushion for use with it.

[ 32 ] Said the Harvard Gazette in 2007: When the chair holds its robed occupant, onlookers cannot detect the odd geometry by which its triangular seat points toward a square back rippling with knobby dowels and finials. Perhaps by striking their own precarious balance in this strange seat of authority, the successors of Edward Holyoke [Harvard's president 1737–1769] come to sense what the job is all about.

[ note 6 ] Ceremonies [ edit ] 1947 honorands: J.

Robert Oppen­heim­er (left), George C. Mar­shall (third left, speak­ing with Pres.

James B. Conant ), Omar N. Bradley (third right), T.

S. Eliot (2nd right).

At the University Marshal's call ("Mister Sheriff, pray give us order") the Middlesex Sheriff takes to the dais, strikes it thrice with the butt of his staff, and intones, "The meeting will be in order." [ 8 ] Three student speakers (Under­grad­uate English, Under­grad­uate Latin, and Graduate English) are introduced and deliver their addresses.

[ clarification needed ] Then, according to the order in which the various graduate and professional schools were created, [ citation needed ] the dean of each school steps forward to present, en masse, that school's degree candidates.
Each group stands for the President's incantation conferring their degrees, which is followed by a traditional welcome or exhortation:
doctoral graduates, for example, are welcomed "to the ancient and universal company of scholars", while law graduates are reminded to "aid in the shaping and application of those wise restraints that make us free."
Last to be graduated are the bachelor's candidates, who are then welcomed to "the fellowship of educated men and women." [ 5 ] Honorary degrees are then bestowed.
Finally, all rise to sing "The Harvard Hymn", [ 34 ] [ 35 ] expressing the hope ( Integri sint curatores, Eruditi professores, Largiantur donatores ‍—‌printed
lyrics are supplied) [ 36 ] that the trustees, faculty and benefactors will manifest (respectively) integrity, wisdom, and generosity.

[ 37 ] After a benediction is said, the Middlesex Sheriff declares the ceremony closed and the Presi­dent's Procession  departs.

Once the dais is clear the Harvard Band strikes up and the Memorial Church bell commences to peal, [ 35 ] joined by bells throughout Cambridge for most of the following hour.

Order of the Exercises (1801) opening with "A Saluta­tory Oration in Latin" Mid-day ceremonies [ edit ] Seniors entering Sanders Theatre for Class Day exercises (late 19th or early 20th century) After the Morning Exercises, each graduate or professional school, and each upperclass House, holds a smaller ceremony (with luncheon) at which its member-graduates are called forward by name to receive their diplomas in hand.

Alumni Association meeting and afternoon addresses [ edit ] For many years, at the afternoon meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association, the Presi­dent and the Commence­ment Day speaker delivered their addresses. However, in 2022, the Alumni Association meeting was moved to a week after commencement, as cancellations during COVID "helped lead to the re-thinking about purpose and forums." [ 38 ] US Secretary of State (and former Army general) George C. Marshall 's address at the 1947 commencement famously outlined a plan (soon known as the Marshall Plan ) for the economic revival of post–World War II Europe.

[ 39 ] Historical notes [ edit ] Sheriffs [ edit ] Lionel de Jersey Harvard (r) with fellow seniors, 1915 Outside Sever Gate , 2015 "Our fathers ... closely associated the thirst for learning and that for beer", a 1924 Harvard history observed, [ 5 ] so that (a modern survey continued) the sheriffs' presence at Commencements "has a practical origin. Feasting, drinking, and merry­making at earlier commence­ments often got out of hand. Fights were not unheard of",
and commencements in various years have featured two-headed calves, an elephant, and Indians-versus-scholars archery competitions.

[ 8 ] Such goings-on were sufficiently common knowledge that in 1749, Bostonian William Douglass explained to a general readership that the siege and capture of Louisbourg had been "carried on in a tumultuary random Manner, and resembled a Cambridge Commence­ment." [ 5 ] Thus in 1781, For the prevention of Disorders on Commence­ment day, [the Corporation] voted that the Honble Henry Gardner Esq : and the Honble Abraham Fuller Esq: Justices of the Peace thro' the State, and Loammi Baldwin Esq : Sheriff of the County of Middlesex, be requested to give their attendance on that day ...

[ 22 ] Earlier measures had included the 1693 banning of plum cake ‍—‌the enjoyment of which, officials asserted, was unknown at other universities, "dishonourable to ye Colledge, not gratefull to Wise men, and chargable to [i.e. the fault of] ye Parents".
This was one of many efforts by Increase Mather (Harvard's president from 1692 to 1701) toward "Reformation of those excesses ... [of] Commence­ment day and weeke at the Colledge, [ sic ] so that I might [prevent] disorder and profaneness" [ 5 ] ‍—‌for Harvard officials a recurring headache.

[ note 8 ] Sartorial regulations [ edit ] To curb unseemly sartorial displays of wealth and social status [ clarification needed ] the 1807 Laws of Harvard College provided that, on Commence­ment day, [E]very Candidate for a first degree shall be clothed in a black gown, or in a coat of blue grey, a dark blue, or a black color; and no one shall wear any silk nightgown, on said day, nor any gold or silver lace, cord, or edging upon his hat, waistcoat, or any other part of his clothing, in the College, or town of Cambridge.

[ 37 ] 2024 Gaza war protest [ edit ] At least several hundred degree candidates and faculty walked out of the 2024 morning exercises to protest the denial of degrees, pending appeal, to thirteen Harvard College seniors; the degrees had been withheld due to the students' conduct during a weeks-long "encampment" in Harvard Yard protesting the Gaza–Israel conflict .
According to the Harvard undergraduate newspaper, The Crimson , the walkout had been "something of a foregone conclusion ... so widely expected by students and administrators alike that it could just as well have been added to the official Commencement program." [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Honorary degrees [ edit ] Several hundred [ 43 ] Harvard honorary degrees (which with few exceptions must be accepted in person) [ note 9 ] have been awarded since the first were awarded in 1692.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Notable recipients have included at least 14 U.S. Presidents ,  as well as numerous writers, artists, and Nobel Prize recipients.

[ 47 ] In 1984 the Harvard Corporation decided that no honorary degrees would be granted at the 1986 commencement (marking Harvard's 350th year), ending controversy over whether Ronald Reagan would be awarded a degree. A Harvard official called the decision "the only graceful way out" of the situation; Reagan was nonetheless invited to speak at the ceremony.

[ clarification needed ] [ 48 ] George Bernard Shaw [ edit ] In 1935 playwright George Bernard Shaw declined nomination for a Harvard honorary degree, urging instead that Harvard celebrate its three-hundredth anniversary by "burning itself to the ground ... as an example to all the other famous old corrupters of youth" such as Yale .

Responding to the prospect of being nominated for an honorary degree on the occasion of Harvard's Tercentenary celebration in 1936, George Bernard Shaw wrote: Dear Sir, I have to thank you for your proposal to present me as a candidate for an honorary degree of D.L.

of Harvard University at its tri-centenary celebration. But I cannot pretend that it would be fair for me to accept university degrees when every public reference of mine to our educational system, and especially to the influence of the universities on it, is fiercely hostile. If Harvard would celebrate its three hundredth anniversary by burning itself to the ground and sowing its site with salt, the ceremony would give me the greatest satisfaction as an example to all the other famous old corrupters of youth, including Yale , Oxford , Cambridge , the Sorbonne , etc. Under these circumstances I should let you down very heavily if you undertook to sponsor me.

A handwritten postscript read: "I appreciate the friendliness of your attitude." [ 49 ] Commencement speakers [ edit ] This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items .

"The difference between 365 years and 356 commencements is accounted for by wars and plagues that cancelled the event." [ 8 ] ^ [ 14 ] Early commencements were held in a variety of locations, all indoors. They were held in Sanders Theatre from 1874 until 1916, when they were moved to Harvard Stadium ; in 1922 they were moved to their present venue.

[ 15 ] ^ a b The governor and sheriffs are among several public officials, not otherwise affiliated with Harvard, who have long taken part in the ceremonies.

[ clarification needed ] [ 22 ] By tradition the Middlesex Sheriff closes the ceremony by crying, "The meeting is adjourned," though in 1997 Sheriff James DiPaola , "in his first Harvard Commence­ment and clearly enjoying his role, wanted more lines. At the end he boomed, 'Marshal ! As the sheriff of Middlesex County, I have news! The meeting is adjourned !

' " [ 23 ] Not all outside participants have been wholeheartedly enthusiastic.
In the 1930s Governor Paul Dever , [ when?

] to the chagrin of Harvard officials and alumni, shunned the pre­scribed morning coat for a regular tuxedo and straw hat, and Governor James Michael Curley [ when?

] appeared in silk stockings, knee britches, powdered wig, and a tricorn hat with plume.
(When challenged by Harvard officials‍—‌"the story goes", according to the Harvard Crimson ‍—‌Curley produced the Massachusetts Bay Colony's statutes covering Harvard Commence­ment dress, and on the basis of its authority claimed to be the only person present who was properly attired.) In 1970 Middlesex Sheriff John J. Buckley objected to the traditional costume he would be required to wear. After Suffolk Sheriff Thomas S. Eisenstadt was asked to open and close in Buckley's stead, Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci mused, "Now I see they're going to have Tom Eisenstadt march with the sword. Where is he going to get a sword unless he borrows one from the Don Juan Drum and Bugle Corps?" [ 24 ] (The Don Juan Drum an Bugle Corps – now inactive – was a competitive junior drum and bugle corps founded by Vellucci and his wife in 1965.) [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] ^ "[ Morris Hicky Morgan ] was the first regular University Marshal, with the title of Marshal of Commence­ment from 1896 to 1908 and of University Marshal until his death in March 1910. A Chief Marshal had been appointed for the Bicentennial Celebration in 1836 and for the 250th Celebration in 1886. It has not been discovered who ran ordinary academic exercises before 1896; probably an ad hoc Marshal was appointed," wrote Mason Hammond in the Harvard Library bulletin.

[ 21 ] ^ "As recently as Francis Sargent 's 1970 attendance, the Governor of Massachusetts traditionally arrived at Commence­ment with 17th-century mounted, scarlet-coated guard, which escorted him from the State House to the Johnston Gate. The guard bore pikes, somewhat less useful today than when Governor Thomas Dudley rode to the first Commence­ment despite warnings of possible ambush by Indians." [ 5 ] ^ [ 29 ] Measuring 46.5 in (118 cm) high and 32.5 in (83 cm) wide, its seat about 20 inches (51 cm) from the floor and about as deep, the Holyoke Chair is thought to have been made in England or Wales between 1550 and 1600.

[ 31 ] "[A] display of virtuoso turning ," it was bought for Harvard by Holyoke, who saw it as "suitable to the authority of the presi­dent and establishing an iconographic link between Harvard College and its late-medieval English prototypes, Oxford and Cambridge," in the words of Jonathan Fairbanks and Robert Trent.
Although the "thronelike quality [lends] an official air, [chairs of this design] were undoubtedly domestic chairs originally", [ 31 ] and indeed (according to a 1903 New York Times article) its use by Holyoke was at first "merely as a serviceable piece of every-day furniture." [ 33 ] Even after its first recorded ceremonial use (at the 1770 installation of Presi­dent Samuel Locke ) the Presi­dent's Chair "used to stand in the Harvard library [ Gore Hall ], where, according to tradition, it gave a student the right to kiss any young woman whom he was showing through the college and who thoughtlessly sat down on it. Whether or not the privilege was often or ever taken advantage of the present generation has no means of knowing." [ 33 ] The Fogg Museum now has custody between ceremonial uses.
