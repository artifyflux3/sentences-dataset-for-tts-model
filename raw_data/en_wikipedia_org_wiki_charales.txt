Stoneworts Chara globularis Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae Division: Charophyta Class: Charophyceae Order: Charales Families [ 1 ] See text Charales is an order of freshwater green algae in the division Charophyta , class Charophyceae , commonly known as stoneworts . Depending on the treatment of the genus Nitellopsis , living (extant) species are placed into either one family ( Characeae ) or two (Characeae and Feistiellaceae ). Further families are used for fossil members of the order.

Linnaeus established the genus Chara in 1753.

in a spring pond in Germany Taxonomy [ edit ] The higher level classification of green algae was unsettled as of February 2022 [update] .

[ 2 ] AlgaeBase places Charales within the class Charophyceae and its circumscription of the division Charophyta .

[ 1 ] Families [ edit ] The number of families and their division into genera varies. As of February 2022 [update] , AlgaeBase accepts two families containing some extant species and four families containing only fossil species: [ 1 ] Characeae S.F.Gray Feistiellaceae Schudack † Aclistocharaceae X.G.Zhou (may be included in Characeae [ 3 ] ) † Atopocharaceae R.E.Peck (may be included in Clavatoraceae [ 3 ] ) † Clavatoraceae Pia † Porocharaceae Grambast AlgaeBase places the genus Nitellopsis , which has both extant and extinct species, in the family Feistiellaceae .

[ 4 ] Other sources place Nitellopsis in the family Characeae, [ 5 ] with Feistiellaceae containing only fossil species, [ 6 ] so that all extant species are in the family Characeae. The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera accepts a further three extinct families: [ 3 ] † Eocharaceae Grambast † Palaeocharaceae Pia † Raskyellaceae Grambast Fossil record [ edit ] Body fossils of representatives of the order Charales do exist, but are rare.

[ 7 ] The fossil record of the Charales consists mostly of gyrogonites , that is, calcified fructifications or, more exactly, calcified spiral cells surrounding the oospores. It may be noted that the gyrogonites are studied by palaeontologists , but not often destroyed (using acids) during neontological research to liberate the oospores.

[ 8 ] The oldest known representative of the Charales is Eochara wickendenii Choquette from the Middle Devonian.

[ 9 ] The family Characeae starts dominating the fossil assemblages in the Paleogene or perhaps already in the Late Cretaceous .
