Described by Aaron Krister Johnson as "a well-known creative force in the world of online microtonal music", he is most known for his compositions which combine aspects of electronic dance music with microtonality .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] As a child, Archibald was inspired by music in video games such as Chrono Trigger , Streets of Rage , and Sonic the Hedgehog . He would then go on to discover microtonality as a teenager by listening to gamelan music and Aphex Twin . At age 16 he began officially releasing music online and released his first solo album at age 20.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He first gained notoriety in the microtonal music scene with his 2010 release Golden Hour .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Sevish's 2011 xenharmonic dance album, Subversio , created in collaboration with Tony Dubshot and Jacky Ligon, was described by Andrew Hugill as " dub meets microtonal tunings".

[ 7 ] Since most instruments in the West are built to play the 12-tone equal tempered scale , Archibald turned to less common instruments and methods of composing microtonal music. He now uses an AXiS-49 hexagonal MIDI controller to play his microtonal music, along with various DAWs such as Ableton Live , Bitwig Studio (on a Linux system [ 8 ] ), and Max/MSP .

[ 1 ] The tuning systems he uses to create his music include 22-EDO , 15-EDO , 10-EDO , 13 limit just intonation , the Bohlen-Pierce scale, Pelog tuning, and many others.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] Adam Hart of the University of Salford said that his compositions "do not indicate a desire to move away from the archetypes of established EDM genres, but rather to explore alternative tunings through familiar stylistic approaches".

[ 4 ] Archibald has expressed a desire to make microtonality more widely consumed by the public, creating multiple side projects to achieve this goal. He is the creator and host of Now&Xen, a podcast about microtonal music. In 2010 he founded his own record label, split-notes , which is focused on promoting music which uses microtonal scales, alternative tuning systems , and xenharmonics .
