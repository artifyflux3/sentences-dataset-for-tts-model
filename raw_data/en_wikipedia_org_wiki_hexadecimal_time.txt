The proposed figures on the right are based on rotations of those on the left (assigning value 10 to symbol 9).

A hexadecimal clock-face (using the Florence meridian ) Hexadecimal time is the representation of the time of day as a hexadecimal number in the interval [0, 1].

The day is divided into 10 16 (16 10 ) hexadecimal hours, each hour into 100 16 (256 10 ) hexadecimal minutes, and each minute into 10 16 (16 10 ) hexadecimal seconds.

History [ edit ] This time format was proposed by the Swedish-American engineer John W. Nystrom in 1863 as part of his tonal system .

[ 1 ] In 1997, the American Mark Vincent Rogers of Intuitor proposed a similar system of hexadecimal time and implemented it in JavaScript as the Hexclock.

[ 2 ] Implementation [ edit ] A day is unity, or 1 , and any fraction thereof can be shown with digits to the right of the hexadecimal separator .  So the day begins at midnight with .0000 and one hexadecimal second after midnight is .0001 .  Noon is .8000 (one half), one hexadecimal second before was .7FFF and one hexadecimal second before next midnight will be .FFFF .

Intuitor-hextime may also be formatted with an underscore separating hexadecimal hours, minutes and seconds.
