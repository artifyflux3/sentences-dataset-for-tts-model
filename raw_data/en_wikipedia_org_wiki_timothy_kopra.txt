These ancestors include Johann Philipp and Anna Catharina Finckel, who were members of the first group of Palatine Germans who settled in Germantown in the Hudson Valley in 1710. In 1981, Kopra was photographed singing on stage and playing trombone for Austin, Texas punk funk band Big Boys .

Military career [ edit ] Kopra received his commission as a second lieutenant from the U.S. Military Academy in May 1985 and was designated as an Army aviator in August 1986. He then completed a three-year assignment at Fort Campbell , Kentucky , where he served as an aeroscout platoon leader, troop executive officer, and squadron adjutant in the 101st Airborne Division 's air cavalry squadron. In 1990, he was assigned to the 3rd Armored Division in Hanau, Germany , and was deployed to the Middle East in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm . He completed his tour in Germany as an attack helicopter company commander and an operations officer. Kopra retired from the U.S. Army in November 2010.

NASA career [ edit ] Kopra was assigned to NASA at the Johnson Space Center in September 1998 as a vehicle integration test engineer. In this position, he primarily served as an engineering liaison for Space Shuttle launch operations and International Space Station hardware testing. He was actively involved in the contractor tests of the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) interfaces for each of the space station truss segments.
Selected as a mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, Kopra reported for Astronaut Candidate Training the following month. He then completed the initial two years of intensive Space Shuttle and ISS training, scientific and technical briefings, and T-38 flight training. Kopra was also assigned technical duties in the Space Station Branch of the Astronaut Office, where his primary focus was the testing of crew interfaces for two future ISS modules as well as the implementation of support computers and operational Local Area Network on International Space Station .

In September 2006, Kopra served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 11 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory , living and working underwater for seven days.

[ 6 ] Expedition 20 [ edit ] Kopra making a spacewalk during the STS-127 mission.

Kopra spent a little less than 60 days as a flight engineer of Expedition 20 on the ISS, arriving aboard the station aboard space shuttle Endeavour on the STS-127 mission and returning to Earth aboard space shuttle Discovery on the STS-128 mission.  He participated in the first spacewalk of the STS-127 mission.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Kopra was assigned to fly on STS-133 , the final flight of the Discovery . He lost that assignment when he was injured in a bicycle accident, possibly breaking his hip. He was replaced by Stephen G. Bowen .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Expedition 46/47 [ edit ] Kopra in the Cupola Kopra served as commander of the ISS, with Soyuz TMA-19M , as part of Expedition 46 / 47 . During a spacewalk on January 15, 2016, Kopra's spacesuit began to leak water into his helmet causing the walk to be cut short. The suit he was using is the same suit that had developed a more serious water leak during a spacewalk by Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano .

[ 11 ] Kopra returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-19M and landed 18 June 2016 09:15 UTC, [ 12 ] after spending 186 days in space.
