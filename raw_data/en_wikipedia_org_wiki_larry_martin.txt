[ 1 ] Among Martin's work is research on the Triassic reptile Longisquama and theropod dinosaur (or fossil bird) Caudipteryx and Dakotaraptor .   According to the University of Kansas, he "has been a leading opponent of the theory that birds are 'living dinosaurs.'" [ citation needed ] Later he acknowledged a correlation and further contributed. 
He has also appeared in a few television documentaries about dinosaurs, including Jurassic Fight Club .

He died of cancer at the age of 69 on March 9, 2013, after a long battle with the disease.
