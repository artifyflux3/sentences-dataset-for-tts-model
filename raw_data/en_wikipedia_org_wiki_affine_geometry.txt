In affine geometry, one uses [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom") to find the line through C1 and parallel to B1B2, and to find the line through B2 and parallel to B1C1: their intersection C2 is the result of the indicated translation.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **affine geometry** is what remains of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") when ignoring (mathematicians often say "forgetting"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-2)) the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") notions of [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(mathematics) "Distance (mathematics)") and [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle").

As the notion of _[parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel\_lines "Parallel lines")_ is one of the main properties that is independent of any metric, affine geometry is often considered as the study of parallel lines. Therefore, [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom") (Given a line L and a point P not on L, there is exactly one line parallel to L that passes through P.) is fundamental in affine geometry. Comparisons of figures in affine geometry are made with [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation"), which are mappings that preserve alignment of points and parallelism of lines.

Affine geometry can be developed in two ways that are essentially equivalent.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-3)

In [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") is a set of _points_ to which is associated a set of lines, which satisfy some [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") (such as Playfair's axiom).

Affine geometry can also be developed on the basis of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"). In this context an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") is a set of _points_ equipped with a set of _transformations_ (that is [bijective mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_mapping "Bijective mapping")), the [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), which forms a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") (over a given [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), commonly the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")), and such that for any given [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of points there is a unique translation sending the first point to the second; the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") of two translations is their sum in the vector space of the translations.

In more concrete terms, this amounts to having an operation that associates to any ordered pair of points a vector and another operation that allows translation of a point by a vector to give another point; these operations are required to satisfy a number of axioms (notably that two successive translations have the effect of translation by the sum vector). By choosing any point as "[origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)")", the points are in [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") with the vectors, but there is no preferred choice for the origin; thus an affine space may be viewed as obtained from its associated vector space by "forgetting" the origin (zero vector).

The idea of forgetting the metric can be applied in the theory of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). That is developed in the article _[Affine connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine\_connection "Affine connection")_.

In 1748, [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") introduced the term _affine_[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-5) (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")_affinis_'related') in his book _[Introductio in analysin infinitorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio\_in\_analysin\_infinitorum "Introductio in analysin infinitorum")_ (volume 2, chapter XVIII). In 1827, [August Möbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_M%C3%B6bius "August Möbius") wrote on affine geometry in his _Der barycentrische Calcul_ (chapter 3).

After [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")'s [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program"), affine geometry was recognized as a generalization of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-6)

In 1918, [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") referred to affine geometry for his text _Space, Time, Matter_. He used affine geometry to introduce vector addition and subtraction[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-7) at the earliest stages of his development of [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"). Later, [E. T. Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._T._Whittaker "E. T. Whittaker") wrote:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-8)

Weyl's geometry is interesting historically as having been the first of the affine geometries to be worked out in detail: it is based on a special type of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport") [...using] [worldlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldline "Worldline") of light-signals in four-dimensional space-time. A short element of one of these world-lines may be called a _[null-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null\_vector "Null vector")_; then the parallel transport in question is such that it carries any null-vector at one point into the position of a null-vector at a neighboring point.
Several axiomatic approaches to affine geometry have been put forward:

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/PappusAffine.2.svg/250px-PappusAffine.2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PappusAffine.2.svg)

Pappus' law: if the red lines are parallel and the blue lines are parallel, then the dotted black lines must be parallel.

As affine geometry deals with parallel lines, one of the properties of parallels noted by [Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") has been taken as a premise:[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-10)

*   Suppose A, B, C are on one line and A', B', C' on another. If the lines AB' and A'B are parallel and the lines BC' and B'C are parallel, then the lines CA' and C'A are parallel. (This is the affine version of [Pappus's hexagon theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem "Pappus's hexagon theorem")).

The full axiom system proposed has _point_, _line_, and _line containing point_ as [primitive notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"):

*   Two points are contained in just one line.
*   For any line L and any point P, not on L, there is just one line containing P and not containing any point of L. This line is said to be _parallel_ to L.
*   Every line contains at least two points.
*   There are at least three points not belonging to one line.

According to [H. S. M. Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._S._M._Coxeter "H. S. M. Coxeter"):

> The interest of these five axioms is enhanced by the fact that they can be developed into a vast body of propositions, holding not only in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") but also in [Minkowski's geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") of time and space (in the simple case of 1 + 1 dimensions, whereas the special theory of relativity needs 1 + 3). The extension to either Euclidean or Minkowskian geometry is achieved by adding various further axioms of orthogonality, etc.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-11)

The various types of affine geometry correspond to what interpretation is taken for _rotation_. Euclidean geometry corresponds to the [ordinary idea of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)"), while Minkowski's geometry corresponds to [hyperbolic rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_rotation "Hyperbolic rotation"). With respect to [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines, they remain perpendicular when the plane is subjected to ordinary rotation. In the Minkowski geometry, lines that are [hyperbolic-orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic-orthogonal "Hyperbolic-orthogonal") remain in that relation when the plane is subjected to hyperbolic rotation.

An axiomatic treatment of plane affine geometry can be built from the [axioms of ordered geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_geometry#Axioms_of_ordered_geometry "Ordered geometry") by the addition of two additional axioms:[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-12)

1.   ([Affine axiom of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")) Given a point A and a line r not through A, there is at most one line through A which does not meet r.
2.   ([Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_theorem "Desargues theorem")) Given seven distinct points A, A', B, B', C, C', O, such that AA', BB', CC' are distinct lines through O, and AB is parallel to A'B', and BC is parallel to B'C', then AC is parallel to A'C'.

The affine concept of parallelism forms an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on lines. Since the axioms of ordered geometry as presented here include properties that imply the structure of the real numbers, those properties carry over here so that this is an axiomatization of affine geometry over the field of real numbers.

The first [non-Desarguesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane "Non-Desarguesian plane") was noted by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") in his _Foundations of Geometry_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-13) The [Moulton plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulton_plane "Moulton plane") is a standard illustration. In order to provide a context for such geometry as well as those where [Desargues theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_theorem "Desargues theorem") is valid, the concept of a ternary ring was developed by [Marshall Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Hall_(mathematician) "Marshall Hall (mathematician)").

In this approach affine planes are constructed from ordered pairs taken from a ternary ring. A plane is said to have the "minor affine Desargues property" when two triangles in parallel perspective, having two parallel sides, must also have the third sides parallel. If this property holds in the affine plane defined by a ternary ring, then there is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") between "vectors" defined by pairs of points from the plane.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-14) Furthermore, the vectors form an [abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group") under [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_group "Additive group"); the ternary ring is linear and satisfies [right distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_distributivity "Right distributivity"):

Affine transformations
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Affine transformations")]

Geometrically, affine transformations (affinities) preserve [collinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity "Collinearity"): so they transform parallel lines into parallel lines and preserve [ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") of distances along parallel lines.

We identify as _affine theorems_ any geometric result that is [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") under the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group "Affine group") (in [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")'s [Erlangen programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_programme "Erlangen programme") this is its underlying [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of symmetry transformations for affine geometry). Consider in a vector space V, the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")GL(_V_). It is not the whole _affine group_ because we must allow also [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") by vectors v in V. (Such a translation maps any w in V to _w_ + _v_.) The affine group is generated by the general linear group and the translations and is in fact their [semidirect product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product "Semidirect product")![Image 4: {\displaystyle V\rtimes \mathrm {GL} (V).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f817e4040a3a6727fc7c27f32dd01ff3ce45816d) (Here we think of V as a group under its operation of addition, and use the defining [representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory") of GL(_V_) on V to define the semidirect product.)

For example, the theorem from the plane geometry of triangles about the concurrence of the lines joining each [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") to the [midpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint "Midpoint") of the opposite side (at the _[centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid "Centroid")_ or _[barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric\_coordinates\_(astronomy) "Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)")_) depends on the notions of _mid-point_ and _centroid_ as affine invariants. Other examples include the theorems of [Ceva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceva%27s_Theorem "Ceva's Theorem") and [Menelaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus_theorem "Menelaus theorem").

Affine invariants can also assist calculations. For example, the lines that divide the area of a triangle into two equal halves form an [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(mathematics) "Envelope (mathematics)") inside the triangle. The ratio of the area of the envelope to the area of the triangle is affine invariant, and so only needs to be calculated from a simple case such as a unit [isosceles right angled triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_right_triangle "Isosceles right triangle") to give ![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {3}{4}}\log _{e}(2)-{\tfrac {1}{2}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3bcef06764013879af5ce5d45e5455585908a10d) i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%, for all triangles.

Familiar formulas such as half the base times the height for the [area of a triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_triangle "Area of a triangle"), or a third the base times the height for the [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(geometry) "Pyramid (geometry)"), are likewise affine invariants. While the latter is less obvious than the former for the general case, it is easily seen for the one-sixth of the [unit cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cube "Unit cube") formed by a [face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)") (area 1) and the midpoint of the cube (height 1/2). Hence it holds for all pyramids, even slanting ones whose apex is not directly above the [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(geometry) "Centre (geometry)") of the base, and those with base a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") instead of a square. The formula further generalizes to pyramids whose base can be dissected into parallelograms, including [cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone") by allowing infinitely many parallelograms (with due attention to convergence). The same approach shows that a four-dimensional pyramid has [4D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space")[hypervolume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervolume "Hypervolume") one quarter the [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") volume of its [parallelepiped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped "Parallelepiped") base times the [height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height "Height"), and so on for higher dimensions.

Two types of affine transformation are used in [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), both classical and modern. [Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")_v_ is described using length and direction, where length is presumed unbounded. This variety of kinematics, styled as Galilean or Newtonian, uses coordinates of [absolute space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time "Absolute space and time"). The [shear mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping "Shear mapping") of a plane with an axis for each represents coordinate change for an observer moving with velocity _v_ in a resting [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-15)

[Finite light speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), first noted by the delay in appearance of the [moons of Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter "Moons of Jupiter"), requires a modern kinematics. The method involves [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity") instead of velocity, and substitutes [squeeze mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping "Squeeze mapping") for the shear mapping used earlier. This affine geometry was developed [synthetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry") in 1912.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-17) to express the [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity"). In 1984, "the affine plane associated to the [Lorentzian vector space _L_ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_space "Lorentz space")" was described by Graciela Birman and [Katsumi Nomizu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumi_Nomizu "Katsumi Nomizu") in an article entitled "Trigonometry in Lorentzian geometry".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-18)

Affine geometry can be viewed as the geometry of an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") of a given dimension _n_, coordinatized over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")_K_. There is also (in two dimensions) a combinatorial generalization of coordinatized affine space, as developed in [synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry")[finite geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry"). In projective geometry, _affine space_ means the complement of a [hyperplane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_at_infinity "Hyperplane at infinity") in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"). _Affine space_ can also be viewed as a vector space whose operations are limited to those linear combinations whose coefficients sum to one, for example 2 _x_ − _y_, _x_ − _y_ + _z_, (_x_ + _y_ + _z_)/3, **i**_x_ + (1 − **i**)_y_, etc.

Synthetically, [affine planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)") are 2-dimensional affine geometries defined in terms of the relations between points and lines (or sometimes, in higher dimensions, [hyperplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane")). Defining affine (and projective) geometries as [configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_configuration "Geometric configuration") of points and lines (or hyperplanes) instead of using coordinates, one gets examples with no coordinate fields. A major property is that all such examples have dimension 2. Finite examples in dimension 2 ([finite affine planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane_(incidence_geometry) "Affine plane (incidence geometry)")) have been valuable in the study of configurations in infinite affine spaces, in [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"), and in [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics").

Despite being less general than the configurational approach, the other approaches discussed have been very successful in illuminating the parts of geometry that are related to [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry").

In traditional [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), affine geometry is considered to be a study between [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") and [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"). On the one hand, affine geometry is Euclidean geometry with [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") left out; on the other hand, affine geometry may be obtained from projective geometry by the designation of a particular line or plane to represent the [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-19) In affine geometry, there is no [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") structure but the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") does hold. Affine geometry provides the basis for Euclidean structure when [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines are defined, or the basis for Minkowski geometry through the notion of [hyperbolic orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_orthogonality "Hyperbolic orthogonality").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry#cite_note-20) In this viewpoint, an [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") is a [projective transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation "Projective transformation") that does not permute finite points with points at infinity, and affine [transformation geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_geometry "Transformation geometry") is the study of geometrical properties through the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") of the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of affine transformations.
