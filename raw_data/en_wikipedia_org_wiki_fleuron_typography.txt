Fleurons are stylized forms of flowers or leaves; the term derives from the Old French : floron ('flower').

[ 2 ] Robert Bringhurst in The Elements of Typographic Style calls the forms " horticultural dingbats ".

[ 3 ] A commonly encountered fleuron is the ❦ , the floral heart or hedera (ivy leaf), also known as an aldus leaf after Italian Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius .

History [ edit ] Τypographic ornament in ancient city of Kamiros on Rhodes , Greece Flower decorations are among the oldest typographic ornaments. A fleuron can also be used to fill the white space that results from the indentation of the first line of a paragraph, [ 4 ] on a line by itself to divide paragraphs in a highly stylized way, to divide lists, or for pure ornamentation.

[ 5 ] The fleuron (as a formal glyph ) is a sixteenth century introduction.

[ 6 ] Fleurons were crafted the same way as other typographic elements were: as individual metal sorts that could be fit into the printer's compositions alongside letters and numbers. This saved the printer time and effort in producing ornamentation. Because the sorts could be produced in multiples, printers could build up borders with repeating patterns of fleurons.

Further information: Dingbat Thirty forms of fleuron have code points in Unicode . The Dingbats and Miscellaneous Symbols blocks have three fleurons that the standard calls "floral hearts" (also called "aldus leaf", "ivy leaf", "hedera" and "vine leaf"); [ 7 ] twenty-four fleurons (from the pre-Unicode Wingdings and Wingdings 2 fonts) in the Ornamental Dingbats block and three more fleurons used in archaic languages are also supported.
