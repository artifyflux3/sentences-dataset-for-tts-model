Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised‚Äîcreated by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now‚Äîor consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

A complex fleuron with thistle from a 1870 edition of _[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poems,\_Chiefly\_in\_the\_Scottish\_Dialect\_(Edinburgh\_Edition) "Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition)")_

A **fleuron** ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-1)), also known as **printers' flower**, is a [typographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic "Typographic") element, or [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph"), used either as a punctuation mark or as an ornament for typographic compositions. Fleurons are stylized forms of flowers or leaves; the term derives from the [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_language "Old French language"): _floron_ ('flower').[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-2)[Robert Bringhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bringhurst "Robert Bringhurst") in _[The Elements of Typographic Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Elements\_of\_Typographic\_Style "The Elements of Typographic Style")_ calls the forms "[horticultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture "Horticulture")[dingbats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat "Dingbat")".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-3) A commonly encountered fleuron is the ‚ù¶, the _floral heart_ or _\_[hedera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera "Hedera")\__ (ivy leaf), also known as an _aldus leaf_ after Italian Renaissance printer [Aldus Manutius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius "Aldus Manutius").

Flower decorations are among the oldest typographic ornaments. A fleuron can also be used to fill the white space that results from the [indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_(typesetting) "Indentation (typesetting)") of the first line of a paragraph,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-4) on a line by itself to divide paragraphs in a highly stylized way, to divide lists, or for pure ornamentation.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-5) The fleuron (as a formal [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph")) is a sixteenth century introduction.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-6)

Fleurons were crafted the same way as other typographic elements were: as individual metal [sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting) "Sort (typesetting)") that could be fit into the printer's compositions alongside letters and numbers. This saved the printer time and effort in producing ornamentation. Because the sorts could be produced in multiples, printers could build up borders with repeating patterns of fleurons.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleuron_(typography)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Fleurons in Unicode")]

Thirty forms of fleuron have [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"). The [Dingbats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbats_(Unicode_block) "Dingbats (Unicode block)") and [Miscellaneous Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols "Miscellaneous Symbols") blocks have three fleurons that the standard calls "floral hearts" (also called "aldus leaf", "ivy leaf", "hedera" and "vine leaf");[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)#cite_note-unicode2700-7) twenty-four fleurons (from the pre-Unicode [Wingdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings "Wingdings") and Wingdings 2 fonts) in the [Ornamental Dingbats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornamental_Dingbats "Ornamental Dingbats") block and three more fleurons used in archaic languages are also supported.
