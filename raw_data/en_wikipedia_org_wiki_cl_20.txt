N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane , also called HNIW and CL-20 , is a polycyclic nitroamine explosive with the formula C 6 H 6 N 12 O 12 . It has a better oxidizer -to- fuel ratio than conventional HMX or RDX . It releases 20% more energy than traditional HMX-based propellants.

History and use [ edit ] In the 1980s, CL-20 was developed by the China Lake facility, primarily to be used in propellants .

[ 1 ] While most development of CL-20 has been fielded by the Thiokol Corporation , the US Navy (through ONR ) has also been interested in CL-20 for use in rocket propellants , such as for missiles , as it has lower observability characteristics such as less visible smoke.

[ 2 ] Thus far, CL-20 has only been used in the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 “kamikaze” drone, but is undergoing testing for use in the Lockheed Martin [LMT] AGM-158 C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER).

[ 3 ] The Indian Armed Forces have also looked into CL-20.

[ 4 ] The Taiwanese National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology innaugerated a CL-20 production facility in 2022 with reported integration into the HF-2 and HF-3 product lines.

[ 5 ] Synthesis [ edit ] Synthesis of CL20 First, benzylamine ( 1 ) is condensed with glyoxal ( 2 ) under acidic and dehydrating conditions to yield the first intermediate compound ( 3 ).  Four benzyl groups selectively undergo hydrogenolysis using palladium on carbon and hydrogen. The amino groups are then acetylated during the same step using acetic anhydride as the solvent ( 4 ). Finally, compound 4 is reacted with nitronium tetrafluoroborate and nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate , resulting in HNIW.

[ 6 ] Cocrystals [ edit ] In August 2011, Adam Matzger and Onas Bolton published results showing that a cocrystal of CL-20 and TNT had twice the stability of CL-20—safe enough to transport, but when heated to 136 °C (277 °F) the cocrystal may separate into liquid TNT and a crystal form of CL-20 with structural defects that is somewhat less stable than CL-20.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In August 2012, Onas Bolton et al. published results showing that a cocrystal of 2 parts CL-20 and 1 part HMX had similar safety properties to HMX, but with a greater firing power closer to CL-20.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Polymeric derivatives [ edit ] In 2017, K.P. Katin and M.M. Maslov designed one-dimensional covalent chains based on the CL-20 molecules.

[ 11 ] Such chains were constructed using CH 2 molecular bridges for the covalent bonding between the isolated CL-20 fragments. It was theoretically predicted that their stability increased with efficient length growth. A year later, M.A. Gimaldinova and colleagues demonstrated the versatility of CH 2 molecular bridges.

[ 12 ] It is shown that the use of CH 2 bridges is the universal technique to connect both CL-20 fragments in the chain and the chains together to make a network (linear or zigzag). It is confirmed that the increase of the effective sizes and dimensionality of the CL-20 covalent systems leads to their thermodynamic stability growth. Therefore, the formation of CL-20 crystalline covalent solids seems to be energetically favorable, and CL-20 molecules are capable of forming not only molecular crystals but bulk covalent structures as well. Numerical calculations of CL-20 chains and networks' electronic characteristics revealed that they were wide-bandgap semiconductors.
