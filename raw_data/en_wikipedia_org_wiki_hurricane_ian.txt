Hurricane Ian Ian at peak intensity while approaching Southwest Florida on September 28 Meteorological history Formed September 23, 2022 Extratropical September 30, 2022 Dissipated October 1, 2022 Category 5 major hurricane 1-minute sustained ( SSHWS / NWS ) Highest winds 160 mph (260 km/h) Lowest pressure 937 mbar ( hPa ); 27.67 inHg Overall effects Fatalities 161 (69 direct, 92 indirect) Missing 13 Damage $112 billion (2022 USD ) ( Third-costliest tropical cyclone on record; costliest in Florida history) Areas affected Trinidad and Tobago , Venezuela , Colombia , ABC islands , Jamaica , Cayman Islands , Cuba , Southeast United States (especially Florida and The Carolinas ) IBTrACS / [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Part of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season Effects Florida Other Congressional hearing Other wikis Commons: Ian images Hurricane Ian was a devastating tropical cyclone which was the third costliest weather disaster on record worldwide. It was also the deadliest hurricane to strike the state of Florida since the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , and the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Michael in 2018.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Ian caused widespread damage across western Cuba , Florida, and the Carolinas . Ian was the ninth named storm , fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season , and was the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic since Lorenzo in 2019 .

[ 6 ] Ian originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa and across the central tropical Atlantic towards the Windward Islands . The wave moved into the Caribbean Sea on September 21 bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Trinidad and Tobago , the ABC islands , and the northern coast of South America. On the morning of September 23, the wave had enough organization to be designated as a tropical depression, after which it strengthened into Tropical Storm Ian early the next day while it was southeast of Jamaica . As Ian rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, it made landfall in western Cuba. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding across the area resulting in a nationwide power outage. Ian lost a minimal amount of strength while over land and soon re-strengthened while over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico . It peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) early on September 28, while progressing towards the west coast of Florida, and made landfall just below peak intensity in Southwest Florida on Cayo Costa Island .

[ 1 ] In doing so, Ian tied with several other storms to become the 5th-strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous U.S.

[ 7 ] After moving inland, Ian quickly weakened to a tropical storm before moving back offshore into the Atlantic. There it re-strengthened to become a hurricane once again before making its final landfall in South Carolina on September 30. Ian became an extratropical cyclone shortly after landfall and fully dissipated by early the next day.

Hurricane Ian caused 161 fatalities: 5 in Cuba, [ 3 ] 150 in Florida, [ 8 ] [ a ] 5 in North Carolina , [ 10 ] and 1 in Virginia.

[ 11 ] Ian caused catastrophic damage with losses estimated to be around $112 billion, making it the costliest hurricane in Florida's history, surpassing Irma of 2017 , as well as the third-costliest in U.S. history, behind only Katrina of 2005 and Harvey of 2017.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Much of the damage was from flooding brought about by a storm surge of 10–15 ft (3.0–4.6 m).

[ 14 ] The cities of Fort Myers , Cape Coral , and Naples were particularly hit hard, leaving millions without power in the storm's wake and numerous inhabitants forced to take refuge on their roofs.

Sanibel Island , Fort Myers Beach , and Pine Island bore the brunt of Ian's powerful winds and its accompanying storm surge at landfall, which leveled thousands of standing structures in the region and collapsed the Sanibel Causeway and the Pine Island Causeway to Pine Island, entrapping those left on the islands for several days. The destruction led to the United States Congress holding a televised investigative hearing regarding the federal government's response to and overall recovery efforts from Ian. Due to the damage and loss of life left by Ian the name was Retired after the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season and replaced by the name Idris for the 2028 season Meteorological history [ edit ] Map plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir–Simpson scale Map key Saffir–Simpson scale Tropical depression (≤38 mph, ≤62 km/h) Tropical storm (39–73 mph, 63–118 km/h) Category 1 (74–95 mph, 119–153 km/h) Category 2 (96–110 mph, 154–177 km/h) Category 3 (111–129 mph, 178–208 km/h) Category 4 (130–156 mph, 209–251 km/h) Category 5 (≥157 mph, ≥252 km/h) Unknown Storm type Tropical cyclone Subtropical cyclone Extratropical cyclone , remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression Ian originated from a tropical wave producing a large amount of showers and thunderstorms moving off the west coast of Africa on September 14–15.

[ 1 ] The wave subsequently moved westward, passing south of the Cape Verde Islands with occasional bursts of convection during the ensuing six days.

[ 1 ] On September 22, as the disturbance tracked west-northwestward it showed signs of increasing organization. Strong wind shear with 30–35 mph (45–55 km/h) winds generated by the upper-level outflow from Hurricane Fiona inhibited development into a tropical depression.

[ 15 ] A well-defined circulation was still able to form within the disturbance by 06:00 September 23; its convection then increased and became persistent overnight into the next day. As a result, it was designated Tropical Depression Nine at that time.

[ 1 ] Hurricane Ian viewed by the Expedition 67 crew on board the International Space Station on September 28 By 00:00 UTC on September 24, the depression's wind speed had increased to 40 mph (64 km/h), at which time it became Tropical Storm Ian . Moderate-to-strong vertical wind shear hindered development of Ian until late the following day; it began rapidly intensifying at 18:00 UTC September 25. Ian became a hurricane 12 hours later and a major hurricane after another 24 hours. At approximately 08:30 UTC on September 27, Ian made landfall on western Cuba as a high-end Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a pressure of 947 mbar (27.96 inHg), becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to impact Pinar del Río Province since Hurricane Gustav in 2008.

[ 1 ] [ 16 ] Ian weakened to a low-end major hurricane with 115 mph (185 km/h) winds as it emerged off the coast of Cuba and into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico around 14:00 UTC.

[ 1 ] Ian strengthened slightly once offshore, then initiated an eyewall replacement cycle causing its wind speed to remain steady at 120 mph (195 km/h) for about 12 hours.  Its central pressure continued to fall to a minimum of 947 mbar (27.96 inHg) before temporarily rising to 952 mbar (28.11 inHg) by 02:00 UTC, when it moved over the Dry Tortugas with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).

[ 1 ] Ian completed the eyewall replacement cycle shortly afterwards and began rapidly intensifying once more. By 12:00 UTC on September 28, Ian strengthened further to its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of 937 mbar (27.67 inHg) as it neared Southwest Florida , [ 1 ] despite outflow being restricted in its southwestern quadrant by moderate wind shear.

[ 17 ] Operationally, the NHC classified Ian as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), but during post-season reanalysis concluded a peak wind speed of 160 mph (260 km/h) based on stepped frequency microwave radiometer measurements of 158–159 mph (254–256 km/h) (these observations had been flagged as being unreliable operationally).

[ 1 ] At around this time, a NOAA weather drone measured wind gusts reaching up to 216 mph (348 km/h).

[ 18 ] Ian maintained its intensity for several hours before weakening to a Category 4 hurricane as it approached the coast of Florida due to worsening environmental conditions. At 19:05 UTC, Ian made landfall on Cayo Costa with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of 941 mbar (27.79 inHg), becoming the first Category 4 hurricane to impact Southwest Florida since Charley in 2004, which made landfall at the same location.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Ian then made a second landfall just south of Punta Gorda near Pirate Harbor at 20:35 UTC with 145 mph (230 km/h) winds.

[ 21 ] Ian weakened to Category 3 strength by 00:00 UTC the next day.

[ 1 ] Continual land interaction resulted in the frictional displacement of the system, and that coupled with high vertical wind shear caused Ian to quickly degrade to a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC as it moved north-northeast off of the eastern Florida coastline.

[ 1 ] At 00:00 UTC, the system's low-level circulation had completely emerged off of the coast of Florida, and although the convection was slightly offset to the north, Ian reintensified to a Category 1 hurricane at that time.

[ 1 ] The system turned northward on the morning of September 30 and accelerated toward the South Carolina coast. It strengthened some during this time, as deep convection re-developed near the center and hybrid frontal features moved away.

[ 22 ] The system made its final landfall that afternoon near Georgetown, South Carolina , at 18:05 UTC, with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Ian became extratropical a few hours later over northeastern South Carolina , and fully dissipated over central North Carolina by 12:00 UTC on October 1.

[ 1 ] Preparations [ edit ] Caribbean [ edit ] Jamaica [ edit ] The Meteorological Service of Jamaica issued tropical storm watches for the island of Jamaica on September 23. Flood warnings and marine warnings were issued simultaneously.

[ 23 ] Cayman Islands [ edit ] The government of the Cayman Islands issued hurricane watches for its three islands, Grand Cayman , Cayman Brac , and Little Cayman , on September 23 at 21:00 UTC as Ian was projected to pass over the British Overseas Territory as a hurricane.

[ 23 ] The National Emergency Operations Centre had gone into full activation mode. Along with the emergency services, the Cayman Islands Regiment and Cayman Islands Coast Guard saw the full mobilization and deployment of their personnel. In addition, the Governor of the Cayman Islands , Martyn Roper , requested for the United Kingdom to further deploy additional military assets to the islands for Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief Operations. Subsequently, HMS Medway was deployed to the Cayman Islands. Helicopters from Royal Cayman Islands Police Service were also deployed to assist in the operation. At the time one of the helicopters was deployed to the Turks and Caicos Islands before the development of Ian to assist recovery efforts there after the passage of Hurricane Fiona . The Royal Navy also deployed its helicopter to assist. Schools, universities, and education centers closed on the evening of September 23. On September 24 at 18:00 UTC, the hurricane watch for Grand Cayman was upgraded to a hurricane warning, and the hurricane watch for Cayman Brac and Little Cayman was changed to a tropical storm watch. Flood warnings along with marine warnings were also issued for Grand Cayman.

[ 24 ] The Cayman Islands Airports Authority continued operating the airports until the afternoon of September 25. Then the airports closed and the aircraft at the airports were evacuated.

[ 25 ] Cuba [ edit ] Hurricane Ian shortly after its landfall over western Cuba early on September 27 Authorities in Cuba issued evacuation orders for around 50,000 people in the Pinar del Rio province and set up around 55 shelters before the storm. State media stated that steps were being taken to protect food and crops in warehouses. Locals removed fishing boats in Havana , and city workers inspected and unclogged storm drains.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] United States [ edit ] Amtrak suspended its Auto Train service for September 27–28 and truncated the September 26 southbound Silver Star service, which was already on a modified schedule due to the suspension of the Silver Meteor service, at Jacksonville, Florida , on September 27.

Silver Star service was canceled for September 27–28 with the northbound Silver Star for September 29 also canceled.

[ 28 ] Ian's updated track forecast then prompted them to suspend those services through October 1.

[ 29 ] Palmetto service was also truncated for Washington D.C.

, on September 30 [ 30 ] and October 1.

[ 31 ] As Ian dissipated over the Carolinas , Amtrak modified its schedule, truncating the October 2 southbound Silver Star at Jacksonville, which would be the origin of the October 3 northbound Silver Star . Bus transportation was provided for Orlando and Tampa .

[ 32 ] Additionally, the resumption of the Silver Meteor service, which had been suspended since January 24, 2022, due to a resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 , was pushed back from October 3 to 11.

[ 33 ] The modified schedule and the resumption of service for the Silver Meteor was then pushed out to October 13 due to the extensive damage inflicted along the Central Florida Rail Corridor .

[ 34 ] Full resumptions of both of these services would occur over a period from October 14–17.

[ 122 ] The storm surge in Lewes, Delaware reached 3.48 ft (1.06 m), the seventh highest level on record.

[ 123 ] A separate low-pressure area formed to the northeast of Ian as it dissipated on October 1, [ 1 ] which stalled off the coast of New Jersey for nearly a week. Widespread coastal flooding occurred along the Jersey Shore , [ 124 ] with Sea Isle City receiving 8.14 inches (207 mm) of rain between October 1 and 3.

[ 125 ] In addition, Philadelphia set a daily precipitation record due to the storm on October 2, at 1.99 in (51 mm).

AccuWeather described the system as a nor'easter which produced storm surge levels comparable to those of Hurricane Sandy . The rainfall alleviated drought conditions throughout much of New Jersey, [ 123 ] and lasted until October 5. The system also produced unseasonably cold temperatures across the region, with Trenton having a maximum temperature of 53 °F (12 °C) on October 4, one degree shy of the record lowest daily high for that date.

[ 125 ] Several ferries between Cape May, New Jersey and Lewes, Delaware were canceled due to the storm on October 3.

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] On October 3, The Guardian reported 10,000 people remained unaccounted for. However, the next day, FEMA's statement did not include numbers about people remaining unaccounted for.

[ 145 ] There were sporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several businesses in Lee County, Florida; alleged thefts of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm prompted officials to enforce a curfew in the county.

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] Door-to-door scams posing as charities were carried out across the nation.

[ 148 ] According to DeSantis, Florida was working with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to use the Starlink satellite Internet service to help restore communication across the state.

[ 149 ] At least eight school districts [ 150 ] suffered closures as a result of Ian.

[ 151 ] The Lee County and DeSoto County Public School Districts reopened on October 17.

[ 152 ] The Charlotte County Public School District reopened October 18. Sarasota County Schools were closed due to damage from storm, with classes resuming on October 10 for most of the county, while several schools that sustained more damage remaining closed until October 17.

[ 153 ] Critics have noted that federally subsidized flood insurance is one of the reasons that people continue to move to hurricane-prone areas of Florida.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] Since the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) began, millions of people moved to Florida in the past 50 years into areas that were part of Hurricane Ian's path in part, critics note, due to the subsidized flood insurance offered by the federal government and insurance companies.

[ 156 ] NBC News described most of the deaths as preventable, blaming a lack of communication on the government's side and care on the citizen's side.

[ 157 ] Many insurance companies went out of business and 200,000 claims could not be paid.

[ 158 ] Lee County also saw a sharp rise in infections and death from flesh-eating bacteria that live in warm brackish water . By October 18, 2022, 29 cases and four deaths had been recorded since landfall due to infection from Vibrio vulnificus , [ 159 ] at least one of whom was from out of state.

[ 160 ] At least one Lee County man was infected with Mycobacterium haemophilum .

[ 161 ] Around 15% of the bees in the United States, which were found in Florida, were affected by Ian. Upwards of 150,000 bee hives were destroyed in the storm. Surviving bees were malnourished due to Brazilian peppertrees , which bloom in the autumn, being stripped.

[ 162 ] Weeks later several coast side condominiums and hotels damaged by Ian in Volusia County were deemed unsafe and evacuated as Hurricane Nicole approached on November 10. Many structures fell into the ocean.

[ 163 ] On February 10, 2024, a fire station in Sanibel was demolished after suffering wind and flood damage. The station moved temporarily into a mobile home that month.

[ 164 ] Damage estimates [ edit ] Early estimates of Ian's cost ranged $42 billion to $258 billion, [ 165 ] with Ian being by far the most costly climate-related event of 2022.

[ 166 ] Shown: Christian Aid estimates of ten most costly of such 2022 disasters.

Preliminary estimates of damages from Hurricane Ian are wide-ranging. Various analytic agencies and insurance companies have placed losses in the tens of billions.

CoreLogic reported potential insured losses at $28–47 billion.

Verisk Analytics indicated a total of $42–57 billion and potentially over $60 billion when losses not covered under the NFIP are included.

[ 167 ] [ 168 ] Moody's Analytics calculated potential damages of $45–55 billion in Florida alone with billions more in South Carolina. Total economic losses were estimated at $56 billion by Enki Research.

[ 169 ] Karen Clark & Co. placed insured damages at nearly $63 billion with total economic losses over $100 billion.

[ 83 ] On October 10, Risk Management Solutions, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, placed private market damages at $53–74 billion with an additional $10 billion from the NFIP.

[ 170 ] Beyond physical and economic losses, The Triple-I Corporation estimated litigation costs in Florida would reach $10–20 billion.

[ 171 ] On January 10, 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated total losses at $112 billion, making Ian the costliest hurricane in Florida's history, surpassing Hurricane Irma of 2017 , as well as the third-costliest in US history, behind only Hurricane Katrina of 2005 and Hurricane Harvey of 2017 respectively.

[ 12 ] Ian marked the 15th billion-dollar disaster for the country in 2022.

[ 172 ] Wreckage in Fort Myers pictured in late April 2023, about seven months after the hurricane In 2023, Florida senator Rick Scott introduced the Hurricane Tax Relief Act into the 118th Congress , which would enable Ian's victims, as well as victims of Hurricanes Nicole and Fiona in the US and Puerto Rico to more easily claim damage relief on their 2022 tax bills.

[ 173 ] Congressional investigation [ edit ] Main article: United States Congress hearing on Hurricane Ian In August 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform launched an investigation into the government's response to and overall recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian. During the investigation, witnesses from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), along with others were called to provide testimony. During the testimony, Florida politician Chauncey Goss , accused FEMA of providing "false hope" to the citizens of Sanibel, Florida . The during the hearing, it was discovered various government agencies had "regulatory hurdles, miscommunication, and burdensome administrative requirements", which made recovery efforts difficult. The investigation also uncovered that FEMA did not "tap into the expertise on the local level and pre-certify people from the city".

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] [ 176 ] Depiction in media [ edit ] The storm had heavy coverage in both traditional media and social media. Coverage of Hurricane Ian was the most viewed by cable viewership on September 28 with the Weather Channel occupying eight of the top ten cable spots with continuous coverage of the storm.

[ 177 ] Fox Weather , the weather streaming service from Fox News reported an average of 552,000 viewers on September 28 between 1:00–4:00 pm ET when the storm made landfall in Florida.

[ 178 ] This was by far their most ever daily views.

[ 179 ] Internet personality Ryan Hall, Y'all was ranked number three on YouTube during a livestream covering Ian's landfall on September 29.

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] Photos and videos of the hurricane were posted throughout social media with a large amount seen on TikTok where videos posted under the hashtag #HurricaneIan had about 3.5 billion views by September 28, while on Instagram there were more than 65,000 posts with the same hashtag.

[ 182 ] Others provided livestream feeds of their homes and surrounding areas during the hurricane.

[ 183 ] Many Floridians who posted about the storm to social media found humor while discussing preparing for the hurricane, the storm, and its aftermath.

[ 184 ] Some people who sheltered in place at Walt Disney World documented or livestreamed their experiences and the storm, and in some cases monetized the videos which drew criticism from many. In one case a Floridian YouTuber 's video was disliked more than double the number of times it was liked on the platform.

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] Many asked for help on social media looking for loved ones after losing contact with them or getting pleas from them for aid. While Florida authorities urged Floridians to use official emergency channels to report emergencies and to limit personal information that could be shared, many discovered informal digital structures or relied on ones from previous disasters to help provide aid or finding missing individuals.

[ 187 ] Retirement [ edit ] See also: List of retired Atlantic hurricane names Due to the extreme damage and number of deaths the hurricane caused, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ian from its rotating name lists in March 2023, and it will never be used again for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Idris , which will first appear on the 2028 season list.

Hurricane Irma (2017) – Category 5 hurricane which also severely affected Southwest Florida Hurricane Nicole (2022) – Category 1 hurricane that further affected Florida in the areas that were already affected by Ian a month later.

Hurricane Idalia (2023) – Category 4 hurricane that made landfall in Florida after hitting Cuba eleven months after Ian.

Hurricane Milton (2024) – Category 5 hurricane which caused widespread damage in similar areas.

Another major first included the successful launch of the Altius 600 small uncrewed aircraft system by scientists from NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab. Scientists launched the instrument from NOAA's P-3 Hurricane Hunter into the core of Hurricane Ian hours before landfall, transmitting back data of wind speeds as high as 216 mph at an altitude of 2,150 feet.
