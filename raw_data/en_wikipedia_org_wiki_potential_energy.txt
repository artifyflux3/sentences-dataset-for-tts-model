When the string is released, the force between the string and the arrow does work on the arrow. The potential energy in the bow limbs is transformed into the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of the arrow as it takes flight. |

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **potential energy** is the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") of an object or system due to the body's position relative to other objects, or the configuration of its particles. The energy is equal to the work done against any restoring forces, such as gravity or those in a spring.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-1)

The term _potential energy_ was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist [William Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine "William Rankine"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Rankin1853-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Roche2003-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-SmithEnergy-4) although it has links to the ancient Greek philosopher [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s concept of [_potentiality_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_Actuality "Potentiality and Actuality").

Common types of potential energy include [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy "Gravitational potential energy"), the [elastic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_potential_energy "Elastic potential energy") of a deformed spring, and the [electric potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential_energy "Electric potential energy") of an [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"). The unit for energy in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) is the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") (symbol J).

Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, whose total work is path independent, are called [_conservative forces_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). If the force acting on a body varies over space, then one has a [_force field_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)"); such a field is described by vectors at every point in space, which is, in turn, called a _[vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_field "Vector field")_. A conservative vector field can be simply expressed as the gradient of a certain scalar function, called a _[scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar\_potential "Scalar potential")_. The potential energy is related to, and can be obtained from, this potential function.

Overview
--------

There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force. For example, the work of an [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)") force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the [Coulomb force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_force "Coulomb force") is called [electric potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential_energy "Electric potential energy"); work of the [nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear force") acting on the [baryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon")[charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)") is called nuclear potential energy; work of [intermolecular forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_forces "Intermolecular forces") is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels "Fossil fuels"), is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of configurations of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their configuration.

Forces derivable from a potential are also called [conservative forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). The [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done by a conservative force is ![Image 3: {\displaystyle W=-\Delta U,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19651a266a5f836a55f2a2f4ecdb324def12ce58) where ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \Delta U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4716a2c49bbbe155e8b399117ca78342e802cbe) is the change in the potential energy associated with the force. The negative sign provides the convention that work done against a force field increases potential energy, while work done by the force field decreases potential energy. Common notations for potential energy are _PE_, _U_, _V_, and _E_ p.

Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object's position relative to other objects.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-:0-5) Potential energy is often associated with restoring [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") such as a [spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device) "Spring (device)") or the force of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential. This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy. If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall.

Consider a ball whose mass is _m_ dropped from height _h_. The acceleration _g_ of free fall is approximately constant, so the weight force of the ball _mg_ is constant. The product of force and displacement gives the work done, which is equal to the gravitational potential energy, thus ![Image 5: {\displaystyle U_{\text{g}}=mgh.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e73e752ed8fdf6a7b486f057dbe4c79978128bda)

The more formal definition is that potential energy is the energy difference between the energy of an object in a given position and its energy at a reference position.

History
-------

From around 1840 scientists sought to define and understand energy and [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-SmithEnergy-4) The term "potential energy" was coined by [William Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine "William Rankine") a Scottish engineer and physicist in 1853 as part of a specific effort to develop terminology.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Rankin1853-2) He chose the term as part of the pair "actual" vs "potential" going back to work by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"). In his 1867 discussion of the same topic Rankine describes potential energy as 'energy of configuration' in contrast to actual energy as 'energy of activity'. Also in 1867, [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin") introduced "kinetic energy" as the opposite of "potential energy", asserting that all actual energy took the form of ⁠1/2⁠_mv_ 2. Once this hypothesis became widely accepted, the term "actual energy" gradually faded.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Roche2003-3)

Work and potential energy
-------------------------

Potential energy is closely linked with [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)"). If the work done by a force on a body that moves from _A_ to _B_ does not depend on the path between these points (if the work is done by a conservative force), then the work of this force measured from _A_ assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a [scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential "Scalar potential") field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the [vector gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of the potential field.

If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated from the start to the end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a function _U_(**x**), called a "potential", that can be evaluated at the two points **x**A and **x**B to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}})-U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/799ebee8649d879b556394a3ea57e2d0138519c1) where _C_ is the trajectory taken from A to B. Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, _C_, from A to B.

The function _U_(**x**) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

### Derivable from a potential

In this section the relationship between work and potential energy is presented in more detail. The [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") that defines work along curve _C_ takes a special form if the force **F** is related to a scalar field _U_′(**x**) so that ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\nabla U'}=\left({\frac {\partial U'}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial U'}{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial U'}{\partial z}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5479c40f234d752098ffc916f11676a2a489cf5c) This means that the units of _U_′ must be this case, work along the curve is given by ![Image 8: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{C}\nabla U'\cdot d\mathbf {x} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01c2c1bf7334946f5846ab2853b6fdea47dac25b) which can be evaluated using the [gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem") to obtain ![Image 9: {\displaystyle W=U'(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}})-U'(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/865d575b658050fe2275c038b7cb3da2b2f699f2) This shows that when forces are derivable from a scalar field, the work of those forces along a curve _C_ is computed by evaluating the scalar field at the start point A and the end point B of the curve. This means the work integral does not depend on the path between A and B and is said to be independent of the path.

Potential energy _U_ = −_U_′(**x**) is traditionally defined as the negative of this scalar field so that work by the force field decreases potential energy, that is ![Image 10: {\displaystyle W=U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{A}})-U(\mathbf {x} _{\text{B}}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa74c1b22fc5c8b86c09970bf4394c3d58009ca4)

In this case, the application of the [del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_operator "Del operator") to the work function yields, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\nabla W}=-{\nabla U}=-\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial x}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial y}},{\frac {\partial U}{\partial z}}\right)=\mathbf {F} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6eadee4df78e6e0a7163cc581adbe3e8fb31c433) and the force **F** is said to be "derivable from a potential".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-6) This also necessarily implies that **F** must be a [conservative vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field "Conservative vector field"). The potential _U_ defines a force **F** at every point **x** in space, so the set of forces is called a [force field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)").

### Computing potential energy

Given a force field **F**(**x**), evaluation of the work integral using the [gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem") can be used to find the scalar function associated with potential energy. This is done by introducing a parameterized curve _γ_(_t_) = **r**(_t_) from _γ_(_a_) = _A_ to _γ_(_b_) = _B_, and computing, ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }\nabla \Phi (\mathbf {r} )\cdot d\mathbf {r} &=\int _{a}^{b}\nabla \Phi (\mathbf {r} (t))\cdot \mathbf {r} '(t)dt,\\&=\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {d}{dt}}\Phi (\mathbf {r} (t))dt=\Phi (\mathbf {r} (b))-\Phi (\mathbf {r} (a))=\Phi \left(\mathbf {x} _{B}\right)-\Phi \left(\mathbf {x} _{A}\right).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b0f2885c5c2505f4f884f71059ffbbbc7579f9d)

For the force field **F**, let **v** = _d_**r**/_dt_, then the [gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem") yields, ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} &=\int _{a}^{b}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} \,dt,\\&=-\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {d}{dt}}U(\mathbf {r} (t))\,dt=U(\mathbf {x} _{A})-U(\mathbf {x} _{B}).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/995577cd127c003fdf63e5d48e2e1994c208570e)

The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity **v** of the point of application, that is ![Image 14: {\displaystyle P(t)=-{\nabla U}\cdot \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c83c632670f20b5c035568a8d32c5eafb4d24cbf)

Examples of work that can be computed from potential functions are gravity and spring forces.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-7)

Potential energy for near-Earth gravity
---------------------------------------

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Trebuchet.jpg/250px-Trebuchet.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trebuchet.jpg)

A [trebuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet "Trebuchet") uses the gravitational potential energy of the [counterweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight "Counterweight") to throw projectiles over two hundred meters

For small height changes, gravitational potential energy can be computed using ![Image 16: {\displaystyle U_{\text{g}}=mgh,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0044b11d17430958efbd1ed209c931164ced6e6) where _m_ is the mass in kilograms, _g_ is the local gravitational field (9.8 metres per second squared on Earth), _h_ is the height above a reference level in metres, and _U_ is the energy in joules.

In classical physics, gravity exerts a constant downward force _**F**_ = (0, 0, _F_ z) on the center of mass of a body moving near the surface of the Earth. The work of gravity on a body moving along a trajectory _**r**_(_t_) = (_x_(_t_), _y_(_t_), _z_(_t_)), such as the track of a roller coaster is calculated using its velocity, _**v**_ = (_v_ x, _v_ y, _v_ z), to obtain ![Image 17: {\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {v}}\,dt=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F_{\text{z}}v_{\text{z}}\,dt=F_{\text{z}}\Delta z.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9e0d7c288784b6226286fc403bbb587b1e13b48) where the integral of the vertical component of velocity is the vertical distance. The work of gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the curve _**r**_(_t_).

Potential energy for a linear spring
------------------------------------

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Springs_009.jpg/250px-Springs_009.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Springs_009.jpg)

[Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device) "Spring (device)") are used for storing [elastic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_potential_energy "Elastic potential energy")

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Longbowmen.jpg/250px-Longbowmen.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Longbowmen.jpg)

[Archery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery "Archery") is one of humankind's oldest applications of elastic potential energy

A horizontal spring exerts a force **F** = (−_kx_, 0, 0) that is proportional to its deformation in the axial or _x_-direction. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space curve **s**(_t_) = (_x_(_t_), _y_(_t_), _z_(_t_)), is calculated using its velocity, **v** = (_v_ x, _v_ y, _v_ z), to obtain ![Image 20: {\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} \,dt=-\int _{0}^{t}kxv_{\text{x}}\,dt=-\int _{0}^{t}kx{\frac {dx}{dt}}dt=\int _{x(t_{0})}^{x(t)}kx\,dx={\frac {1}{2}}kx^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fba1ac7b02435dd0cdfc3cf744bc3d1e7db162d8) For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at _t_ = 0, then the integral of the product of the distance _x_ and the _x_-velocity, _xv_ x, is _x_ 2/2.

The function ![Image 21: {\displaystyle U(x)={\frac {1}{2}}kx^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c7e243bdec3b25a115573033e700cdc4cb01505) is called the potential energy of a linear spring.

Elastic potential energy is the potential energy of an [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)") object (for example a [bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(weapon) "Bow (weapon)") or a catapult) that is deformed under tension or compression (or [stressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(physics) "Stress (physics)") in formal terminology). It arises as a consequence of a force that tries to restore the object to its original shape, which is most often the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force "Electromagnetic force") between the atoms and molecules that constitute the object. If the stretch is released, the energy is transformed into [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy").

Potential energy for gravitational forces between two bodies
------------------------------------------------------------

The gravitational potential function, also known as [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy "Gravitational potential energy"), is: ![Image 22: {\displaystyle U=-{\frac {GMm}{r}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e4ba4c6266dadc7bda4935bf42846bd225e4ed1)

The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

### Derivation

The gravitational force between two bodies of mass _M_ and _m_ separated by a distance _r_ is given by [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation")![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/563afb133555aa37bf9874e83826101157b49eb4) where ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fe52dfe80c9a6604b3a46b24d65eb02c92c59e9) is [a vector of length 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") pointing from _M_ to _m_ and _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant").

Let the mass _m_ move at the velocity **v** then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position **r**(_t_ 1) to **r**(_t_ 2) is given by ![Image 25: {\displaystyle W=-\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{2})}{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} \cdot \mathbf {v} \,dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b3be5bae571f2ae04285631a40816e371c185f7d) The position and velocity of the mass _m_ are given by ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =r\mathbf {e} _{r},\qquad \mathbf {v} ={\dot {r}}\mathbf {e} _{\text{r}}+r{\dot {\theta }}\mathbf {e} _{\text{t}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc520a1e6ba6129374e86dec9315999d53ed913f) where **e**r and **e**t are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from _M_ to _m_. Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to, ![Image 27: {\displaystyle W=-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GmM}{r^{3}}}(r\mathbf {e} _{\text{r}})\cdot ({\dot {r}}\mathbf {e} _{\text{r}}+r{\dot {\theta }}\mathbf {e} _{\text{t}})\,dt=-\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac {GmM}{r^{3}}}r{\dot {r}}dt={\frac {GMm}{r(t_{2})}}-{\frac {GMm}{r(t_{1})}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42dee5c5faae34fb8c78c18d6c7c7ddceb04d787)

This calculation uses the fact that ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}r^{-1}=-r^{-2}{\dot {r}}=-{\frac {\dot {r}}{r^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68f74984cb177d2d1be704437e3b93467b37cf36)

Potential energy for electrostatic forces between two bodies
------------------------------------------------------------

The electrostatic force exerted by a charge _Q_ on another charge _q_ separated by a distance _r_ is given by [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law")![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Qq}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/515c327baabebc2e5258e21e544a5e0f53075c84) where ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fe52dfe80c9a6604b3a46b24d65eb02c92c59e9) is a vector of length 1 pointing from _Q_ to _q_ and _ε_ 0 is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity").

The work _W_ required to move _q_ from _A_ to any point _B_ in the electrostatic force field is given by the potential function ![Image 31: {\displaystyle U(r)={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Qq}{r}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b43fe12913f8378546fff1563569d615edf263c)

Reference level
---------------

The potential energy is a function of the state a system is in, and is defined relative to that for a particular state. This reference state is not always a real state; it may also be a limit, such as with the distances between all bodies tending to infinity, provided that the energy involved in tending to that limit is finite, such as in the case of [inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law "Inverse-square law") forces. Any arbitrary reference state could be used; therefore it can be chosen based on convenience.

Typically the potential energy of a system depends on the _relative_ positions of its components only, so the reference state can also be expressed in terms of relative positions.

Gravitational potential energy
------------------------------

Gravitational energy is the potential energy associated with [gravitational force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_force "Gravitational force"), as work is required to elevate objects against Earth's gravity. The potential energy due to elevated positions is called gravitational potential energy, and is evidenced by water in an elevated reservoir or kept behind a dam. If an object falls from one point to another point inside a gravitational field, the force of gravity will do positive work on the object, and the gravitational potential energy will decrease by the same amount.

Gravitational force keeps the planets in orbit around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")

Consider a book placed on top of a table. As the book is raised from the floor to the table, some external force works against the gravitational force. If the book falls back to the floor, the "falling" energy the book receives is provided by the gravitational force. Thus, if the book falls off the table, this potential energy goes to accelerate the mass of the book and is converted into [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"). When the book hits the floor this kinetic energy is converted into heat, deformation, and sound by the impact.

The factors that affect an object's gravitational potential energy are its height relative to some reference point, its mass, and the strength of the gravitational field it is in. Thus, a book lying on a table has less gravitational potential energy than the same book on top of a taller cupboard and less gravitational potential energy than a heavier book lying on the same table. An object at a certain height above the Moon's surface has less gravitational potential energy than at the same height above the Earth's surface because the Moon's gravity is weaker. "Height" in the common sense of the term cannot be used for gravitational potential energy calculations when gravity is not assumed to be a constant. The following sections provide more detail.

### Local approximation

The strength of a gravitational field varies with location. However, when the change of distance is small in relation to the distances from the center of the source of the gravitational field, this variation in field strength is negligible and we can assume that the force of gravity on a particular object is constant. Near the surface of the Earth, for example, we assume that the acceleration due to gravity is a constant _g_ = 9.8 m/s 2 ([standard gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity")). In this case, a simple expression for gravitational potential energy can be derived using the _W_ = _Fd_ equation for [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work "Mechanical work"), and the equation ![Image 33: {\displaystyle W_{\text{F}}=-\Delta U_{\text{F}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4566f9354d2be700bec1a8043d9173327a0ad67)

The amount of gravitational potential energy held by an elevated object is equal to the work done against gravity in lifting it. The work done equals the force required to move it upward multiplied with the vertical distance it is moved (remember _W_ = _Fd_). The upward force required while moving at a constant velocity is equal to the weight, _mg_, of an object, so the work done in lifting it through a height h is the product _mgh_. Thus, when accounting only for [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation"), and [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude"), the equation is:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-8)![Image 34: {\displaystyle U=mgh}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2630448f947077ab71ede5b40839f03d3d906272) where _U_ is the potential energy of the object relative to its being on the Earth's surface, _m_ is the mass of the object, _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity, and _h_ is the altitude of the object.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-9)

Hence, the potential difference is ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \Delta U=mg\Delta h.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2f7c0c78b3e299137246d874be98dac6f2fc572)

### General formula

However, over large variations in distance, the approximation that _g_ is constant is no longer valid, and we have to use [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") and the general mathematical definition of work to determine gravitational potential energy. For the computation of the potential energy, we can [integrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") the gravitational force, whose magnitude is given by [Newton's law of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation"), with respect to the distance _r_ between the two bodies. Using that definition, the gravitational potential energy of a system of masses _m_ 1 and _M_ 2 at a distance _r_ using the [Newtonian constant of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_constant_of_gravitation "Newtonian constant of gravitation")_G_ is ![Image 36: {\displaystyle U=-G{\frac {m_{1}M_{2}}{r}}+K,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0141c6cbb8bdcbd17613e5e8b370aeb77a0dd0da) where _K_ is an arbitrary constant dependent on the choice of datum from which potential is measured. Choosing the convention that _K_ = 0 (i.e. in relation to a point at infinity) makes calculations simpler, albeit at the cost of making _U_ negative; for why this is physically reasonable, see below.

Given this formula for _U_, the total potential energy of a system of n bodies is found by summing, for all ![Image 37: {\textstyle {\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daf76f7f60595b709cbca7bc7e45ca2d7d3e8785) pairs of two bodies, the potential energy of the system of those two bodies.

[![Image 38](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Gravitational_potential_summation_2.png/250px-Gravitational_potential_summation_2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_potential_summation_2.png)

Gravitational potential summation ![Image 39: {\displaystyle U=-m\left(G{\frac {M_{1}}{r_{1}}}+G{\frac {M_{2}}{r_{2}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8425aefd5785206e19b574034ece0eee18084f0f)

Considering the system of bodies as the combined set of small particles the bodies consist of, and applying the previous on the particle level we get the negative [gravitational binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_binding_energy "Gravitational binding energy"). This potential energy is more strongly negative than the total potential energy of the system of bodies as such since it also includes the negative gravitational binding energy of each body. The potential energy of the system of bodies as such is the negative of the energy needed to separate the bodies from each other to infinity, while the gravitational binding energy is the energy needed to separate all particles from each other to infinity. ![Image 40: {\displaystyle U=-m\left(G{\frac {M_{1}}{r_{1}}}+G{\frac {M_{2}}{r_{2}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8425aefd5785206e19b574034ece0eee18084f0f) therefore, ![Image 41: {\displaystyle U=-m\sum G{\frac {M}{r}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29eafaf6d8c11ea69b1472c0f3a94d7dcff2cc50)

### Negative gravitational energy

As with all potential energies, only differences in gravitational potential energy matter for most physical purposes, and the choice of zero point is arbitrary. Given that there is no reasonable criterion for preferring one particular finite _r_ over another, there seem to be only two reasonable choices for the distance at which _U_ becomes zero: ![Image 42: {\displaystyle r=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89) and ![Image 43: {\displaystyle r=\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d38c8164ddb69351cdab28da290255fde3b846d4). The choice of ![Image 44: {\displaystyle U=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d868ee7902023d29169252eb059f8faff9f08fc1) at infinity may seem peculiar, and the consequence that gravitational energy is always negative may seem counterintuitive, but this choice allows gravitational potential energy values to be finite, albeit negative.

The [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity "Mathematical singularity") at ![Image 45: {\displaystyle r=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89) in the formula for gravitational potential energy means that the only other apparently reasonable alternative choice of convention, with ![Image 46: {\displaystyle U=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d868ee7902023d29169252eb059f8faff9f08fc1) for ⁠![Image 47: {\displaystyle r=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89)⁠, would result in potential energy being positive, but infinitely large for all nonzero values of _r_, and would make calculations involving sums or differences of potential energies beyond what is possible with the [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") system. Since physicists abhor infinities in their calculations, and _r_ is always non-zero in practice, the choice of ![Image 48: {\displaystyle U=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d868ee7902023d29169252eb059f8faff9f08fc1) at infinity is by far the more preferable choice, even if the idea of negative energy in a [gravity well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well "Gravity well") appears to be peculiar at first.

The negative value for gravitational energy also has deeper implications that make it seem more reasonable in cosmological calculations where the total energy of the universe can meaningfully be considered; see [inflation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_theory "Inflation theory") for more on this.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-10)

### Uses

Gravitational potential energy has a number of practical uses, notably the generation of [pumped-storage hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity"). For example, in [Dinorwig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station "Dinorwig Power Station"), Wales, there are two lakes, one at a higher elevation than the other. At times when surplus electricity is not required (and so is comparatively cheap), water is pumped up to the higher lake, thus converting the electrical energy (running the pump) to gravitational potential energy. At times of peak demand for electricity, the water flows back down through electrical generator turbines, converting the potential energy into kinetic energy and then back into electricity. The process is not completely efficient and some of the original energy from the surplus electricity is in fact lost to friction.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-EconomistPSH-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-thier-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Levine-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-yang-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-heco-15)

Gravitational potential energy is also used to power clocks in which falling weights operate the mechanism.

It is also used by [counterweights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight "Counterweight") for lifting up an [elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator "Elevator"), crane, or [sash window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sash_window "Sash window").

[Roller coasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollercoasters "Rollercoasters") are an entertaining way to utilize potential energy – chains are used to move a car up an incline (building up gravitational potential energy), to then have that energy converted into kinetic energy as it falls.

Another practical use is utilizing gravitational potential energy to descend (perhaps coast) downhill in transportation such as the descent of an automobile, truck, railroad train, bicycle, airplane, or fluid in a pipeline. In some cases the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") obtained from the potential energy of descent may be used to start ascending the next grade such as what happens when a road is undulating and has frequent dips. The commercialization of stored energy (in the form of rail cars raised to higher elevations) that is then converted to electrical energy when needed by an electrical grid, is being undertaken in the United States in a system called [Advanced Rail Energy Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_energy_storage_projects#Gravitational_potential_energy_storage "List of energy storage projects") (ARES).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Economist-2012.03.03-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-Bloomberg-2012.09.06-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-18)

Chemical potential energy
-------------------------

Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result of [chemical bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") within a molecule or otherwise. Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a [chemical reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"). As an example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat, same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism. Green plants transform [solar energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy "Solar energy") to chemical energy through the process known as [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis"), and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy through [electrochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical "Electrochemical") reactions.

The similar term [chemical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_potential "Chemical potential") is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc.

Electric potential energy
-------------------------

An object can have potential energy by virtue of its [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and several forces related to their presence. There are two main types of this kind of potential energy: electrostatic potential energy, electrodynamic potential energy (also sometimes called magnetic potential energy).

[![Image 49](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Plasma-lamp_2.jpg/250px-Plasma-lamp_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plasma-lamp_2.jpg)

### Electrostatic potential energy

Electrostatic potential energy between two bodies in space is obtained from the force exerted by a charge _Q_ on another charge _q_, which is given by ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{e}=-{\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Qq}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76f6140a681ec789469a10c10819183ae3fd8c3c) where ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fe52dfe80c9a6604b3a46b24d65eb02c92c59e9) is a vector of length 1 pointing from _Q_ to _q_ and _ε_ 0 is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity").

If the electric charge of an object can be assumed to be at rest, then it has potential energy due to its position relative to other charged objects. The [electrostatic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential_energy "Electric potential energy") is the energy of an electrically charged particle (at rest) in an electric field. It is defined as the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its present location, adjusted for non-electrical forces on the object. This energy will generally be non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby.

The work _W_ required to move _q_ from _A_ to any point _B_ in the electrostatic force field is given by ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \Delta U_{AB}({\mathbf {r} })=-\int _{A}^{B}\mathbf {F_{e}} \cdot d\mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee90d4592943c2af5e32481b0a226946672ffc27) typically given in J for Joules. A related quantity called _[electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_potential "Electric potential")_ (commonly denoted with a _V_ for voltage) is equal to the electric potential energy per unit charge.

### Magnetic potential energy

The energy of a [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment")![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1aee7d7b4a36d96dfb35bfee9c7751bba1fdfbe) in an externally produced [magnetic B-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field")**B** has potential energy[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-19)![Image 54: {\displaystyle U=-{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\cdot \mathbf {B} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f207b3923b54bab1f029d006f1d8ace1d52f3f1)

The [magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization")**M** in a field is ![Image 55: {\displaystyle U=-{\frac {1}{2}}\int \mathbf {M} \cdot \mathbf {B} \,dV,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dfb25c09400910ac33b1b363bd2d767b9d62b5ed) where the integral can be over all space or, equivalently, where **M** is nonzero.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-20) Magnetic potential energy is the form of energy related not only to the distance between magnetic materials, but also to the orientation, or alignment, of those materials within the field. For example, the needle of a compass has the lowest magnetic potential energy when it is aligned with the north and south poles of the Earth's magnetic field. If the needle is moved by an outside force, torque is exerted on the magnetic dipole of the needle by the Earth's magnetic field, causing it to move back into alignment. The magnetic potential energy of the needle is highest when its field is in the same direction as the Earth's magnetic field. Two magnets will have potential energy in relation to each other and the distance between them, but this also depends on their orientation. If the opposite poles are held apart, the potential energy will be higher the further they are apart and lower the closer they are. Conversely, like poles will have the highest potential energy when forced together, and the lowest when they spring apart.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#cite_note-22)

Nuclear potential energy
------------------------

Nuclear potential energy is the potential energy of the [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle") inside an [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). The nuclear particles are bound together by the [strong nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_force "Strong nuclear force"). Their rest mass provides the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay").

Nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are not destroyed in fission and fusion processes, but collections of them can have less mass than if they were individually free, in which case this mass difference can be liberated as heat and radiation in nuclear reactions. The process of hydrogen fusion occurring in the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") is an example of this form of [energy release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain#Energy_release "Proton–proton chain") – 600 million tonnes of hydrogen nuclei are fused into helium nuclei, with a loss of about 4 million tonnes of mass per second. This energy, now in the form of [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and [gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_rays "Gamma rays"), keeps the solar core hot even as [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") carries [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_energy "Electromagnetic energy") into space.

Forces and potential energy
---------------------------

Potential energy is closely linked with [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)"). If the work done by a force on a body that moves from _A_ to _B_ does not depend on the path between these points, then the work of this force measured from _A_ assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a [scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential "Scalar potential") field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the [vector gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of the potential field.

For example, gravity is a [conservative force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). The associated potential is the [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential"), often denoted by ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) or ![Image 57: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845), corresponding to the energy per unit mass as a function of position. The gravitational potential energy of two particles of mass _M_ and _m_ separated by a distance _r_ is ![Image 58: {\displaystyle U=-{\frac {GMm}{r}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/139f5ca37da97d23736e4844ab2857f10bb44c17) The gravitational potential ([specific energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy")) of the two bodies is ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \phi =-\left({\frac {GM}{r}}+{\frac {Gm}{r}}\right)=-{\frac {G(M+m)}{r}}=-{\frac {GMm}{\mu r}}={\frac {U}{\mu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b13fa222d176ada345d04dd8887e185876b9756e) where ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \mu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fd47b2a39f7a7856952afec1f1db72c67af6161) is the [reduced mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_mass "Reduced mass").

The work done against gravity by moving an [infinitesimal mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particle "Test particle") from point A with ![Image 61: {\displaystyle U=a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25f7c64dfadca83cc9f4b12a39401157d08c6676) to point B with ![Image 62: {\displaystyle U=b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90ee1a6dbef47df856564b9621590ec4865e3eee) is ![Image 63: {\displaystyle (b-a)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/438f310cfd162b48bf8476ee318726770a92bce9) and the work done going back the other way is ![Image 64: {\displaystyle (a-b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de142beb9731d08ae0cf1d37fbb1e7bc6ccd4dc5) so that the total work done in moving from A to B and returning to A is ![Image 65: {\displaystyle U_{A\to B\to A}=(b-a)+(a-b)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fed6784345f5da7649dfc4173f0bfc55255e13b) If the potential is redefined at A to be ![Image 66: {\displaystyle a+c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c25f3213d18c8ab37a1c4125462d7568047567d2) and the potential at B to be ![Image 67: {\displaystyle b+c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7db36971debb247704a03ec6c3832d8fecdb05b), where ![Image 68: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455) is a constant (i.e. ![Image 69: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455) can be any number, positive or negative, but it must be the same at A as it is at B) then the work done going from A to B is ![Image 70: {\displaystyle U_{A\to B}=(b+c)-(a+c)=b-a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41fc6dc68501bb759f43d6762ab08906bfddf81b) as before.

In practical terms, this means that one can set the zero of ![Image 71: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) and ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) anywhere one likes. One may set it to be zero at the surface of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), or may find it more convenient to set zero at infinity (as in the expressions given earlier in this section).

A conservative force can be expressed in the language of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") as a [closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_differential_form "Closed differential form"). As [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is [contractible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space "Contractible space"), its [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology") vanishes, so every closed form is also an [exact form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_differential_form "Exact differential form"), and can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field. This gives a mathematical justification of the fact that all conservative forces are gradients of a potential field.
