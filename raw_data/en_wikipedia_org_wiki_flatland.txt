_**Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions**_ is a [satirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire "Satire") novella by the English [schoolmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolmaster "Schoolmaster")[Edwin Abbott Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Abbott_Abbott "Edwin Abbott Abbott"), first published in 1884 by [Seeley & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeley,_Service "Seeley, Service") of London. Written pseudonymously by "A Square",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-1) the book used the fictional [two-dimensional world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of [Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-isbn0-465-01123-3_1-2)

A sequel, _[Sphereland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphereland "Sphereland")_, was written by [Dionys Burger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionys_Burger "Dionys Burger") in 1957. Several films have been based on _Flatland_, including the feature film _[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland\_(2007\_Ehlinger\_film) "Flatland (2007 Ehlinger film)")_ (2007). Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by [Dudley Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Moore "Dudley Moore") and the short films _[Flatland: The Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland\_(2007\_Johnson\_and\_Travis\_film) "Flatland (2007 Johnson and Travis film)")_ (2007) and _[Flatland 2: Sphereland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland\_2:\_Sphereland "Flatland 2: Sphereland")_ (2012).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-3)

Illustration of a simple house in Flatland.

The story describes a [two-dimensional world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") inhabited by [geometric figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape") (flatlanders[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-4)); women are [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), while men are [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry) "Square (geometry)"), a member of the [caste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste "Caste") of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe, as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium.

On New Year's Eve, the Square dreams of a visit to a [one-dimensional world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space"), "Lineland", inhabited by men, who are lines, while the women are "lustrous points". These [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") and lines are unable to see the Square as anything other than a set of points on a line. Thus, the Square attempts to convince the realm's [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch") of a second dimension but cannot do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill the Square rather than tolerate him any further.

Following this vision, the Square is visited by a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). Similar to the "points" in Lineland, he is unable to see the three-dimensional object as anything other than a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") (more precisely, a [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)")). The Sphere then levitates up and down through Flatland, allowing the Square to see the circle expand and contract between a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") and small circles. The Sphere then tries further to convince the Square of the [third dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") by dimensional analogies (a point becomes a line, a line becomes a square). The Square is still unable to comprehend the third dimension, so the Sphere resorts to deeds: he gives information about the "insides" of the house, moves a tablet through the third dimension, and even goes inside the Square for a moment. Still unable to comprehend the third dimension, the Square is taken by the Sphere to the third dimension, Spaceland. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new [apostle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle "Apostle") to the idea of a third dimension in the hope of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they can oversee the leaders of Flatland, acknowledging the Sphere's existence and prescribing the silencing. After this [proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation "Proclamation") is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including the Square's brother.

After the Square's mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a [fourth dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") and higher spatial dimensions. The Sphere at first scoffs at the idea of higher dimensions, just as the Square had done, showing that his comprehension is not as broad as he had thought. Still, the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace.

The Square then has a dream in which the Sphere revisits him, this time to introduce him to a [zero-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional_space "Zero-dimensional space"), Pointland, of whom the Point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. [Solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism "Solipsism")):

> "You see," said my Teacher, "how little your words have done. So far as the Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own– for he cannot conceive of any other except himself– and plumes himself upon the variety of _Its Thought_ as an instance of creative Power. Let us leave this god of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his omnipresence and omniscience: nothing that you or I can do can rescue him from his self-satisfaction."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-5)

— the Sphere

The last sketch in the book.

The Square recognises the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland's existence, especially after official [decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree "Decree") are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). For example, he tries to convince his relative of the third dimension but cannot move a square "upward," as opposed to forward or sideways. Eventually, the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother, who is imprisoned in the same facility. He cannot convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, "A. Square" writes out the book _Flatland_ as a [memoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir "Memoir"), hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence.

Men are portrayed as polygons whose [social status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status "Social status") is determined by their [regularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") and the number of their sides, with a Circle considered the "perfect" shape. Women are lines, quite fragile but also dangerous, as they can disappear from view and possibly stab someone. To prevent this, they are required by law to sound a "peace-cry" while moving about and to use separate doors from men.

In the world of Flatland, classes are distinguished by the "Art of Hearing", the "Art of Feeling", and the "Art of Sight Recognition". Classes can be distinguished by the sound of one's voice, but the lower classes have more developed vocal organs, enabling them to feign the voice of a Polygon or even a Circle. Feeling, practised by the lower classes and women, determines the configuration of a person by feeling one of its [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"). The "Art of Sight Recognition", practised by the upper classes, is aided by "Fog", which allows an observer to determine the depth of an object. With this, polygons with sharp angles relative to the observer will fade more rapidly than polygons with more gradual angles. Colour of any kind [was banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law "Sumptuary law") in Flatland after [Isosceles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle "Isosceles triangle") workers painted themselves to impersonate [noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility") Polygons. The Square describes these events, and the ensuing [class war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict "Class conflict") at length.

The population of Flatland can "[evolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution")" through the "Law of Nature", which states: "a male child shall have one more side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a [Pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon "Pentagon"), the son of a Pentagon, a [Hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon"), and so on".

This rule is not the case when dealing with Isosceles Triangles (Soldiers and Workmen) with only two [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") sides. The smallest angle of an Isosceles Triangle gains 30 [arc minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc") (half a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)")) each generation. Additionally, the rule does not seem to apply to many-sided Polygons. For example, the sons of several hundred-sided Polygons will often develop 50 or more sides more than their parents. Furthermore, the angle of an Isosceles Triangle or the number of sides of a (regular) Polygon may be altered during life by deeds or [surgical adjustments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification "Body modification").

An [Equilateral Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") is a member of the [craftsman class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan "Artisan"). Squares and Pentagons are the "gentlemen" class, as doctors, lawyers, and other professions. Hexagons are the lowest rank of nobility, all the way up to (near) Circles, who make up the [priest class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestly_caste "Priestly caste"). The higher-order Polygons have much less of a chance of producing sons, preventing Flatland from being overcrowded with noblemen.

Apart from Isosceles Triangles, only regular Polygons are considered until chapter seven of the book when the issue of irregularity, or physical deformity is brought up. In a two-dimensional world, a regular polygon can be identified by a single angle and/or [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)"). To maintain [social cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohesiveness "Group cohesiveness"), irregularity is to be abhorred, with moral irregularity and criminality cited, "by some" (in the book), as inevitable additional deformities, a sentiment with which the Square concurs. If the error of deviation is above a stated amount, the irregular Polygon faces [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia "Euthanasia"); if below, he becomes the lowest rank of [civil servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service "Civil service"). An irregular Polygon is not destroyed at birth, but allowed to develop to see if the irregularity can be "cured" or reduced. If the deformity remains, the irregular is "painlessly and mercifully consumed."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-6)

In _Flatland_, Abbott describes a society rigidly divided into classes. Social ascent is the main aspiration of its inhabitants, apparently granted to everyone but strictly controlled by the top of the hierarchy. Freedom is despised and the laws are cruel. Innovators are imprisoned or suppressed. Members of lower classes who are intellectually valuable, and potential leaders of [riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot "Riot"), are either killed or promoted to the higher classes. Every attempt for change is considered dangerous and harmful. This world is not prepared to receive "revelations from another world". The satirical part is mainly concentrated in the first part of the book, "This World", which describes Flatland. The main points of interest are the Victorian concept of women's roles in the society and in the class-based hierarchy of men.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-isbn0-465-01123-3_3-7) Abbott has been accused[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] of [misogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny "Misogyny") due to his portrayal of women in _Flatland_. In his Preface to the Second and Revised Edition, 1884, he answers such critics by emphasizing that the description of women was satirizing the viewpoints held, stating that the Square:

> was writing as a Historian, he has identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally adopted by Flatland and (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland, Historians; in whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of mention and never of careful consideration.

_Flatland_ did not have much success when published, although it was not entirely ignored.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-Flatland_Reviews-8) In the entry on Edwin Abbott in the _[Dictionary of National Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary\_of\_National\_Biography "Dictionary of National Biography")_ for persons who died in the period of 1922 to 1930, _Flatland_ was not even mentioned.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-isbn0-465-01123-3_1-2)

The book was discovered again after [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") was published, which brought to prominence the concept of a fourth dimension. _Flatland_ was mentioned in a letter by William Garnett entitled "Euclid, Newton and Einstein" published in _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_ on 12 February 1920. In this letter, Abbott is depicted, in a sense, as a prophet due to his intuition of the importance of _time_ to explain certain phenomena:[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-isbn0-465-01123-3_4-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland#cite_note-urlFlatland_Reviews-10)

> Some thirty or more years ago a little _[jeu d'esprit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jeu\_d%27esprit "wiktionary:jeu d'esprit")_ was written by Dr. Edwin Abbott entitled _Flatland_. At the time of its publication it did not attract as much attention as it deserved... If there is motion of our three-dimensional space relative to the fourth dimension, all the changes we experience and assign to the flow of time will be due simply to this movement, the whole of the future as well as the past always existing in the fourth dimension.

The _[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary\_of\_National\_Biography#Oxford\_Dictionary\_of\_National\_Biography "Dictionary of National Biography")_ subsequently revised his biography to state that [Abbott] "is most remembered as the author of _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_".
