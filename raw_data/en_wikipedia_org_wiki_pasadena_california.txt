It is the most populous city and the primary cultural center of the San Gabriel Valley .

[ 17 ] Old Pasadena is the city's original commercial district.

Its population was 138,699 at the 2020 census , [ 14 ] making it the 45th-largest city in California [ 14 ] and the ninth-largest in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, 36 years after the city of Los Angeles but still one of the first in what is now Los Angeles County.

[ 18 ] Pasadena is home to many scientific, educational, and cultural institutions, including the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena City College , Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine , Fuller Theological Seminary , Theosophical Society , Parsons Corporation , Art Center College of Design , the Planetary Society , Pasadena Playhouse , the Ambassador Auditorium , the Norton Simon Museum , and the USC Pacific Asia Museum .

Pasadena hosts the annual Rose Bowl football game and Tournament of Roses Parade each New Year's Day .

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Pasadena, California and Old Town Pasadena Indigenous history [ edit ] The earliest known inhabitants of Pasadena and its surroundings were members of the Native American Hahamog-na tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation. They spoke the Tongva language , part of the Uto-Aztecan language group. Native Americans had lived in the Los Angeles Basin for thousands of years.

[ 19 ] Pasadena means "valley" in the language of the Ojibwe , a Native American tribe not local to the region. The name was chosen by American colonists from Indiana who would later move to the area.

[ 3 ] Spanish era [ edit ] The Spanish first colonized the Los Angeles Basin in the 1770s as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain , building the San Gabriel Mission and renaming the local Tongva people "Gabrielino Indians", after the name of the mission. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.

[ 20 ] Mexican era [ edit ] In 1821, Mexico became independent of Spain, and California came under control of the Mexican government. In 1833, the mission lands were secularized and most of the lands in California were granted to private Mexican citizens in the form of ranchos. Present-day Pasadena was divided between Rancho San Rafael (lands west of the Arroyo Seco extending to present-day Burbank in the northwest to Glassell Park in the southwest), Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual , [ 19 ] (present-day central Pasadena, Altadena , and South Pasadena ), and Rancho Santa Anita (present-day east Pasadena, Arcadia, and Monrovia).

[ 21 ] Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was so named because it was deeded on Easter Sunday to Eulalia Perez de Guillén Mariné of Mission San Gabriel Arcángel .

American era [ edit ] The last of the Mexican owners of Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was Manuel Garfias , [ 19 ] who retained title to the property through the American conquest of California in 1848 and statehood in 1850. Garfias sold sections of the property to the first Anglo settlers to come into the area: Dr. Benjamin Eaton , the father of Fred Eaton ; and Dr. S. Griffin. Much of the property was purchased by Benjamin Wilson , who established his Lake Vineyard property in the vicinity. Wilson, known as Don Benito to the local Indians, [ 19 ] also owned the Rancho Jurupa ( Riverside, California ) and was mayor of Los Angeles . He was the grandfather of WWII General George S. Patton Jr.

and the namesake of Mount Wilson .

View of Pasadena c. 1898 In 1873, Wilson was visited by Dr. Daniel M. Berry of Indiana, who was looking for a place in the country that could offer a mild climate for his patients, most of whom suffered from respiratory ailments. Berry, an asthmatic, concluded that he had his best three nights' sleep at Rancho San Pascual.

[ 22 ] To keep the find a secret, Berry code-named the area "Muscat" after the grape that Wilson grew. To raise funds to bring the company of people to San Pascual, Berry formed the Southern California Orange and Citrus Growers Association and sold stock in it.

[ 23 ] The newcomers were able to purchase a large portion of the property along the Arroyo Seco and on January 31, 1874, they incorporated the Indiana Colony . As a gesture of good will, Wilson added 2,000 acres (8 km 2 ) of then-useless highland property, part of which would become Altadena . Colonel Jabez Banbury opened the first school on South Orange Grove Avenue. Banbury had twin daughters, named Jennie and Jessie. The two became the first students to attend Pasadena's first school on Orange Grove.

[ 24 ] At the time, the Indiana Colony was a narrow strip of land between the Arroyo Seco and Fair Oaks Avenue . On the other side of the street was Wilson's Lake Vineyard development.

[ 25 ] After more than a decade of parallel development on both sides, the two settlements merged into the City of Pasadena.

[ 25 ] Resort town [ edit ] The former Hotel Green in 1900 The region drew people from across the country. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway opened its Second District and began making stops at the Santa Fe Depot in downtown Pasadena.

[ 26 ] This triggered a real estate boom. Tourist hotels were developed in the city. Pasadena became a winter resort for wealthy Easterners, spurring the development of new neighborhoods and business districts, and increased road and transit connections with Los Angeles. In 1940, when the Arroyo Seco Parkway , California's first freeway, connected Pasadena to Downtown Los Angeles. By that time, Pasadena had become the eighth-largest city in California and was widely considered a twin city to Los Angeles.

[ 27 ] Downtown Pasadena, c. 1910 The first of the hotels to be established in Pasadena was the Raymond (1886) atop Bacon Hill, renamed Raymond Hill after construction. The original Mansard Victorian 200-room facility burned down on Easter morning of 1895, was rebuilt in 1903, and razed during the Great Depression to make way for residential development. The Maryland Hotel existed from the early 1900s and was demolished in 1934.

[ citation needed ] The world-famous Mount Lowe Railway and associated mountain hotels shut down four years later due to fire damage. Three hotel structures have survived, the Green Hotel (a co-op since 1926), the Vista Del Arroyo (now used as a Federal courthouse), and a residential tower of the Maryland at 80 North Euclid Avenue (a co-op since 1953).

[ 28 ] The American Craftsman era in art and design is well represented in Pasadena. The architectural firm Greene and Greene developed the style; many of its residences still stand. Two examples of their Ultimate bungalow are the masterpiece Gamble House , of which public tours are available, and the Robert R. Blacker House , both designated California Historical Landmarks and enrolled on the U.S.

National Register of Historic Places .

Contemporary [ edit ] The California Institute of Technology in 1925 World War II was a boon to Pasadena. Southern California became a major staging area for the Pacific War .

[ 29 ] High-tech manufacturing and scientific companies made the city their home, a trend that continued in the decades following the war, notably with NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Tetra Tech , and Ameron International.

In the 1950s, Pasadena saw a steady influx of people from the Southern United States , especially African-Americans from Texas and Louisiana . Pasadena also began hosting a large immigrant community, particularly from China, Japan, Philippines, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Italy, Armenia, and India.

The American Academy of Dramatic Arts , founded in 1884 in New York, opened its Pasadena campus in 1974. However, in 2001 the conservatory moved from Pasadena to Hollywood. Training actors for the stage in a two year program, the conservatory was the first school in the United States to offer professional education in the field of acting.

Point Loma Nazarene University was located in Pasadena for many years before relocating to San Diego County , and retained the names Pasadena University and Pasadena College.

Downtown Pasadena in 1945 In 1969, the Pasadena Unified School District was desegregated, though the issue would continue to be fought in court for a decade. A year later, the 210 Freeway was built along a newly chosen route. The freeway's construction was controversial, as it caused the demolition of over a thousand homes, many historic, and many claimed that the route was designed to cut off the city's less wealthy neighborhoods.

Downtown Pasadena became dangerous in some parts and deserted in others, and incidences of murder and arson skyrocketed. Old Pasadena faced destruction as plans for new high-rise developments were drawn up, though they were mostly stopped by increasingly active preservation advocates. Pasadena suffered demographically as many residents moved for the nearby suburbs or the Inland Empire , causing an overall decrease in population.

[ citation needed ] Despite these setbacks, many local artists and hipsters moved in to take advantage of low property values. Their legacy can be seen today in the Doo Dah Parade which began in 1976.

In 2014, several arrests were made involving an embezzlement scheme which stole an estimated $6.4 million from the city's Underground Utility Program.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] In January 2025, portions of Pasadena were destroyed in the Eaton Fire .

[ 32 ] Geography [ edit ] Hahamongna Watershed Park The greater Pasadena area is bounded by the Raymond Fault line, the San Rafael Hills , and the San Gabriel Mountains . The Arroyo Seco , a major geographic feature and home of the Rose Bowl, flows from headwaters in Pasadena's towering Angeles National Forest greenbelt in the San Gabriel Mountains .

[ 17 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 23.1 square miles (60 km 2 ), over 99% of it land; 0.68% is water.

Its location relative to the San Gabriel mountains allows the orographic lift to add several more inches of rainfall per year than nearby areas. During the first few months of the year, Pasadena experiences cool to warm highs, typically in the upper 60s (16–18 °C) to lower 70s (21–24 °C). Colder days are usually accompanied by heavier rain. By April, temperatures warm further, and rain tapers off significantly.

By May and June, rain is typically sparse, but the marine layer becomes more persistent. Locals have dubbed June " June Gloom " as it is the cloudiest month despite being the 3rd driest month. By July, the marine layer subsides as inland areas cool due to an increased monsoon flow. Heatwaves from July through October can be oppressive and lengthy. In addition, it rarely rains during the summer and fall months, and only does when the remnants of hurricanes and tropical storms pass by. In fact, some days in both July and August have never recorded rainfall.

[ 34 ] It is not impossible to go 6 months without measurable precipitation.

The average highest temperature recorded each year is around 106 °F (41 °C). The hottest heatwaves of the year usually occur in mid to late September. By late October, temperatures drop off. By November, Pacific storms return to Pasadena, bringing increasingly heavy rain and cooler weather. Along with them, however, are the Santa Ana winds. The Santa Ana winds can produce heat, high winds, power outages, tree damage and an increased wildfire threat whenever they strike. By December, lows typically drop into the 40s (below 10 °C) with the occasional reading in the 30s (under 5 °C and down to freezing). Highs remain around 68 °F (20 °C) with heatwaves pushing temperatures into the mid-80s (around 30 °C). A high temperature of at least 85 °F (29 °C) has been recorded on all 365 days of the year, with temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C) possible April through early November.

The wettest "rain year" was from July 1940 to June 1941 with 46.32 in (1,176.5 mm) and the driest from July 1960 to June 1961 with 7.18 in (182.4 mm). Wet years are commonly associated with El Niño warm surface water in the eastern Pacific and dry years with La Niña cold water conditions. The most rainfall in one month was 19.70 in (500.4 mm) in February 1980. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 7.70 in (195.6 mm) on March 2, 1938.

La Loma Bridge , built in 1914, spans the Arroyo Seco .

Situated at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, snow is known to fall occasionally in Pasadena. The heaviest snowfall in Pasadena history occurred on January 11, 1949; 8 inches (20.3 cm) fell at Pasadena's city hall and more than 14 inches (35.6 cm) fell in the foothills above the city.

[ 37 ] The most recent snowfall in Pasadena was 1 inch (2.5 cm) on February 21, 2019.

On November 30 and December 1, 2011, Pasadena, along with surrounding communities, was struck by a major windstorm caused by Santa Ana winds.

[ 38 ] The city suffered heavy damage with trees toppled, buildings damaged and even the roof of a gas station torn off.

The official NOAA weather station for the city is located just north-west of the townhall on the other side of Garfield Avenue.

The first parade was held in 1890 and was originally sponsored by the Valley Hunt Club , a Pasadena social club . The motivation for having the parade was, as member Professor Charles F. Holder said, "In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise." [ 74 ] By 1895, the festivities had outgrown the Valley Hunt Club, and the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the parade. The Rose Parade, as it is familiarly known, traditionally features elaborate floats, bands and equestrian units. According to the organizers, "Every inch of every float must be covered with flowers, or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds, or bark. On average a float requires about 100,000 flowers and greenery. Volunteer workers swarm over the floats in the days after Christmas, their hands and clothes covered with glue and petals." [ 75 ] The most perishable flowers are placed in small vials of water, which are placed onto the float individually.

Construction began in June 2010 to extend the Gold Line east through several additional foothill communities of the San Gabriel Valley, including Arcadia, Monrovia, Duarte, Irwindale, and Azusa. It began revenue service on March 5, 2016.

[ 156 ] Pasadena is also served by various bus services.

Pasadena Transit exclusively serves the city, while bus services Amtrak Thruway 19 , Foothill Transit , LADOT Commuter Express 549 , Metro Local , and Metro Express also serve Pasadena.

[ 157 ] Trains [ edit ] Santa Fe Depot c.

1900 Pasadena was served by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad , which was acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1906, at a Santa Fe Depot in downtown when the Second District was opened in 1887.

[ 26 ] In 1925, the historical and traditionally styled station in Pasadena was opened.

[ 26 ] Originally, the Second District was an invaluable line; it served manufacturing and agricultural businesses throughout the entire San Gabriel Valley. But longer trains had great difficulty climbing the precipitous 2.2% grade at Arroyo Seco , between Pasadena and Los Angeles, requiring the costly addition of extra locomotives. The still-used Third District opened in 1888, just a year after the Second District, and rapidly took over most of the longer freight trains.

[ 26 ] The Second District and the Pasadena Depot became well known; up to 26 passenger trains went through Pasadena every day. To avoid the media in Los Angeles, many celebrities chose to use Pasadena as their main train station, bringing it an association with old Hollywood.

[ 26 ] [ 158 ] Amtrak took over passenger rail operations in 1971, serving Pasadena with trains such as the Southwest Chief , Las Vegas Limited , and Desert Wind . On January 15, 1994, the final Southwest Chief train arrived in Pasadena.

[ 158 ] ATSF sold the line between Los Angeles and San Bernardino via Pasadena (known as the "second division") following the 1994 Northridge earthquake which damaged a bridge in Arcadia used by the line.

[ 159 ] (Now the Southwest Chief operates over the transcon via Fullerton.) The LACMTA A Line uses the right-of-way after rebuilding the route to accommodate light rail in 2003. The old depot is still visible at the Del Mar station , though it has since been converted into a restaurant. Electrified Light Rail was the preferred alternative to Metrolink or similar style rail service due to the city of Pasadena voting against any further diesel locomotives traversing through the city.

[ 160 ] The construction of the Gold Line also allowed the closure of the former railroad crossing along Colorado Boulevard which meant that motorists and the Rose Parade would no longer be hindered by trains.

Airports [ edit ] Hollywood Burbank Airport in nearby Burbank serves as the regional airport for Pasadena. The airport is owned and operated by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport is under the control of the governments of the three cities named. While most destinations from Hollywood Burbank Airport are within the United States, Los Angeles International Airport and Ontario International Airport are the major airports that provide domestic and international commercial service. Other nearby airports with commercial service include Long Beach Airport and John Wayne Airport .

Freeways and highways [ edit ] Four freeways run through Pasadena, and Pasadena is a control city for all of them. The most important is the Foothill Freeway (I-210) which enters the northwestern portion of the city from La Cañada Flintridge . The Foothill Freeway initially runs due south, passing the Rose Bowl before its junction with the Ventura Freeway . At this interchange, the Foothill Freeway shifts its alignment and direction, becoming an east-west freeway, exiting the city on its eastern boundary before entering Arcadia . The Foothill Freeway connects Pasadena with San Fernando (westbound) and San Bernardino (eastbound).

Foothill Freeway (I-210) as seen from the Metro L Line Sierra Madre Villa Station The Ventura Freeway (SR 134) starts at the junction of the Foothill Freeway (I-210) at the edge of downtown Pasadena and travels westward. This freeway is the main connector to the Hollywood Burbank Airport and the San Fernando Valley .

A spur of the Long Beach Freeway (SR 710 in Pasadena) is also located in Pasadena. The Long Beach Freeway was intended to connect Long Beach to Pasadena but a gap, known as the South Pasadena Gap , between Alhambra and Pasadena has not been completed due to legal battles primarily involving the city of South Pasadena. The spur starts at the junction of the Ventura Freeway and Foothill Freeway and travels south along the eastern edge of Old Pasadena with two exits for Colorado Boulevard and Del Mar Boulevard before ending at an at-grade intersection with California Boulevard. Efforts to complete the Long Beach Freeway were met with strong opposition, including the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to overcome objections.

[ 161 ] The gap will no longer be constructed, with the $780 million earmarked for constructing the gap now allocated towards local infrastructure improvements.

[ 162 ] Pasadena is exploring options on the future of the spur.

[ 163 ] Colorado Street Bridge seen from the Arroyo Seco below The Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110) , also known as the Pasadena Freeway, was the first freeway in California, connecting Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco and is the primary access to Downtown Los Angeles . The freeway enters the southern part of the city from South Pasadena. Only one exit is actually inside city limits, the southbound exit connecting to State Street with access to Fair Oaks Avenue . At Glenarm Street, the freeway ends and the four-lane Arroyo Parkway continues northward to Old Pasadena.

Three state highways enter the city of Pasadena. Arroyo Parkway (SR 110), maintained by the city of Pasadena, runs from the termination of the Pasadena Freeway at Glenarm Street to Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena. While Arroyo Parkway continues north two more blocks, SR 110 ends at Holly Street.

Rosemead Boulevard (formerly SR 19 ) is a state highway in unincorporated Pasadena from Huntington Drive to Foothill Boulevard .

A portion of the Angeles Crest Highway ( SR 2 ) in the San Gabriel Mountains cuts through Pasadena near the Angeles Crest Ranger Station. This 2-mile (3.2 km) stretch of highway in the Angeles National Forest is north of La Cañada Flintridge and west of Mount Wilson and is approximately 3,000 feet (910 m) in elevation.

Historic U.S. Route 66 ran through Pasadena until it was decommissioned in 1964. The historic highway entered Pasadena from the east on Colorado Boulevard and then jogged south on Arroyo Parkway before becoming part of the Pasadena Freeway (SR 110) .

The intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena is the zero-zero, east-west, north-south postal division of Pasadena.

Water and power [ edit ] Water and Light Fountain at the historic Glenarm Power Plant . Designed by Harold H. Lewis in 1938.

The city Water and Power Department (PWP) provides services to an area encompassing 23 sq mi (60 km 2 ) that includes areas outside of the city proper, including unincorporated areas of southern Altadena, East Pasadena, Chapman Woods, and East San Gabriel. PWP has operated the Glenarm Power Plant for over 110 years.

Pasadena created the Pasadena Municipal Light and Power Department in 1906. Expanding continued and more generating capacity was expanded and the city then offered power to commercial customers in 1908, and bought out Southern California Edison 's Pasadena operations in 1920.

[ 164 ] In 1911, the city began condemnation actions against a number of small, local water companies. In 1912, the Water Department was created; in 1913, it began actual operations. The city continued to acquire small, local water companies for several decades afterwards, usually en toto , such as the Pasadena Lake Vineyard and Land Company, and sometimes in part, such as Las Flores Water Company's southern portions and San Gabriel Valley Water Company's operations in the southern reaches of Pasadena. In 1967, the Water Department and the Light and Power department were consolidated into the "Pasadena Water and Power Department" (PWP).

[ 164 ] It operates a number of water wells, has a spreading ground for the capture of surface water from the Arroyo Seco, and purchases surface water from MWDSC. A number of wells on the west side of the service area had become contaminated with volatile organic chemicals and perchlorate and had to be shut down several years. A treatment plant was built to remove these chemicals which began operation in July 2011.

[ citation needed ] Notable people [ edit ] See List of people from Pasadena, California Wildlife [ edit ] Pasadena has a large, non-indigenous population of naturalized parrots . According to the "Parrot Project of Los Angeles", [ 165 ] the parrots are of at least six species.

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ] Some residents have come to enjoy the birds as part of the city's unique culture, [ 169 ] [ 170 ] while others consider them to be loud pests. There are many theories explaining how the parrots came to inhabit Pasadena.

[ 171 ] A widely accepted story is that they were part of the stock that were set free for their survival from the large pet emporium at Simpson's Garden Town on East Colorado Boulevard, which burned down in 1959.

[ 167 ] [ 172 ] Sister cities [ edit ] The Pasadena Sister Cities Committee is the official organization that maintains Pasadena's ties with its corresponding sister cities.

[ 173 ] The mayor and vice mayor of Pasadena are members on an ex officio basis.

Pasadena has six sister cities as noted by Sister Cities International (SCI) and the Pasadena Sister Cities Committee: [ 174 ] Ludwigshafen , Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany (1948) pre-dates Sister Cities International which was formed in 1956 Mishima , Shizuoka , Japan (1957) Järvenpää , Finland (1983) [ 175 ] Vanadzor , Armenia (1991) Xicheng District , Beijing, China (1999) Dakar-Plateau , Senegal (2019) [ 176 ] The following are Friendship Cities: Kasukabe , Japan (1993) and Paju , Gyeonggi, South Korea (2009) See also [ edit ] Greater Los Angeles portal Largest cities in Southern California List of cities and towns in California National Register of Historic Places listings in Pasadena, California USS Pasadena , 3 ships Explanatory notes [ edit ] A The number of people counted statistically in demographics will sometimes exceed 100% because some Hispanics and Latinos identify as both White and Hispanic.
