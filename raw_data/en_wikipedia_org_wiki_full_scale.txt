In [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") and [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing"), **full scale** represents the maximum [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude "Amplitude") a system can represent.

In [digital systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_system "Digital system"), a signal is said to be at **digital full scale** when its magnitude has reached the maximum representable value. Once a signal has reached digital full scale, all [headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headroom_(audio_signal_processing) "Headroom (audio signal processing)") has been utilized, and any further increase in amplitude will result in an error known as [clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(signal_processing) "Clipping (signal processing)"). The amplitude of a digital signal can be represented in percent; full scale; or [decibels, full scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS "DBFS") (dBFS).

In analog systems, full scale may be defined by the maximum voltage available, or the maximum deflection (**full scale deflection** or **FSD**) or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or [galvanometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer "Galvanometer").

Binary representation
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full_scale&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Binary representation")]

Since [binary integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations#Two's_complement "Signed number representations") representation range is asymmetrical, full scale is defined using the maximum positive value that can be represented.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale#cite_note-2) For example, [16-bit PCM audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth "Audio bit depth") is centered on the value 0, and can contain values from −32,768 to +32,767. A signal is at full-scale if it reaches from −32,767 to +32,767. (This means that −32,768, the lowest possible value, slightly _exceeds_ full-scale.)

Signal processing in [digital audio workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation "Digital audio workstation") often uses [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic"), which can include values past full-scale, to avoid clipping in intermediate processing stages. In a [floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic") representation, a full-scale signal is typically defined to reach from −1.0 to +1.0.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale#cite_note-4)

The signal passes through an [anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter "Anti-aliasing filter"), [resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_rate_conversion "Sample rate conversion"), or [reconstruction filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_filter "Reconstruction filter"), which may increase peak amplitude slightly due to [ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts "Ringing artifacts").

It is possible for the _analog_ signal _represented by_ the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa. Converting to the analog domain, there is no clipping problem as long as the analog circuitry in the [digital-to-analog converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter "Digital-to-analog converter") is well designed.

If a full-scale analog signal is converted to digital with sufficient sampling frequency, and then [reconstructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_reconstruction "Signal reconstruction"), the [Nyquist theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_theorem "Nyquist theorem") guarantees that there will be no problem in the analog domain due to "peak" issues because the restored analog signal will be an exact copy of the original analog signal. (However, if the signal is [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_normalization "Audio normalization") in the digital domain, it may contain "intersample peaks" which exceed full scale after analog reconstruction.)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_scale#cite_note-5)
