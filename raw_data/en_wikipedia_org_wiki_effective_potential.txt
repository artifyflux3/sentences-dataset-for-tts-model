The effective potential (also known as effective potential energy ) combines multiple, perhaps opposing, effects into a single potential . In its basic form, it is the sum of the "opposing" centrifugal potential energy with the potential energy of a dynamical system . It may be used to determine the orbits of planets (both Newtonian and relativistic ) and to perform semi-classical atomic calculations, and often allows problems to be reduced to fewer dimensions .

Definition [ edit ] Effective potential.

E > 0: hyperbolic orbit (A 1 as pericenter), E = 0: parabolic orbit (A 2 as pericenter), E < 0: elliptic orbit ( A 3 as pericenter, A 3 ' as apocenter), E = E min : circular orbit ( A 4 as radius). Points A 1 , ..., A 4 are called turning points.

The basic form of potential U eff {\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}} is defined as U eff ( r ) = L 2 2 μ μ r 2 + U ( r ) , {\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {L^{2}}{2\mu r^{2}}}+U(\mathbf {r} ),} where L is the angular momentum , r is the distance between the two masses, μ is the reduced mass of the two bodies (approximately equal to the mass of the orbiting body if one mass is much larger than the other), U ( r ) is the general form of the potential .

The effective force, then, is the negative gradient of the effective potential: F eff = − − ∇ ∇ U eff ( r ) = L 2 μ μ r 3 r ^ ^ − − ∇ ∇ U ( r ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F} _{\text{eff}}&=-\nabla U_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf {r} )\\&={\frac {L^{2}}{\mu r^{3}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}-\nabla U(\mathbf {r} ),\end{aligned}}} where r ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}} denotes a unit vector in the radial direction.

Important properties [ edit ] There are many useful features of the effective potential, such as U eff ≤ ≤ E .

{\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}\leq E.} To find the radius of a circular orbit, simply minimize the effective potential with respect to r {\displaystyle r} , or equivalently set the net force to zero and then solve for r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}} : d U eff d r = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {dU_{\text{eff}}}{dr}}=0.} After solving for r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}} , plug this back into U eff {\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}} to find the maximum value of the effective potential U eff max {\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}}} .

A circular orbit may be either stable or unstable. If it is unstable, a small perturbation could destabilize the orbit, but a stable orbit would return to equilibrium. To determine the stability of a circular orbit, determine the concavity of the effective potential. If the concavity is positive, d 2 U eff d r 2 > 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}U_{\text{eff}}}{dr^{2}}}>0,} the orbit is stable.

The frequency of small oscillations, using basic Hamiltonian analysis, is ω ω = U eff ″ m , {\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {\frac {U_{\text{eff}}''}{m}}},} where the double prime indicates the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to r {\displaystyle r} and is evaluated at a minimum.

Gravitational potential [ edit ] Main article: Gravitational potential Components of the effective potential of two rotating bodies: (top) the combined gravitational potentials; (btm) the combined gravitational and rotational potentials Visualisation of the effective potential in a plane containing the orbit (grey rubber-sheet model with purple contours of equal potential), the Lagrangian points (red) and a planet (blue) orbiting a star (yellow) [ 1 ] Consider a particle of mass m orbiting a much heavier object of mass M . Assume Newtonian mechanics , which is both classical and non-relativistic. The conservation of energy and angular momentum give two constants E and L , which have values E = 1 2 m ( r ˙ ˙ 2 + r 2 ϕ ϕ ˙ ˙ 2 ) − − G m M r , {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}m\left({\dot {r}}^{2}+r^{2}{\dot {\phi }}^{2}\right)-{\frac {GmM}{r}},} L = m r 2 ϕ ϕ ˙ ˙ , {\displaystyle L=mr^{2}{\dot {\phi }},} when the motion of the larger mass is negligible. In these expressions, r ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {r}}} is the derivative of r with respect to time, ϕ ϕ ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {\phi }}} is the angular velocity of mass m , G is the gravitational constant , E is the total energy, L is the angular momentum .

Only two variables are needed, since the motion occurs in a plane. Substituting the second expression into the first and rearranging gives m r ˙ ˙ 2 = 2 E − − L 2 m r 2 + 2 G m M r = 2 E − − 1 r 2 ( L 2 m − − 2 G m M r ) , {\displaystyle m{\dot {r}}^{2}=2E-{\frac {L^{2}}{mr^{2}}}+{\frac {2GmM}{r}}=2E-{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}\left({\frac {L^{2}}{m}}-2GmMr\right),} 1 2 m r ˙ ˙ 2 = E − − U eff ( r ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}m{\dot {r}}^{2}=E-U_{\text{eff}}(r),} where U eff ( r ) = L 2 2 m r 2 − − G m M r {\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}(r)={\frac {L^{2}}{2mr^{2}}}-{\frac {GmM}{r}}} is the effective potential.

[ Note 1 ] The original two-variable problem has been reduced to a one-variable problem. For many applications the effective potential can be treated exactly like the potential energy of a one-dimensional system: for instance, an energy diagram using the effective potential determines turning points and locations of stable and unstable equilibria . A similar method may be used in other applications, for instance, determining orbits in a general relativistic Schwarzschild metric .

Effective potentials are widely used in various condensed matter subfields, e.g. the Gauss-core potential (Likos 2002, Baeurle 2004) and the screened Coulomb potential (Likos 2001).
