Institutions (including UNESCO ) concerned about safeguarding cultural diversity use the term.

[ 1 ] In its Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity , UNESCO notes the importance of States adopting inclusive ways of encouraging cultural diversity...

[ 2 ] Cultural mapping is also used to describe the use of research methods, tools, and techniques to identify, describe, portray, promote, and plan future use of particular regions' or cities' combined cultural assets and resources: A broadly-based mapping exercise for purposes of investigating or creating an identity profile of the community is enriching, informative and useful ...
