**Japanese punctuation** ([Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): 約物, [Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization "Hepburn romanization"): _yakumono_) includes various written marks (besides [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_character "Japanese character") and numbers), which differ from those found in [European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_languages "European languages"), as well as some not used in formal Japanese writing but frequently found in more casual writing, such as [exclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark") and [question marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark").

Japanese can be written [horizontally or vertically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts"), and some [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") marks adapt to this change in direction. [Parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses "Bracket"), curved brackets, square quotation marks, [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis"), dashes, and [swung dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swung_dash "Swung dash") are rotated clockwise 90° when used in vertical text ([see diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#Japanese_punctuation_marks)).

Japanese punctuation marks are usually "full width" (that is, occupying an area that is the same as the surrounding characters).

Punctuation was not widely used in Japanese writing until translations from European languages became common in the 19th century.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#cite_note-1)

Diagram showing differences in placement of punctuation marks in vertical and horizontal writing, in a sentence containing [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana"), [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") and [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji").

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [括弧](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%8B%AC%E5%BC%A7 "ja:括弧")

Various types of brackets (括弧, _kakko_) are used in Japanese. As in English, brackets are used in pairs to set apart or interject text within other text. When writing vertically, brackets are rotated clockwise ninety degrees. Each bracket occupies its own square when using _[genkō yōshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genk%C5%8D\_y%C5%8Dshi "Genkō yōshi")_.

_Sumitsukikakko_ (隅付き括弧, filled brackets), also known as lenticular brackets. Lenticular brackets are also used as quotation marks in the Japanese language.

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [読点](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AA%AD%E7%82%B9 "ja:読点")

| Symbol | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") | [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") | [Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _、_ | U+3001 | 1-1-2 | &#12289; |

The comma (読点, _tōten_) is used in many contexts, principally for marking off separate elements within a sentence. In horizontal writing, the comma is placed at the bottom right of the preceding character. In vertical writing, it is placed immediately below and to the right of the last character, in a separate square if using _genkō yōshi_. In horizontally written manuscripts that contain a mixture of Japanese and Western characters, the full-width [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma") may be incorporated as well. No extra space is left after a comma.

| _゠_ | KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN | U+30A0 | 1-3-91 | &#12448; |
| _＝_ | FULLWIDTH EQUALS SIGN | U+FF1D | 1-1-65 | &#65309; |

The double hyphen (二重ハイフン, _nijū haifun_ or ダブルハイフン, _daburu haifun_) is exclusively used in [transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration"). It may act in two ways:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#cite_note-2)

*   Primarily, it is used to represent a [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") (-), due to potential confusion with the [prolonged sound mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu "Chōonpu") (_ー_). For example, "[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau")" is written "ジャン゠ジャック・ルソー", and "[Catherine Zeta-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Zeta-Jones "Catherine Zeta-Jones")" is written "キャサリン・ゼタ゠ジョーンズ". Occasionally, the hyphen too may be represented as an interpunct (・), in which case no distinction is made between hyphens and spaces.
*   Although far more rarely, it can be observed in identical use to the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#Interpunct). In that case, "[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle "Arthur Conan Doyle")" may, for example, be written "サー゠アーサー゠コナン゠ドイル".

Digitally, it is correctly represented in Unicode as U+30A0゠KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN. However, due to visual similarity, absence from historically common encodings such as [Shift JIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS "Shift JIS") and [EUC-JP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUC-JP "EUC-JP"), and ease of input on a keyboard, it is often encountered written as U+FF1D＝FULLWIDTH EQUALS SIGN.

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [リーダー (記号)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC_(%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7) "ja:リーダー (記号)")

| Symbol | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") | [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") | [Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _…_ | U+2026 | 1-3-63 | &#8230; |
| _‥_ | U+2025 | 1-3-63 | &#8229; |

[Ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis "Ellipsis") (リーダー _rīdā_ (leaders), 点線 _tensen_ (dotted line), or てんてん _ten-ten_ ("dot dot") indicate an intentional omission or abbreviation, or a pause in speech, an unfinished thought or, at the end of a sentence, a trailing off into silence ([aposiopesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposiopesis "Aposiopesis")). The ellipsis was adopted into Japanese from European languages.

The ellipsis is often three dots or six dots (in two groups of three dots), though variations in number of dots exist. The dots can be either on the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography) "Baseline (typography)") or centred between the baseline and the [ascender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography) "Ascender (typography)") when horizontal; the dots are centred horizontally when vertical.

Other uses:

*   As a substitute for dashes
*   In [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga "Manga") and [visual novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel "Visual novel"), the ellipsis by itself often represents speechlessness or a "[pregnant pause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnant_pause "Pregnant pause")"

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [句点](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A5%E7%82%B9 "ja:句点")

| Symbol | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") | [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") | [Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _。_ | U+3002 | 1-1-3 | &#12290; |

The full stop (句点, _kuten_) is a small circle. In horizontal writing, the full stop is placed in the same position as it would be in English, that is, at the bottom right of the preceding character. In vertical writing, it is placed immediately below and to the right of the last character, in a separate square if using _[genkō yōshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genk%C5%8D\_y%C5%8Dshi "Genkō yōshi")_. (Note the difference in placement with the traditional Chinese full stop, which is placed in the centre of the square.)

Unlike the [English full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop"), it is often used to separate consecutive sentences, rather than to finish every sentence; it is frequently left out where a sentence stands alone. No extra space is used after a full stop.

In manuscripts that contain a mixture of Japanese and Western characters, the Western full stop may be incorporated as well.

#### Words containing full stops

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese_punctuation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Words containing full stops")]

Starting in the 1980s, [advertising copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_copy "Advertising copy") writers began incorporating full stops in titles and other advertising. In the 1990s, the group [Morning Musume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Musume "Morning Musume") (モーニング娘。) began using a full stop in its name, starting a fad for this usage. Other examples include the following:

*   _[Good Person.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii\_Hito "Ii Hito")_ (いいひと。, _Ii Hito_), a [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga "Manga") by [Shin Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Takahashi "Shin Takahashi").
*   [Ecomoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomoni "Ecomoni"). (エコモ二。), a Japanese pop group from [Hello! Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_Project "Hello! Project").
*   _[Nobuta. wo Produce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuta.\_wo\_Produce "Nobuta. wo Produce")_ (野ブタ。をプロデュース), a drama series ([dorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_television_drama "Japanese television drama")), produced and aired in 2005 by [NTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Television "Nippon Television").
*   _[Your Name.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your\_Name. "Your Name.")_ (君の名は。), a 2016 [Japanese animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Anime")[romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film "Romance film")[drama film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_film "Drama film") written and directed by [Makoto Shinkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai "Makoto Shinkai").

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [中黒](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E9%BB%92 "ja:中黒")

The [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct")**・** (中黒, _nakaguro_; "middle black") or "katakana middle dot" (as the Unicode consortium calls it) is a small dot used for [interword separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interword_separation "Interword separation"). It is also known as _nakapochi_, _nakapotsu_ and _nakaten_. It has a fixed width that is the same as most kana characters.

Uses include:

*   Separating Japanese words where the intended meaning would be unclear if the characters were written side-by-side
*   To separate listed items, instead of a comma: 小・中学校 (elementary and middle school) versus 小、中学校
*   To separate foreign words and names when written in kana: パーソナル・コンピューター (personal computer), and occasionally for Japanese names, particularly when there would otherwise be confusion as to where one name ends and another begins.
*   As a substitute for a [double hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#Double_hyphen)
*   To separate titles, names and positions: 部長補佐・鈴木 (Assistant Department Head Suzuki)
*   As a [decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point") when writing numbers in kanji: 三・一四 (3.14)
*   In place of hyphens, dashes and colons when writing vertically

### Part alternation mark

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese_punctuation&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Part alternation mark")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Part_alternation_mark.svg/120px-Part_alternation_mark.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Part_alternation_mark.svg)

The part alternation mark

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [庵点](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BA%B5%E7%82%B9 "ja:庵点")

| Symbol | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") | [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") | [Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _〽_ | U+303D | 1-3-28 | &#12349; |

The part alternation mark **_〽_** (庵点 _ioriten_ or 歌記号 _utakigō_) is used to indicate the beginning of a song, or the beginning of the next player's part.

It was most common in [Noh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh "Noh") chanting books and [Renga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renga "Renga") (linked verse). In Noh books it is used to mark the beginning of each character's (or the chorus') parts. The opening square quotation mark (_「_) may also be used.

#### Single quotation marks

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese_punctuation&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Single quotation marks")]

「 」
_kagikakko_ (鉤括弧, hook brackets)

#### Double quotation marks

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese_punctuation&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Double quotation marks")]

『 』〝 〟
Double quotation marks (二重鉤括弧, _nijūkagikakko_) are used to mark quotes within quotes: _「...『...』...」_ as well as to mark book titles (Japanese does not have [italic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type"), and does not use sloping type for this purpose in Japanese). They are also sometimes used in fiction to denote text that is heard through a telephone or other device.

**Use of spaces on _[genkō yōshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genk%C5%8D\_y%C5%8Dshi "Genkō yōshi")_**

**1**. 3 spaces before the title.

**2**. 1 space between the author's family name and given name; 1 space below.

**3**. Each new paragraph begins after a space.

**4**. Subheadings have 1 empty line before and after, and have 2 spaces above.

**5**. Punctuation marks normally occupy their own square, except when they occur at the bottom of a line, in which case they share a square with the last character of the line.

A space () is any empty (non-written) zone between written sections. In Japanese, the space is referred to by the transliterated English name (スペース, _supēsu_). A Japanese space is the same width as a [CJK character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters "CJK characters") and is thus also called an "ideographic space".

In English, spaces are used for [interword separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interword_separation "Interword separation") as well as separation between punctuation and words. In normal Japanese writing, no spaces are left between words, except if the writing is exclusively in [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") or [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") (or with very little [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji")), in which case spaces may be required to avoid confusion.

In Japanese, a single space is often left before the first character in a new paragraph, especially when writing on _[genkō yōshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genk%C5%8D\_y%C5%8Dshi "Genkō yōshi")_ (manuscript paper), and a space is left after non-Japanese punctuation marks (such as exclamation points and question marks). A space may be left between the [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name "Family name") and [given names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name "Given name") as well. When the character is not easily available, a direct HTML equivalent is the `&emsp;` entity (em-space) which outputs the same fullwidth " " glyph.

A fullwidth space may be used where a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") or comma would be used in English: 大和銀行 大阪支店 (_Yamato Bank, Osaka Branch_).

The wave dash

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [波ダッシュ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%A2%E3%83%80%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5 "ja:波ダッシュ")

| Symbol | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") | [JIS X 0213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0213 "JIS X 0213") | [Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") |

The [wave dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_dash "Wave dash")**_〜_** (波ダッシュ, _nami dasshu_; wave dash) resembles a lengthened [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde")(FULLWIDTH TILDE), which does not exist in [JIS X 0208](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0208 "JIS X 0208").

Uses in Japanese include:

*   To indicate ranges (5時〜6時, from 5 o'clock to 6 o'clock; 東京〜大阪[Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo") to [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka "Osaka")). In such cases it may be read as _...kara...made_ (...から...まで)
*   To separate a title from a subtitle on the same line; in English a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") is used for this purpose.
*   To mark subtitles: 〜概要〜
*   In pairs, in place of dashes or brackets: 〜〜答え〜〜
*   To indicate origin: フランス〜 (from France)
*   To indicate a long or drawn-out vowel (ですよね〜 or あ〜〜〜), usually for comic or [cute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii "Kawaii") effect
*   To indicate or suggest that music is playing: _♬ 〜_
*   To suggest a ruled line: _〜〜〜〜〜_ or _〜・〜・〜_

Other punctuation marks in common use
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese_punctuation&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Other punctuation marks in common use")]

The Japanese versions of these punctuation marks are usually [full-width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms "Halfwidth and fullwidth forms") characters. A full-width space is usually left after such marks when writing in Japanese.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_punctuation#cite_note-3)

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [コロン (記号)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AD%E3%83%B3_(%E8%A8%98%E5%8F%B7) "ja:コロン (記号)")

 ： 
The colon (コロン, _koron_) consists of two equally sized dots centered on the same vertical line. As a rule, a colon informs the reader that what follows proves, clarifies, explains, or simply enumerates elements of what is referred to before. Although not a native Japanese punctuation mark, the colon is sometimes used, especially in academic writing.

As in English, the colon is commonly used in Japanese to indicate time (_4:05_, instead of 4時5分 or 4分5秒) or for lists (日時:3月3日 4時5分 Day/time: March 3, 4:05pm).

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [感嘆符](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%84%9F%E5%98%86%E7%AC%A6 "ja:感嘆符")

 ！ 
The [exclamation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_point "Exclamation point") or mark (感嘆符, _kantanfu_), also colloquially called the びっくりマーク (_bikkuri māku_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") "surprise mark") is usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or high volume, and generally marks the end of a sentence. A sentence ending in an exclamation mark is either an actual exclamation ("Wow!", "Boo!"), a command ("Stop!"), or is intended to be astonishing in some way ("They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!").

While there is no exclamation point in formal Japanese, it is very commonly used, especially in casual writing, [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction "Fiction") and manga.

Main article on the Japanese Wikipedia: [疑問符](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%96%91%E5%95%8F%E7%AC%A6 "ja:疑問符")

 ？ 
In formal Japanese, no particular symbol is used to mark interrogative sentences, which end with the normal Japanese full stop (_。_). However, the question mark is very commonly used, especially in casual and creative writing and in manga. It is generally known formally as 疑問符 (_gimonfu_) or less formally はてなマーク (_hatena māku_), but the katakana form of "question mark" (クエスチョンマーク or クエッションマーク) is also common.

 ♪ 
This sign is added to the tail of a phrase, indicating it is a part of lyrics or someone is singing the phrase. It may also indicate that the speaker is talking in a sing-song voice.
