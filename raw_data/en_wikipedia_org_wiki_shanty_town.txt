A shanty town , squatter area, squatter settlement , or squatter camp is a settlement of improvised buildings known as shanties or shacks , typically made of materials such as mud and wood, or from cheap building materials such as corrugated iron sheets. A typical shanty town is squatted and, at least initially,  lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity and street drainage. Over time, shanty towns may develop their infrastructure and even change into middle class neighbourhoods.

[ citation needed ] They can be small informal settlements or they can house millions of people.

First used in North America to designate a shack, the term shanty is likely derived from French chantier (construction site and associated low-level workers' quarters), or alternatively from Scottish Gaelic sean ( pronounced [ʃɛn] ) meaning 'old' and taigh ( pronounced [tʰɤj] ) meaning 'house[hold]'.

Globally, some of the largest shanty towns are Ciudad Neza in Mexico, Orangi in Pakistan and Dharavi in India. They are known by various names in different places, such as favela in Brazil, villa miseria in Argentina and gecekondu in Turkey. Shanty towns are mostly found in developing nations , but also in the cities of developed nations , such as Athens , Los Angeles and Madrid .

Cañada Real is considered the largest informal settlement in Europe, and Skid Row is an infamous shanty town in Los Angeles. Shanty towns are sometimes found on places such as railway sidings , swampland or disputed building projects. In South Africa , squatter camps, often referred to as "plakkerskampe", directly translated from the Afrikaans word for squatter camps, often start and grow rapidly on vacant land or public spaces within or close to cities and towns, where there may be nearby work opportunities, without the cost of transport.

Construction [ edit ] Shacks in Villa 31 , near Retiro Station, Buenos Aires, Argentina, showing construction.

Shanty towns tend to begin as improvised shelters on squatted land. People build shacks from whatever materials are easy to acquire, for example wood or mud. There are no facilities such as electricity, gas, sewerage or running water. The squatters choose areas such as railway sidings, preservation areas or disputed building projects.

[ 1 ] Swiss journalist Georg Gerster noted, with specific reference to the invasões of Brasília , that "squatter settlements [as opposed to slums ], despite their unattractive building materials, may also be places of hope, scenes of a counter-culture, with an encouraging potential for change and a strong upward impetus".

[ 2 ] Stewart Brand observed that shanty towns are environmentally friendly , with people recycling as much as possible and tending to travel by foot, bicycle, rickshaw or shared taxi rather than car, due to poverty.

[ 3 ] Development and future prospects [ edit ] Some shanty towns have an informal economy , such as garbage scavenging, pottery-making, textiles, or leather works, providing some income. In Ezbet Al Nakhl, Cairo , Egypt, garbage is scavenged (residential area at top of  image).

While most shanty towns begin as precarious establishments haphazardly thrown together without basic social and civil services, over time, some have undergone a certain amount of development. Often the residents themselves are responsible for the major improvements.

[ 4 ] Community organizations sometimes working alongside NGOs , private companies, and the government, set up connections to the municipal water supply, pave roads, and build local schools.

[ 4 ] Some of these shanties have become middle class suburbs . One such example is the Los Olivos neighbourhood of Lima , Peru, which now contains gated communities , casinos , and plastic surgery clinics.

[ 4 ] Some Brazilian favelas have also seen improvements in the 21st century, and can even attract tourists.

[ 5 ] Development occurs over a long period of time, and newer towns—and many older ones—still lack basic services. Nevertheless, there has been a general trend whereby shanties undergo gradual improvements, rather than relocation to even more distant parts of a metropolis.

[ 6 ] [ failed verification ] In Africa, many shanty towns are starting to implement the use of composting toilets [ 7 ] and solar panels .

[ 8 ] In India, people living in slums have access to cell phones and the internet.

[ 9 ] Other African shanty towns have even become popular tourist attractions.

Soweto (SOuthWEst TOwnship), an old squatter camp from apartheid -era South Africa is now classified as a city within a city, with a population of almost 2 million. The "Soweto Towers" vertical adventure centre is in Soweto, [ 10 ] and there are guided excursions, often including a Shisa-nyama.

Pope Francis argued in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato si' that shanty town settlements should be developed, if possible, rather than people being moved on and their settlements destroyed. He and the Catholic Church 's Council for Justice and Peace have emphasised the need for information, involvement and choice being offered to people being moved on.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Instances [ edit ] Shanty towns are present in a number of developing countries . In Francophone countries, shanty towns are referred to as bidonvilles (French for "can town"); such countries include Haiti , where Cité Soleil houses between 200,000 and 300,000 people on the edge of Port-au-Prince .

[ 13 ] Africa [ edit ] In 2016, 62% of Africa's population was living in shanty towns.

[ 14 ] Squatter camps in South Africa typically use cheap, and easily acquired building materials such as corrugated tin sheets to build shacks. Offering very little protection against extreme weather conditions, these squatter camps, often built near streams or rivers due to the steady water supply, are often subjected to flash floods. They are also prone to runaway fires due to the close proximity they are built in. They often cause a great deal of damage to naturally occurring ecosystems, both directly, and indirectly. An example of severe indirect damage is the use of washing detergents, and refuse disposal in the nearby water source, which can often be seen for hundreds of kilometers down stream.

Due to the lack of infrastructure, and the cost of basic services, such as water and electricity, the overall squatted area is often barren, with the ground sweeped and stamped to minimise dust, and where gardening is simply impossible and unaffordable. Illegal and dangerous electricity connections are abundant, another danger for fires, and electrical accidents, The Joe Slovo squatter camp, in Cape Town, houses an estimated 20,000 people.

[ 15 ] Shack dwellers in South Africa organise themselves in groups such as Abahlali baseMjondolo and Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign .

Developed countries [ edit ] An impoverished American family living in a shanty during the Great Depression . Photographed by Dorothea Lange in 1936 Shanty town along the Martin Pena Canal in Puerto Rico (1970s).

During the 1930s Great Depression , shanty towns nicknamed Hoovervilles sprang up across the United States.

[ 30 ] Following the Great Depression,  squatters lived in shacks on landfill sites beside the Martin Pena canal in Puerto Rico and were still there in 2010.

[ 31 ] More recently, cities such as Newark and Oakland have witnessed the creation of tent cities . The Umoja Village shanty town was squatted in 2006 in Miami, Florida.

[ 32 ] There are also colonias near the border with Mexico.

[ 33 ] Although shanty towns are now generally less common in developed countries in Europe, they still exist. The growing influx of migrants has fuelled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the European Union, including Athens and Patras in Greece.

[ 34 ] The Calais Jungle in France had grown to over 8,000 people by the time of its clearance in October 2016.

[ 35 ] Bidonvilles exist in the peripheries of some French cities. The state authorities recorded 16,399 people living in 391 slums across the country in 2012. Of these, 41% lived on the outskirts of Paris.
