Seismometers are the instruments that are used to capture ground motion.

For twenty years, two Bosch-Omori horizontal pendulum instruments were working in the basement of the Geological Museum at the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1928, the station was moved to the Oak Ridge Observatory at Harvard, Massachusetts.
