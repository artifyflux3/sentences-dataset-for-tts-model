Déborah Oliveros Oliveros in Oberwolfach , 2024 Nationality Mexican Alma mater UNAM Scientific career Fields Discrete geometry , combinatorics , convex geometry Thesis Los volantines : sistemas dinamicos asociados al problema de la flotacion de los cuerpos (1997) Doctoral advisor Luis Montejano, Javier Bracho Déborah Oliveros Braniff is a Mexican mathematician whose research interests include discrete geometry , combinatorics , and convex geometry , including the geometry of bodies of constant width and related topics.

[ 1 ] Education and career [ edit ] After earning an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1992, and earning a master's degree in 1994 under the mentorship of Mónica Clapp , [ 2 ] Oliveros continued at UNAM for graduate study in mathematics, with doctoral research on an unsolved question of Stanislaw Ulam concerning the buoyancy of floating convex bodies.

[ 1 ] Her 1997 dissertation on the topic, Los volantines : sistemas dinamicos asociados al problema de la flotacion de los cuerpos , was jointly supervised by Luis Montejano and Javier Bracho.

[ 3 ] She became a professor at UNAM in 1996, but left in 1999 for postdoctoral research at the University of Calgary in Canada. She became a professor there from 2001 to 2005, when she returned to a professorship at UNAM.

[ 2 ] She became one of the founders of the branch of the UNAM Institute of Mathematics at the UNAM Juriquilla campus, and directed the institute for 2015–2016.

[ 1 ] She also holds an affiliation with the Faculty of Engineering of the Autonomous University of Queretaro .

[ 4 ] Book [ edit ] Oliveros is a coauthor with Horst Martini and Luis Montejano of the book Bodies of Constant Width: An Introduction to Convex Geometry with Applications (Birkhäuser, 2019).

[ 5 ] Recognition [ edit ] UNAM gave Oliveros the "Reconocimiento Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz" award in 2014.

[ 6 ] She is a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences .
