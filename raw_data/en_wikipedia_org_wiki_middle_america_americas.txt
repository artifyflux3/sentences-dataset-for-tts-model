[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Geography [ edit ] Political map of Middle America Physiographically , Middle America marks the territorial transition between Northern America and South America , connecting yet separating the two.

[ 4 ] On the west, the Middle American mainland comprises the tapering, isthmian tract of the American landmass between the southern Rocky Mountains in the southern United States and the northern tip of the Andes in Colombia, [ 5 ] separating the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Atlantic Ocean (viz. the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea ) on the east, while the Greater and Lesser Antilles form an island arc in the east.

[ 4 ] The region developed subaerially southward from North America as a complex volcanic arc - trench system during the Early Cretaceous period, eventually forming the land bridge during the Pliocene epoch when its southern end (at Panama) collided with South America through tectonic action .

[ 6 ] Countries and territories [ edit ] Small island nations are excluded. Puerto Rico is in italics due to not being independent.

In English, the term is uncommonly used as a synonym of the term Mesoamerica (or Meso- America ), [ 5 ] [ 7 ] which generally refers to an ancient culture region situated in Middle America extending roughly from central Mexico to northern Costa Rica .

[ 8 ] In addition, some residents of the region (e.g., Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans ) may be referred to as Meso-Americans or Central Americans, but not, however, as Middle Americans , which refers to a particular constituency in the United States.

Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies, to which the term is normally applicable, share a general [geographic] focus .... For some ... "Middle America" refers only to Mexico and Central America; others add the West Indies and, infrequently, even Colombia , Venezuela , and The Guianas . Occasionally, the term "Central America" is used synonymously with "Middle America". Also, German geographers often refer to just the isthmian territories from Panama to Guatemala as Mittelamerika .
