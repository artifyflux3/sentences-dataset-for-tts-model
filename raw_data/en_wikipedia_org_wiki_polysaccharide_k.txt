Polysaccharide-K ( Krestin , PSK ) is a protein -bound polysaccharide isolated from the mycelium [ 1 ] [ 2 ] of Trametes versicolor .

Although PSK is approved in Japan as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment , [ 3 ] it is not approved in the United States for treatment of cancer or any clinical condition.

[ 4 ] Research [ edit ] There is little evidence that turkey tail mushroom extracts or PSK are useful for treating cancer or any medical condition.

[ 4 ] Polysaccharide-K, an extract of T. versicolor , is approved in Japan as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment.

[ 3 ] Chemistry [ edit ] PSK is a protein polysaccharide consisting of a beta-glucan β-1,4 main chain with β-1,3 and β-1,6 side chains. The approximate molecular weight of PSK is 100,000 Da , and the protein component is reported at the β-1,6 side chain.

[ 5 ] PSK is isolated from the "CM-101" strain of Trametes versicolor . The analogous compound PSP , is derived from the "COV-1" strain of Trametes versicolor .
