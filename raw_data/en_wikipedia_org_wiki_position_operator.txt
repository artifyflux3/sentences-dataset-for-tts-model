When the position operator is considered with a wide enough domain (e.g. the space of tempered distributions ), its eigenvalues are the possible position vectors of the particle.

[ 1 ] In one dimension, if by the symbol | x ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |x\rangle } we denote the unitary eigenvector of the position operator corresponding to the eigenvalue x {\displaystyle x} , then, | x ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |x\rangle } represents the state of the particle in which we know with certainty to find the particle itself at position x {\displaystyle x} .

Therefore, denoting the position operator by the symbol X {\displaystyle X} we can write X | x ⟩ ⟩ = x | x ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle X|x\rangle =x|x\rangle ,} for every real position x {\displaystyle x} .

One possible realization of the unitary state with position x {\displaystyle x} is the Dirac delta (function) distribution centered at the position x {\displaystyle x} , often denoted by δ δ x {\displaystyle \delta _{x}} .

In quantum mechanics, the ordered (continuous) family of all Dirac distributions, i.e. the family δ δ = ( δ δ x ) x ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle \delta =(\delta _{x})_{x\in \mathbb {R} },} is called the (unitary) position basis, just because it is a (unitary) eigenbasis of the position operator X {\displaystyle X} in the space of tempered distributions .

It is fundamental to observe that there exists only one linear continuous operator X {\displaystyle X} on the space of tempered distributions to itself, such that X ( δ δ x ) = x δ δ x , {\displaystyle X(\delta _{x})=x\delta _{x},} for every real point x {\displaystyle x} . It's possible to prove that the unique above endomorphism is necessarily defined by X ( ψ ψ ) = x ψ ψ , {\displaystyle X(\psi )=\mathrm {x} \psi ,} for every tempered distribution ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , where x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } denotes the coordinate function of the position line –  defined from the real line into the complex plane by x : R → → C : x ↦ ↦ x .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {x} :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {C} :x\mapsto x.} Introduction [ edit ] Consider representing the quantum state of a particle at a certain instant of time by a square integrable wave function ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } . For now, assume one space dimension (i.e. the particle "confined to" a straight line). If the wave function is normalized , then the square modulus | ψ ψ | 2 = ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ψ ψ , {\displaystyle |\psi |^{2}=\psi ^{*}\psi ,} represents the probability density of finding the particle at some position x {\displaystyle x} of the real-line, at a certain time. That is, if ‖ ‖ ψ ψ ‖ ‖ 2 = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ | ψ ψ | 2 d x = 1 , {\displaystyle \|\psi \|^{2}=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }|\psi |^{2}d\mathrm {x} =1,} then the probability to find the particle in the position range [ a , b ] {\displaystyle [a,b]} is π π X ( ψ ψ ) ( [ a , b ] ) = ∫ ∫ a b | ψ ψ | 2 d x .

{\displaystyle \pi _{X}(\psi )([a,b])=\int _{a}^{b}|\psi |^{2}d\mathrm {x} .} Hence the expected value of a measurement of the position X {\displaystyle X} for the particle is ⟨ ⟨ X ⟩ ⟩ ψ ψ = ∫ ∫ R x | ψ ψ | 2 d x = ∫ ∫ R ψ ψ ∗ ∗ ( x ψ ψ ) d x = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | X ( ψ ψ ) ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \langle X\rangle _{\psi }=\int _{\mathbb {R} }\mathrm {x} |\psi |^{2}d\mathrm {x} =\int _{\mathbb {R} }\psi ^{*}(\mathrm {x} \psi )\,d\mathrm {x} =\langle \psi |X(\psi )\rangle ,} where x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } is the coordinate function x : R → → C : x ↦ ↦ x , {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {C} :x\mapsto x,} which is simply the canonical embedding of the position-line into the complex plane.

Strictly speaking, the observable position X = x ^ ^ {\displaystyle X={\hat {\mathrm {x} }}} can be point-wisely defined as ( x ^ ^ ψ ψ ) ( x ) = x ψ ψ ( x ) , {\displaystyle \left({\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\psi \right)(x)=x\psi (x),} for every wave function ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } and for every point x {\displaystyle x} of the real line. In the case of equivalence classes ψ ψ ∈ ∈ L 2 {\displaystyle \psi \in L^{2}} the definition reads directly as follows x ^ ^ ψ ψ = x ψ ψ , ∀ ∀ ψ ψ ∈ ∈ L 2 .

{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\psi =\mathrm {x} \psi ,\quad \forall \psi \in L^{2}.} That is, the position operator X {\displaystyle X} multiplies any wave-function ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } by the coordinate function x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } .

Three dimensions [ edit ] The generalisation to three dimensions is straightforward.

The space-time wavefunction is now ψ ψ ( r , t ) {\displaystyle \psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)} and the expectation value of the position operator r ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}} at the state ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is ⟨ r ^ ^ ⟩ ψ ψ = ∫ ∫ r | ψ ψ | 2 d 3 r {\displaystyle \left\langle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}\right\rangle _{\psi }=\int \mathbf {r} |\psi |^{2}d^{3}\mathbf {r} } where the integral is taken over all space. The position operator is r ^ ^ ψ ψ = r ψ ψ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} \psi =\mathbf {r} \psi .} Basic properties [ edit ] In the above definition, which regards the case of a particle confined upon a line,  the careful reader may remark that there does not exist any clear specification of the domain and the co-domain for the position operator. In literature, more or less explicitly, we find essentially three main directions to address this issue.

The position operator is defined on the subspace D X {\displaystyle D_{X}} of L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} formed by those equivalence classes ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } whose product by the embedding x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } lives in the space L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} . In this case the position operator X : D X ⊂ ⊂ L 2 → → L 2 : ψ ψ ↦ ↦ x ψ ψ {\displaystyle X:D_{X}\subset L^{2}\to L^{2}:\psi \mapsto \mathrm {x} \psi } reveals not continuous (unbounded with respect to the topology induced by the canonical scalar product of L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} ), with no eigenvectors, no eigenvalues and consequently with empty point spectrum .

The position operator is defined on the Schwartz space S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} (i.e. the nuclear space of all smooth complex functions defined upon the real-line whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing). In this case the position operator X : S ⊂ ⊂ L 2 → → S ⊂ ⊂ L 2 : ψ ψ ↦ ↦ x ψ ψ {\displaystyle X:{\mathcal {S}}\subset L^{2}\to {\mathcal {S}}\subset L^{2}:\psi \mapsto \mathrm {x} \psi } reveals continuous (with respect to the canonical topology of S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} ), injective, with no eigenvectors, no eigenvalues and consequently with empty point spectrum. It is (fully) self-adjoint with respect to the scalar product of L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} in the sense that ⟨ ⟨ X ( ψ ψ ) | ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ | X ( ϕ ϕ ) ⟩ ⟩ , ∀ ∀ ψ ψ , ϕ ϕ ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle \langle X(\psi )|\phi \rangle =\langle \psi |X(\phi )\rangle ,\quad \forall \psi ,\phi \in {\mathcal {S}}.} The position operator is defined on the dual space S × × {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}^{\times }} of S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} (i.e. the nuclear space of tempered distributions ). As L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} is a subspace of S × × {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}^{\times }} , the product of a tempered distribution by the embedding x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } always lives S × × {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}^{\times }} . In this case the position operator X : S × × → → S × × : ψ ψ ↦ ↦ x ψ ψ {\displaystyle X:{\mathcal {S}}^{\times }\to {\mathcal {S}}^{\times }:\psi \mapsto \mathrm {x} \psi } reveals continuous (with respect to the canonical topology of S × × {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}^{\times }} ), surjective, endowed with complete families of generalized  eigenvectors and real generalized eigenvalues. It is self-adjoint with respect to the scalar product of L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} in the sense that its transpose operator t X : S → → S : ϕ ϕ ↦ ↦ x ϕ ϕ , {\displaystyle {}^{t}X:{\mathcal {S}}\to {\mathcal {S}}:\phi \mapsto \mathrm {x} \phi ,} is self-adjoint, that is ⟨ t X ( ϕ ϕ ) | ψ ψ ⟩ = ⟨ ϕ ϕ | t X ( ψ ψ ) ⟩ , ∀ ∀ ψ ψ , ϕ ϕ ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle \left\langle \left.\,{}^{t}X(\phi )\right|\psi \right\rangle =\left\langle \phi |\,{}^{t}X(\psi )\right\rangle ,\quad \forall \psi ,\phi \in {\mathcal {S}}.} The last case is, in practice, the most widely adopted choice in Quantum Mechanics literature, although never explicitly underlined.

[ citation needed ] It addresses the possible absence of eigenvectors by extending the Hilbert space to a rigged Hilbert space : [ 2 ] S ⊂ ⊂ L 2 ⊂ ⊂ S × × , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}\subset L^{2}\subset {\mathcal {S}}^{\times },} thereby providing a mathematically rigorous notion of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

[ 3 ] Eigenstates [ edit ] The eigenfunctions of the position operator (on the space of tempered distributions), represented in position space , are Dirac delta functions .

Informal proof.

To show that possible eigenvectors of the position operator should necessarily be Dirac delta distributions, suppose that ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is an eigenstate of the position operator with eigenvalue x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} . We write the eigenvalue equation in position coordinates, x ^ ^ ψ ψ ( x ) = x ψ ψ ( x ) = x 0 ψ ψ ( x ) {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\psi (x)=\mathrm {x} \psi (x)=x_{0}\psi (x)} recalling that x ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathrm {x} }}} simply multiplies the wave-functions by the function x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } , in the position representation. Since the function x {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} } is variable while x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a constant, ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } must be zero everywhere except at the point x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} . Clearly, no continuous function satisfies such properties, and we cannot simply define the wave-function to be a complex number at that point because its L 2 {\displaystyle L^{2}} -norm would be 0 and not 1. This suggest the need of a "functional object" concentrated at the point x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} and with integral different from 0: any multiple of the Dirac delta centered at x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} .
The normalized solution to the equation x ψ ψ = x 0 ψ ψ {\displaystyle \mathrm {x} \psi =x_{0}\psi } is ψ ψ ( x ) = δ δ ( x − − x 0 ) , {\displaystyle \psi (x)=\delta (x-x_{0}),} or better ψ ψ = δ δ x 0 , {\displaystyle \psi =\delta _{x_{0}},} such that x δ δ x 0 = x 0 δ δ x 0 .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {x} \delta _{x_{0}}=x_{0}\delta _{x_{0}}.} Indeed, recalling that the product of any function by the Dirac distribution centered at a point is the value of the function at that point times the Dirac distribution itself, we obtain immediately x δ δ x 0 = x ( x 0 ) δ δ x 0 = x 0 δ δ x 0 .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {x} \delta _{x_{0}}=\mathrm {x} (x_{0})\delta _{x_{0}}=x_{0}\delta _{x_{0}}.} Although such Dirac states are physically unrealizable and, strictly speaking, are not functions, the Dirac distribution centered at x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} can be thought of as an "ideal state" whose position is known exactly (any measurement of the position always returns the eigenvalue x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} ). Hence, by the uncertainty principle , nothing is known about the momentum of such a state.

Momentum space [ edit ] Usually, in quantum mechanics, by representation in the momentum space we intend the representation of states and observables with respect to the canonical unitary momentum basis η η = ( [ ( 2 π π ℏ ℏ ) − − 1 2 e ( ι ι / ℏ ℏ ) ( x | p ) ] ) p ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle \eta =\left(\left[(2\pi \hbar )^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}e^{(\iota /\hbar )(\mathrm {x} |p)}\right]\right)_{p\in \mathbb {R} }.} In momentum space , the position operator in one dimension is represented by the following differential operator ( x ^ ^ ) P = i ℏ ℏ d d p = i d d k , {\displaystyle \left({\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\right)_{P}=i\hbar {\frac {d}{d\mathrm {p} }}=i{\frac {d}{d\mathrm {k} }},} where: the representation of the position operator in the momentum basis is naturally defined by ( x ^ ^ ) P ( ψ ψ ) P = ( x ^ ^ ψ ψ ) P {\displaystyle \left({\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\right)_{P}(\psi )_{P}=\left({\hat {\mathrm {x} }}\psi \right)_{P}} , for every wave function (tempered distribution) ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ; p {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} } represents the coordinate function on the momentum line and the wave-vector function k {\displaystyle \mathrm {k} } is defined by k = p / ℏ ℏ {\displaystyle \mathrm {k} =\mathrm {p} /\hbar } .

Formalism in L 2 ( R , C ) [ edit ] Consider the case of a spinless particle moving in one spatial dimension. The state space for such a particle contains L 2 ( R , C ) {\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {C} )} ; the Hilbert space of complex-valued , square-integrable functions on the real line .

The position operator is defined as the self-adjoint operator Q : D Q → → L 2 ( R , C ) : ψ ψ ↦ ↦ q ψ ψ , {\displaystyle Q:D_{Q}\to L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {C} ):\psi \mapsto \mathrm {q} \psi ,} with domain of definition D Q = { ψ ψ ∈ ∈ L 2 ( R ) ∣ ∣ q ψ ψ ∈ ∈ L 2 ( R ) } , {\displaystyle D_{Q}=\left\{\psi \in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} )\mid \mathrm {q} \psi \in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} )\right\},} and coordinate function q : R → → C {\displaystyle \mathrm {q} :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {C} } sending each point x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } to itself, 
such that [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Q ( ψ ψ ) ( x ) = x ψ ψ ( x ) = q ( x ) ψ ψ ( x ) , {\displaystyle Q(\psi )(x)=x\psi (x)=\mathrm {q} (x)\psi (x),} for each pointwisely defined ψ ψ ∈ ∈ D Q {\displaystyle \psi \in D_{Q}} and x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } .

Immediately from the definition we can deduce that the spectrum consists of the entire real line and that Q {\displaystyle Q} has a strictly continuous spectrum , i.e., no discrete set of eigenvalues.

The three-dimensional case is defined analogously. We shall keep the one-dimensional assumption in the following discussion.

Measurement theory in L 2 ( R , C ) [ edit ] As with any quantum mechanical observable , in order to discuss position measurement , we need to calculate the spectral resolution of the position operator X : D X → → L 2 ( R , C ) : ψ ψ ↦ ↦ x ψ ψ {\displaystyle X:D_{X}\to L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {C} ):\psi \mapsto \mathrm {x} \psi } which is X = ∫ ∫ R λ λ d μ μ X ( λ λ ) = ∫ ∫ R x μ μ X = μ μ X ( x ) , {\displaystyle X=\int _{\mathbb {R} }\lambda \,d\mu _{X}(\lambda )=\int _{\mathbb {R} }\mathrm {x} \,\mu _{X}=\mu _{X}(\mathrm {x} ),} where μ μ X {\displaystyle \mu _{X}} is the so-called spectral measure of the position operator.

Let χ χ B {\displaystyle \chi _{B}} denote the indicator function for a Borel subset B {\displaystyle B} of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . Then the spectral measure is given by ψ ψ ↦ ↦ μ μ X ( B ) ( ψ ψ ) = χ χ B ψ ψ , {\displaystyle \psi \mapsto \mu _{X}(B)(\psi )=\chi _{B}\psi ,} i.e., as multiplication by the indicator function of B {\displaystyle B} .

Therefore, if the system is prepared in a state ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } , then the probability of the measured position of the particle belonging to a Borel set B {\displaystyle B} is ‖ ‖ μ μ X ( B ) ( ψ ψ ) ‖ ‖ 2 = ‖ ‖ χ χ B ψ ψ ‖ ‖ 2 = ∫ ∫ B | ψ ψ | 2 μ μ = π π X ( ψ ψ ) ( B ) , {\displaystyle \|\mu _{X}(B)(\psi )\|^{2}=\|\chi _{B}\psi \|^{2}=\int _{B}|\psi |^{2}\ \mu =\pi _{X}(\psi )(B),} where μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the Lebesgue measure on the real line.

After any measurement aiming to detect the particle within the subset B, the wave function collapses to either μ μ X ( B ) ψ ψ ‖ ‖ μ μ X ( B ) ψ ψ ‖ ‖ = χ χ B ψ ψ ‖ ‖ χ χ B ψ ψ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{X}(B)\psi }{\|\mu _{X}(B)\psi \|}}={\frac {\chi _{B}\psi }{\|\chi _{B}\psi \|}}} or ( 1 − − χ χ B ) ψ ψ ‖ ‖ ( 1 − − χ χ B ) ψ ψ ‖ ‖ , {\displaystyle {\frac {(1-\chi _{B})\psi }{\|(1-\chi _{B})\psi \|}},} where ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|} is the Hilbert space norm on L 2 ( R , C ) {\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {C} )} .
