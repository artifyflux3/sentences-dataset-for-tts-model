The Hamilton Institute was established in November 2001 under the first round of funding, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). It was officially opened by Bill Harris, SFI Director-General with the inaugural lecture being given by Kevin Warwick . Since 2001 the institute grew to a size to around 45 full-time researchers in 2008.

[ 3 ] From 2001 until 2014 the institute Director was Douglas Leith. From 2015 to 2016 Fiona Lyddy was acting director, [ citation needed ] with Ken Duffy serving as the Institute's director from 2016-2020.

[ 4 ] Since 2023, Andrew Parnell has been the director.

[ 5 ] Since its founding, the institute has won a number of research grants, in addition to the original seed funding grant from SFI, including the €4.7M National Communications Network Research Centre, [ 6 ] a €2.5M Systems Biology initiative, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] the €2.7M Next Generation Internet project, [ 9 ] the National Biophotonics Platform [ 10 ] and the €2.2M Network Mathematics initiative.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The institute was also a partner in the €5.8M SFI funded FAME strategic research cluster announced in 2009.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] It hosts Maynooth University's students for the SFI Centre for Research Training in Data Analytics [ 16 ] [ 17 ] and Damien Wood's DNA computing group.

[ 18 ] The Hamilton Institute is on the top floor of the EOLAS building The Hamilton Institute's stated aim is to provide a bridge between mathematics and its applications in ICT and biology .

[ 19 ] It has organised a number of inter-disciplinary workshops including a series of biannual International Workshops on Non-negative Matrices & Their Applications, [ 20 ] (run in 2004, [ 21 ] 2006 [ 22 ] and 2008) [ 23 ] and a series of International Workshops on Systems Biology (in 2006 [ 24 ] and 2008).

[ 25 ] The Hamilton Institute has also hosted workshops such as the International Symposium on Positive Systems (POSTA), [ 26 ] the International Workshop on Multiple Access Communications (MACOM) [ 27 ] and the Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference.

[ 28 ] The Hamilton Institute robotic soccer team were RoboCup World Champions in 2008, [ 29 ] [ 30 ] and have regularly fielded Robocup teams since.
