Florkin was graduated in 1928 as a Doctor in Medicine and became in 1934 a professor of biochemistry at the University of Liège . He retired as professor emeritus in 1970.

[ 1 ] In 1951, he was the initiator of the Belgian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology . Together with Christian de Duve , and others, he wrote a proposal for the statutes which was adopted in 1952, on the first general meeting. In 1944, he published a book (translated to English in 1949) concerning biochemical evolution, in which he explained the relevance of evolution for understanding differences in metabolism and chemical makeup between different types of organisms.

[ 2 ] In later years he applied the principles of biosemiotics (indicator biology) on biochemistry. In 1946, Marcel Florkin was awarded the Francqui Prize on Biological and Medical Sciences. He was a member of the Association for the intellectual and artistic progress of Wallonia .
