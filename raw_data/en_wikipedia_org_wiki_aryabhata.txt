**Aryabhata** ( [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919 "ISO 15919"): _Āryabhaṭa_) or **Aryabhata I**[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Aryabhata_the_Elder-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Publishing2010-4) (476–550 [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era"))[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ray2009-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Yadav2010-6) was the first of the major [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician")-[astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") from the classical age of [Indian mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics "Indian mathematics") and [Indian astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_astronomy "Indian astronomy"). His works include the _[Āryabhaṭīya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80ryabha%E1%B9%AD%C4%ABya "Āryabhaṭīya")_ (which mentions that in 3600 _[Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali\_Yuga "Kali Yuga")_, 499 CE, he was 23 years old)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Roupp1997-7) and the _Arya-[siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhanta "Siddhanta")_.

For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-8)

Biography
---------

### Name

While there is a tendency to misspell his name as "Aryabhatta" by analogy with other names having the "[bhatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhatta "Bhatta")" suffix, his name is properly spelled Aryabhata: every astronomical text spells his name thus,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9) including [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta")'s references to him "in more than a hundred places by name".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Bhau-1) Furthermore, in most instances "Aryabhatta" would not fit the metre either.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9)

### Time and place of birth

Aryabhata mentions in the _Aryabhatiya_ that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the _[Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali\_Yuga "Kali Yuga")_, but this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Yadav2010-6) Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or [Pataliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra "Pataliputra") (near present day [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna "Patna"), [Bihar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar "Bihar")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Bhau-1)

#### Other hypothesis

[Bhāskara I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_I "Bhāskara I") describes Aryabhata as _āśmakīya_, "one belonging to the _[Aśmaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9Bmaka "Aśmaka")_ country." During the Buddha's time, a branch of the Aśmaka people settled in the region between the [Narmada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmada_River "Narmada River") and [Godavari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godavari "Godavari") rivers in central India.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

It has been claimed that the _aśmaka_ (Sanskrit for "stone") where Aryabhata originated may be the present day [Kodungallur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodungallur "Kodungallur") which was the historical capital city of _Thiruvanchikkulam_ of ancient Kerala.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Menon-11) This is based on the belief that Koṭuṅṅallūr was earlier known as Koṭum-Kal-l-ūr ("city of hard stones"); however, old records show that the city was actually Koṭum-kol-ūr ("city of strict governance"). Similarly, the fact that several commentaries on the Aryabhatiya have come from Kerala has been used to suggest that it was Aryabhata's main place of life and activity; however, many commentaries have come from outside Kerala, and the Aryasiddhanta was completely unknown in Kerala.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9) K. Chandra Hari has argued for the Kerala hypothesis on the basis of astronomical evidence.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-12)

Aryabhata mentions "Lanka" on several occasions in the _Aryabhatiya_, but his "Lanka" is an abstraction, standing for a point on the equator at the same longitude as his [Ujjayini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjayini "Ujjayini").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-13)

### Education

It is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-14) Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as [Bhāskara I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_I "Bhāskara I") (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as [Pāṭaliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%ADaliputra "Pāṭaliputra"), modern [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna "Patna").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9) A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (_\_kulapa\__) at Kusumapura, and, because the university of [Nalanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda "Nalanda") was in Pataliputra at the time, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-sarma-9) However Aryabhata's connection with Nalanda has been termed as "speculation" as he himself never declared Nalanda to be his patron in his writings which given the prestige of Nalanda at the time, would have made his connection to it unlikely.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-15) The claim that Nalanda used to be located in Kusamapura/Pataliputra also cannot be proven.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-16) Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in [Taregana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taregana "Taregana"), Bihar.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-17)

Works
-----

Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), though _[Aryabhatiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya "Aryabhatiya")_ is the only one which survives.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-18)

Much of the research included subjects in astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, and other fields.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19)_Aryabhatiya_, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:0-20) The mathematical part of the _Aryabhatiya_ covers [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"), [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), [plane trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), and [spherical trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry "Spherical trigonometry"). It also contains [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction "Continued fraction"), [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation"), sums-of-[power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series"), and a [table of sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata%27s_sine_table "Aryabhata's sine table").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:0-20)

The _Arya-siddhanta_, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, [Varahamihira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varahamihira "Varahamihira"), and later mathematicians and commentators, including [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta") and [Bhaskara I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I "Bhaskara I"). This work appears to be based on the older [Surya Siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta "Surya Siddhanta") and uses the midnight-day reckoning, as opposed to sunrise in _Aryabhatiya_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10) It also contained a description of several astronomical instruments: the [gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon "Gnomon") (_shanku-yantra_), a shadow instrument (_chhaya-yantra_), possibly angle-measuring devices, semicircular and circular (_dhanur-yantra_ / _chakra-yantra_), a cylindrical stick _yasti-yantra_, an umbrella-shaped device called the _chhatra-yantra_, and [water clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock") of at least two types, bow-shaped and cylindrical.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

A third text, which may have survived in the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") translation, is _Al ntf_ or _Al-nanf_. It claims that it is a translation by Aryabhata, but the Sanskrit name of this work is not known. Probably dating from the 9th century, it is mentioned by the [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people") scholar and chronicler of India, [Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Rayh%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB "Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

### Aryabhatiya

Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from the _Aryabhatiya_. The name "Aryabhatiya" is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-8) His disciple [Bhaskara I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I "Bhaskara I") calls it _Ashmakatantra_ (or the treatise from the Ashmaka). It is also occasionally referred to as _Arya-shatas-aShTa_ (literally, Aryabhata's 108), because there are 108 verses in the text.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:0-20)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-8) It is written in the very terse style typical of [sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutra "Sutra") literature, in which each line is an aid to memory for a complex system. Thus, the explication of meaning is due to commentators. The text consists of the 108 verses and 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four _pāda_ s or chapters:

1.   _Gitikapada_: (13 verses): large units of time—_kalpa_, _manvantra_, and _yuga_—which present a cosmology different from earlier texts such as Lagadha's _[Vedanga Jyotisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanga\_Jyotisha "Vedanga Jyotisha")_ (c. 1st century BCE). There is also a table of sines (_[jya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jya "Jya")_), given in a single verse. The duration of the planetary revolutions during a _mahayuga_ is given as 4.32 million years.
2.   _Ganitapada_ (33 verses): covering [mensuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensuration_(mathematics) "Mensuration (mathematics)") (_kṣetra vyāvahāra_), arithmetic and geometric progressions, [gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon "Gnomon") / shadows (_shanku_-_chhAyA_), simple, [quadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equations "Quadratic equations"), [simultaneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations "Simultaneous equations"), and [indeterminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations "Diophantine equations") equations (_kuṭṭaka_).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19)
3.   _Kalakriyapada_ (25 verses): different units of time and a method for determining the positions of planets for a given day, calculations concerning the intercalary month (_adhikamAsa_), _kShaya-tithi_ s, and a seven-day week with names for the days of week.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19)
4.   _Golapada_ (50 verses): Geometric/[trigonometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric "Trigonometric") aspects of the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere"), features of the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"), [celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator "Celestial equator"), node, shape of the earth, cause of day and night, rising of [zodiacal signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_sign "Zodiacal sign") on horizon, etc.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19) In addition, some versions cite a few [colophons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing) "Colophon (publishing)") added at the end, extolling the virtues of the work, etc.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19)

The _Aryabhatiya_ presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple Bhaskara I (_Bhashya_, c.600 CE) and by [Nilakantha Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji "Nilakantha Somayaji") in his _Aryabhatiya Bhasya_ (1465 CE).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:0-20)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-:1-19)

_Aryabhatiya_ is also well-known for his description of relativity of motion. He expressed this relativity thus: "Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects (on the shore) as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people on earth as moving exactly towards the west."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-8)

Mathematics
-----------

### Place value system and zero

The [place-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place-value "Place-value") system, first seen in the 3rd-century [Bakhshali Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhshali_Manuscript "Bakhshali Manuscript"), was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero"), the French mathematician [Georges Ifrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Ifrah "Georges Ifrah") argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's [place-value system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place-value_system "Place-value system") as a place holder for the powers of ten with [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(mathematics) "Null (mathematics)")[coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficients "Coefficients").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-21)

However, Aryabhata did not use the Brahmi numerals. Continuing the [Sanskritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") tradition from [Vedic times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period "Vedic period"), he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities, such as the table of sines in a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") form.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-22)

### Approximation of _π_

Aryabhata worked on the approximation for [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. In the second part of the _Aryabhatiyam_ (_gaṇitapāda_ 10), he writes:

> _\_caturadhikaṃ śatamaṣṭaguṇaṃ dvāṣaṣṭistathā sahasrāṇām\__
> 
> _\_ayutadvayaviṣkambhasyāsanno vṛttapariṇāhaḥ.\__
> 
> 
> "Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached."[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-23)

This implies that for a circle whose diameter is 20000, the circumference will be 62832

i.e, ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a) = ![Image 3: {\displaystyle 62832 \over 20000}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69c3a5e87dfa5351bafcc322cf38aeff80d1efb1) = ![Image 4: {\displaystyle 3.1416}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd22cc5592e082759248145de8729154be290992), which is accurate to two parts in one million.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-aryabhattapi-24)

It is speculated that Aryabhata used the word _āsanna_ (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or [irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational "Irrational")). If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, because the irrationality of pi (π) was proved in Europe only in 1761 by [Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert "Johann Heinrich Lambert").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-25)

After Aryabhatiya was translated into [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") (c.820 CE), this approximation was mentioned in [Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi "Al-Khwarizmi")'s book on algebra.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

### Trigonometry

In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as

_\_tribhujasya phalaśarīraṃ samadalakoṭī bhujārdhasaṃvargaḥ\__
that translates to: "for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area."[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-26)

Aryabhata discussed the concept of _[sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine")_ in his work by the name of _[ardha-jya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardha-jya "Ardha-jya")_, which literally means "half-chord". For simplicity, people started calling it _[jya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jya "Jya")_. When Arabic writers translated his works from [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") into Arabic, they referred it as _jiba_. However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as _jb_. Later writers substituted it with _jaib_, meaning "pocket" or "fold (in a garment)". (In Arabic, _jiba_ is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when [Gherardo of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gherardo_of_Cremona "Gherardo of Cremona") translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic _jaib_ with its Latin counterpart, _sinus_, which means "cove" or "bay"; thence comes the English word _sine_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-27)

### Indeterminate equations

A problem of great interest to [Indian mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematicians "Indian mathematicians") since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations "Diophantine equations") that have the form ax + by = c.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-28) (This problem was also studied in ancient Chinese mathematics, and its solution is usually referred to as the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem "Chinese remainder theorem").) This is an example from [Bhāskara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_I "Bhāskara I")'s commentary on Aryabhatiya:

Find the number which gives 5 as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as the remainder when divided by 9, and 1 as the remainder when divided by 7
That is, find N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85. In general, diophantine equations, such as this, can be notoriously difficult. They were discussed extensively in ancient Vedic text [Sulba Sutras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulba_Sutras "Sulba Sutras"), whose more ancient parts might date to 800 BCE. Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the _\_kuṭṭaka\__ (कुट्टक) method. _[Kuṭṭaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADaka "Kuṭṭaka")_ means "pulverizing" or "breaking into small pieces", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was called _kuṭṭaka-gaṇita_ or simply _kuṭṭaka_.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-29)

### Algebra

In _Aryabhatiya_, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics) "Series (mathematics)") of squares and cubes:[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-30)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle 1^{2}+2^{2}+\cdots +n^{2}={n(n+1)(2n+1) \over 6}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b1a47289cece2440528c05d6278f26976e777da)
and

![Image 6: {\displaystyle 1^{3}+2^{3}+\cdots +n^{3}=(1+2+\cdots +n)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/551fa64a9d0998afbb6435d14eba6719eb595df0) (see [squared triangular number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squared_triangular_number "Squared triangular number"))
Astronomy
---------

Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the _audAyaka system_, in which days are reckoned from _uday_, dawn at _lanka_ or "equator". Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or _ardha-rAtrikA_, midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta")'s _[Khandakhadyaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khandakhadyaka "Khandakhadyaka")_. In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation"). He may have believed that the planet's orbits are [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") rather than circular.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Hayashi08Aryabhata-32)

### Motions of the Solar System

Aryabhata correctly stated in Aryabhatiyam in 47 AD that the Earth is round and it rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-aryabhattapi-24)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-33): 30  This is indicated in the first chapter of the _Aryabhatiya_, where he gives the number of rotations of the Earth in a _yuga_,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-34) and made more explicit in his _gola_ chapter:[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-35)

> In the same way that someone in a boat going forward sees an unmoving [object] going backward, so [someone] on the equator sees the unmoving stars going uniformly westward. The cause of rising and setting [is that] the sphere of the stars together with the planets [apparently?] turns due west at the equator, constantly pushed by the [cosmic wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_wind "Cosmic wind").

Aryabhata described a [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric "Geocentric") model of the Solar System, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle"). They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the _Paitāmahasiddhānta_ (c.425 CE), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller _manda_ (slow) and a larger _śīghra_ (fast).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-36) The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), and the [asterisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy) "Asterism (astronomy)").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet's motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two-epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic [Greek astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_astronomy "Hellenistic astronomy").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-37) Another element in Aryabhata's model, the _śīghrocca_, the basic planetary period in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric "Heliocentric") model.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-38)

### Eclipses

Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by [Rahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahu "Rahu") and [Ketu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketu_(mythology) "Ketu (mythology)") (identified as the pseudo-planetary [lunar nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_nodes "Lunar nodes")), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Thus, the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth's shadow (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the size and extent of the Earth's shadow (verses gola.38–48) and then provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the core. His computational paradigm was so accurate that 18th-century scientist [Guillaume Le Gentil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Le_Gentil "Guillaume Le Gentil"), during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the [lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse "Lunar eclipse") of 30 August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Ansari-10)

### Sidereal periods

Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the [sidereal rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_rotation "Sidereal rotation") (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds;[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-Selin1997-39) the modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his value for the length of the [sidereal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year "Sidereal year") at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds (365.25858 days)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-40) is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-41)

### Heliocentrism

As mentioned, Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model also gave corrections (the _śīgra_ anomaly) for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean speed of the Sun. Thus, it has been suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on an underlying [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") model, in which the planets orbit the Sun,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-44) though this has been rebutted.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-45) It has also been suggested that aspects of Aryabhata's system may have been derived from an earlier, likely pre-Ptolemaic [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy "Greek astronomy"), heliocentric model of which Indian astronomers were unaware,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-46) though the evidence is scant.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-47) The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late [Babylonian astronomical texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomical_diaries "Babylonian astronomical diaries")), and that Aryabhata's system was not explicitly heliocentric.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-48)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Aryabhata_Satellite.jpg/330px-Aryabhata_Satellite.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aryabhata_Satellite.jpg)

[India's first satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata_(satellite) "Aryabhata (satellite)") named after Aryabhata[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") translation during the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") (c.820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by [Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi "Al-Khwarizmi") and in the 10th century [Al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni") stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.

His definitions of [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") (_[jya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jya "Jya")_), cosine (_[kojya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojya "Kojya")_), versine (_[utkrama-jya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utkrama-jya "Utkrama-jya")_), and inverse sine (_otkram jya_) influenced the birth of [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"). He was also the first to specify sine and [versine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versine "Versine") (1−cos _x_) tables, in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places.

In fact, the modern terms "sine" and "cosine" are mistranscriptions of the words _jya_ and _kojya_ as introduced by Aryabhata. As mentioned, they were translated as _jiba_ and _kojiba_ in Arabic and then misunderstood by [Gerard of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_of_Cremona "Gerard of Cremona") while translating an Arabic geometry text to [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"). He assumed that _jiba_ was the Arabic word _jaib_, which means "fold in a garment", L. _sinus_ (c. 1150).[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-49)

Aryabhata's astronomical calculation methods were also very influential. Along with the trigonometric tables, they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to compute many Arabic astronomical tables ([zijes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zij "Zij")). In particular, the astronomical tables in the work of the [Arabic Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") scientist [Al-Zarqali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zarqali "Al-Zarqali") (11th century) were translated into Latin as the [Tables of Toledo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tables_of_Toledo "Tables of Toledo") (12th century) and remained the most accurate [ephemeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris "Ephemeris") used in Europe for centuries.

Calendric calculations devised by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for the practical purposes of fixing the [Panchangam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchangam "Panchangam") (the [Hindu calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar "Hindu calendar")). In the Islamic world, they formed the basis of the [Jalali calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar "Jalali calendar") introduced in 1073 CE by a group of astronomers including [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam "Omar Khayyam"),[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-50) versions of which (modified in 1925) are the national calendars in use in [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan") today. The dates of the Jalali calendar are based on actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata and earlier [Siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhanta "Siddhanta") calendars. This type of calendar requires an ephemeris for calculating dates. Although dates were difficult to compute, seasonal errors were less in the Jalali calendar than in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Aryabhatta Knowledge University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatta_Knowledge_University "Aryabhatta Knowledge University") (AKU), Patna has been established by Government of Bihar for the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management and allied professional education in his honour. The university is governed by Bihar State University Act 2008.

India's first satellite [Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata_(satellite) "Aryabhata (satellite)") and the [lunar crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_crater "Lunar crater")[Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata_(crater) "Aryabhata (crater)") are both named in his honour, the Aryabhata satellite also featured on the reverse of the [Indian 2-rupee note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_2-rupee_note "Indian 2-rupee note"). An Institute for conducting research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the [Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatta_Research_Institute_of_Observational_Sciences "Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences") (ARIES) near Nainital, India. The inter-school [Aryabhata Maths Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryabhata_Maths_Competition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aryabhata Maths Competition (page does not exist)") is also named after him,[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-51) as is _Bacillus aryabhata_, a species of bacteria discovered in the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") by [ISRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISRO "ISRO") scientists in 2009.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#cite_note-ISRO_Press_Release_16_March_2009-53)
