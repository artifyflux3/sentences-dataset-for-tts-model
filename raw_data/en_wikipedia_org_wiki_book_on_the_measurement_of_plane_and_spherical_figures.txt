[ 2 ] A Latin translation by the 12th century Italian astrologer Gerard of Cremona was made, entitled Liber trium fratrum de geometria and Verba filiorum Moysi filii Sekir . The original work in Arabic was edited by the Persian polymath Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī in the 13th century.

[ 3 ] The original work in Arabic is not extant, but its contents are known from later translations.

[ 4 ] The treatise, which is about geometry , was similar to two books by Archimedes , On the measurement of the circle and On the sphere and the cylinder .

[ 3 ] It was used extensively in the Middle Ages, and was quoted by authors such as Thābit ibn Qurra , Ibn al-Haytham , Leonardo Fibonacci (in his Practica geometriae ), Jordanus de Nemore , and Roger Bacon .

[ 5 ] It deals with the geometrical concepts of area and volume , angle trisection , construction , and conic sections .

[ 6 ] It includes theorems not known to the Greeks.

[ 7 ] The book was re-published in Latin with an English translation by the American historian Marshall Clagett , who has also summarized how the work influenced mathematicians during the Middle Ages .
