Marinus ( Ancient Greek : Μαρῖνος ὁ Νεαπολίτης ; born c. 440 AD) was a Byzantine Neoplatonist philosopher , mathematician and rhetorician [ 1 ] born in Flavia Neapolis (modern Nablus), Palaestina Secunda . He was a student of Proclus in Athens. His surviving works are an introduction to Euclid 's Data ; a Life of Proclus , and two astronomical texts.

Most of what we know of his life comes from an epitome of a work by Damascius conserved in the Byzantine Suda encyclopedia.

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] He was, according to his pupil Damascius, born a Samaritan .

[ 3 ] [ a ] Whether this information is correct is disputed, but it is quite possible. Damascius also adds that he had converted from Samaritanism .

[ 4 ] He came to Athens at a time when, with the exception of Proclus , there was a great dearth of eminent men in the Neoplatonist school . He was appointed as successor ( diadochos ) to Proclus, sometime before the latter's death, during the period of the teacher's infirmity. Proclus dedicated to Marinus his commentary on Plato 's Myth of Er .

[ 5 ] Proclus himself, it is reported, worried that Marinus himself was of delicate constitution.

[ 6 ] During this period, the professors of the old Greek religion suffered persecution at the hands of the Christians and Marinus was compelled to seek refuge at Epidaurus , where he died, at a date unknown.

[ 7 ] Works [ edit ] Only a remnant of his output survives.

[ 8 ] His chief surviving work was a biography of Proclus, since it is the main source of information on Proclus' life. This was written in a combination of prose and epic hexameters , of which only the former survives.

[ 7 ] The publication of the biography is fixed by internal evidence to the year of Proclus's death; for he mentions an eclipse which will happen when the first year after that event is completed. It was first published with the works of Marcus Aurelius in 1559; it was republished separately by Fabricius at Hamburg in 1700, and re-edited in 1814 by Boissonade with emendations and notes.

[ 9 ] He is also the author of a commentary (or introduction) on the Data of Euclid , and a commentary on Theon 's Little Commentary .

[ 10 ] There is also a surviving astronomical text which discusses the Milky Way .

[ 10 ] His lost works included commentaries on Aristotle , on Theon of Alexandria and on some of the dialogues of Plato . He is said to have destroyed his commentary on Plato's Philebus on the advice of a pupil he was tutoring, Isidorus .

[ 11 ] According to a version of the story written by Damascius, when Marinus showed his student, to whom he taught Aristotelianism , [ 12 ] this commentary, which he had just completed, Isidorus prevailed on him to destroy it, arguing that since the 'divine' Proclus had himself written a definitive commentary which was the final word on the topic.

[ 13 ] Current scholarship suspects that this advice arose from fears that Marinus' commentary would, despite his best efforts, betray traces of material that might undermine the reigning Neoplatonic paradigm .

[ 13 ] References [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] ^ 'He says that the successor of Proclus, Marinus, came from Neapolis in Palestine, a city situated near the mountain called Argarizon Then the impious writer uttered the blasphemy that on this mountain there is a most holy sanctuary of Zeus the Highest, to whom Abraham the father of the old Hebrew consecrated himself'.
