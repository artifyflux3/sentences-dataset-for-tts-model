dilatino dilaton gluino gluon Eight gluons and eight gluinos.

gravitino graviton Predicted by supergravity ( SUGRA ).

higgsino Higgs boson For supersymmetry there is a need for several Higgs bosons, neutral and charged, according with their superpartners.

photino photon Mixing with zino and neutral Higgsinos for neutralinos.

wino, zino W and Z bosons The charged wino mixing with the charged Higgsino for charginos, for the zino see line above.

Just as the photon, Z and W ± bosons are superpositions of the B 0 , W 0 , W 1 , and W 2 fields, the photino , zino, and wino ± are superpositions of the bino 0 , wino 0 , wino 1 , and wino 2 . No matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutralinos and charginos as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos.

Other superpartner categories include: Charginos ,  superpositions of the superpartners of charged Standard Model bosons: charged Higgs boson and W boson. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts two pairs of charginos.

Neutralinos ,  superpositions of the superpartners of neutral Standard Model bosons: neutral Higgs boson, Z boson and photon. The lightest neutralino is a leading candidate for dark matter. The MSSM predicts four neutralinos.

Goldstinos are fermions produced by the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry ; they are the supersymmetric counterpart of Goldstone bosons .

Sgoldstino , superpartners of goldstinos.
