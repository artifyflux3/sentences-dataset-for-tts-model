It is stated as ∀ ∀ x .

∀ ∀ y .

∃ ∃ w .

∀ ∀ z .

( z ∈ ∈ w ↔ ↔ ( z ∈ ∈ x ∨ ∨ z = y ) ) .

{\displaystyle \forall x.\forall y.\exists w.\forall z.{\big (}z\in w\leftrightarrow (z\in x\lor z=y){\big )}.} Bernays ( 1937 , page 68, axiom II (2)) introduced the axiom of adjunction as one of the axioms for a system of set theory that he introduced in about 1929.
It is a weak axiom, used in some weak systems of set theory such as general set theory or finitary set theory . The adjunction operation is also used as one of the operations of primitive recursive set functions .

Interpretability of arithmetic [ edit ] Tarski and Szmielew showed that Robinson arithmetic ( Q {\displaystyle {\mathsf {Q}}} ) can be interpreted in a weak set theory whose axioms are extensionality , the existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction ( Tarski 1953 , p.34).
In fact, in the language of set theory extended with a function symbol for adjunction, the axioms of empty set and adjunction alone (without extensionality) suffice to interpret Q {\displaystyle {\mathsf {Q}}} .

[ 1 ] (They are mutually interpretable.) Adding epsilon-induction to empty set and adjunction yields a theory that is mutually interpretable with Peano arithmetic ( P A {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PA}}} ).
Another axiom schema also yields a theory that is mutually interpretable with P A {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PA}}} : [ 2 ] ∀ ∀ x .

∀ ∀ y .

∃ ∃ w .

∀ ∀ z .

( z ∈ ∈ w ↔ ↔ ( ( z ∈ ∈ x ∨ ∨ z = y ) ∧ ∧ ϕ ϕ ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x.\forall y.\exists w.\forall z.{\Big (}z\in w\leftrightarrow {\big (}(z\in x\lor z=y)\land \phi {\big )}{\Big )}} , where ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is not allowed to have w {\displaystyle w} free. This combines axioms of set theory: For ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } trivially true it reduced to the adjunction axiom above, and for ( z ≠ ≠ y ) ∧ ∧ P {\displaystyle (z\neq y)\land P} it gives the axiom of separation with P {\displaystyle P} .
