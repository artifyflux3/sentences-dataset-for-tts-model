[ 11 ] It is the 54th [ 12 ] most populous country in the world and the most populous Oceanian country. Its population is concentrated mainly in urban areas, particularly on the Eastern, South Eastern and Southern seaboards, and is expected to exceed 30 million by 2029.

[ 13 ] Australia's population has grown from an estimated population of between 300,000 and 2,400,000 Indigenous Australians at the time of British colonisation in 1788 due to numerous waves of immigration during the period since. Also due to immigration, the European component's share of the population rose sharply in the late 18th and 19th centuries, but is now declining as a percentage.

[ 14 ] Australia has an average population density of 3.6 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world . This is generally attributed to the semi-arid and desert geography of much of the interior of the country. Another factor is urbanisation—with 89% of its population living in a handful of urban areas, Australia is one of the world's most urbanised countries.

[ 15 ] The life expectancy of Australia in 2015–2017 was 83.2 years, among the highest in the world .

[ 16 ] Population [ edit ] Estimated resident population of Australia since 1981 Population estimates in the table below do not include the Aboriginal population before 1961. Estimates of Aboriginal population before European settlement range from 300,000 to one million, with archaeological finds indicating a sustainable maximum population of around 750,000.

[ 17 ] Where available, actual population figures from census years are included.

The rate increased to a peak of 17.4 per thousand population in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. During the Great Depression , the rate declined to a low of 7.1 per thousand population in 1934 and 1935. Immediately after World War II, the rate increased sharply as a result of the start of the post–World War II baby boom and the immigration of many young people who then had children in Australia. A rate plateau of over 13.0 persons per 1,000 population occurred for every year from 1946 to 1962.

There has been a fall in the rate of natural increase since 1962 due to falling fertility . In 1971, the rate of natural increase was 12.7 persons per 1,000 population; a decade later it had fallen to 8.5. In 1996 the rate of natural increase fell below seven for the first time, with the downward trend continuing in the late 1990s.  Population projections by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that continued low fertility, combined with the increase in deaths from an ageing population, will result in natural increase falling below zero sometime in the mid-2030s. However, in 2006 the fertility rate rose to 1.81, one of the highest rates in the OECD .

Since 1901, the crude death rate has fallen from about 12.2 deaths per 1,000 population, to 6.4 deaths per 1,000 population in 2006.

[ 62 ] Dutch navigators landed on the coasts of modern Western Australia and Queensland several times during the 17th century. Captain James Cook wrote that he claimed the east coast for Great Britain in 1770 while standing on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula . The west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have numbered between as few as 315,000 and as many as 1,100,000, [ 63 ] [ 64 ] divided into many tribes speaking many different languages. In the 2011 census , 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal , 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander , and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders .

[ 65 ] Today, most of Australia's Indigenous population live on the east coast of Australia, where almost 60% of Indigenous Australians live in New South Wales (208,476) and Queensland (188,954) which roughly represents 2–5% of those state's populations. The Northern Territory has an Indigenous population of 61,115, which represents 26.3% of the total Northern Territory population.

[ 66 ] There were 24,737 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander births registered in 2023, an increase of 349 babies from 2022. This represents 8.6% of all births registered in 2023. The total fertility rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women was 2.17 births per woman.

[ 67 ] Of the 24,388 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander births registered in 2022 only 23% were births for which both parents were identified as being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin on the birth certificate. 45% were births where only the mother was of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin (including births where paternity was not acknowledged or the father's Indigenous status was not stated), and 32% were births where only the father was of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin (including births where the mother's Indigenous status was not stated).

[ 68 ] Ancestry [ edit ] Main article: Australians European Australians from 1947 to 1966 when racial data was collected in the country The earliest accepted timeline for the first arrivals of humans to the continent of Australia places this human migration to at least 65,000 years ago, [ 69 ] most probably from the islands of Indonesia and New Guinea .

[ 62 ] Captain James Cook claimed the east coast for Great Britain in 1770; the west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have been between 315,000 and 750,000, [ 63 ] divided into as many as 500 tribes speaking many different languages.

Between 1788 and the Second World War , the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England , Ireland and Scotland ), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe , with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism , [ 70 ] and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.

[ 71 ] The Australian Bureau of Statistics no longer collects data on race , but does ask each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census .

[ 72 ] These ancestry responses are classified into broad standardised ancestry groups.

[ 73 ] In the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were: [ 74 ] English (33%) Australian (29.9%) Irish (9.5%) Scottish (8.6%) Chinese (5.5%) Italian (4.4%) German (4%) Indian (3.1%) Aboriginal (2.9%) [ N 12 ] Greek (1.7%) Filipino (1.6%) Dutch (1.5%) Vietnamese (1.3%) Lebanese (1%) Polish (0.9%) Maltese (0.8%) Maori (0.6%) Croatian (0.6%) South African (0.4%) Macedonian (0.3%) At the 2021 census, 3.2% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous — Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders .

[ N 13 ] [ 75 ] In 2020, 7.5% of births were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons up from 5.7% in 2010; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander fertility rates have stayed above replacement levels even as the nation's has declined rapidly.

[ 76 ] Although the ABS does not collect data on race and ethnic background, various studies have put together results of the census to determine the ethnic composition of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission has estimated the European population at 76% of the Australian population in 2016, [ 77 ] while a media diversity study put it at 72% in 2021, the non-European proportion was 21% and 23% respectively, and the Aboriginal Australian population at 3% in both.

[ 78 ] Immigration minister Andrew Giles had pledged to incorporate a question on ethnicity into the 2026 Australian census .

[ 79 ] However in 2024 the ABS decided against collecting data on ethnicity in favor of ancestry. As recent studies indicate that the public does not have a consistent understanding of ethnic identity, or the difference between ethnic identity and ancestry. The ABS determined that due to these complexities, collecting both ethnic identity and ancestry on the same form is not feasible for the 2026 Census.

[ 80 ] Immigration and country of birth [ edit ] Main articles: Immigration to Australia and Foreign-born population of Australia Australian and foreign born population pyramid in 2021 In 2019, 30% of the Australian resident population, or 7,529,570 people, were born overseas.

[ 81 ] Australia's population has quadrupled since the end of World War I, [ 82 ] much of this increase from immigration . Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, a higher proportion than in any other nation with a population of over 10 million.

[ 81 ] [ 83 ] Asia is the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.

[ 84 ] Net overseas migration reached a record level of 536,000 in 2022–23.

[ 85 ] Overall migration was 739,000 in 2022-23.

[ 86 ] Net permanent and long-term arrivals in 2023 were 447,790, the highest on record.

[ 87 ] Most immigrants are skilled, [ 88 ] but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees .

[ 88 ] The following table shows Australia's population by country of birth as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2023. It shows only countries or regions or birth with a population of over 100,000 residing in Australia.

As of 2020, 29.8% of Australia's population was born overseas and 76% as of 2016 had European ancestry. The percentage of Australians with European backgrounds has been declining since the 1960s and 1970s, which is around the time the White Australia policy was abolished.

Although Australia has no official language, English has always been the de facto national language and the only common tongue.

[ 90 ] Australian English is a major variety of the language, with a distinctive accent and lexicon, [ 91 ] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.

[ 92 ] General Australian serves as the standard variety.

At the 2021 census English was the only language spoken in the homes of 72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin Chinese (2.7%), Arabic (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.3%), and Cantonese (1.2%).

[ 75 ] Considerable proportions of first- and second-generation immigrants are bilingual.

Over 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact; fewer than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people.

[ 94 ] At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.

[ 95 ] Australia has its own sign language , Auslan . The Australian Bureau of Statistics included Auslan as an option for the first time in the 2021 census when asking which language was used at home.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] According to the census, it is the main language of about 16,000 deaf people.

[ 97 ] Religion [ edit ] Main article: Religion in Australia Religion in Australia as declared in the 2021 census [ 98 ] Christianity (43.9%) No religion (38.9%) Islam (3.20%) Hinduism (2.70%) Buddhism (2.40%) Sikhism (0.80%) Other religions (0.90%) Not stated or unclear (7.20%) At the 2021 Census, 38.9% of the population identified as having "no religion" , [ 74 ] up from 15.5% in 2001.

[ 99 ] The largest religion is Christianity (43.9% of the population).

[ 74 ] The largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church (20% of the population) and the Anglican Church of Australia (9.8%). Multicultural immigration since the Second World War has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%), Buddhism (2.4%), Sikhism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.4%).

[ 74 ] The Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information: Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.

Historically, Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology was the prevalent belief system in Australia until around 1840, when European Australians first outnumbered indigenous Australians. For a period, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Australia was majority Protestant with a large Catholic minority.

[ 100 ] [ 101 ] Catholics first outnumbered Anglicans in the 1986 census.

[ 102 ] As a result of this history, while Australia has no official religion and "no religion" constitutes the largest group by religious identification, the various governments of Australia refer to the Christian God in their ceremonies, as do the various Australian Courts.

[ 103 ] In all censuses since 1991, the percentage of Christians has been steadily decreasing, while the percentage of non-religious has been increasing.

[ 104 ] As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in religious services is lower than would be indicated by the proportion of the population identifying themselves as affiliated with a religion; weekly attendance at Christian church services is about 1.5 million, or about 7.5% of the population.

[ 105 ] Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools play a prominent role in welfare and education services. The Catholic education system is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 795,000 students (and around 20 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).

[ 107 ] At the 2021 census, the national median weekly personal income across Australia was $789, and the median weekly household income was $1,770. More than half of people had employee wages and salary as their main source of income (56.4% or more than 10.5 million people). Government benefits and allowances were the main source of income for 23.4% or 4.4 million people.
