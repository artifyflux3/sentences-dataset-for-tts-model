In mathematics , an argument of a function is a value provided to obtain the function's result. It is also called an independent variable .

[ 1 ] For example, the binary function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}} has two arguments, x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} , in an ordered pair ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} . The hypergeometric function is an example of a four-argument function. The number of arguments that a function takes is called the arity of the function. A function that takes a single argument as input, such as f ( x ) = x 2 {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} , is called a unary function . A function of two or more variables is considered to have a domain consisting of ordered pairs or tuples of argument values. The argument of a circular function is an angle . The argument of a hyperbolic function is a hyperbolic angle .

A mathematical function has one or more arguments in the form of independent variables designated in the definition, which can also contain parameters . The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments that the function takes, whereas the parameters are not. For example, in the logarithmic function f ( x ) = log b ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) , {\displaystyle f(x)=\log _{b}(x),} the base b {\displaystyle b} is considered a parameter.

Sometimes, subscripts can be used to denote arguments. For example, we can use subscripts to denote the arguments with respect to which partial derivatives are taken.

[ 2 ] The use of the term "argument" in this sense developed from astronomy , which historically used tables to determine the spatial positions of planets from their positions in the sky ( ephemerides ). These tables were organized according to measured angles called arguments, literally "that which elucidates something else."
