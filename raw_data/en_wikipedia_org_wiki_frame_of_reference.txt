In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), a **frame of reference** (or **reference frame**) is an abstract [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"), whose [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"), [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)"), and [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(geometry) "Scale (geometry)") have been specified in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space"). It is based on a set of **reference points**, defined as [geometric points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") whose [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)") is identified both mathematically (with numerical coordinate values) and physically (signaled by conventional markers).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Kovalevsky_Mueller_1989_pp._1%E2%80%9312-1) An important special case is that of _[inertial reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial\_reference\_frame "Inertial reference frame")_, a stationary or uniformly moving frame.

For _n_ dimensions, _n_ + 1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [rectangular Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the _n_ coordinate [axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [Einsteinian relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(special_relativity) "Observer (special relativity)") and the phenomenon under observation. In this context, the term often becomes **observational frame of reference** (or **observational reference frame**), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"). A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [coordinate time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_time "Coordinate time"), which does not equate across different reference frames [moving relatively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_motion "Relative motion") to each other. The situation thus differs from [Galilean relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance "Galilean invariance"), in which all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in _Cartesian frame of reference_. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in _[rotating frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating\_reference\_frame "Rotating reference frame")_. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in _[Galilean frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean\_frame\_of\_reference "Galilean frame of reference")_. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in _macroscopic_ and _microscopic frames of reference_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-macroscopic-2)

In this article, the term _observational frame of reference_ is used when emphasis is upon the _state of motion_ rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a _coordinate system_ may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs _[generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized\_coordinates "Generalized coordinates")_, _[normal modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal\_modes "Normal modes")_ or _[eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors "Eigenvectors")_, which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*   An observational frame (such as an [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame "Inertial frame") or [non-inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-inertial_frame_of_reference "Non-inertial frame of reference")) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*   A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Pontriagin-3) Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, ...) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's _observational_ frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Johansson-4) Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*   Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

 An observer O, situated at the origin of a local set of coordinates â€“ a frame of reference **F**. The observer in this frame uses the coordinates (_x, y, z, t_) to describe a spacetime event, shown as a star.

Although the term "coordinate system" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term "coordinate system" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.

A coordinate system in mathematics is a facet of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") or of [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Barker-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Ramsay-11) in particular, a property of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") (for example, in physics, [configuration spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") or [phase spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space")).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Hawking-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Morita-13) The [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") of a point **r** in an _n_-dimensional space are simply an ordered set of _n_ numbers:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Korn-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-encarta-15)

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =[x^{1},\ x^{2},\ \dots ,\ x^{n}].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7dd8270c4f5fa053e35aeab704c2d09b59e3275)
In a general [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space"), these numbers could be (for example) coefficients in a functional expansion like a [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series"). In a physical problem, they could be [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") coordinates or [normal mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode "Normal mode") amplitudes. In a [robot design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), they could be angles of relative rotations, linear displacements, or deformations of [joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical) "Linkage (mechanical)").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Yamane-16) Here we will suppose these coordinates can be related to a [Cartesian coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") system by a set of functions:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle x^{j}=x^{j}(x,\ y,\ z,\ \dots ),\quad j=1,\ \dots ,\ n,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70cffae3c981a2746c07924eeca0014f72cef764)
where _x_, _y_, _z_, _etc._ are the _n_ Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions, **coordinate surfaces** are defined by the relations:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle x^{j}(x,y,z,\dots )=\mathrm {constant} ,\quad j=1,\ \dots ,\ n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c16299c230de0f2759d72960643cae6289f35f9)
The intersection of these surfaces define **coordinate lines**. At any selected point, tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at that point define a set of **basis vectors** {**e**1, **e**2, ..., **e**n} at that point. That is:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Papapetrou-17)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{i}(\mathbf {r} )=\lim _{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{\frac {\mathbf {r} \left(x^{1},\ \dots ,\ x^{i}+\epsilon ,\ \dots ,\ x^{n}\right)-\mathbf {r} \left(x^{1},\ \dots ,\ x^{i},\ \dots ,\ x^{n}\right)}{\epsilon }},\quad i=1,\ \dots ,\ n,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d4fd676934b280fde6f899304144693ddc3c114)
which can be normalized to be of unit length. For more detail see [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant_basis "Curvilinear coordinates").

Coordinate surfaces, coordinate lines, and [basis vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") are components of a **coordinate system**.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Zdunkowski-18) If the basis vectors are orthogonal at every point, the coordinate system is an [orthogonal coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates "Orthogonal coordinates").

An important aspect of a coordinate system is its [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")_g ik_, which determines the [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length")_ds_ in the coordinate system in terms of its coordinates:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Borisenko-19)

![Image 6: {\displaystyle (ds)^{2}=g_{ik}\ dx^{i}\ dx^{k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55218988ef73c7f49940c0fe4f4b41e0d81bcbc7)
where repeated indices are summed over.

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [mathematical construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory"), part of an [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"). There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") and [Galilean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation") may be viewed as [coordinate transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system#Transformations "Coordinate system").

Observational frame of reference
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frame_of_reference&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Observational frame of reference")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Minkowski_diagram_-_3_systems.svg/330px-Minkowski_diagram_-_3_systems.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minkowski_diagram_-_3_systems.svg)

Three frames of reference in special relativity. The black frame is at rest. The primed frame moves at 40% of light speed, and the double primed frame at 80%. Note the scissors-like change as speed increases.

An **observational frame of reference**, often referred to as a _physical frame of reference_, a _frame of reference_, or simply a _frame_, is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized _only by its state of motion_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Kubar-20) However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an _observer_ and a _frame_. According to this view, a _frame_ is an _observer_ plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Doran-21) This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Moller-22)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Lightman-23) In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") the use of general coordinate systems is common (see, for example, the [Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild "Karl Schwarzschild") solution for the gravitational field outside an isolated sphere[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Faber-24)).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [inertial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") and [non-inertial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-inertial_reference_frame "Non-inertial reference frame"). An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") these frames are related by [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation"), which are parametrized by [rapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidity "Rapidity"). In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_first_law "Newton's first law") holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [free particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_particle "Free particle") travels in a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") at constant [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"), or is at rest. These frames are related by [Galilean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation"). These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory") of the [PoincarÃ© group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Poincar%C3%A9_group "Representation theory of the PoincarÃ© group") and of the [Galilean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Galilean_group "Representation theory of the Galilean group").

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [fictitious forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force") must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force "Coriolis force"), [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force"), and [gravitational force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_force "Gravitational force"). (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

Measurement apparatus
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frame_of_reference&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Measurement apparatus")]

A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [measurement apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology") (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics "Measurement in quantum mechanics"), where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem "Measurement problem")).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [laboratory frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_frame "Laboratory frame") or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [center of momentum frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_momentum_frame "Center of momentum frame") "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology") that is connected to the nature of the [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), and uses [atomic clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clocks "Atomic clocks") that operate according to the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model "Standard model") and that must be corrected for [gravitational time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation "Gravitational time dilation").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Wolfson-25) (See [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter "Meter") and [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Rizzi-26)

The discussion is taken beyond simple space-time coordinate systems by [Brading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Brading "Katherine Brading") and Castellani.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Brading-27) Extension to coordinate systems using generalized coordinates underlies the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle "Hamilton's principle") and [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") formulations[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Johns-28) of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), [classical relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), and [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Greenwood-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Trump-30)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Kompaneyets-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Srednicki-32)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Rovelli-33)

> We first introduce the notion of _reference frame_, itself related to the idea of _observer_: the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:â€¦ the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2), is said to move with the observer.â€¦ The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2) by establishing a _coordinate system_ _R_ with origin _O_. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame ![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2), can be considered to give a physical realization of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2).

and this on the utility of separating the notions of ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2) and [_R_, _Râ€²_, _etc._]:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Lakhtakia-6)

> As noted by Brillouin, a distinction between mathematical sets of coordinates and physical frames of reference must be made. The ignorance of such distinction is the source of much confusionâ€¦ the dependent functions such as velocity for example, are measured with respect to a physical reference frame, but one is free to choose any mathematical coordinate system in which the equations are specified.

and this, also on the distinction between ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5d31f64c0e02f0dc73d5aeb636a1caf2011dce2) and [_R_, _Râ€²_, _etc._]:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#cite_note-Nerlich-7)

> The idea of a reference frame is really quite different from that of a coordinate system. Frames differ just when they define different _spaces_ (sets of _rest_ points) or times (sets of simultaneous events). So the ideas of a space, a time, of rest and simultaneity, go inextricably together with that of frame. However, a mere shift of origin, or a purely spatial rotation of space coordinates results in a new coordinate system. So frames correspond at best to _classes_ of coordinate systems.

> In traditional developments of special and general relativity it has been customary not to distinguish between two quite distinct ideas. The first is the notion of a coordinate system, understood simply as the smooth, invertible assignment of four numbers to events in spacetime neighborhoods. The second, the frame of reference, refers to an idealized system used to assign such numbers [â€¦] To avoid unnecessary restrictions, we can divorce this arrangement from metrical notions. [â€¦] Of special importance for our purposes is that each frame of reference has a definite state of motion at each event of spacetime. [â€¦] Within the context of special relativity and as long as we restrict ourselves to frames of reference in inertial motion, then little of importance depends on the difference between an inertial frame of reference and the inertial coordinate system it induces. This comfortable circumstance ceases immediately once we begin to consider frames of reference in nonuniform motion even within special relativity.â€¦More recently, to negotiate the obvious ambiguities of Einsteinâ€™s treatment, the notion of frame of reference has reappeared as a structure distinct from a coordinate system.
