It is also used for financial reporting by businesses and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis but generally with the reporting period not aligning with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxes , such as income tax. Many annual government fees—such as council tax and license fees— are also levied on a fiscal year basis, but others are charged on an anniversary basis.

Some companies, such as Cisco Systems , [ 1 ] end their fiscal year on the same day of the week each year: the day that is closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December). Under such a system, some fiscal years have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks.

[ 2 ] The calendar year is used as the fiscal year by about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for most large corporations in the United Kingdom.

[ 3 ] That is the case in many countries around the world with a few exceptions such as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

[ 4 ] Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer to align the fiscal year with the academic year (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year) and also because the university is normally less busy during the summer months. In the Northern Hemisphere , that is July to the next June. In the Southern Hemisphere , that is the calendar year, January to December. In a similar fashion, many nonprofit performing arts organizations will have a fiscal year which ends during the summer, so that their performance season that begins in the fall and ends in the spring will be within one fiscal year.

Some media/communication-based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year.

Fiscal years' names are often shortened based on the year in which they end ; for example, "fiscal year 2023-2024" and "FY24" are synonymous.

Taxpayers in many jurisdictions may choose their tax year.

[ 6 ] Some federal countries, such as Canada and Switzerland, require the provincial or cantonal tax year to align with the federal year. In the United States, most states retained a 30 June fiscal year-end date when the federal government switched to 30 September in 1976. Nearly all jurisdictions require that the tax year be 12 months or 52/53 weeks.

[ 7 ] However, short years are permitted as the first year or when changing tax years.

[ 8 ] Most countries require all individuals to pay income tax based on the calendar year. Significant exceptions include: Australia: individuals pay income tax based on the financial year of 1 July until 30 June.

[ 9 ] United Kingdom: the tax year for individuals begins on 6 April. This is due to Britain historically having a calendar year starting on Lady Day (25 March) in the Julian calendar but a fiscal year ending on that day. When the UK adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, 25 March translated to 5 April and 26 March to 6 April. (See History of taxation in the United Kingdom#Start of tax year for more detailed explanation.) United States: individuals may (but rarely do) elect any tax year, subject to IRS approval.

[ 10 ] Many jurisdictions require that the tax year conform to the taxpayer's fiscal year for financial reporting. The United States is a notable exception: taxpayers may choose any tax year, but must keep books and records for such year.

[ 7 ] Operation by jurisdiction [ edit ] In some jurisdictions, particularly those that permit tax consolidation , companies that are part of a group of businesses must use nearly the same fiscal year (differences of up to three months are permitted in some jurisdictions, such as the US and Japan), with consolidating entries to adjust for transactions between units with different fiscal years, so the same resources will not be counted more than once or not at all.

[ citation needed ] Afghanistan [ edit ] In Afghanistan , from 2011 to 2021, the fiscal year began on 1 Hamal (20th or 21 March).

[ 11 ] The fiscal year aligned with the Persian or Solar Hijri calendar used in Afghanistan at the time.

Following transfer of power to the Taliban administration in September 2021, Afghanistan abandoned the Solar Hijri calendar in favour of the Lunar Hijri calendar . The fiscal cycle was restarted with effect from 1 Muharram 1444 AH (30 July 2022).

[ 12 ] Australia [ edit ] In Australia , a fiscal year is commonly called a "financial year" (FY), and starts on 1 July, ending on 30 June the next year. Financial years are designated by the calendar year of the second half of the period. For example, financial year 2026 is the 12-month period ending on 30 June 2026 and can be referred to as FY2025/26. It is used for official purposes, by individual taxpayers and by the overwhelming majority of business enterprises.

[ 9 ] Business enterprises may opt to use a financial year that ends at the end of a week (e.g., 52 or 53 weeks in length, and therefore is not exactly one calendar year in length), or opt for its financial year to end on a date that matches the reporting cycle of its foreign parent. All entities within the one group must use the same financial year.

For government accounting and budget purposes, pre- Federation colonies changed the financial year from the calendar year to a year ending 30 June on the following dates: Victoria changed in 1870, South Australia in 1874, Queensland in 1875, Western Australia in 1892, New South Wales in 1895 and Tasmania in 1904. The Commonwealth adopted the near-ubiquitous financial year standard since its inception in 1901.

[ 13 ] The reason given for the change was for convenience, as Parliament typically sits during May and June, while it was difficult for it to meet in November and December to pass a budget.

[ 13 ] The financial year is split into four quarters which cover the following periods: [ 14 ] Quarter Period covered Quarter 1 1 Jul – 30 Sep Quarter 2 1 Oct – 31 Dec Quarter 3 1 Jan – 31 Mar Quarter 4 1 Apr – 30 Jun Austria [ edit ] In Austria , the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.

[ 67 ] A number of major corporations that were once government-owned, such as BT Group and the National Grid , continue to use the government's financial year, which ends on the last day of March, as they have found no reason to change since privatisation .

[ citation needed ] The 5 April year end for income tax reflects the old civil and ecclesiastical calendar under which New Year began on 25 March ( Lady Day ). The difference between the two dates is accounted for by the eleven days omitted in September 1752 due to the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 by which Great Britain also converted from the Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar . However, although the calendar year finished on 24 March, the tax year finished a day later, on 25 March, the Quarter Day – the traditional day on which debts were settled. (For a fuller explanation about the history of the United Kingdom income tax year and its start date, see History of taxation in the United Kingdom § Start of tax year .) United States [ edit ] Federal government [ edit ] In the United States , the federal government's fiscal year is the 12-month period beginning 1 October and ending 30 September the following year. The identification of a fiscal year is the calendar year in which it ends; the current fiscal year is often written as "FY25" or "FY2024-25", which began on 1 October 2024 and will end on 30 September 2025.

In 1843, the federal government changed the fiscal year from a calendar year to one starting on 1 July, [ 68 ] which lasted until 1976. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 created the current fiscal year of 1 October to 30 September, making the change to allow Congress more time to arrive at a budget and creating what is known as the "transitional quarter" from 1 July 1976 to 30 September 1976.

For example, the United States government Fiscal Year 2024-25 is: 1st quarter: 1 October 2024 – 31 December 2024 2nd quarter: 1 January 2025 – 31 March 2025 3rd quarter: 1 April 2025 – 30 June 2025 4th quarter: 1 July 2025 – 30 September 2025 State governments [ edit ] State governments set their own fiscal year. Forty-six of the fifty states set their fiscal year to end on 30 June.

[ 69 ] Two states have fiscal years that are different: New York , ends 31 March [ 70 ] Texas , ends 31 August The fiscal year for the Washington, DC government ends on 30 September.

[ 71 ] Among the inhabited territories of the United States , most align with the federal fiscal year, ending on 30 September. These include American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands .

[ 69 ] Puerto Rico is the exception, with its fiscal year ending on 30 June.

Vietnam [ edit ] In Vietnam , the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.

Businesses and organizations [ edit ] The tax year for a business is governed by the fiscal year it chooses. A business may choose any consistent fiscal year that it wants; however, for seasonal businesses such as farming and retail, a good accounting practice is to end the fiscal year shortly after the highest revenue time of year. Consequently, most large agriculture companies end their fiscal years after the harvest season, and most retailers end their fiscal years shortly after the Christmas shopping season. Drake notes, however, that there are cases where businesses choose a year-end which fits with the slower part of their business year. At this point in the year they are likely to hold less inventory than their average daily inventory over the whole year.
