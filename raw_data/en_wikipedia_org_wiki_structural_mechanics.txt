[ 1 ] It is one subset of structural analysis . Structural mechanics analysis needs input data such as structural loads , the structure's geometric representation and support conditions, and the materials' properties. Output quantities may include support reactions, stresses and displacements . Advanced structural mechanics may include the effects of stability and non-linear behaviors.

Mechanics of structures is a field of study within applied mechanics that investigates the behavior of structures under mechanical loads, such as bending of a beam, buckling of a column, torsion of a shaft, deflection of a thin shell, and vibration of a bridge.

There are three approaches to the analysis: the energy methods , flexibility method or direct stiffness method which later developed into finite element method and the plastic analysis approach.
