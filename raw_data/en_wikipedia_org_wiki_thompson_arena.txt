Thompson Arena is a 3,500-seat hockey arena in Hanover, New Hampshire . It is home to the Dartmouth College Big Green men's and women's ice hockey teams .  The barrel-vaulted, reinforced concrete arena was designed by renowned architect Pier Luigi Nervi . It was named for Rupert C. Thompson '28, the major benefactor of the project, and replaced Davis Rink, the original "indoor" home of Dartmouth hockey from 1929 to 1975. ( Davis Rink , which was located next to old Alumni Gym, was demolished in 1985 to make way for the Berry Sports Center.) Thompson Arena Renovations [ edit ] In 2016, both the men's and women's locker rooms were renovated. At the same time, the rink also got new dasher boards, glass and a refrigeration system.

In July of 2025, the 50th anniversary of the Arena's opening, Dartmouth announced a 11,050-square foot renovation. The project includes a new locker room for both the men's and women's ice hockey teams, a new team lounge, weight room and coaching suite. The Arena would also receive new additions to the concourse to improve fan enjoyment.

[ 1 ] The renovation is expected to be completed in the fall of 2026.
