[ 28 ] New York Shock Exchange managed to defend their title with a narrow win over Puget Sound Outcast Derby.

[ 29 ] At the 2012 Championships, Your Mom Men's Derby beat St. Louis by a single point (136–135) in the final, despite having trailed for almost the entire bout.

[ 31 ] Your Mom Men's Derby went on to win the 2014 final by beating St. Louis GateKeepers.

Post-season resumed in 2023 with the Western Hemisphere Cup, and the usual post-season (qualifiers and championships) were once again held in 2024, with the St Louis Gatekeepers claiming their sixth MRDA Championship title (against Denver Ground Control 146-129).
