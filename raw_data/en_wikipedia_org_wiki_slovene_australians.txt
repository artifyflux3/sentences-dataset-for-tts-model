[ 2 ] Until the 1900s, there was only a small number of Slovenian immigrants to Australia.  The largest number of Slovenians migrated to Australia after World Wars One and Two.

[ 3 ] The exact number who came after WW1 is impossible to determine because Slovenians were often classified as Austrians .

A lot of Slovenian Axis collaborators and their families migrated to Australia after World War II , fleeing persecution by the post-war socialist government of Josip Broz Tito .

[ 3 ] Demographics [ edit ] Numbers [ edit ] In the 2001 Australian Census , 14,189 Australians declared that they were of Slovenian origin. In the 2006 Australian Census , 16,093 Australians declared that they were of Slovenian origin.

[ 4 ] Because many Slovenians came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire they identified themselves as Austrians.

Distribution [ edit ] According to the 2016 Australian Census , there were 5,557 Slovenian-born people living in the country. The majority of them lived in either Victoria (2,172 or 39.1%) or New South Wales (1,773 or 31.9%).
