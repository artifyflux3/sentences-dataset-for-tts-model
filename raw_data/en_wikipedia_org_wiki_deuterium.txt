**Deuterium** (**hydrogen-2**, symbol **2 H** or **D**, also known as **heavy hydrogen**) is one of two [stable isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope_ratio "Stable isotope ratio") of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"); the other is protium, or hydrogen-1, 1 H. The deuterium [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") (**deuteron**) contains one [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and one [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), whereas the far more common 1 H has no neutrons.

The name _deuterium_ comes from Greek _[deuteros](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:δεύτερος")_, meaning "second".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-diplogen-4) American chemist [Harold Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey "Harold Urey") discovered deuterium in 1931. Urey and others produced samples of [heavy water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water "Heavy water") in which the 2 H had been highly concentrated. The discovery of deuterium won Urey a [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Chemistry "List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry") in 1934.

Nearly all deuterium found in nature was [synthesized in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis "Big Bang nucleosynthesis") the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") 13.8 billion years ago, forming the primordial ratio of 2 H to 1 H (~26 deuterium nuclei per 10 6 hydrogen nuclei). Deuterium is subsequently produced by the slow stellar [proton–proton chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain "Proton–proton chain"), but rapidly destroyed by exothermic [fusion reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion"). The [deuterium–deuterium reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium-deuterium_fusion "Deuterium-deuterium fusion") has the second-lowest [energy threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion "Lawson criterion"), and is the most astrophysically accessible, occurring in both [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars "Stars") and [brown dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarfs "Brown dwarfs").

The [gas giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant "Gas giant") planets display the primordial ratio of deuterium. Comets show an elevated ratio similar to Earth's oceans (156 deuterium nuclei per 10 6 hydrogen nuclei). This reinforces theories that much of Earth's ocean water is of cometary origin.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-nature2-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Hersant-6) The deuterium ratio of comet [67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko "67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko"), as measured by the _[Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta\_(spacecraft) "Rosetta (spacecraft)")_ space probe, is about three times that of Earth water. This figure is the highest yet measured in a comet, thus deuterium ratios continue to be an active topic of research in both astronomy and climatology.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-sciencemag.org-7)

Deuterium is used in most [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon"), many [fusion power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power "Fusion power") experiments, and as the most effective [neutron moderator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator "Neutron moderator"), primarily in [heavy water nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_heavy-water_reactor "Pressurized heavy-water reactor"). It is also used as an [isotopic label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_label "Isotopic label"), in [biogeochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_isotope_biogeochemistry "Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry"), [NMR spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium_NMR "Deuterium NMR"), and [deuterated drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterated_drug "Deuterated drug").

Differences from common hydrogen (protium)
------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Differences from common hydrogen (protium)")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Hydrogen_deuterium_glow_comparison.png/250px-Hydrogen_deuterium_glow_comparison.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydrogen_deuterium_glow_comparison.png)

Hydrogen (above) and deuterium (below) glowing in gas discharge tubes

Deuterium is often represented by the [chemical symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_symbol "Chemical symbol") D. Since it is an isotope of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") with [mass number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number "Mass number") 2, it is also represented by 2 H. [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry "International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry") allows both D and 2 H, though 2 H is preferred.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-8) A distinct chemical symbol is used for convenience because of the isotope's common use in various scientific processes. Also, its large mass difference with [protium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protium "Protium") (1 H) confers non-negligible chemical differences with 1 H compounds. Deuterium has a mass of 2.014 102[Da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit) "Dalton (unit)"), about twice the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean") hydrogen [atomic weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_weight "Atomic weight") of 1.007 947 Da, or twice protium's mass of 1.007 825 Da. The isotope weight ratios within other elements are largely insignificant in this regard.

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), the energy levels of electrons in atoms depend on the [reduced mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_mass "Reduced mass") of the system of electron and nucleus. For a [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom"), the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the [Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") of the atom, where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the [Rydberg constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_constant "Rydberg constant") and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"), and the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") for calculating atomic energy levels.

The reduced mass of the system in these equations is close to the mass of a single electron, but differs from it by a small amount about equal to the ratio of mass of the electron to the nucleus. For 1 H, this amount is about ⁠1837/1836⁠, or 1.000545, and for 2 H it is even smaller: ⁠3671/3670⁠, or 1.0002725. The energies of electronic spectra lines for 2 H and 1 H therefore differ by the ratio of these two numbers, which is 1.000272. The wavelengths of all deuterium spectroscopic lines are shorter than the corresponding lines of light hydrogen, by 0.0272%. In astronomical observation, this corresponds to a blue Doppler shift of 0.0272% of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), or 81.6 km/s.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-9)

The differences are much more pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as [infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy") and [Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_spectroscopy "Raman spectroscopy"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-10) and in rotational spectra such as [microwave spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_spectroscopy "Microwave spectroscopy") because the [reduced mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_mass "Reduced mass") of the deuterium is markedly higher than that of protium. In [nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy"), deuterium has a very different [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Nuclear magnetic resonance") frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, though [deuterium NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium_NMR "Deuterium NMR") on its own right is also possible.

### Big Bang nucleosynthesis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Big Bang nucleosynthesis")]

Synthesis during the formation of the universe is the only significant way naturally occurring deuterium has been created; it is destroyed in [stellar fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_fusion "Stellar fusion"). Deuterium is thought to have played an important role in setting the number and ratios of the elements that were formed in the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-11): 24.2  Combining [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") and the changes brought about by cosmic expansion, one can calculate the fraction of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons "Protons") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons "Neutrons") based on the temperature at the point that the universe cooled enough to allow formation of [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). This calculation indicates seven protons for every neutron at the beginning of [nucleogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleogenesis "Nucleogenesis"), a ratio that would remain stable even after nucleogenesis was over. This fraction was in favor of protons initially, primarily because the lower mass of the proton favored their production. As the Universe expanded, it cooled. [Free neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_neutron "Free neutron") and protons are less stable than [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") nuclei, and the protons and neutrons had a strong energetic reason to form [helium-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4 "Helium-4"). However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium.

Through much of the few minutes after the Big Bang during which nucleosynthesis could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore, any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the **deuterium bottleneck**. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the Universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100[keV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeV "KeV")). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused into helium). However, very soon thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the Universe became too cool for any further [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") or nucleosynthesis. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") products of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (such as [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium "Tritium")) decay.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-12) The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (no stable nucleus has a mass number of 5 or 8) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as the Sun.

Simplified chart of particle content

Deuterium occurs in trace amounts naturally as deuterium [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") (2 H 2 or D 2), but most deuterium in the [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") is bonded with 1 H to form a gas called [hydrogen deuteride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_deuteride "Hydrogen deuteride") (HD or 1 H 2 H).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-13) Similarly, natural water contains deuterated molecules, almost all as [semiheavy water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiheavy_water "Semiheavy water") HDO with only one deuterium.

The existence of deuterium on Earth, elsewhere in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") (as confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), is also an important datum in [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"). Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there is no known natural process other than [Big Bang nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis "Big Bang nucleosynthesis") that might have produced deuterium at anything close to its observed natural abundance. Deuterium is produced by the rare [cluster decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_decay "Cluster decay"), and occasional absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are trivial sources. There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior of the Sun and other stars, as at these temperatures the [nuclear fusion reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion_reaction "Nuclear fusion reaction") that consume deuterium happen much faster than the [proton–proton reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_reaction "Proton–proton reaction") that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the outer solar atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this has probably been unchanged since the origin of the Solar System. The natural abundance of 2 H seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it.

The existence of deuterium at a low but constant primordial fraction in all hydrogen is another one of the arguments in favor of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") over the [Steady State theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_State_theory "Steady State theory") of the Universe. The observed ratios of hydrogen to helium to deuterium in the universe are difficult to explain except with a Big Bang model. It is estimated that the abundances of deuterium have not evolved significantly since their production about 13.8 billion years ago.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-14) Measurements of [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") galactic deuterium from ultraviolet spectral analysis show a ratio of as much as 23 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms in undisturbed gas clouds, which is only 15% below the [WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP "WMAP") estimated primordial ratio of about 27 atoms per million from the Big Bang. This has been interpreted to mean that less deuterium has been destroyed in star formation in the Milky Way galaxy than expected, or perhaps deuterium has been replenished by a large in-fall of primordial hydrogen from outside the galaxy.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-15) In space a few hundred light years from the Sun, deuterium abundance is only 15 atoms per million, but this value is presumably influenced by differential adsorption of deuterium onto carbon dust grains in interstellar space.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-16)

The abundance of deuterium in [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter")'s atmosphere has been directly measured by the [_Galileo_ space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_space_probe "Galileo space probe") as 26 atoms per million hydrogen atoms. ISO-SWS observations find 22 atoms per million hydrogen atoms in Jupiter.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-17) and this abundance is thought to represent close to the primordial Solar System ratio.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Hersant-6) This is about 17% of the terrestrial ratio of 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms.

Comets such as [Comet Hale–Bopp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp "Comet Hale–Bopp") and [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet") have been measured to contain more deuterium (about 200 atoms per million hydrogens), ratios which are enriched with respect to the presumed protosolar nebula ratio, probably due to heating, and which are similar to the ratios found in Earth seawater. The recent measurement of deuterium amounts of 161 atoms per million hydrogen in Comet [103P/Hartley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/103P/Hartley "103P/Hartley") (a former [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt "Kuiper belt") object), a ratio almost exactly that in Earth's oceans (155.76 ± 0.1, but in fact from 153 to 156 ppm), emphasizes the theory that Earth's surface water may be largely from comets.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-nature2-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Hersant-6) Most recently the 2 H 1 HR of [67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko "67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko") as measured by _Rosetta_ is about three times that of Earth water.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-sciencemag.org-7) This has caused renewed interest in suggestions that Earth's water may be partly of asteroidal origin.

Deuterium has also been observed to be concentrated over the mean solar abundance in other terrestrial planets, in particular Mars and Venus.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-18)

Deuterium is produced for industrial, scientific and military purposes, by starting with ordinary water—a small fraction of which is naturally occurring [heavy water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water "Heavy water")—and then separating out the heavy water by the [Girdler sulfide process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girdler_sulfide_process "Girdler sulfide process"), distillation, or other methods.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-19)

In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The world's leading supplier of deuterium was [Atomic Energy of Canada Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_of_Canada_Limited "Atomic Energy of Canada Limited") until 1997, when the last heavy water plant was shut down. Canada uses heavy water as a [neutron moderator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator "Neutron moderator") for the operation of the [CANDU reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor "CANDU reactor") design.

Another major producer of heavy water is India. All but one of India's atomic energy plants are pressurized heavy water plants, which use natural (i.e., not enriched) uranium. India has eight heavy water plants, of which seven are in operation. Six plants, of which five are in operation, are based on D–H exchange in ammonia gas. The other two plants extract deuterium from natural water in a process that uses [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide "Hydrogen sulfide") gas at high pressure.

While India is self-sufficient in heavy water for its own use, India also exports reactor-grade heavy water.

### Physical properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Physical properties")]

Compared to hydrogen in its natural composition on Earth, pure deuterium (2 H 2) has a higher [melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point "Melting point") (18.72 K vs. 13.99 K), a higher [boiling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point "Boiling point") (23.64 vs. 20.27 K), a higher [critical temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics) "Critical point (thermodynamics)") (38.3 vs. 32.94 K) and a higher critical pressure (1.6496 vs. 1.2858 MPa).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-20)

The physical properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant [kinetic isotope effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_isotope_effect "Kinetic isotope effect") and other physical and chemical property differences from the protium analogs. 2 H 2 O, for example, is more [viscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscous "Viscous") than normal [H 2 O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-21) There are differences in bond energy and length for compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to protium, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium "Tritium") are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in protium, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that 2 H is harder to remove from carbon than 1 H.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-22)

Deuterium can replace 1 H in water molecules to form heavy water (2 H 2 O), which is about 10.6% denser than normal water (so that ice made from it sinks in normal water). Heavy water is slightly toxic in [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic "Eukaryotic") animals, with 25% substitution of the body water causing cell division problems and sterility, and 50% substitution causing death by cytotoxic syndrome (bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal lining failure). [Prokaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic "Prokaryotic") organisms, however, can survive and grow in pure heavy water, though they develop slowly.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-23) Despite this toxicity, consumption of heavy water under normal circumstances does not pose a [health threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Toxicity_in_humans "Heavy water") to humans. It is estimated that a 70 kg (154 lb) person might drink 4.8 litres (1.3 US gal) of heavy water without serious consequences.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-24) Small doses of heavy water (a few grams in humans, containing an amount of deuterium comparable to that normally present in the body) are routinely used as harmless metabolic tracers in humans and animals.

The deuteron has [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_spin "Quantum spin") +1 ("[triplet state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_state "Triplet state")") and is thus a [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson"). The [NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Nuclear magnetic resonance") frequency of deuterium is significantly different from normal hydrogen. [Infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy") also easily differentiates many deuterated compounds, due to the large difference in IR absorption frequency seen in the vibration of a chemical bond containing deuterium, versus light hydrogen. The two stable isotopes of hydrogen can also be distinguished by using [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry "Mass spectrometry").

The triplet deuteron nucleon is barely bound at _E_ B = 2.23 MeV, and none of the higher energy states are bound. The singlet deuteron is a virtual state, with a negative binding energy of ~60 keV. There is no such stable particle, but this virtual particle transiently exists during neutron–proton inelastic scattering, accounting for the unusually large neutron scattering cross-section of the proton.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-25)

#### Deuteron mass and radius

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Deuteron mass and radius")]

The deuterium nucleus is called a **deuteron**. It has a mass of 2.013 553 212 544(15)Da[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-physconst-mdDa-26) (just over 1.875 GeV/_c_ 2[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-27)).

The [charge radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_radius "Charge radius") of a deuteron is 2.127 78(27)×10−15 m.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-physconst-rd-28)

Like the [proton radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton#Charge_radius "Proton"), measurements using [muonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon") deuterium produce a smaller result: 2.125 62(78)[fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometre "Femtometre").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-29)

Deuterium is one of only five stable [nuclides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclide "Nuclide") with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons. (2 H, [6 Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_lithium "Isotopes of lithium"), [10 B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_boron "Isotopes of boron"), [14 N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_nitrogen "Isotopes of nitrogen"), [180m Ta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_tantalum "Isotopes of tantalum"); the long-lived radionuclides [40 K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40 "Potassium-40"), [50 V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_vanadium "Isotopes of vanadium"), [138 La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_lanthanum "Isotopes of lanthanum"), [176 Lu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_lutetium "Isotopes of lutetium") also occur naturally.) Most [odd–odd nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd%E2%80%93odd_nuclei "Odd–odd nuclei") are unstable to [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay"), because the decay products are [even–even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93even_nuclei "Even–even nuclei"), and thus more strongly bound, due to [nuclear pairing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula#Pairing_term "Semi-empirical mass formula"). Deuterium, however, benefits from having its proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger nuclear attraction; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle") which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin to have some other different quantum number, such as [orbital angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator "Angular momentum operator"). But orbital angular momentum of either particle gives a lower [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy") for the system, mainly due to increasing distance of the particles in the steep gradient of the nuclear force. In both cases, this causes the [diproton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diproton "Diproton") and [dineutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dineutron "Dineutron") to be [unstable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstable "Unstable").

The proton and neutron in deuterium can be [dissociated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(chemistry) "Dissociation (chemistry)") through [neutral current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_current "Neutral current") interactions with [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"). The [cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics) "Cross section (physics)") for this interaction is comparatively large, and deuterium was successfully used as a neutrino target in the [Sudbury Neutrino Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory "Sudbury Neutrino Observatory") experiment.

Diatomic deuterium (2 H 2) has ortho and para [nuclear spin isomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_isomers_of_hydrogen "Spin isomers of hydrogen") like diatomic hydrogen, but with [differences in the number and population of spin states and rotational levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_isomers_of_hydrogen#Deuterium "Spin isomers of hydrogen"), which occur because the deuteron is a [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson") with nuclear spin equal to one.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Hollas-30)

#### Isospin singlet state of the deuteron

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Isospin singlet state of the deuteron")]

Due to the similarity in mass and nuclear properties between the proton and neutron, they are sometimes considered as two symmetric types of the same object, a [nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon"). While only the proton has electric charge, this is often negligible due to the weakness of the [electromagnetic interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interaction "Electromagnetic interaction") relative to the [strong nuclear interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_interaction "Strong nuclear interaction"). The symmetry relating the proton and neutron is known as [isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin "Isospin") and denoted _I_ (or sometimes _T_).

Isospin is an [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2) "SU(2)") symmetry, like ordinary [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)"), so is completely analogous to it. The proton and neutron, each of which have iso[spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2 "Spin-1/2"), form an isospin doublet (analogous to a [spin doublet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_doublet "Spin doublet")), with a "down" state (↓) being a neutron and an "up" state (↑) being a proton.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] A pair of nucleons can either be in an antisymmetric state of isospin called [singlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlet_state "Singlet state"), or in a symmetric state called [triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_triplet "Spin triplet"). In terms of the "down" state and "up" state, the singlet is

![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\Big (}|{\uparrow \downarrow }\rangle -|{\downarrow \uparrow }\rangle {\Big )}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b1540708dc063271f434af745feb972172c5b32), which can also be written:![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}{\Big (}|pn\rangle -|np\rangle {\Big )}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e61f4d1caa907eead1cc53b47acc9e3b27fa235)
This is a nucleus with one proton and one neutron, i.e. a deuterium nucleus. The triplet is

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{ll}|{\uparrow \uparrow }\rangle \\{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|{\uparrow \downarrow }\rangle +|{\downarrow \uparrow }\rangle )\\|{\downarrow \downarrow }\rangle \end{array}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c62ce13d2aaa53dc58bb50917226819c7cb18610)
and thus consists of three types of nuclei, which are supposed to be symmetric: a deuterium nucleus (actually a highly [excited state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") of it), a nucleus with two protons, and a nucleus with two neutrons. These states are not stable.

#### Approximated wavefunction of the deuteron

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Approximated wavefunction of the deuteron")]

The deuteron wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the isospin representation is used (since a proton and a neutron are not identical particles, the wavefunction need not be antisymmetric in general). Apart from their isospin, the two nucleons also have spin and spatial distributions of their wavefunction. The latter is symmetric if the deuteron is symmetric under [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics) "Parity (physics)") (i.e. has an "even" or "positive" parity), and antisymmetric if the deuteron is antisymmetric under parity (i.e. has an "odd" or "negative" parity). The parity is fully determined by the total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons: if it is even then the parity is even (positive), and if it is odd then the parity is odd (negative).

The deuteron, being an isospin singlet, is antisymmetric under nucleons exchange due to isospin, and therefore must be symmetric under the double exchange of their spin and location. Therefore, it can be in either of the following two different states:

*   Symmetric spin and symmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (+1) from spin exchange and (+1) from parity (location exchange), for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.
*   Antisymmetric spin and antisymmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (−1) from spin exchange and (−1) from parity (location exchange), again for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.

In the first case the deuteron is a spin triplet, so that its total spin _s_ is 1. It also has an even parity and therefore even orbital angular momentum _l_. The lower its orbital angular momentum, the lower its energy. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0.

In the second case the deuteron is a spin singlet, so that its total spin _s_ is 0. It also has an odd parity and therefore odd orbital angular momentum _l_. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has _s_ = 0, _l_ = 1.

Since _s_ = 1 gives a stronger nuclear attraction, the deuterium [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") is in the _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 state.

The same considerations lead to the possible states of an isospin triplet having _s_ = 0, _l_ = even or _s_ = 1, _l_ = odd. Thus, the state of lowest energy has _s_ = 1, _l_ = 1, higher than that of the isospin singlet.

The analysis just given is in fact only approximate, both because isospin is not an exact symmetry, and more importantly because the [strong nuclear interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_interaction "Strong nuclear interaction") between the two nucleons is related to [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") in [spin–orbit interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93orbit_interaction "Spin–orbit interaction") that mixes different _s_ and _l_ states. That is, _s_ and _l_ are not constant in time (they do not [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity") with the [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics) "Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)")), and over time a state such as _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 may become a state of _s_ = 1, _l_ = 2. Parity is still constant in time, so these do not mix with odd _l_ states (such as _s_ = 0, _l_ = 1). Therefore, the [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") of the deuterium is a [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition "Quantum superposition") (a linear combination) of the _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 state and the _s_ = 1, _l_ = 2 state, even though the first component is much bigger. Since the [total angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_angular_momentum "Total angular momentum")_j_ is also a good [quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number "Quantum number") (it is a constant in time), both components must have the same _j_, and therefore _j_ = 1. This is the total spin of the deuterium nucleus.

To summarize, the deuterium nucleus is antisymmetric in terms of isospin, and has spin 1 and even (+1) parity. The relative angular momentum of its nucleons _l_ is not well defined, and the deuteron is a superposition of mostly _l_ = 0 with some _l_ = 2.

#### Magnetic and electric multipoles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Magnetic and electric multipoles")]

In order to find theoretically the deuterium [magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment "Magnetic dipole moment")_μ_, one uses the formula for a [nuclear magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_moment "Nuclear magnetic moment")

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {1}{j+1}}{\bigl \langle }(l,s),j,m_{j}{=}j\,{\bigr |}\,{\vec {\mu }}\cdot {\vec {\jmath }}\,{\bigl |}\,(l,s),j,m_{j}{=}j{\bigr \rangle }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eaa092680a79c28810185adf61c54f581024c7bb)
with

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\vec {\mu }}=g^{(l)}{\vec {l}}+g^{(s)}{\vec {s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9098e82b87c66c10dfffdb7dd059c087f94acd7f)
_g_(_l_) and _g_(_s_) are [_g_-factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-factor_(physics) "G-factor (physics)") of the nucleons.

Since the proton and neutron have different values for _g_(_l_) and _g_(_s_), one must separate their contributions. Each gets half of the deuterium orbital angular momentum ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\vec {l}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c457ef3d8e8bdf1f2ec773bb2523e6174dac0893) and spin ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57ce74ecbbc0e198d0bb4b1b2ffc0cb9669b72e1). One arrives at

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {1}{j+1}}{\Bigl \langle }(l,s),j,m_{j}{=}j\,{\Bigr |}\left({\frac {1}{2}}{\vec {l}}{g^{(l)}}_{p}+{\frac {1}{2}}{\vec {s}}({g^{(s)}}_{p}+{g^{(s)}}_{n})\right)\cdot {\vec {\jmath }}\,{\Bigl |}\,(l,s),j,m_{j}{=}j{\Bigr \rangle }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7836e3bdf093ddb5b359a9675dc7af3cd9770865)
where subscripts p and n stand for the proton and neutron, and _g_(l)n = 0.

By using the same identities as [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_moment#Calculating_the_magnetic_moment "Nuclear magnetic moment") and using the value g(l)p = 1, one gets the following result, in units of the [nuclear magneton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magneton "Nuclear magneton")_μ_ N

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {1}{4(j+1)}}\left[({g^{(s)}}_{p}+{g^{(s)}}_{n}){\big (}j(j+1)-l(l+1)+s(s+1){\big )}+{\big (}j(j+1)+l(l+1)-s(s+1){\big )}\right]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3c23357e4baf596b679ef024306fab09a5396a8)
For the _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 state (_j_ = 1), we obtain

![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {1}{2}}({g^{(s)}}_{p}+{g^{(s)}}_{n})=0.879}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f46a3286c109b89e605f736374f7bfe602c3f68f)
For the _s_ = 1, _l_ = 2 state (_j_ = 1), we obtain

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mu =-{\frac {1}{4}}({g^{(s)}}_{p}+{g^{(s)}}_{n})+{\frac {3}{4}}=0.310}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77be671b87e9e4b25b0d3dbc67318c059c72a770)
The measured value of the deuterium [magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment "Magnetic dipole moment"), is 0.857 _μ_ N, which is 97.5% of the 0.879 _μ_ N value obtained by simply adding moments of the proton and neutron. This suggests that the state of the deuterium is indeed to a good approximation _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 state, which occurs with both nucleons spinning in the same direction, but their magnetic moments subtracting because of the neutron's negative moment.

But the slightly lower experimental number than that which results from simple addition of proton and (negative) neutron moments shows that deuterium is actually a linear combination of mostly _s_ = 1, _l_ = 0 state with a slight admixture of _s_ = 1, _l_ = 2 state.

The [electric dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole "Electric dipole") is zero [as usual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_shell_model "Nuclear shell model").

The measured electric [quadrupole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole "Quadrupole") of the deuterium is 0.2859[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge")·[fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometer "Femtometer")2. While the order of magnitude is reasonable, since the deuteron radius is of order of 1 femtometer (see below) and its [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") is e, the above model does not suffice for its computation. More specifically, the [electric quadrupole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_quadrupole "Electric quadrupole") does not get a contribution from the _l_ = 0 state (which is the dominant one) and does get a contribution from a term mixing the _l_ = 0 and the _l_ = 2 states, because the electric quadrupole [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(quantum_mechanics) "Operator (quantum mechanics)") does not [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property#Non-commuting_operators_in_quantum_mechanics "Commutative property") with [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum").

The latter contribution is dominant in the absence of a pure _l_ = 0 contribution, but cannot be calculated without knowing the exact spatial form of the nucleons [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction") inside the deuterium.

Higher magnetic and electric [multipole moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_moment "Multipole moment") cannot be calculated by the above model, for similar reasons.

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Deuterium_Ionized.JPG/250px-Deuterium_Ionized.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deuterium_Ionized.JPG)

Ionized deuterium in a [fusor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor "Fusor") reactor giving off its characteristic pinkish-red glow

Deuterium is used in [heavy water moderated fission reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water_reactor "Heavy water reactor"), usually as liquid 2 H 2 O, to slow neutrons without the high neutron absorption of ordinary hydrogen.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-31) This is a common commercial use for larger amounts of deuterium.

In [research reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_reactor "Research reactor"), liquid 2 H 2 is used in cold sources to moderate neutrons to very low energies and wavelengths appropriate for [scattering experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering "Neutron scattering").

Experimentally, deuterium is the most common [nuclide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclide "Nuclide") used in [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") reactor designs, especially in combination with [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium "Tritium"), because of the large reaction rate (or [nuclear cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_cross_section "Nuclear cross section")) and high [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") yield of the deuterium–tritium (DT) reaction. There is an even higher-yield 2 H–[3 He](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3 "Helium-3") fusion reaction, though the [breakeven point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_energy_gain_factor "Fusion energy gain factor") of 2 H–3 He is higher than that of most other fusion reactions; together with the scarcity of 3 He, this makes it implausible as a practical power source, at least until DT and deuterium–deuterium (DD) fusion have been performed on a commercial scale. Commercial nuclear fusion is not yet an accomplished technology.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Deuterium_lamp_1.png/250px-Deuterium_lamp_1.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deuterium_lamp_1.png)

[Emission spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum") of an ultraviolet [deuterium arc lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium_arc_lamp "Deuterium arc lamp")

Deuterium is most commonly used in hydrogen [nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy") ([proton NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_NMR "Proton NMR")) in the following way. NMR ordinarily requires compounds of interest to be analyzed as dissolved in solution. Because of deuterium's nuclear spin properties which differ from the light hydrogen usually present in organic molecules, NMR spectra of hydrogen/protium are highly differentiable from that of deuterium, and in practice deuterium is not "seen" by an NMR instrument tuned for 1 H. Deuterated solvents (including heavy water, but also compounds like deuterated [chloroform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform "Chloroform"), CDCl 3 or C 2 HCl 3, are therefore routinely used in NMR spectroscopy, in order to allow only the light-hydrogen spectra of the compound of interest to be measured, without solvent-signal interference.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to obtain information about the deuteron's environment in isotopically labelled samples ([deuterium NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium_NMR "Deuterium NMR")). For example, the configuration of hydrocarbon chains in lipid bilayers can be quantified using solid state deuterium NMR with deuterium-labelled lipid molecules.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-32)

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.

Deuterated (i.e. where all or some hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium) compounds are often used as [internal standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_standard "Internal standard") in [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry "Mass spectrometry"). Like other [isotopically labeled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling "Isotopic labeling") species, such standards improve [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy "Accuracy"), while often at a much lower cost than other isotopically labeled standards. Deuterated molecules are usually prepared via [hydrogen isotope exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hydrogen_isotope_exchange&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hydrogen isotope exchange (page does not exist)") reactions.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-34)

In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") and [environmental sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_sciences "Environmental sciences"), deuterium is used as a non-radioactive, [stable isotopic tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_isotope_biogeochemistry "Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry"), for example, in the [doubly labeled water test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_labeled_water_test "Doubly labeled water test"). In [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") and [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway "Metabolic pathway"), deuterium behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from normal hydrogen most easily by its mass, using [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry "Mass spectrometry") or [infrared spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectrometry "Infrared spectrometry"). Deuterium can be detected by [femtosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond "Femtosecond")[infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") spectroscopy, since the mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations; 2 H–carbon bond vibrations are found in spectral regions free of other signals.

Measurements of small variations in the natural abundances of deuterium, along with those of the stable heavy [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") isotopes 17 O and 18 O, are of importance in [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology"), to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater ([meteoric water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_water "Meteoric water")) are enriched as a function of the temperature of the region where the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the [global meteoric water line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_meteoric_water_line "Global meteoric water line") (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-35) The ratio of concentration of 2 H to 1 H is usually indicated with a delta as [δ 2 H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%942H "Δ2H") and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotopes are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-37)

### Contrast properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Contrast properties")]

[Neutron scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering "Neutron scattering") techniques particularly profit from availability of deuterated samples: The 1 H and 2 H cross sections are very distinct and different in sign, which allows contrast variation in such experiments. Further, a nuisance problem of normal hydrogen is its large incoherent neutron cross section, which is nil for 2 H. The substitution of deuterium for normal hydrogen thus reduces scattering noise.

Hydrogen is an important and major component in all materials of organic chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays. As hydrogen atoms (including deuterium) interact strongly with neutrons; neutron scattering techniques, together with a modern deuteration facility,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-38) fills a niche in many studies of macromolecules in biology and many other areas.

See below. Most stars, including the Sun, generate energy over most of their lives by fusing hydrogen into heavier elements; yet such fusion of light hydrogen (protium) has never been successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial fusion, including the hydrogen fusion in hydrogen bombs, requires heavy hydrogen (deuterium, tritium, or both).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-39)

A deuterated drug is a [small molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule "Small molecule") medicinal product in which one or more of the [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") atoms in the drug molecule have been replaced by deuterium. Because of the [kinetic isotope effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_isotope_effect "Kinetic isotope effect"), deuterium-containing drugs may have significantly lower rates of [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), and hence a longer [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_half-life "Biological half-life").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-pmid19295573-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-pmid23744136-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-pmid24294889-42) In 2017, [deutetrabenazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutetrabenazine "Deutetrabenazine") became the first deuterated drug to receive FDA approval.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-First_deuterated_drug_approved-43)

### Reinforced essential nutrients

Deuterium can be used to reinforce specific oxidation-vulnerable C–H bonds within essential or conditionally [essential nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_nutrients "Essential nutrients"),[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-44) such as certain [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids "Amino acids"), or [polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid "Polyunsaturated fatty acid") (PUFA), making them more resistant to oxidative damage. [Deuterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterated_drug "Deuterated drug") polyunsaturated [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid "Fatty acid"), such as [linoleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid "Linoleic acid"), slow down the chain reaction of [lipid peroxidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation "Lipid peroxidation") that damage living cells.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-46) Deuterated ethyl ester of linoleic acid ([RT001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT001 "RT001")), developed by Retrotope, is in a [compassionate use trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_use_trial "Compassionate use trial") in [infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantile_neuroaxonal_dystrophy "Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy") and has successfully completed a Phase I/II trial in [Friedreich's ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedreich%27s_ataxia "Friedreich's ataxia").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-47)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-First_deuterated_drug_approved-43)

Deuterium has been shown to lengthen the period of oscillation of the circadian clock when dosed in rats, hamsters, and [Gonyaulax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonyaulax "Gonyaulax") dinoflagellates.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Interval_Timing_Is_Preserved_Despit-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-52) In rats, chronic intake of 25% 2 H 2 O disrupts circadian rhythm by lengthening the circadian period of [suprachiasmatic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus "Suprachiasmatic nucleus")-dependent rhythms in the brain's hypothalamus.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-Interval_Timing_Is_Preserved_Despit-51) Experiments in hamsters also support the theory that deuterium acts directly on the suprachiasmatic nucleus to lengthen the free-running circadian period.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-53)

### Suspicion of lighter element isotopes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Suspicion of lighter element isotopes")]

The existence of nonradioactive isotopes of lighter elements had been suspected in studies of neon as early as 1913,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and proven by mass spectrometry of light elements in 1920.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] At that time the neutron had not yet been discovered, and the prevailing theory was that isotopes of an element differ by the existence of additional _protons_ in the nucleus accompanied by an equal number of _[nuclear electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery\_of\_the\_neutron#Problems\_of\_the\_nuclear\_electrons\_hypothesis "Discovery of the neutron")_. In this theory, the deuterium nucleus with mass two and charge one would contain two protons and one nuclear electron. However, it was expected that the element hydrogen with a measured average atomic mass very close to 1 Da, the known mass of the proton, always has a nucleus composed of a single proton (a known particle), and could not contain a second proton. Thus, hydrogen was thought to have no heavy isotopes.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Harold Urey, deuterium's discoverer

It was first detected spectroscopically in late 1931 by [Harold Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey "Harold Urey"), a chemist at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University"). Urey's collaborator, [Ferdinand Brickwedde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Brickwedde "Ferdinand Brickwedde"), [distilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation "Distillation") five [liters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liter "Liter") of [cryogenically produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics "Cryogenics")[liquid hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen "Liquid hydrogen") to 1[mL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millilitre "Millilitre") of liquid, using the low-temperature physics laboratory that had recently been established at the National Bureau of Standards (now [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology")) in Washington, DC. The technique had previously been used to isolate heavy isotopes of neon. The cryogenic boiloff technique concentrated the fraction of the mass-2 isotope of hydrogen to a degree that made its spectroscopic identification unambiguous.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-55)

### Naming of the isotope and Nobel Prize

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Naming of the isotope and Nobel Prize")]

Urey created the names _protium_, _deuterium_, and _tritium_ in an article published in 1934. The name is based in part on advice from [Gilbert N. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis") who had proposed the name "deutium". The name comes from Greek _deuteros_ 'second', and the nucleus was to be called a "deuteron" or "deuton". Isotopes and new elements were traditionally given the name that their discoverer decided. Some British scientists, such as [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford"), wanted to call the isotope "diplogen", from Greek _diploos_ 'double', and the nucleus to be called "diplon".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-diplogen-4)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-56)

The amount inferred for normal abundance of deuterium was so small (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in seawater [156 parts per million]) that it had not noticeably affected previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why it hadn't been suspected before. Urey was able to concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. [Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis"), Urey's graduate advisor at [Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley_College_of_Chemistry "UC Berkeley College of Chemistry"), had prepared and characterized the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of deuterium, coming before the discovery of the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") in 1932, was an experimental shock to [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics"); but when the neutron was reported, making deuterium's existence more explicable, Urey was awarded the [Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry "Nobel Prize in Chemistry") only three years after the isotope's isolation. Lewis was deeply disappointed by the [Nobel Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Committee_for_Chemistry "Nobel Committee for Chemistry")'s decision in 1934 and several high-ranking administrators at Berkeley believed this disappointment played a central role in [his suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis#Death "Gilbert N. Lewis") a decade later.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-:5-59)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-diplogen-4)

### "Heavy water" experiments in World War II

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: \"Heavy water\" experiments in World War II")]

Shortly before the war, [Hans von Halban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Halban "Hans von Halban") and [Lew Kowarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Kowarski "Lew Kowarski") moved their research on neutron moderation from France to Britain, smuggling the entire global supply of heavy water (which had been made in Norway) across in twenty-six steel drums.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-61)

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") was known to be conducting experiments using heavy water as moderator for a [nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor "Nuclear reactor") design. Such experiments were a source of concern because they might allow them to produce [plutonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium "Plutonium") for an [atomic bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb "Atomic bomb"). Ultimately it led to the [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") operation called the "[Norwegian heavy water sabotage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage "Norwegian heavy water sabotage")", the purpose of which was to destroy the [Vemork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemork "Vemork") deuterium production/enrichment facility in Norway. At the time this was considered important to the potential progress of the war.

After World War II ended, the Allies discovered that Germany was not putting as much serious effort into the program as had been previously thought. The Germans had completed only a small, partly built experimental reactor (which had been hidden away) and had been unable to sustain a chain reaction. By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor,[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] partially due to the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, even if the Germans had succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with [Chicago Pile-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1 "Chicago Pile-1") in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from the development of an [atomic bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb "Atomic bomb"). The engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required about two and a half years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S. and [U.S.S.R.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.S.R. "U.S.S.R."), for example.

### In thermonuclear weapons

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deuterium&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: In thermonuclear weapons")]

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Ivy_Mike_Sausage_device.jpg/500px-Ivy_Mike_Sausage_device.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ivy_Mike_Sausage_device.jpg)

The "Sausage" device casing of the [Ivy Mike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Mike "Ivy Mike")[H bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb "Hydrogen bomb"), attached to instrumentation and cryogenic equipment. The 20-ft-tall bomb held a cryogenic [Dewar flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewar_flask "Dewar flask") with room for 160 kg of liquid deuterium.

The 62-ton [Ivy Mike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Mike "Ivy Mike") device built by the United States and exploded on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful [hydrogen bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb "Hydrogen bomb") (thermonuclear bomb). In this context, it was the first bomb in which most of the energy released came from [nuclear reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction "Nuclear reaction") stages that followed the primary [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") stage of the [atomic bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb "Atomic bomb"). The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated [vacuum flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_flask "Vacuum flask") or [cryostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryostat "Cryostat"), held [cryogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic "Cryogenic") liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 [liters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liter "Liter") (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional atomic bomb (the "primary") at one end of the bomb was used to create the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off the [thermonuclear reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_reaction "Thermonuclear reaction").

Within a few years, so-called "dry" hydrogen bombs were developed that did not need cryogenic hydrogen. Released information suggests that all [thermonuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon "Thermonuclear weapon") built since then contain [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") of deuterium and lithium in their secondary stages. The material that contains the deuterium is mostly [lithium deuteride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_deuteride "Lithium deuteride"), with the lithium consisting of the isotope [lithium-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-6 "Lithium-6"). When the lithium-6 is bombarded with fast [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") from the atomic bomb, [tritium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium "Tritium") (hydrogen-3) is produced, and then the deuterium and the tritium quickly engage in [thermonuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_fusion "Thermonuclear fusion"), releasing abundant energy, [helium-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4 "Helium-4"), and even more free neutrons. "Pure" fusion weapons such as the [Tsar Bomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba "Tsar Bomba") are believed to be obsolete. In most modern ("boosted") thermonuclear weapons, fusion directly provides only a small fraction of the total energy. Fission of a natural [uranium-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-238 "Uranium-238") tamper by fast neutrons produced from D–T fusion accounts for a much larger (i.e. boosted) energy release than the fusion reaction itself.

In August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous deuterium into a [liquid metallic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen "Metallic hydrogen"). This may help researchers better understand [gas giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant "Gas giant") planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and some [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet"), since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-NYT-20180816-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-SCI-20180816-63)

An **antideuteron** is the [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter") counterpart of the deuteron, consisting of an [antiproton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiproton "Antiproton") and an [antineutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineutron "Antineutron"). The antideuteron was first produced in 1965 at the [Proton Synchrotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Synchrotron "Proton Synchrotron") at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN "CERN")[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-64) and the [Alternating Gradient Synchrotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_Gradient_Synchrotron "Alternating Gradient Synchrotron") at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory "Brookhaven National Laboratory").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-65) A complete atom, with a [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron") orbiting the nucleus, would be called _antideuterium_, but as of 2019 antideuterium has not yet been created. The proposed symbol for antideuterium is D, that is, D with an overbar.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#cite_note-66)
