Today the manuscript is found in the collections of the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem .

Description [ edit ] The book contains Hebrew and Aramaic phrases which were copied to Hebrew letters by Newton, such as the phrase: "ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד" (English: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity ). A Latin translation appears alongside the Hebrew and Aramaic phrases, together with additional explanations which are taken from the book "On Hebrew Abbreviations" by the Christian Hebraist , Johannes Buxtorf .

The manuscript contains references to a variety of sources, including the Old Testament , the Midrash (interpreting biblical stories) of the sophos Hillel and Shammai , the Talmud , the Zohar , and Targum Jonathan .

The dimension of the manuscript is 31 x 20 centimeters.

History [ edit ] Newton bases the book on the prophecy from the biblical Book of Ezekiel , which contains a description of the Temple . In addition, Newton uses a commentary about that prophecy description by the Spanish Jesuit , Juan Bautista Villalpando , and the critique about his commentary by Louis Cappel . This critique appeared on Brian Walton 's multilingual edition of the Bible, of which Newton had a copy.

The manuscript is dated between 1675 and 1685.
