[ 1 ] The major wildland fire emissions include greenhouse gases and several criteria pollutants that impact human health and welfare.: [ 2 ] Emissions Grams of emission / kilogram of fuel burned Percentage Carbon dioxide 1564.8 71.44% Water 459.2 20.97% Carbon monoxide 120.9 5.52% Atmospheric particulate matter <2.5μ 10.3 0.47% Nitric oxide 8.5 0.39% Methane 5.9 0.27% Volatile organic compounds 5.2 0.24% Organic carbon 5.2 0.24% Non-methane hydrocarbon 4.3 0.20% Particulate matter > 10μ 3.8 0.17% Particulate matter <10μ and >2.5μ 1.9 0.09% Elemental carbon 0.4 0.02% Compared to the preindustrial era, wildland land fire in the conterminous U.S.

has been reduced 90 percent with proportional reductions in wildland fire emissions. Land use changes ( agriculture and urbanization ) are responsible for roughly 50 percent of this decrease, and land management decisions (land fragmentation , suppression actions, etc.) are responsible for the remainder.

Anthropogenic activities (e.g., industrial production , transportation , agriculture , etc.) today have more than replaced the lost preindustrial wildland fire atmospheric emissions.

[ 3 ] The following charts compare preindustrial wildland fire emissions [ 4 ] with contemporary emissions.
