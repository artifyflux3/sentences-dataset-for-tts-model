Effective 2002–03, the team's nickname was changed to the Bobcats. They played as a Division I independent that season and 2003–04. In 2004–05, the team played in the College Hockey America Conference . The following season, the Bobcats joined the ECAC where they still compete.

History [ edit ] On February 28, 2010, Quinnipiac made NCAA history. Against the Rensselaer Engineers, the Bobcats lost by a score of 2–1, but it took five overtimes. It is now the longest college hockey game in NCAA history. Senior defenseman Laura Gersten had the game-winning goal. She registered it at 4:32 of the fifth overtime session to not only clinch the win, but the series victory.

[ 3 ] RPI advanced to the ECAC Hockey Women's Semifinals for the second consecutive season. The Engineers will face top ranked Cornell University.

On November 12 and 13, 2010, Kelly Babstock made Quinnipiac hockey history as she accounted for six of the seven goals scored over the weekend. Babstock registered back to back hat tricks against ECAC opponents (No. 10 ranked Harvard and Dartmouth). In addition, she is the first skater in Quinnipiac history to record two hat tricks in one season. As of November 14, Babstock led the team and the entire NCAA in goals (13) and points (27).

[ 4 ] Versus the Brown Bears on Friday, December 3, 2010, Kelly Babstock became Quinnipiac's all-time leader in goals scored in a season by netting her 16th goal of the season. Babstock's nation leading sixth game-winning goal against Yale on Saturday, Dec. 4 was part of a Bobcats 3–1 win.

[ 5 ] With a second period goal versus the Colgate Raiders on November 19, 2011, Kelly Babstock of the Quinnipiac Bobcats became the program's all-time leading scorer.

[ 6 ] In just her second season, Babstock surpassed Vicki Graham, who finished with 73 career points, after the 2006–07 season. Babstock reached the milestone in her 50th career game.

[ 7 ] Kelly Babstock led all skaters in points at the 2011 Nutmeg Classic with four (one goal, three assists). With the two assists in the championship game, Babstock earned the 39 and 40 assists of her career, surpassing Caitlin Peters as the all-time assist leader in Bobcats history.

[ 8 ] Breann Frykas scored the game-winning goal as the Bobcats bested the Robert Morris Colonials by a 3–2 tally. The victory in the Nutmeg Classic was also the 200th career victory of head coach Rick Seeley.
