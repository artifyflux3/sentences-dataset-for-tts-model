[ 1 ] A graphical illustration of a zero-dimensional space is a point .

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] Specifically: A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the Lebesgue covering dimension if every open cover of the space has a refinement that is a cover by disjoint open sets.

A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the finite-to-finite covering dimension if every finite open cover of the space has a refinement that is a finite open cover such that any point in the space is contained in exactly one open set of this refinement.

A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the small inductive dimension if it has a base consisting of clopen sets .

The three notions above agree for separable , metrisable spaces .

[ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ] Properties of spaces with small inductive dimension zero [ edit ] A zero-dimensional Hausdorff space is necessarily totally disconnected , but the converse fails. However, a locally compact Hausdorff space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected. (See ( Arhangel'skii & Tkachenko 2008 , Proposition 3.1.7, p.136) for the non-trivial direction.) Zero-dimensional Polish spaces are a particularly convenient setting for descriptive set theory . Examples of such spaces include the Cantor space and Baire space .

Hausdorff zero-dimensional spaces are precisely the subspaces of topological powers 2 I {\displaystyle 2^{I}} where 2 = { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle 2=\{0,1\}} is given the discrete topology . Such a space is sometimes called a Cantor cube . If I is countably infinite , 2 I {\displaystyle 2^{I}} is the Cantor space.

Manifolds [ edit ] All points of a zero-dimensional manifold are isolated .
