In written languages, an **ordinal indicator** is a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(typography) "Character (typography)"), or group of characters, following a [numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit") denoting that it is an [ordinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number_(linguistics) "Ordinal number (linguistics)"), rather than a [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_numbers_in_English#Cardinal_numbers "Names of numbers in English"). Historically these letters were "elevated terminals", that is to say the last few letters of the full word denoting the ordinal form of the number displayed as a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript"). Probably originating with [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") scribes, the character(s) used vary in different languages.

In [English orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_ordinal_numbers "English ordinal numbers"), this corresponds to the suffixes _‑st_, _‑nd_, _‑rd_, _‑th_ in written ordinals (represented either on the line _1st_, _2nd_, _3rd_, _4th_ or as [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript "Subscript and superscript")_1 st_, _2 nd_, _3 rd_, _4 th_). Also commonly encountered in [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") are the superscript or [superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_letter "Superior letter") (and often underlined) **masculine ordinal indicator**, **º**, and **feminine ordinal indicator**, **ª**. In formal typography, the ordinal indicators ª and º are distinguishable from other characters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-mstyp-1)

The practice of underlined (or doubly underlined) superscripted abbreviations was common in 19th-century writing (not limited to ordinal indicators in particular, and extant in the [numero sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign "Numero sign")№), and was found in handwritten English until at least the late 19th century (e.g. _first_ abbreviated '**1 st'** or _1 st_).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-2)

In [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"), and [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language "Galician language"), the ordinal indicators º and ª are appended to the numeral depending on whether the [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender") is masculine or feminine. The indicator may be given an [underline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline "Underline") but this is not ubiquitous. In [digital typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_typography "Digital typography"), this depends on the font: [Cambria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambria_(typeface) "Cambria (typeface)") and [Calibri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri "Calibri"), for example, have underlined ordinal indicators, while most other fonts do not.

Examples of the usage of ordinal indicators in Italian are:

*   _\_1º, primo\__; _\_1ª, prima\__ "first"
*   _\_2º, secondo\__; _\_2ª, seconda\__ "second"
*   _\_3º, terzo\__; _\_3ª, terza\__ "third"

Galician also forms its ordinal numbers this way,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-3) while [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language "Asturian language") follows a similar system where ᵘ is used for the masculine gender, ª for the feminine gender and º for the neuter gender.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-4)

In Spanish, using the two final letters of the word as it is spelled is not allowed,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-5) except in the cases of _\_primer\__ (an [apocope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocope "Apocope") of _\_primero\__) before singular masculine nouns, which is not abbreviated as _\_1.º\__ but as _\_1.er\__, of _\_tercer\__ (an apocope of _\_tercero\__) before singular masculine nouns, which is not abbreviated as _\_3.º\__ but as _\_3.er\__, and of compound ordinal numbers ending in _\_primer\__ or _\_tercer\__. For instance, "twenty-first" is _\_vigésimo primer\__ before a masculine noun, and its abbreviation is _\_21.er\__. Since none of these words are shortened before feminine nouns, their correct forms for those cases are _\_primera\__ and _\_tercera\__. These can be represented as _\_1.ª\__ and _\_3.ª\__. As with other abbreviations in Spanish, the ordinal numbers have a period ".", which is placed _before_ the indicator. Portuguese follows the same method.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-6)

The practice of indicating ordinals with superscript suffixes may originate with the practice of writing a superscript _o_ to indicate a [Latin ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_(Latin) "Ablative (Latin)") in pre-modern [scribal practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribal_abbreviation "Scribal abbreviation"). This ablative [desinence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/desinence "wikt:desinence") happened to be frequently combined with ordinal numerals indicating dates (as in _tertio die_ [written _\_iii o die\__] "on the third day" or in [Anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini "Anno Domini") years, as in _anno millesimo [...] ab incarnatione domini nostri Iesu Christi_ [written an ͂ M o [...] dm ͂i nri ih ͂u xp ͂i or similarly] "in the thousandth [...] year after the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The usage of terminals in the [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular "Vernacular") languages of Europe derives from Latin usage, as practised by scribes in monasteries and [chanceries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_(medieval_office) "Chancery (medieval office)") before writing in the vernacular became established. The terminal letters used depend on the gender of the item to be ordered and the case in which the ordinal adjective is stated, for example _\_primus dies\__ ('the first day', nominative case, masculine), but _\_primo die\__ ('on the first day', ablative case masculine), shown as I o or i o. As monumental inscriptions often refer to days on which events happened (e.g., "he died on the tenth of June"), the ablative case is generally used: X o (_\_decimo\__) with the month stated in the genitive case. Examples:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-7)

*   I o _\_(primo) die Julii\__ "on the first day of July"
*   X o _\_decimo\__
*   XX o _\_vicensimo\__
*   L o _\_quinquagesimo\__
*   C o _\_centesimo\__
*   M o _\_millesimo\__

Comparison between the ordinal indicator (left) and the degree sign (right), in a monotone font and in a variable stroke width font.

The masculine ordinal indicator º may be confused with the [degree sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_sign "Degree sign")° (U+00B0), which looks very similar and which is provided on the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#Italian "QWERTY") and [Latin American keyboard layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#Latin_America,_officially_known_as_Spanish_Latinamerican_sort "QWERTY"). It was common in the early days of computers to use the same character for both.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The degree sign is a uniform circle and is never underlined. The masculine ordinal indicator is the shape of a lower-case letter o, and thus may be [oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval "Oval") or [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), and may have a varying line thickness.

Ordinal indicators may also be underlined. It is not mandatory in [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-8) nor in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-11) but it is preferred in some fonts to avoid confusion with the degree sign.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-mstyp-1)

Alignment of the ordinal indicator (left) and superscript characters (right), in the Portuguese abbreviation _1.º E.do_ (1st floor left), in a monotone font and in a variable stroke width font.

Also, the ordinal indicators should be distinguishable from superscript characters. The top of the ordinal indicators (i.e., the top of the elevated letter a and letter o) must be aligned[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-mstyp-1) with the [cap height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height "Cap height") of the font. The alignment of the top of superscripted letters a and o will depend on the font.

Comparison between ordinal indicator and superscript markup (left) and superscript characters (U+1D48 and U+1D52) (right), in the Portuguese abbreviation _1.º E.do_ (1st floor left), in a monotone font and in a variable stroke width font.

The line thickness of the ordinal indicators is always proportional to the line thickness of the other characters of the font. Many fonts just shrink the characters (making them thinner) to draw superscripts.

The Romance feminine and masculine ordinal indicators were adopted into the 8-bit [ECMA-94](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMA-94 "ECMA-94") encoding in 1985 and the [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1") encoding in 1987 (both based on [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation")'s [Multinational Character Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Character_Set "Multinational Character Set") designed for [VT220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220 "VT220")), at positions 170 (xAA) and 186 (xBA), respectively. ISO 8859-1 was incorporated as the first 256 code points of [ISO/IEC 10646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_10646 "ISO/IEC 10646") and [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") in 1991. The Unicode characters are thus:

*   U+00AA ª FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR (&ordf;)
*   U+00BA º MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR (&ordm;)

There are [superscript versions of the letters ⟨a⟩ and ⟨o⟩ in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts "Unicode subscripts and superscripts"); these are different characters and should not be used as ordinal indicators.

The majority of character sets intended to support Galician, Portuguese, and/or Spanish have those two characters encoded in hexadecimal as follows:

Similar conventions
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ordinal_indicator&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Similar conventions")]

*   Some languages use [superior letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_letter "Superior letter") as a typographic convention for abbreviations. For example, in pre-20th-century handwritten letters and records, English featured abbreviations like "answ d" for "answered"[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-12) and "Jo s" for "Joseph".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-13)
*   Spanish uses superscript letters and ordinal indicators in some abbreviations,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-dpd-14) such as _\_V.º B.º\__ for _\_visto bueno\__ "approved"; _\_n.º\__ for _\_número\__ "number"; _\_D.ª\__ for _\_doña\__ (an [honorific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific "Honorific")); _M.ª_ for _[María](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria\_(given\_name) "Maria (given name)")_ (a [Spanish name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_name "Spanish name") frequently used in compounds like _[José M.ª](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9\_Mar%C3%ADa "José María")_); and _\_adm.ora\__ for _\_administradora\__ "administrator". The superscript characters and indicators are always preceded by a period. Traditionally, they have been underlined, but this is optional and less frequent today. Portuguese forms some abbreviations in the same manner; for example: _\_Ex.mo\__ for _\_[Excelentíssimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelent%C3%ADssimo "Excelentíssimo")\__ (an [honorific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific "Honorific")), _\_L.da\__ for _\_Limitada\__ ([Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ltd. "Ltd.")), and _\_Sr.ª\__ for _\_Senhora\__ ([Ms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms. "Ms.")).
*   English has borrowed the _No._ abbreviation from the [Romance-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") word _\_numero\__, which itself derives from the Latin word _\_numero\__, the [ablative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_(Latin) "Ablative (Latin)") of the word _\_numerus\__ "number".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-15) This is sometimes written as _N o_, with the superscript _o_ optionally underlined, or sometimes with the ordinal indicator. In this case the ordinal indicator would simply represent the letter _o_ in _\_numero\__; see [numero sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign "Numero sign").
*   In English, superscript abbreviations were common.

Sometimes the characters for the ordinal indicators (º and ª) are used for one of these purposes, which may be considered a misuse if other characters are preferred for these contexts.

In [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), the period can be omitted if there is no ambiguity whether a given numeral is ordinal or cardinal. The only exceptions are variables in mathematics (_\_k+1-szy\__ – _\_(k+1)st\__).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-16) Writing out the [endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix "Suffix") for various [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case "Grammatical case"), as sometimes happens in Czech and Slovak, is considered incorrect and uneducated. Should a [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") follow this dot, it is omitted.

The Serbian standard of Serbo-Croatian (unlike the Croatian and Bosnian standards) uses the dot in role of the ordinal indicator only past Arabic numerals, while Roman numerals are used without a dot.

There is a problem with autocorrection, mobile editors, etc., which often force a capital initial letter in the word following the ordinal numbers.

*   _-st_ is used with numbers ending in _1_ (e.g. _1st_, pronounced _fir**st**_)
*   _-nd_ is used with numbers ending in _2_ (e.g. _92nd_, pronounced _ninety-seco**nd**_)
*   _-rd_ is used with numbers ending in _3_ (e.g. _33rd_, pronounced _thirty-thi**rd**_)
*   As an exception to the above rules, numbers ending with _11_, _12_, and _13_ use _-th_ (e.g. _11th_, pronounced _eleven**th**_, _112th_, pronounced _one hundred [and] twelf**th**_)
*   _-th_ is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced _nin**th**_).
*   One archaic variant uses a singular _-d_ for numbers ending in 2 or 3 (e.g. _92d_ or _33d_)

In 19th-century handwriting, these terminals were often elevated, that is to say written as superscripts (e.g. 2 nd, 34 th). With the gradual introduction of the [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") in the late 19th century, it became common to write them on the baseline in typewritten texts,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-17) and this usage even became recommended in certain 20th-century style guides. Thus, the 17th edition of _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ states: "The letters in ordinal numbers should not appear as superscripts (e.g., 122nd not 122 nd)", as do the _[Bluebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebook "Bluebook")_[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-TforL-18) and style guides by the _[Council of Science Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council\_of\_Science\_Editors "Council of Science Editors")_,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-19)[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Manual_of_Style_for_Technical_Publications "Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-20) and [Yahoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-21) Two problems are that superscripts are used "most often in citations" and are "tiny and hard to read".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-TforL-18) Some [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor") format ordinal indicators as superscripts by default (e.g. [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word")[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-22)). Style guide author Jack Lynch ([Rutgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University "Rutgers University")) recommends turning off automatic superscripting of ordinals in [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word"), because "no professionally printed books use superscripts".[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-23)

[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") uses the ordinal indicators _\_er\__ and _\_re\__ for the number 1, depending on gender (masculine _\_1 er – premier\__; feminine _\_1 re – première\__). It uses _\_e\__ for higher numbers (for instance _\_2 e – deuxième\__). French also uses the indicators _\_d\__ and _\_de\__ for the alternative second ordinal number (masculine _2 d – second_; feminine _2 de – seconde_). In plural, all these indicators are suffixed with an _s_: _\_ers\__ (_\_1 ers – premiers\__), _\_res\__ (_\_1 res – premières\__), _\_es\__ (_\_2 es – deuxièmes\__), _\_ds\__ (_\_2 ds – seconds\__), _des_ (_\_2 des – secondes\__).

Although regarded as incorrect by typographic standards, longer forms are in wide usage: _\_ère\__ for feminine 1 (_\_1 ère – première\__)), _\_ème\__ for numbers starting at 2 (for instance _\_2 ème – deuxième\__), _\_nd\__ and _\_nde\__ for the alternative second ordinal number (_\_2 nd – second\__; _\_2 nde – seconde\__)

These indicators use superscript formatting whenever it is available.

The rule in [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language") is to follow the number with the last letter in the singular and the last two letters in the plural.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-24) Most numbers follow the pattern exemplified by _vint_ '20' (_\_20è\__ _m_ _sg_, _\_20a\__ _f_ _sg_, _\_20ns\__ _m_ _pl_, _\_20es\__ _f_ _pl_), but the first few ordinals are irregular, affecting the abbreviations of the masculine forms. Superscripting is not standard.

Unlike other [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages"), [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") is similar to [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") in this respect: the French layout with _e_ used to be popular, but [the recent spelling changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_orthography "Dutch orthography") now prescribe the suffix _\_‑e\__. Optionally _\_‑ste\__ and _\_‑de\__ may be used, but this is more complex: _\_1ste\__(_\_eerste\__), _\_2de\__(_\_tweede\__), _\_4de\__(_\_vierde\__), _\_20ste\__(_\_twintigste\__), etc.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#cite_note-25)

In [Finnish orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_orthography "Finnish orthography"), when the numeral is followed by its [head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics) "Head (linguistics)") noun (which indicates the [grammatical case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case "Grammatical case") of the ordinal), it is sufficient to write a period or [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") after the numeral: _\_Päädyin kilpailussa **2. sijalle**\__ "In the competition, I finished **in 2nd place**". However, if the head noun is omitted, the ordinal indicator takes the form of a [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)") suffix, which is attached to the numeral with a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)"). In the [nominative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case"), the suffix is _‑nen_ for 1 and 2, and _‑s_ for larger numerals: _\_Minä olin **2:nen**, ja veljeni oli **3:s**\__ 'I came **2nd**, and my brother came **3rd**'. This is derived from the endings of the spelled-out ordinal numbers: _\_ensimmäinen\__, _\_toinen\__, _\_kolmas\_, \_neljäs\__, _\_viides\__, _\_kuudes\__, _\_seitsemäs\__, etc..

The system becomes rather complicated when the ordinal needs to be [inflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflected "Inflected"), as the ordinal suffix is adjusted according to the case ending: _\_3:**s**\__ (nominative case, which has no ending), _\_3:**nne**n\__ ([genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") with ending _\_‑n\__), _\_3:**t**ta\__ ([partitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive_case "Partitive case") with ending _\_‑ta\__), _\_3:**nne**ssa\__ ([inessive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inessive_case "Inessive case") with ending _\_‑ssa\__), _\_3:**nte**en\__ ([illative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illative_case "Illative case") with ending _\_‑en\__), etc.. Even native speakers sometimes find it difficult to exactly identify the ordinal suffix, as its borders with the [word stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem "Word stem") and the case ending may appear blurred. In such cases, it may be preferable to write the ordinal word entirely with [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet) "Letter (alphabet)") and particularly _\_2:nen\__ is rare even in the nominative case, as it is not significantly shorter than the full word _\_toinen\__.

Numerals from 3 up form their ordinals uniformly by adding the suffix _\_-ú\__: _\_3ú\__, _\_4ú\__, _\_5ú\__, etc. When the ordinal is written out, the suffix adheres to the spelling restrictions imposed by the [broad/slender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_phonology "Irish phonology") difference in consonants and is written _\_-iú\__ after slender consonants; but when written as numbers, only the suffix itself (_\_-ú\__) is written. In the case of 4 (_\_ceathair\__), the final syllable is [syncopated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(phonetics) "Syncope (phonetics)") before the suffix, and in the case of 9 (_\_naoi\__), 20 (_\_fiche\__), and 1000 (_\_míle\__), the final vowel is assimilated into the suffix.

Most multiples of ten end in a vowel in their cardinal form and form their ordinal form by adding the suffix to their genitive singular form, which ends in _\_-d\__; this is not reflected in writing. Exceptions are 20 (_\_fiche\__) and 40 (_\_daichead\__), both of which form their ordinals by adding the suffix directly to the cardinal (_\_fichiú\__ and _\_daicheadú\__).

When counting objects, _\_dó\__ (2) becomes _\_dhá\__ and _\_ceathair\__ (4) becomes _\_ceithre\__.

As in French, the vigesimal system is widely used, particularly in people's ages. _\_Ceithre scór agus cúigdéag\__ – 95.

The numbers 1 (_\_aon\__) and 2 (_\_dó\__) both have two separate ordinals: one regularly formed by adding _\_-ú\__ (_\_aonú\__, _\_dóú\__), and one [suppletive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion") form (_\_céad\__, _\_dara\__). The regular forms are restricted in their usage to actual numeric contexts, when counting. The latter are also used in counting, especially _\_céad\__, but are used in broader, more abstract senses of "first" and "second" (or "other"). In their broader senses, _céad_ and _dara_ are not written as _\_1ú\__ and _\_2ú\__, though _\_1ú\__ and _\_2ú\__ may in a numeric context be read aloud as _\_céad\__ and _\_dara\__ (e.g., _\_an 21ú lá\__ may be read as _\_an t-aonú lá is fiche\__ or as _\_an chéad lá is fiche\__).

|  | Cardinal | Ordinal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | _a h-aon_ | _aonú_ (_1ú_) or _céad_ |
| 2 | _a dó_ | _dóú_ (_2ú_) or _dara_ |

| 20 | _fiche_ or _scór_ | _fichiú_ (_20ú_) |
| 30 | _triocha_ | _triochadú_ (_30ú_) |
| 40 | _daichead_, _ceathracha_ or _dhá scór_ | _daicheadú_ or _ceathrachadú_ (_40ú_) |
| 50 | _caoga_ | _caogadú_ (_50ú_) |
| 60 | _seasca_ or _trí scór_ | _seascadú_ (_60ú_) |
| 70 | _seachtó_ | _seachtódú_ (_70ú_) |
| 80 | _ochtó_ or _ceithre scór_ | _ochtódú_ (_80ú_) |
| 90 | _nócha_ | _nóchadú_ (_90ú_) |
| 100 | _céad_ | _céadú_ (_100ú_) |
| 1000 | _míle_ | _míliú_ (_1000ú_) |

One or two letters of the spelled-out numeral are appended to it (either after a hyphen or, rarely, in superscript). The rule is to take the minimal number of letters that include at least one consonant phoneme. Examples: 2-му второму/ftɐro**mu**/, 2-я вторая/ftɐra**ja**/, 2-й второй/ftɐro**j**/ (note that in the second example, the vowel letter я represents two phonemes, one of which [/j/] is _consonant_).

The general rule is that _:a_ (for 1 and 2) or _\_:e\__ (for all other numbers, except _\_101:a\__, _\_42:a\__, etc., but including _\_11:e\__ and _\_12:e\__) is appended to the numeral. The reason is that _\_-a\__ and _\_-e\__ respectively end the ordinal number words. The ordinals for 1 and 2 may however be given an _\_-e\__ form (_\_förste\__ and _\_andre\__ instead of _\_första\__ and _\_andra\__) when used about a male person (masculine natural gender), and if so they are written _\_1:e\__ and _\_2:e\__. When indicating dates, suffixes are never used. Examples: _\_1:a klass\__ "first grade (in elementary school)", _\_3:e utgåvan\__ "third edition", but _\_6 november\__. Furthermore, suffixes can be left out if the number obviously is an ordinal number, example: _\_3 utg.\__ "3rd ed". Using a [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") as an ordinal indicator is considered [archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism "Archaism"), but still occurs in military contexts; for example: _\_5. komp\__ "5th company".

Representation as prefix
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ordinal_indicator&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Representation as prefix")]

Numbers in [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language") and [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language "Indonesian language") are preceded by the ordinal prefix _\_ke-\__; for example, _\_ke-7\__ "seventh". The exception is _\_pertama\__, which means "first".

Numbers in [Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_language "Filipino language") are preceded by the ordinal prefix _\_ika-\__ or _\_pang-\__ (the latter subject to [sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi "Sandhi"); for example, _\_ika-7\__ or _\_pam-7\__ "seventh"). The exception is _\_una\__, which means "first".

In [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") and [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), an ordinal number is prefixed by 第 _\_dì\__ / _\_dai\__; for example: 第一 "first", 第二 "second".

In [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"), an ordinal number is prefixed by 제 _\_je\__ or suffixed by 번째 _\_beonjjae\__; for example: 제1 "first", 2번째 "second".
