He specialized in mathematical analysis and was known for the monographs and textbooks he has written.

Academic career [ edit ] Duren received in 1956 his bachelor's degree from Harvard University and in 1960 his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under Gian-Carlo Rota with thesis Spectral theory of a class of non-self-adjoint infinite matrix operators .

[ 2 ] As a postdoc he was an instructor at Stanford University . At the University of Michigan , he became in 1962 an assistant professor, in 1966 an associate professor, in 1969 a professor, and in 2010 a professor emeritus. As a professor, Duren served on the thesis committee of Ted Kaczynski .

[ 3 ] Duren was in 1968/69 at the Institute for Advanced Study , in 1975 a visiting professor at the Technion in Haifa, in 1964/65 a visiting scientist at Imperial College and the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay, in 1982 a visiting professor at the University of Maryland and in 1982/83 at the Mittag-Leffler Institute , the University of Paris-Sud and at the ETH Zürich . In 1989 he was a visiting scientist at Stanford University, in 1993 at the University of Hawaii and in 1996 at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. He has also been a visiting scientist in Halle, at the Max-Planck Institute in Leipzig, at the University of Witwatersrand , in Santiago de Chile, at the Autonomous University of Madrid , at Bar-Ilan University and the Academia Sinica in Beijing.

In 1976/77 he was chief editor of the Michigan Mathematical Journal . He was a co-editor of the American Mathematical Monthly and a festschrift for Frederick Gehring .

Duren's research and expository writing deals with function theory and functional analysis, including Hardy spaces , schlicht functions , harmonic analysis , geometric function theory , potential theory , and special functions .

Duren died on July 10, 2020, at the age of 85.

[ 4 ] Awards [ edit ] From 1964 to 1966, Duren was a Sloan Fellow . In 2012, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society .
