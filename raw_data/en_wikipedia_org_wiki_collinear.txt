In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), **collinearity** of a set of [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") is the property of their lying on a single [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-1) A set of points with this property is said to be **collinear** (sometimes spelled as **colinear**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-2)). In greater generality, the term has been used for aligned objects, that is, things being "in a line" or "in a row".

Collinear [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") in a [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system").

In any geometry, the set of points on a line are said to be **collinear**. In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") this relation is intuitively visualized by points lying in a row on a "straight line". However, in most geometries (including Euclidean) a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") is typically a [primitive (undefined) object type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"), so such visualizations will not necessarily be appropriate. A [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") for the geometry offers an interpretation of how the points, lines and other object types relate to one another and a notion such as collinearity must be interpreted within the context of that model. For instance, in [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), where lines are represented in the standard model by great circles of a sphere, sets of collinear points lie on the same great circle. Such points do not lie on a "straight line" in the Euclidean sense, and are not thought of as being _in a row_.

A mapping of a geometry to itself which sends lines to lines is called a _[collineation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collineation "Collineation")_; it preserves the collinearity property. The [linear maps (or linear functions)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_spaces "Vector spaces"), viewed as geometric maps, map lines to lines; that is, they map collinear point sets to collinear point sets and so, are collineations. In [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") these linear mappings are called _[homographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography "Homography")_ and are just one type of collineation.

In any triangle the following sets of points are collinear:

*   The [orthocenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthocenter "Orthocenter"), the [circumcenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcenter "Circumcenter"), the [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid "Centroid"), the [Exeter point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_point "Exeter point"), the [de Longchamps point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Longchamps_point "De Longchamps point"), and the center of the [nine-point circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-point_circle "Nine-point circle") are collinear, all falling on a line called the [Euler line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_line "Euler line").
*   The de Longchamps point also has [other collinearities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Longchamps_point#Additional_properties "De Longchamps point").
*   Any vertex, the tangency of the opposite side with an [excircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excircle "Excircle"), and the [Nagel point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagel_point "Nagel point") are collinear in a line called a [splitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitter_(geometry) "Splitter (geometry)") of the triangle.
*   The midpoint of any side, the point that is equidistant from it along the triangle's boundary in either direction (so these two points [bisect the perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection#Area_bisectors_and_perimeter_bisectors "Bisection")), and the [center of the Spieker circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spieker_center "Spieker center") are collinear in a line called a [cleaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaver_(geometry) "Cleaver (geometry)") of the triangle. (The [Spieker circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spieker_circle "Spieker circle") is the [incircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle "Incircle") of the [medial triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_triangle "Medial triangle"), and [its center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spieker_center "Spieker center") is the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter") of the triangle.)
*   Any vertex, the tangency of the opposite side with the incircle, and the [Gergonne point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gergonne_point#Gergonne_triangle_and_point "Gergonne point") are collinear.
*   From any point on the [circumcircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcircle "Circumcircle") of a triangle, the nearest points on each of the three extended sides of the triangle are collinear in the [Simson line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simson_line "Simson line") of the point on the circumcircle.
*   The lines connecting the feet of the [altitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) "Altitude (triangle)") intersect the opposite sides at collinear points.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-Johnson-3): p.199 
*   A triangle's [incenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incenter "Incenter"), the midpoint of an [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(geometry) "Altitude (geometry)"), and the point of contact of the corresponding side with the [excircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excircle "Excircle") relative to that side are collinear.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-AC-4): p.120, #78 
*   [Menelaus' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus%27_theorem "Menelaus' theorem") states that three points ![Image 2: {\displaystyle P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da44480c4ce88a564e8ff52138d90061fbf91394) on the sides (some [extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_side "Extended side")) of a triangle opposite vertices ![Image 3: {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18eb93c88961a573677555bffd4d27cc0557e70d) respectively are collinear if and only if the following products of segment lengths are equal:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-Johnson-3): p. 147

*   The incenter, the centroid, and the Spieker circle's center are collinear.
*   The circumcenter, the [Brocard midpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocard_points#The_segment_between_the_first_two_Brocard_points "Brocard points"), and the [Lemoine point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemoine_point "Lemoine point") of a triangle are collinear.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-5)
*   Two [perpendicular lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_lines "Perpendicular lines") intersecting at the [orthocenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthocenter "Orthocenter") of a triangle each intersect each of the triangle's [extended sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_side "Extended side"). The midpoints on the three sides of these points of intersection are collinear in the [Droz–Farny line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droz-Farny_line_theorem "Droz-Farny line theorem").

*   In a convex [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral")ABCD whose opposite sides intersect at E and F, the [midpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint "Midpoint") of AC, BD, EF are collinear and the line through them is called the [Newton line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_line "Newton line"). If the quadrilateral is a [tangential quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_quadrilateral "Tangential quadrilateral"), then its incenter also lies on this line.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-6)
*   In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter H, the "area centroid" G, and the quasicircumcenter O are collinear in this order, and _HG_ = 2 _GO_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-Myakishev-7) (See [Quadrilateral#Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#Remarkable_points_and_lines_in_a_convex_quadrilateral "Quadrilateral").)

*   Other collinearities of a [tangential quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_quadrilateral "Tangential quadrilateral") are given in [Tangential quadrilateral#Collinear points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_quadrilateral#Collinear_points "Tangential quadrilateral").
*   In a [cyclic quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral "Cyclic quadrilateral"), the [circumcenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcenter "Circumcenter"), the [vertex centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#Remarkable_points_and_lines_in_a_convex_quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") (the intersection of the two bimedians), and the [anticenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral#Anticenter_and_collinearities "Cyclic quadrilateral") are collinear.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-Honsberger-8)
*   In a cyclic quadrilateral, the [area centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#Remarkable_points_and_lines_in_a_convex_quadrilateral "Quadrilateral"), the vertex centroid, and the intersection of the diagonals are collinear.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-9)
*   In a [tangential trapezoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_trapezoid "Tangential trapezoid"), the tangencies of the [incircle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incircle "Incircle") with the two bases are collinear with the incenter.
*   In a tangential trapezoid, the midpoints of the legs are collinear with the incenter.

*   [Pascal's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_theorem "Pascal's theorem") (also known as the Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem) states that if an arbitrary six points are chosen on a [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") (i.e., [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") or [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola")) and joined by line segments in any order to form a [hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon"), then the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon (extended if necessary) meet in three points which lie on a straight line, called the Pascal line of the hexagon. The converse is also true: the [Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braikenridge%E2%80%93Maclaurin_theorem "Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem") states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic, which may be degenerate as in [Pappus's hexagon theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem "Pappus's hexagon theorem").

*   By [Monge's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monge%27s_theorem "Monge's theorem"), for any three [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") in a plane, none of which is completely inside one of the others, the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines, each externally tangent to two of the circles, are collinear.
*   In an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), the center, the two [foci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)"), and the two [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(curve) "Vertex (curve)") with the smallest [radius of curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_curvature_(mathematics) "Radius of curvature (mathematics)") are collinear, and the center and the two vertices with the greatest radius of curvature are collinear.
*   In a [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"), the center, the two foci, and the two vertices are collinear.

*   The [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of a [conic solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone") of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.

*   The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its [Monge point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Properties_analogous_to_those_of_a_triangle "Tetrahedron") and [circumcenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcenter "Circumcenter"). These points define the _Euler line_ of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the [Euler line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_line "Euler line") of a triangle. The center of the [tetrahedron's twelve-point sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Properties_analogous_to_those_of_a_triangle "Tetrahedron") also lies on the Euler line.

### Collinearity of points whose coordinates are given

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collinearity&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Collinearity of points whose coordinates are given")]

In [coordinate geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_geometry "Coordinate geometry"), in n-dimensional space, a set of three or more distinct points are collinear if and only if, the matrix of the coordinates of these vectors is of [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") 1 or less. For example, given three points

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X&=(x_{1},\ x_{2},\ \dots ,\ x_{n}),\\Y&=(y_{1},\ y_{2},\ \dots ,\ y_{n}),\\Z&=(z_{1},\ z_{2},\ \dots ,\ z_{n}),\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcfbc8d94fc1cddda22cd2ea24dbf441c29f8a36)
if the [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}&x_{2}&\dots &x_{n}\\y_{1}&y_{2}&\dots &y_{n}\\z_{1}&z_{2}&\dots &z_{n}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/065562817eda799f6fb25314035d76f8e8671101)
is of [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") 1 or less, the points are collinear.

Equivalently, for every subset of X, Y, Z, if the [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1&x_{1}&x_{2}&\dots &x_{n}\\1&y_{1}&y_{2}&\dots &y_{n}\\1&z_{1}&z_{2}&\dots &z_{n}\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0051b55c8e7c90552d9a551b3fe8d4b553f92160)
is of [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") 2 or less, the points are collinear. In particular, for three points in the plane (_n_ = 2), the above matrix is square and the points are collinear if and only if its [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") is zero; since that 3×3 determinant is plus or minus twice the [area of a triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle#Using_coordinates "Triangle") with those three points as vertices, this is equivalent to the statement that the three points are collinear if and only if the triangle with those points as vertices has zero area.

### Collinearity of points whose pairwise distances are given

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collinearity&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Collinearity of points whose pairwise distances are given")]

A set of at least three distinct points is called [straight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_geometry#Cayley%E2%80%93Menger_determinants "Distance geometry"), meaning all the points are collinear, if and only if, for every three of those points A, B, C, the following determinant of a [Cayley–Menger determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Menger_determinant "Cayley–Menger determinant") is zero (with _d_(_AB_) meaning the distance between A and B, etc.):

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \det {\begin{bmatrix}0&d(AB)^{2}&d(AC)^{2}&1\\d(AB)^{2}&0&d(BC)^{2}&1\\d(AC)^{2}&d(BC)^{2}&0&1\\1&1&1&0\end{bmatrix}}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89c4138887595a95654a8015e8b1aa25d140e4ca)
This determinant is, by [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula "Heron's formula"), equal to −16 times the square of the area of a triangle with side lengths _d_(_AB_), _d_(_BC_), _d_(_AC_); so checking if this determinant equals zero is equivalent to checking whether the triangle with vertices A, B, C has zero area (so the vertices are collinear).

Equivalently, a set of at least three distinct points are collinear if and only if, for every three of those points A, B, C with _d_(_AC_) greater than or equal to each of _d_(_AB_) and _d_(_BC_), the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality")_d_(_AC_) ≤ _d_(_AB_) + _d_(_BC_) holds with equality.

Two numbers m and n are not [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_numbers "Coprime numbers")—that is, they share a common factor other than 1—if and only if for a rectangle plotted on a [square lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_lattice "Square lattice") with vertices at (0, 0), (_m_, 0), (_m_, _n_), (0, _n_), at least one interior point is collinear with (0, 0) and (_m, n_).

Concurrency (plane dual)
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collinearity&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Concurrency (plane dual)")]

In various [plane geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") the notion of interchanging the roles of "points" and "lines" while preserving the relationship between them is called [plane duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry) "Duality (projective geometry)"). Given a set of collinear points, by plane duality we obtain a set of lines all of which meet at a common point. The property that this set of lines has (meeting at a common point) is called **concurrency**, and the lines are said to be [concurrent lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_lines "Concurrent lines"). Thus, concurrency is the plane dual notion to collinearity.

Given a [partial geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_geometry "Partial geometry")P, where two points determine at most one line, a **collinearity graph** of P is a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") whose vertices are the points of P, where two vertices are [adjacent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacent_vertex "Adjacent vertex") if and only if they determine a line in P.

Usage in statistics and econometrics
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collinearity&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Usage in statistics and econometrics")]

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), **collinearity** refers to a linear relationship between two [explanatory variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_variable "Explanatory variable"). Two variables are _perfectly collinear_ if there is an exact linear relationship between the two, so the correlation between them is equal to 1 or −1. That is, _X_ 1 and _X_ 2 are perfectly collinear if there exist parameters ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \lambda _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfa5ad1eb6cdaf3d8dfd77991ee9ce7bdf169184) and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/571a423bece8f29bcd1b48572f18dd4f6213dce2) such that, for all observations i, we have

![Image 11: {\displaystyle X_{2i}=\lambda _{0}+\lambda _{1}X_{1i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f12f9bef943db04a9a01ffa6d2ca7179eaf1ae1e)
This means that if the various observations (_X_ 1 _i_, _X_ 2 _i_) are plotted in the (_X_ 1, _X_ 2) plane, these points are collinear in the sense defined earlier in this article.

Perfect **multicollinearity** refers to a situation in which _k_ (_k_ ≥ 2) explanatory variables in a [multiple regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_regression "Multiple regression") model are perfectly linearly related, according to

![Image 12: {\displaystyle X_{ki}=\lambda _{0}+\lambda _{1}X_{1i}+\lambda _{2}X_{2i}+\dots +\lambda _{k-1}X_{(k-1),i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05cf11147f6ce2f0908757b3cd08637912f1b9ea)
for all observations i. In practice, we rarely face perfect multicollinearity in a data set. More commonly, the issue of multicollinearity arises when there is a "strong linear relationship" among two or more independent variables, meaning that

![Image 13: {\displaystyle X_{ki}=\lambda _{0}+\lambda _{1}X_{1i}+\lambda _{2}X_{2i}+\dots +\lambda _{k-1}X_{(k-1),i}+\varepsilon _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d26c4359ba5ca181a1b3ed68fd5e7ff6a7cb8198)
where the variance of ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00e1b6ad3cbad4af49bf21a3ad2dc379ff045079) is relatively small.

The concept of _lateral collinearity_ expands on this traditional view, and refers to collinearity between explanatory and criteria (i.e., explained) variables.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-10)

In [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication"), a [collinear (or co-linear) antenna array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear_antenna_array "Collinear antenna array") is an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_array "Antenna array") of [dipole antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna "Dipole antenna") mounted in such a manner that the corresponding elements of each [antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio) "Antenna (radio)") are parallel and aligned, that is they are located along a common line or axis.

The [collinearity equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity_equation "Collinearity equation") are a set of two equations, used in [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry "Photogrammetry") and [computer stereo vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_stereo_vision "Computer stereo vision"), to relate [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates") in an image ([sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor "Sensor")) plane (in two dimensions) to object coordinates (in three dimensions). In the photography setting, the equations are derived by considering the [central projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics) "Projection (mathematics)") of a point of the [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling "3D modeling") through the [optical centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_(optics)#Principal_planes_and_points "Cardinal point (optics)") of the [camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera "Pinhole camera") to the image in the image (sensor) plane. The three points, object point, image point and optical centre, are always collinear. Another way to say this is that the line segments joining the object points with their image points are all concurrent at the optical centre.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear#cite_note-11)
