M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science . It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in the field of computer science and is often referred to as the " Nobel Prize of Computing ". As of 2025 [update] , 79 people have been awarded the prize, with the most recent recipients being Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton , who won in 2024.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The award is named after Alan Turing , also referred as "Father of Computer Science", who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester . Turing is often credited as being the founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence , [ 7 ] and a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher during World War II .

[ 8 ] From 2007 to 2013, the award was accompanied by a prize of US$250,000 , with financial support provided by Intel and Google .

[ 2 ] [ 9 ] Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of US$1 million, with financial support provided by Google.

[ 1 ] [ 10 ] The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis . The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth , who won in 1974 at the age of 36, [ 11 ] while the oldest recipient was Alfred Aho , who won in 2020 at the age of 79.

[ 12 ] Only three women have been awarded the prize: Frances Allen (in 2006), [ 13 ] Barbara Liskov (in 2008), [ 14 ] and Shafi Goldwasser (in 2012).
