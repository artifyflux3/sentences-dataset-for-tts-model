After that, Algeria adopted the French system of units (i.e., the metric system ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Length [ edit ] Before the 1843 changeover, different units were used to measure length . One pic ( dzera à torky ) was equal either to 0.64 m [ 1 ] or 0.623 m [ 3 ] ), while a different pic ( dzera à rabry ) was equal to 0.48 m [ 1 ] or 0.467 m [ 3 ] ). Some other units are given below: [ 1 ] [ 3 ] 1 termin = 1 ⁄ 8 pic 1 rebia = 1 ⁄ 4 pic 1 nus = 1 ⁄ 2 pic.

Mass [ edit ] A number of different units were used to measure mass . One ukkia ( ounce ) was equal to 0.03413 kg . One metical (metsquat) was equal to about 0.0047 kg. Some other units are given below: [ 1 ] [ 4 ] 1 rottolo à thary = 16 ukkia 1 rottolo à khadhary = 18 ukkia 1 rottolo à kebyr = 24 ukkia 1 cantar = 100 rottolo (cantar (kebyr) = 100 rottolo à thary, cantar (khaldary) = 100 rottolo à khadhary , and cantar (thary) = 100 rottolo à thary [ 4 ] ).

In addition to above units, one gyral was equal to 207 mg .

[ 4 ] Capacity [ edit ] Two different systems were used to measure capacity : one for dry measure , and another for liquid measure.

[ 1 ] Some units used to measure dry capacities are given below: [ 1 ] Dry [ edit ] 1 caffiso (or calisse [ 3 ] ) = 317.47 L (Note: in an old publication, one caffiso was equalised to 8 saah, even though the given values are mismatched.

[ 5 ] ) 1 saah (or ssah ) [ 3 ] ) = 58 L 1 tarri (or tarie ) [ 3 ] ) = 1 ⁄ 12 caffiso.

Liquid [ edit ] One khoull (or khoul or kolleh [ 3 ] ) was equal to 16 + 2 ⁄ 3 l (1 hectoliter = 6 khoull [ 6 ] ) or 16 L.

[ 1 ] One Metalli ( oil ) was equal to 17.90 L.
