1605213 Links Journal homepage Online archive The New Left Review is a British bimonthly journal, established in 1960, which analyses international politics, the global economy, social theory, and cultural topics from a leftist perspective.

History [ edit ] Background [ edit ] As part of the emerging British " New Left " in the late 1950s, a number of journals were launched to carry commentary on matters of Marxist theory. One of these was The Reasoner , founded by historians E. P. Thompson and John Saville in July 1956.

[ 1 ] Three quarterly issues were produced.

[ 1 ] The publication was expanded and further developed from 1957 to 1959 as The New Reasoner , with an additional ten issues produced.

[ 1 ] The New Reasoner distanced itself from the British Communist Party and USSR in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev 's February 1956 " Secret Speech " on the Stalinist cult of personality , and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Uprising in November 1956.

[ 1 ] Another radical journal of the period was the Universities and Left Review , a publication started in 1957 with less allegiance to the British communist tradition.

[ 1 ] This journal was youth-oriented and pacifist in nature, expressing opposition to the militaristic rhetoric of the Cold War , voicing strong disagreement with the 1956 Suez War , and supporting the burgeoning Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).

[ 1 ] Establishment [ edit ] New Left Review was established in January 1960 when The New Reasoner and Universities and Left Review merged their Boards.

[ 2 ] The first editor-in-chief of the merged publication was Stuart Hall .

[ 2 ] The early New Left Review style, featuring illustrations on the cover and in the interior layout, was more irreverent and free-flowing than the publication's later issues, which tended to be more sombre and academic.

[ 1 ] Hall was succeeded as editor in 1962 by Perry Anderson .

[ 2 ] In 1993, nineteen of the members of the editorial committee resigned, citing a loss of control over content by the Editorial Board/Committee in favour of a Shareholders' Trust, which they argued was undemocratic. The Trust—composed of Perry Anderson , his brother Benedict Anderson , and Ronald Fraser —said that a change was necessary for the financial sustainability of New Left Review .

[ 3 ] The journal was relaunched in 2000, and Perry Anderson returned as editor until 2003.

[ 2 ] Since 2008 [ edit ] New Left Review closely followed the 2008 financial crisis as well as its aftermath and its global political repercussions. A 2011 essay by Wolfgang Streeck , titled "The Crises of Democratic Capitalism", [ 4 ] was called "the most powerful description of what has gone wrong in western societies" by the Financial Times ' s contributor Christopher Caldwell .

[ 5 ] In recent years, writer Benjamin Kunkel has served as a member of the New Left Review editorial committee, [ 6 ] while Oliver Eagleton is on the editorial staff.

[ 7 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] In 2003, New Left Review was ranked 12th by impact factor on a list of the top 20 political science journals in the world.

[ 8 ] By 2018, however, the Journal Citation Reports rated it 51st out of 176 journals in the category "Political Science", with an impact factor of 1.967.

[ 9 ] In 2023, the citation database Scopus placed New Left Review in the 69th percentile, 214th out of 706 "Political Science and International Relations" journals, with a citation score of 2.2.
