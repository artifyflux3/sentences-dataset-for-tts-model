[ 1 ] The book has been adopted by many universities , including Harvard University , Princeton University , the University of California, Berkeley , the California Institute of Technology , Columbia University , Stanford University , and Brown University , among others.

[ 2 ] Response [ edit ] Stephen Barr said about the book, "Like the famous Feynman Lectures on Physics , this book has the flavor of a good blackboard lecture".

[ 3 ] Michael Peskin's review in Classical and Quantum Gravity said, "This is quantum field theory taught at the knee of an eccentric uncle; one who loves the grandeur of his subject, has a keen eye for a slick argument, and is eager to share his repertoire of anecdotes about Feynman, Fermi, and all of his heroes [...] This [book] can help [students] love the subject and race to its frontier".

[ 4 ] David Tong called it a "charming book, where emphasis is placed on physical understanding and the author isn’t afraid to hide the ugly truth when necessary. It contains many gems".

[ 5 ] Zvi Bern wrote, "Zee has an infectious enthusiasm and a remarkable talent for slicing through technical mumbo jumbo to arrive at the heart of a problem".
