**British English**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-4) is the set of [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics) "Variety (linguistics)") of the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") native to the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), especially [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-7) More narrowly, it can refer specifically to the [English language in England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_England "English language in England"), or, more broadly, to the collective dialects of English throughout the United Kingdom taken as a single umbrella variety, for instance additionally incorporating [Scottish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English "Scottish English"), [Welsh English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_English "Welsh English"), and [Northern Irish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish_English "Northern Irish English"). [Tom McArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McArthur_(linguist) "Tom McArthur (linguist)") in the [Oxford Guide to World English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary") acknowledges that British English shares "all the ambiguities and tensions [with] the word 'British' and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity".

Variations exist in formal (both written and spoken) English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective _wee_ is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland, north-east England, Northern Ireland, Ireland, and occasionally [Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_dialect "Yorkshire dialect"), whereas the adjective _little_ is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term _British English_. The forms of [spoken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language "Spoken language") English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-8) and so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language.

Globally, countries that are [former British colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom "List of countries that have gained independence from the United Kingdom") or members of the [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") tend to follow British English,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-9) as is the case for English used by European Union institutions.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-10) The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") also uses British English with [Oxford spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling "Oxford spelling").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-12) In China, both British English and American English are taught.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-13) The UK government actively teaches and promotes English around the world and [operates in over 100 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Council "British Council").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-16)

History
-------

### Origins

English is a [West Germanic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages "West Germanic languages") that originated from the [Anglo-Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Frisian_languages "Anglo-Frisian languages")[dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect "Dialect") brought to Britain by [Germanic settlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples") from various parts of what is now northwest Germany and the northern Netherlands. The resident population at this time was generally speaking [Common Brittonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Brittonic "Common Brittonic")—the insular variety of [Continental Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Celtic "Continental Celtic"), which was influenced by the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army "Roman army") occupation. This group of languages ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language"), [Cornish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_language "Cornish language"), [Cumbric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbric "Cumbric")) cohabited alongside English into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages"), influence on English was [notably limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_English_words_of_Celtic_origin "Lists of English words of Celtic origin"). However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-17)

Initially, [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon "Anglo-Saxon") kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, [Late West Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_West_Saxon "Late West Saxon"), eventually came to dominate. The original [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") branch of the Germanic family, who settled in parts of Britain in the eighth and ninth centuries; the second was the [Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans "Normans") in the 11th century, who spoke [Old Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norman "Old Norman") and ultimately developed an English variety of this called [Anglo-Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language "Anglo-Norman language"). These two invasions caused English to become "mixed" to some degree (though it was never a truly [mixed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_language "Mixed language") in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).

The more idiomatic, concrete and descriptive English is, the more it is from Anglo-Saxon origins. The more intellectual and abstract English is, the more it contains [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") influences, e.g. swine (like the Germanic _schwein_) is the animal in the field bred by the occupied Anglo-Saxons and pork (like the French _porc_) is the animal at the table eaten by the occupying Normans.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-18) Another example is the Anglo-Saxon _cu_ meaning cow, and the French _bœuf_ meaning beef.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-19)

Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the [Anglo-Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Frisian_languages "Anglo-Frisian languages") core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the [Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a ["borrowing" language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword") of great flexibility and with a huge [vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary").

[Dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language#Europe "List of dialects of the English language") and [accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accents_of_English "Regional accents of English") vary amongst the four [countries of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom "Countries of the United Kingdom"), as well as within the countries themselves.

The major divisions are normally classified as [English English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_England "English language in England") (or English as spoken in England (which is itself broadly grouped into [Southern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Southern_England "English language in Southern England"), [West Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_English "West Country English"), [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands_English "East Midlands English") and [West Midlands English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_English "West Midlands English") and [Northern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Northern_England "English language in Northern England")), [Northern Irish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish_English "Northern Irish English") (in Northern Ireland), [Welsh English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_English "Welsh English") (not to be confused with the [Welsh language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language")), and [Scottish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English "Scottish English") (not to be confused with the [Scots language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language "Scots language") or [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic "Scottish Gaelic")). Each group includes a range of dialects, some markedly different from others. The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages.

Around the middle of the 15th century, there were points where within the 5 major dialects there were almost 500 ways to spell the word _though_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-thehistoryofenglish.com-20)

### Research

Following its last major [survey of English Dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_of_English_Dialects "Survey of English Dialects") (1949–1950), the [University of Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds "University of Leeds") has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Humanities_Research_Council "Arts and Humanities Research Council") awarded a grant to Leeds to study British regional dialects.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-MEO-22)

The team are[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-note-23) sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the "Voices project" run by the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC"), in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. "Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-MEO-22) When discussing the award of the grant in 2007, [Leeds University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds "University of Leeds") stated:

> that they were "very pleased"—and indeed, "well chuffed"—at receiving their generous grant. He could, of course, have been "bostin" if he had come from the [Black Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country "Black Country"), or if he was a [Scouser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouser "Scouser") he would have been well "made up" over so many spondoolicks, because as a [Geordie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordie "Geordie") might say, £460,000 is a "canny load of chink".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-Indi-20070601-24)

### English regional

Most people in Britain speak with a regional accent or dialect. However, about 2% of Britons speak with an accent called [Received Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation "Received Pronunciation")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-25) (also called "the King's English", "Oxford English" and "[BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") English"[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-26)), that is essentially region-less.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-sweet-27)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-fowler-28) It derives from a mixture of the Midlands and Southern dialects spoken in London in the early modern period.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-fowler-28) It is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-fowler-28)

In the South East, there are significantly different accents; the [Cockney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney "Cockney") accent spoken by some East Londoners is strikingly different from Received Pronunciation (RP). Cockney [rhyming slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyming_slang "Rhyming slang") can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-Franklyn1975-29) although the extent of its use is often somewhat exaggerated.

[Londoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors. [Estuary English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary_English "Estuary English") has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-30) Immigrants to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country and particularly to London. Surveys started in 1979 by the [Inner London Education Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_London_Education_Authority "Inner London Education Authority") discovered over 125 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-31) Notably [Multicultural London English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_London_English "Multicultural London English"), a [sociolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolect "Sociolect") that emerged in the late 20th century spoken mainly by young, [working-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class "Working class") people in [multicultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism "Multiculturalism") parts of [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-32)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-33)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-34)

Since the mass [internal migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_migration "Internal migration") to [Northamptonshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northamptonshire "Northamptonshire") in the 1940s and given its position between several major accent regions, it has become a source of various accent developments. In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the [Kettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering "Kettering") accent, which is a transitional accent between the [East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands "East Midlands") and [East Anglian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Anglia "East Anglia"). It is the last southern Midlands accent to use the broad "a" in words like _bath_ or _grass_ (i.e. [_barth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key") or [_grarss_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")). Conversely _crass_ or _plastic_ use a slender "a". A few miles northwest in [Leicestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire "Leicestershire") the slender "a" becomes more widespread generally. In the town of [Corby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corby "Corby"), five miles (8 km) north, one can find Corbyite which, unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.

Features
--------

Phonological features characteristic of British English revolve around the pronunciation of the letter R, as well as the dental plosive T and some diphthongs specific to this dialect.

### T-glottalling

Once regarded as a Cockney feature, in a number of forms of spoken British English, /t/ has become commonly realised as a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop")[ʔ] when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called [T-glottalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-glottalisation "T-glottalisation"). National media, being based in London, have seen the glottal stop spreading more widely than it once was in word endings, _not_ being heard as "no[ʔ]" and _bottle of water_ being heard as "bo[ʔ]le of wa[ʔ]er". It is still stigmatised when used in word-medial positions, such as _later_.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-Trudghill56-35) Other consonants subject to this usage in Cockney English are _p_, as in pa[ʔ]er and _k_ as in ba[ʔ]er.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-Trudghill56-35)

### R-dropping

In most areas of England and Wales, outside the [West Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_English "West Country English") and other near-by counties of the UK, the consonant R is not pronounced if not followed by a vowel, lengthening the preceding vowel instead. This phenomenon is known as [non-rhoticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English "Rhoticity in English"). In these same areas, a tendency exists to insert an R between a word ending in a vowel and a next word beginning with a vowel. This is called the [intrusive R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_R "Intrusive R"). It could be understood as a merger, in that words that once ended in an R and words that did not are no longer treated differently. This is also due to London-centric influences. Examples of R-dropping are _car_ and _sugar_, where the R is not pronounced.

### Diphthongisation

British dialects differ on the extent of diphthongisation of long vowels, with southern varieties extensively turning them into diphthongs, and with northern dialects normally preserving many of them. As a comparison, North American varieties could be said to be in-between.

#### North

Long vowels /iː/ and /uː/ are usually preserved, and in several areas also /oː/ and /eː/, as in **go** and **say** (unlike other varieties of English, that change them to [oʊ] and [eɪ] respectively). Some areas go as far as not diphthongising medieval /iː/ and /uː/, that give rise to modern /aɪ/ and /aʊ/; that is, for example, in the traditional accent of [Newcastle upon Tyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne "Newcastle upon Tyne"), 'out' will sound as 'oot', and in parts of Scotland and North-West England, 'my' will be pronounced as 'me'.

#### South

Long vowels /iː/ and /uː/ are diphthongised to [ɪi] and [ʊu] respectively (or, more technically, [ʏʉ], with a raised tongue), so that **ee** and **oo** in **feed** and **food** are pronounced with a movement. The diphthong [oʊ] is also pronounced with a greater movement, normally [əʊ], [əʉ] or [əɨ].

### People in groups

Dropping a morphological [grammatical number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number"), in [collective nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun "Collective noun"), is stronger in British English than North American English.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-BOD-36) This is to treat them as plural when once grammatically singular, a perceived natural number prevails, especially when applying to institutional nouns and groups of people.

The noun 'police', for example, undergoes this treatment:

> **Police are** investigating the theft of work tools worth £500 from a van at the Sprucefield park and ride car park in Lisburn.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-BBC1-37)

A football team can be treated likewise:

> Arsenal **have** lost just one of 20 home Premier League matches against Manchester City.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-BBC2-38)

This tendency can be observed in texts produced already in the 19th century. For example, [Jane Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen "Jane Austen"), a British author, writes in Chapter 4 of _[Pride and Prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride\_and\_Prejudice\_(novel) "Pride and Prejudice (novel)")_, published in 1813:

> All **the world are** good and agreeable in your eyes.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-39)

However, in Chapter 16, the grammatical number is used.

> **The world is** blinded by his fortune and consequence.

### Negatives

Some dialects of British English use negative concords, also known as [double negatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negatives "Double negatives"). Rather than changing a word or using a positive, words like nobody, not, nothing, and never would be used in the same sentence.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-40) While this does not occur in Standard English, it does occur in non-standard dialects. The double negation follows the idea of two different morphemes, one that causes the double negation, and one that is used for the point or the verb.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-41)

Standard British English
------------------------

[Standard English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English "Standard English") in the United Kingdom, as in other English-speaking nations, is widely enforced in schools and by social norms for formal contexts but not by any singular authority; for instance, there is no institution equivalent to the [Académie française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise "Académie Française") with French or the [Royal Spanish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Academy "Royal Spanish Academy") with Spanish. Standard British English [differs notably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English "Comparison of American and British English") in certain vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation features from standard [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") and certain other standard English varieties around the world. [British and American spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences "American and British English spelling differences") also differ in minor ways.

The accent, or pronunciation system, of standard British English, based in southeastern England, has been known for over a century as [Received Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation "Received Pronunciation") (RP). However, due to [language evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change "Language change") and changing social trends, some linguists argue that RP is losing [prestige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige_(sociolinguistics) "Prestige (sociolinguistics)") or has been replaced by another accent, one that the linguist [Geoff Lindsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lindsey "Geoff Lindsey") for instance calls Standard Southern British English.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-42) Other scholars suggest that more regionally-oriented standard accents are emerging in England.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-43) Outside of England, namely in Scotland and Northern Ireland, RP exerts very little influence, particularly in the 21st century. RP, while long established as the standard English accent around the globe due to the spread of the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), is distinct from the standard English pronunciation in some parts of the world; most prominently, RP [notably contrasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_General_American_and_Received_Pronunciation "Comparison of General American and Received Pronunciation") with standard North American accents.

As of the 21st century, dictionaries such as the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_, the _[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longman\_Dictionary\_of\_Contemporary\_English "Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English")_, the _[Chambers Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers\_Dictionary "Chambers Dictionary")_, and the _[Collins Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins\_Dictionary "Collins Dictionary")_ record actual [usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_(language) "Usage (language)") rather than attempting to [prescribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription "Linguistic prescription") it.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-courses.nus.edu.sg-44) In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time; words are freely borrowed from other languages and other varieties of English, and [neologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologisms "Neologisms") are frequent.

### History of standardisation

For historical reasons dating back to the rise of [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") in the ninth century, the form of language spoken in London and the [East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands "East Midlands") became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education in Britain. The standardisation of British English is thought to be from both [dialect levelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_levelling_in_Britain "Dialect levelling in Britain") and a thought of social superiority. Speaking in the Standard dialect created class distinctions; those who did not speak the standard English would be considered of a lesser class or social status and often discounted or considered of a low intelligence.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-courses.nus.edu.sg-44) Another contribution to the standardisation of British English was the introduction of the printing press to England in the mid-15th century. In doing so, William Caxton enabled a common language and spelling to be dispersed among the entirety of England at a much faster rate.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-thehistoryofenglish.com-20)

_[Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel\_Johnson%27s\_A\_Dictionary\_of\_the\_English\_Language "Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language")_ (1755) was a large step in the [English-language spelling reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform "English-language spelling reform"), where the purification of language focused on standardising both speech and spelling.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-45) By the early 20th century, British authors had produced numerous books intended as guides to English grammar and usage, a few of which achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades. These include, most notably of all, Fowler's _[Modern English Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern\_English\_Usage "Modern English Usage")_ and _[The Complete Plain Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Complete\_Plain\_Words "The Complete Plain Words")_ by [Sir Ernest Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Ernest_Gowers "Sir Ernest Gowers").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-46)

Detailed guidance on many aspects of writing British English for publication is included in style guides issued by various publishers including _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_ newspaper, the _[Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_University\_Press "Oxford University Press")_ and the _[Cambridge University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge\_University\_Press "Cambridge University Press")_. _The Oxford University Press_ guidelines were originally drafted as a single broadsheet page by Horace Henry Hart, and were at the time (1893) the first guide of their type in English; they were gradually expanded and eventually published, first as _[Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%27s\_Rules "Hart's Rules")_, and in 2002 as part of _The Oxford Manual of Style_. Comparable in authority and stature to _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ for published [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English"), the Oxford Manual is a fairly exhaustive standard for published British English that writers can turn to in the absence of specific guidance from their publishing house.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-47)

Relationship with Commonwealth English
--------------------------------------

British English is the basis of, and very similar to, [Commonwealth English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations "English in the Commonwealth of Nations").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-48) Commonwealth English is English as spoken and written in the [Commonwealth countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations"), though often with some local variation. This includes English spoken in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English "Australian English"), [Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Malta#English "Languages of Malta"), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English "New Zealand English"), [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_English "Nigerian English"), and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_English "South African English"). It also includes [South Asian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_English "South Asian English") used in South Asia, in English varieties in [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia"), and in parts of Africa. [Canadian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English "Canadian English") is based on British English, but has more influence from [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English"), often [grouped together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English "North American English") due to their close proximity.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-49) British English, for example, is the closest English to Indian English, but Indian English has extra vocabulary and some English words are assigned different meanings.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English#cite_note-50)

An example provided by [Partridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Partridge "Eric Partridge") is: " 'The committee of public safety is to consider the matter', but 'the committee of public safety quarrel regarding their next chairman' ...Thus...singular when...a unit is intended; plural when the idea of plurality is predominant".
