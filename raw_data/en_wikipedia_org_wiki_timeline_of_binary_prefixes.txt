Historically, computers have used many systems of internal data representation, [ 3 ] methods of operating on data elements, and data addressing. Early decimal computers included the ENIAC , UNIVAC 1 , IBM 702 , IBM 705 , IBM 650 , IBM 1400 series , and IBM 1620 . Early binary addressed computers included Zuse Z3 , Colossus , Whirlwind , AN/FSQ-7 , IBM 701 , IBM 704 , IBM 709 , IBM 7030 , IBM 7090 , IBM 7040 , IBM System/360 and DEC PDP series .

Decimal systems typically had memory configured in whole decimal multiples, e.g., blocks of 100 and later 1000 . The unit abbreviation ' K ' or ' k ' if it was used, represented multiplication by 1000 . Binary memory had sizes of powers of two or small multiples thereof. In this context, ' K ' or ' k ' was sometimes used to denote multiples of 1024 units or just the approximate size, e.g., either '64K' or '65K' for 65 536 (2 16 ).

1790s [ edit ] 1793 [ edit ] The French Commission temporaire de Poids & Mesures rêpublicaines , Décrets de la Convention Nationale , proposes the binary prefixes double and demi , denoting a factor of 2 (2 1 ) and 1 ⁄ 2 (2 −1 ), respectively, in 1793.

[ 4 ] 1795 [ edit ] The prefixes double and demi [ 5 ] are part of the original metric system adopted by France (with kilo for 1000) in 1795. These were not retained when the decadic SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.

1870s [ edit ] Metric prefix " mega- " established in 1873.

1930s [ edit ] Metric prefixes " kilo- " (established 1795) and " mega- " (established 1873) are widely used as decimal multipliers 1,000 and 1,000,000 for units of frequency and impedance in the electronics industry.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The Committee of the Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker publishes suggested names and symbols for the metric prefixes with decimal meaning, i.e., giga ( G = 10 9 ) and tera ( T = 10 12 ).

[ 8 ] 1940s [ edit ] 1943–1944 [ edit ] J. W. Tukey coins the word "bit" as an abbreviation of "binary digit".

[ 9 ] 1947 [ edit ] "The Whirlwind I Computer is planned with a storage capacity of 2048 numbers of 16 binary digits each." [ 10 ] 1948 [ edit ] Tukey's "bit" is referenced in the work of information theorist Claude Shannon .

[ 9 ] 1950s [ edit ] In the 1950s, "1 kilo bit" meant 1000 bits: [ 11 ] [ 12 ] "In the '50s, amazingly enough—and only total coincidence—I actually was given the job of writing the operational specifications [...] for what was called cross telling. They handed me this thing and said, 'You're going to define how the hand-over process works between direction centers', [...] and I had no idea what they were talking about. But we had [...] one-kilobit lines connecting the direction centers and I thought, 'Good God!

1000 bits a second. Well, we'll surely be able to figure out something to do with that.

' " — Saverah Warenstein, former programmer at Lincoln Laboratory, IBM [ 11 ] 1952 [ edit ] The first magnetic core memory , from the IBM 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine, is tested successfully in April 1952. (The image shows 10 × 12 cores; presumably one of 8) [ 13 ] "Teaming up with a more experienced engineer, [Mike Haynes] built a core memory with just enough capacity to store all the information in an IBM punched card : 960 bits in an 80 × 12 array. In May 1952 it was successfully tested as a data buffer between a Type 405 alphabetical accounting machine and a Type 517 summary punch . This first functional test of a ferrite core memory was made in the same month that a four-times smaller 16 × 16-bit ferrite core array was successfully tested at MIT." [ 14 ] The IBM 701 , a binary-addressed computer containing 72 Williams tubes of 1024 bits each, is released in April.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Principles of Operation Type 701 [ 17 ] does not use prefixes with lengths of words or size of storage. For example, it specifies that memory tubes hold 2048 words each.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The IBM 737 optional magnetic core storage stores 4096 36-bit words.

[ 20 ] Each plane stored 64 × 64 = 4096 bits.

[ 21 ] 1955 [ edit ] The IBM 704 (a binary machine) manual uses decimal arithmetic for powers of two, without prefixes [ 22 ] "Magnetic core storage units are available with capacities of either 4096 or 32 768 core storage registers; or two magnetic core storage units, each with a capacity of 4096 core storage registers, may be used. Thus, magnetic core storage units are available to give the calculator a capacity of 4096 , 8192 , or 32 768 core storage registers." "Each drum has a storage capacity of 2048 words." 1956 [ edit ] The IBM 702 (a decimally addressed machine)  Preliminary Manual of Information uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes.

[ 23 ] "Electrostatic memory is the principal storage medium within the machine. It consists of cathode ray tubes which can store up to 10 000 characters of information in the form of electrostatic charges ... Additional storage, as required, may be provided through the use of magnetic drum storage units, each having a capacity of 60 000 characters." "A character may be a letter of the alphabet, a decimal number, or any of eleven different punctuation marks or symbols used in report printing." "Each one of the 10 000 positions of memory is numbered from 0000 to 9999 and each stored character must occupy one of these positions." (page 8) The word byte , meaning eight bits, is coined by Dr.

Werner Buchholz in June 1956, during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] IBM 650 RAMAC (a decimal addressed machine) announcement [ 28 ] "The 650 RAMAC combines the IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data Processing Machine with a series of disk memory units which are capable of storing a total of 24-million digits. The 305 RAMAC is an entirely new machine which contains its own input and output devices and processing unit as well as a built-in 5-million-digit disk memory." 1957 [ edit ] The IBM 705 (a decimal addressed machine) Operating manual uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes.

[ 29 ] "A total of 40 000 characters can be stored within the main storage unit of the Type 705." "Each one of the 40 000 positions in memory is numbered from 0000 to 39 999 ."

Werner Buchholz [ 31 ] 1959 [ edit ] The term 32k is used in print to refer to a memory size of 32768 (2 15 ).

"At a 100 kilobit per second information rate, both mark and space signals will generally be transmitted in any 0.0001 sec, interval, and therefore this requirement is easily met with conventional resistors and capacitors."

The 8K core stores were getting fairly common in this country in 1954. The 32K store started mass production in 1956; it is the standard now for large machines and at least 200 machines of the size (or its equivalent in the character addressable machines) are in existence today (and at least 100 were in existence in mid-1959).

[ 33 ] 1955–1961 [ edit ] A search of the Computer History Museum's Stretch collection [ 34 ] of 931 text documents dated from September 1955 through September 1961 shows no usage of 'k' or 'K' to describe main storage size.

In the case of the transmission of business-machine or telemetered data, it is more usual to express the speed in bits or kilobits ( 1000 bits) per second.

{{ cite book }} : ISBN / Date incompatibility ( help ) Quoted in OED as first instance of " kilo bit", though "it is more usual" suggests it is already in common use (see timeline entry for 1957) Described device contains 512 words, 24 bits each (= 12 288 bits) [ 35 ] "It is no longer reasonable to spend as much time to transmit an 80-bit address as 12 kilo bits of message information – a 1500 to 1 ratio ... We have theoretically and experimentally proved that speech can be compressed from the straightforward requirement for 48 kilo bit PCM channel capability to 2400 bits by the application of the Dudley syllabic vocoder." [ 36 ] The IBM 7090 Data Processing System (a binary machine), Additional Core Storage (65 K means 'approximately 65000') [ 37 ] "The Additional Core Storage feature for the IBM 7090 Data Processing System provides a second IBM 7302 Core Storage, increasing the capacity of main storage by 32 768 words. The block of storage represented by both 7302 units is referred to as "main storage unit".

"Additional core storage provides two methods of using main storage: (1) The 65 K mode – the computer program is enabled to address both of the main storage units, and (2) the 32 K mode —the computer program is able to address only one storage unit, so that main storage capacity available to that program is effectively 32,768 words." The IBM 1410 Data Processing System, which used modified decimal addressing, uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes [ 38 ] "Core storage units are available in 10 000 -, 20 000 - or 40 000 -character position capacities." "The matrix switch makes it possible to address any one of the 100 X-drive lines (in a 10 K core array)." "The 40 K core array requires 40 000 valid five-position addresses from 0000 to 39 999 ." "This operation check detects errors in programming that cause invalid addresses. Examples: 40 000 -and-above on a 40 K core array; 20 000 -and-above on a 20 K core array. On a 10 K core array, invalid addresses are detected by the address-bus validity check." 1962 [ edit ] A reference to a "4 k IBM 1401" meant 4000 characters of storage (memory).

[ 39 ] 1963 [ edit ] Ludwig uses kilo bit in the decimal sense [ 40 ] DEC Serial Drum Type 24 [ 41 ] "Drums are equipped to store either 64, 128, or 256 data blocks, providing a memory capability of 16384, 32768, or 65536 computer words" (no abbreviations) Honeywell 200 Summary Description [ 42 ] "The main memory is a magnetic core ... The memory unit supplied as part of the basic central processor has a capacity of 2048 characters, each of which is stored in a separate, addressable, memory location. This capacity may be expanded in modular increments by adding one 2048 -character module and additional 4,096-character modules." "Random access disc file and control (disc capacities of up to 100 million characters are available.)" "Up to eight drum storage units can be connected to the Model 270 Random Access Drum Control. Each drum provides storage for 2 621 441 characters, allowing a total capacity of approximately 21 million characters." 1964 [ edit ] Gene Amdahl's seminal April 1964 article on IBM System/360 used 1 K to mean 1024.

The Teleregister Telefile data processor includes drum storage whose capacity is far in excess of the requirements for sorting. ... The Telefile data processor provides 16,000 positions in memory, each position storing one binary coded decimal character. A floating accumulator arrangement allows the accumulator to contain any field in memory from 1 to 100 characters in length. All indexing is accomplished programmatically. Input and output tape blocking is fixed at 300 characters per block.

[ 47 ] "One method of designing a slave memory for instructions is as follows. Suppose that the main memory has 64 K words (where K = 1024 ) and, therefore, 16 address bits, and that the slave memory has 32 words and, therefore, 5 address bits." [ 48 ] IBM 1620 CPU Model 1 (a decimal machine) System Reference Library, dated 19 July 1965, states: "A core storage module, which is 20 000 addressable positions of magnetic core storage, is located in the 1620. Two additional modules are available ... Each core storage module ( 20 000 positions) is made up of 12 core planes as shown in Figure 3. Each core plane contains all cores for a specific bit value." 1966 [ edit ] U.S. patent 3,435,420 CONTIGUOUS BULK STORAGE ADDRESSING is filed on 3 January 1966 "Note that ' K ' as used herein indicates 'thousands'. Each storage location in the present embodiment includes 64 data bits and 8 related parity bits, as described herein." "Thus, if only storage unit 1A were provided, it would contain addresses 0 through 32K; storage IB would include addresses between 32K and 64K, storage 2A would contain addresses between 64K and 96K, ...".

1968 [ edit ] A Univac 9400 disc based computer system ..." can have 2–8 8411 drives for 14.5–58 mega bytes capacity. The 8411 has a transfer rate of 156K bytes per second." - using megabytes in a decimal sense [ 49 ] Donald Morrison proposes to use the Greek letter kappa (" κ ") to denote 1024 bytes, " κ 2 " to denote 1024 × 1024, and so on.

[ 50 ] (At the time, memory size was small, and only 'K' was in widespread use.) Wallace Givens responded with a proposal to use " bK " as an abbreviation for 1024 and " bK2 " or " bK 2 " for 1024 × 1024, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter "b" would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.

[ 51 ] Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used to indicate a base-2 exponent in binary scientific notation , similar to E in decimal scientific notation , to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3 × 2 20 [ 52 ] 1969 [ edit ] IBM 1401 (a decimal machine) Simulator for IBM OS/360 [ 53 ] "1401 features supported are advanced programming, sense switches, tapes, multiply, divide, 16K core, and all standard instructions except Select Stacker."

If tape simulation is not required, this core requirement may be reduced to 50K with the removal of the tape Buffer area." U.S. patent 3,638,185 HIGH DENSITY PERMANENT DATA STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM is filed on March 17, 1969, earliest Google Patent search containing "kilobyte".

"The data word processor 606 handles the inflow and out-flow of byte-oriented input/output data and interleaved signals at a rate of, for example, 500 kilobytes per second. Instruction processing rates of four to eight per microsecond are required for such a data flow." U.S. patent 3,618,041 Memory Control System is filed on October 29, 1969 "FIG. 2a shows a practical example of an operand address which consists of, for example 24 bits. It is assumed herein that each block includes 32 bytes, each sector includes 1 kilobyte, the buffer memory 116 includes 4 kilobytes, and read data is represented by one double word or 64 bits, as one word in this case consists of 32 bits."

Also, random access devices are advantageous over serial access devices for backing store applications only when the memory capacity is less than 1 Mbyte . For capacities of 4 Mbyte and 16 Mbyte serial access stores with shift register lengths of 256-bit and 1024-bit, respectively, look favorable.

[ 68 ] The first 5 1 ⁄ 4 inch floppy disk drive, the Shugart SA 400, is introduced in August 1976. The drive had 35 tracks and was single sided. The data sheet gives the unformatted capacity as 3125 bytes per track for a total of 109.4 K bytes ( 3125 × 35 = 109 375 ). When formatted with 256 byte sectors and 10 sectors per track the capacity is 89.6 K bytes (256 × 10 × 35 = 89 600 ).

The industry, in 1977, is segmented into nine segments ranging from "Disk Cartridge Drives, up to 12 M B" to "Fixed Disk Drives, over 200 M B."  While the categories changed during the next 22 years of publication, Disk/Trend, the principal marketing study of the hard disk drive industry always and consistently categorized the industry in segments using prefixes M and later G in the decimal sense.

[ citation needed ] 1995 [ edit ] August: The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 's Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols proposed new prefixes kibi (from kilobinary), mebi , gibi , and tebi for powers of 1024; using the symbols kb , Mb , Gb , and Tb respectively (e.g. giving kb B for kibi byte).

[ 103 ] 1996 [ edit ] FOLDOC defines the exa byte (1 E B) as 1024 peta bytes (1024 P B), with peta byte used in the binary sense of 1024 5 B.

[ 104 ] Markus Kuhn proposes a system with di prefixes, like the " dikilo byte" ( K 2 B) and " digiga byte" ( G 2 B).

[ 105 ] It did not see significant adoption.

1997 [ edit ] January: Bruce Barrow endorses the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 's proposal for prefixes kibi , mebi , gibi , and tebi in "A Lesson in Megabytes" in IEEE Standards Bearer, [ 106 ] [ 107 ] but instead using the symbols Ki , Mi , Gi , and Ti .

IEEE requires prefixes to take the standard SI meaning (e.g., mega always to mean 1000 2 ). Exceptions for binary meaning ( mega to mean 1024 2 ) are permitted as an interim measure (where pointed out on a case-by-case basis) until a binary prefix could be standardised.

[ 108 ] FOLDOC defines the zetta byte (1 Z B) as 1024 exa bytes (1024 E B) [ 109 ] and the yotta byte (1 Y B) as 1024 zetta bytes (1024 Z B).

[ 110 ] 1998 [ edit ] December: IEC establishes unambiguous prefixes for binary multiples ( Ki B, Mi B, Gi B, Ti B, Pi B and Ei B), reserving k B, M B, G B and so on for their decimal sense. Formally published in January 1999.

[ 111 ] 1999 [ edit ] Donald Knuth , who uses decimal notation like 1 M B = 1000 k B, [ 112 ] expresses "astonishment" that the proposal was adopted by the IEC, calling them "funny-sounding", and proposes that the powers of 1024 be designated as "large kilobytes" and "large megabytes" (abbreviated KK B and MM B, as "doubling the letter connotes both binary-ness and large-ness").

[ 113 ] Double prefixes were formerly used in the metric system, however, with a multiplicative meaning (" MM B" would be equivalent to " T B"), and this proposed usage never gained any traction.

In their November 1999 paper, [ 114 ] Steven W. Schlosser, John Linwood Griffin, David F. Nagle and Gregory R. Ganger adopt the symbol Gi B for gibi byte and quote data throughput in mebi bytes per second "... Although these numbers appear to yield a capacity of 2.98 Gi B per sled, the capacity decreases ... This yields an effective capacity of about 2.098 Gi B per sled. ..." "maximum throughput ( Mi B/s )" The IEEE 802.11-1999 standard introduces the time unit TU defined as 1024 μs.

Peuhkuri adopts IEC prefixes in his paper at the 2001 Internet Measurement Conference: "... allows maximum size of 224 that requires 1 GiB of RAM ... or acknowledgement numer [sic] is within 32 KiB range. ... on a PC with Celeron processor with 512 MiB of memory ..." [ 116 ] The Linux kernel uses IEC prefixes.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] 2002 [ edit ] Marcus Kuhn introduces the term kibi hertz to mean 1024 Hz.

[ 119 ] "Most embedded clocks (state of the art is still a calibrated 32 kibi hertz crystal) have a frequency error of at least 10 −5 (10 ppm), and therefore drift away from the TAI rate faster than 1 second per week." Mackenzie et al 2002 : use tebi byte ( Ti B), pebi byte ( Pi B), exbi byte ( Ei B) use the symbols Zi B, Yi B, accompanied by notes explaining that these are "a GNU extension to IEC 60027-2" JEDEC publishes the standard JESD100B.01 , which lists the prefixes K , M and G qualified "as a prefix to units of semiconductor storage capacity", in "contrast with the SI prefix mega ( M ) equal to 10 6 , as in a 1- M b/s data transfer rate, which is equal to 1 000 000 bits per second."  A table lists the binary prefixes kibi Ki (2 10 ) 1 , mebi Mi (2 10 ) 2 , gibi Gi (2 10 ) 3 , tebi Ti (2 10 ) 4 and the decimal prefixes kilo (10 3 ) 1 , mega (10 3 ) 2 , giga (10 3 ) 3 , tera (10 3 ) 4 .

Chris Hurley refers to 1.024 milliseconds as a " kilo micro second", mixing binary use of the prefix " kilo " with the conventional decimal prefix micro .

[ 123 ] Thomas Maufer draws an equivalence between the " kilo - micro second" and "Time Unit" (TU) that was introduced by the IEEE 802.11-1999 standard.

[ 115 ] 2005 [ edit ] IEC extends binary prefixes to include zebi (Zi) and yobi (Yi) [ 124 ] IEC prefixes are adopted by the IEEE after a two-year trial period.

On March 19, 2005, the IEEE standard IEEE 1541 -2002 (Prefixes for Binary Multiples) was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association after a two-year trial period.

[ 125 ] 2006 [ edit ] The BIPM publishes the 8th SI Brochure including the note [ 126 ] "These SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 [...]. The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers [...]. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the incorrect usage of the SI prefixes." In addition to the k and m decimal as well as the K and M binary prefixes, 4DOS 7.50 .141 (2006-12-24) adds support for g and G as decimal respective binary prefixes in variable functions and size range parameters.

[ 97 ] 2007 [ edit ] Windows Vista still uses the binary conventions (e.g., 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1048576 bytes) for file and drive sizes, and for data rates [ 127 ] GParted uses IEC prefixes for partition sizes Advanced Packaging Tool and Synaptic Package Manager use standard SI prefixes for file sizes IBM uses "exabyte" to mean 1024 6 bytes.

[ 128 ] "Each address space, called a 64-bit address space, is 16 exabytes (EB) in size; an exabyte is slightly more than one billion gigabytes. The new address space has logically 2 64 addresses. It is 8 billion times the size of the former 2-gigabyte address space, or 18,446,744,073,709,600,000 bytes." Edward Michael McDonald III uses the terms zebibyte, yobibyte to mean 2 70 and 2 80 bytes, respectively, pointing out the need to distinguish between decimal and binary prefixes when dealing with the storage capacity of high performance computers.

[ 129 ] 2008 [ edit ] The US National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines prohibit use of SI prefixes k, M, ... in the binary sense, and suggest IEC prefixes Ki, Mi ... for binary multiples [ 130 ] p. 29, "The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2 10 , 2 20 , 2 30 , 2 40 , 2 50 , and 2 60 are, respectively: kibi , Ki ; mebi , Mi ; gibi , Gi ; tebi , Ti ; pebi , Pi ; and exbi , Ei . Thus, for example, one kibi byte is also written as 1 Ki B = 2 10 B = 1024 B, where B denotes the unit byte . Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the non-standard usage of the SI prefixes." The binary prefixes are defined in IEC Standard IEC 80000-13 , formally incorporating them into the ISO/IEC series of standards of quantities and units .

IBM WebSphere describes data transfer using unambiguous IEC prefixes [ 131 ] "Current file. The name of the file currently being transferred. The part of the individual file that has already been transferred is displayed in B, Ki B, Mi B, Gi B, or Ti B along with total size of the file in parentheses. The unit of measurement displayed depends on the size of the file. B is bytes per second.

Ki B/s is kibibytes per second, where 1 kibi byte equals 1024 bytes.

Mi B/s is mebi bytes per second, where 1 mebi byte equals 1 048 576 bytes.

Gi B/s is gibi bytes per second where 1 gibi byte equals 1 073 741 824 bytes.

Ti B/s is tebi bytes per second where 1 tebi byte equals 1 099 511 627 776 bytes." "The rate the file is being transferred in Ki B/s ( kibi bytes per second, where 1 kibi byte equals 1024 bytes.)" 2009 [ edit ] Apple Inc.

uses the SI decimal definitions for capacity (e.g., 1 kilobyte = 1000 bytes) in the Mac OS X v10.6 operating system to conform with standards body recommendations and avoid conflict with hard drive manufacturers' specifications.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Frank Löffler and co-workers report disk size and computer memory in tebibytes.

[ 134 ] "For the largest simulations using 2048 cores this sums up to about 650 GiB per complete checkpoint and about 6.4 TiB in total (for 10 checkpoints)." the SourceForge web site [ 135 ] "For example, in 2009, the SourceForge web site reported file sizes using binary prefixes for several months before changing back to SI prefixes but switching the file sizes to powers of ten." The binary prefixes, as defined by IEC 80000-13, are incorporated into ISO 80000-1 , including a note that "SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2." [ 136 ] In ISO 80000-1, the application of the binary prefixes is not limited to computer technology. For example, 1 KiHz = 1024 Hz.

2010s [ edit ] 2010 [ edit ] The Ubuntu operating system uses the SI prefixes for base-10 numbers and IEC prefixes for base-2 numbers as of the 10.10 release.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] Baba Arimilli and co-workers use the pebibyte (PiB) for computer memory and disk storage and exbibyte (EiB) for archival storage [ 139 ] "Blue Waters will comprise more than 300.000 POWER7 cores, more than 1 PiB memory, more than 10 PiB disk storage, more than 0.5 EiB archival storage, and achieve around 10 PF/s peak performance." HP publishes a leaflet explaining use of SI and binary prefixes "To reduce confusion, vendors are pursuing one of two remedies: they are changing SI prefixes to the new binary prefixes, or they are recalculating the numbers as powers of ten." [ 135 ] "For disk and file capacities, the latter remedy is more popular because it is much easier to recognize that 300 GB is the same as 300,000 MB than to recognize that 279.4 GiB is the same as 286,102 MiB." "For memory capacities, binary prefixes are more natural. For example, reporting a Smart Array controller cache size of 512 MiB is preferable to reporting it as 536.9 MB." "HP is considering modifying its storage utilities to report disk capacity with correct decimal and binary values side-by-side (for example, '300 GB (279.4 GiB)'), and report cache sizes with binary prefixes ('1 GiB')." 2011 [ edit ] The GNU operating system uses the SI prefixes for base-10 numbers and IEC prefixes for base-2 numbers as of the parted-2.4 release (May 2011).

"specifying partition start or end values using MiB, GiB, etc. suffixes now makes parted do what I want, i.e., use that precise value, and not some other that is up to 500KiB or 500MiB away from what I specified. Before, to get that behavior, you would have had to use carefully chosen values with units of bytes ('B') or sectors ('s') to obtain the same result, and with sectors, your usage would not be portable between devices with varying sector sizes. This change does not affect how parted handles suffixes like KB, MB, GB, etc." [ 140 ] "Note that as of parted-2.4, when you specify start and/or end values using IEC binary units like 'MiB', 'GiB', 'TiB', etc., parted treats those values as exact, and equivalent to the same number specified in bytes (i.e., with the 'B' suffix), in that it provides no 'helpful' range of sloppiness. Contrast that with a partition start request of '4GB', which may actually resolve to some sector up to 500MB before or after that point. Thus, when creating a partition, you should prefer to specify units of bytes ('B'), sectors ('s'), or IEC binary units like 'MiB', but not 'MB', 'GB', etc." [ 141 ] On its Archive Project Request Form, the University of Oxford uses IEC prefixes: "The initial amount of data to be archived (MiB GiB TiB )" The IBM Style Guide permits IEC prefixes or "SI prefixes" if used consistently and explained to the user [ 142 ] "Whether you choose to use IEC prefixes for powers of 2 and SI prefixes for powers of 10, or use SI prefixes for a dual purpose ... be consistent in your usage and explain to the user your adopted system." 2012 [ edit ] June: Toshiba describes data transfer rates in units of MiB/s.

[ 143 ] In the same press release, SSD storage capacity is given in decimal gigabytes, accompanied by the footnote "One Gigabyte (GB) means 10 9 = 1,000,000,000 bytes using powers of 10. A computer operating system, however, reports storage capacity using powers of 2 for the definition of 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes and therefore shows less storage capacity" July: Ola BRUSET and Tor Øyvind VEDAL are granted a patent citing the binary unit KiHz to mean 1024 hertz [ 144 ] The Minnesota Supercomputing Institute of the University of Minnesota uses IEC prefixes to describe its supercomputing facilities [ 145 ] "Itasca is an HP Linux cluster with 1,091 HP ProLiant BL280c G6 blade servers, each with two quad-core 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon X5560 'Nehalem EP' processors sharing 24 GiB of system memory, with a 40-gigabit QDR InfiniBand (IB) interconnect. In total, Itasca consists of 8,728 compute cores and 24 TiB of main memory." "Cascade consists of a Dell R710 head/login node, 48 GiB of memory; eight Dell compute nodes, each with dual X5675 six-core 3.06 GHz processors and 96 GiB of main memory; and 32 Nvidia M2070 GPGPUs. A compute node is connected to four GPGPUs, each of which has 448 3.13 GHz cores and 5 GiB of memory. Each GPU is capable of 1.2 single-precision TFLOPS and 0.5 double-precision TFLOPs." Phidgets Inc describes PhidgetSBC3 as a "Single board computer running Debian 7.0 with 128 MiB DDR2 SDRAM, 1 GiB Flash, integrated 1018 and 6 USB 2.0 High Speed 480Mbits/s ports".

IBM's Customer Information Center uses IEC prefixes to disambiguate [ 146 ] "To reduce the possibility of confusion, this information center represents data storage using both decimal and binary units. Data storage values are displayed using the following format:#### decimal unit (binary unit). By this example, the value 512 terabytes is displayed as: 512 TB (465.6 TiB)" 2013 [ edit ] February: Toshiba distinguishes unambiguously between decimal and binary prefixes by means of footnotes. Hybrid drives MQ01ABD100H and MQ01ABD075H are described as having a buffer size of 32 Mi B.

[ 147 ] "1 M B (megabytes) = 1 000 000 bytes, 1 G B ( giga bytes) = 1 000 000 000 bytes, 1 T B ( tera bytes) = 1 000 000 000 000 bytes" " Ki B ( kebi bytes [ sic ]) = 1024 (2 10 bytes), Mi B ( mebi bytes) = 1 048 576 (2 20 ) bytes, Gi B (gibibytes) = 1 073 741 824 (2 30 ) bytes".

March: Kevin Klughart uses the zebi byte ( Zi B) and yobi byte ( Yi B) as units for maximum volume size [ 148 ] PRACE Best Practice Guide uses IEC prefixes for net capacity (300 Ti B) and throughput (2 Gi B/s).

[ 149 ] Nicla Andersson, of Sweden's National Supercomputer Centre, Sweden, refers to the NSC's Triolith as having "42.75 Ti B memory" and "75 Ti B/s aggregate memory BW" and to a 2018 DARPA target of "32–64 Pi B memory" [ 150 ] August: Mitsuo Yokokawa, of Kobe University , describes the Japanese K Computer as having "1.27 (1.34) PiB" of memory.

[ 151 ] The official file server of the University of Stuttgart reports file sizes in gibi bytes ( Gi B) and tebi bytes ( Ti B).

[ 152 ] In their book IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 with R3.0 , Coyne et al. use IEC prefixes to distinguish them from decimal prefixes.

[ 153 ] Examples are "Larger, 1.1 G B (1 Gi B) internal buffer on Model E06/EU6, 536.9 M B (512 Mi B) for Model E05, 134.2 M B (128 Mi B) for Model J1A" "Up to 160 Mi bit/sec. native data rate for the Models E06 and EU6, four times faster than the model J1A at 40 Mi bit/sec. (Up to 100 Mi bit/sec. for the Model E05)" Maple 17 uses Mi B and Gi B as units of memory usage.

November: The online computer dictionary FOLDOC defines the kilo byte as one thousand (1000) bytes, the mega byte as one million (1000 2 ) bytes, and the giga byte as one billion (1000 3 ) bytes.

[ 154 ] 2014 [ edit ] February: Rahul Bali writes [ 155 ] "the [Sequia (IBM)] contains in total 1,572,864 processor cores with 1.5 PiB memory" "The total CPU plus coprocessor memory [of the Tianhe-2 (NUDT)] is 1,375 TiB." CDBurnerXP states disc sizes in mebibytes (MiB) and gibibytes (GiB), clarifying that "in Windows, if you see GB or MB it usually refers to GiB or MiB respectively".

September: HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage best practices guide uses binary prefixes for storage and decimal prefixes for speed.

[ 156 ] 2017 [ edit ] K Liao and co-authors approximate the year as 30 mebiseconds (30 Mis) [ 157 ] 2019 [ edit ] The BIPM publishes the 9th SI brochure, confirming the position from its 8th brochure (published in 2006), with the note [ 158 ] "The SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 [...]" 2020s [ edit ] 2020 [ edit ] A Californian court finds that, as the NIST specifies that prefixes such as " G " are decimal rather than binary, and that California law specifies that the NIST definitions of measure "shall govern ... transactions in this state", and because the vendor of a 64 G B flash drive with 64 billion bytes indicated on the packaging of the drive that 1 G B = 1 000 000 000 bytes, they did not deceive consumers into believing that the drive had 64 × 1024 × 1024 × 1024 bytes.

[ 159 ] 2021 [ edit ] Ainslie, Halvorsen and Robinson point out the parallel with the confusion between a one-third octave and a one-tenth decade in acoustics.

[ 160 ] "The near coincidence between ten octaves and three decades (2 10 ≈ 10 3 ) is identical to the one that causes confusion in the computer industry by use of the term ' kilo byte' to mean 1024 B ... when the internationally accepted use of the prefix kilo requires it to mean 1000 B." 2022 [ edit ] February: IEEE 1541 is amended to include the prefixes zebi and yobi .

[ 161 ] November: The additional decimal prefixes ronna for 1000 9 and quetta for 1000 10 are adopted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).

[ 162 ] [ 163 ] Binary counterparts to ronna and quetta were suggested in a consultation paper of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU) for the International Committee for Weights and Measures as robi ( Ri , 1024 9 ) and quebi ( Qi , 1024 10 ).

[ 164 ] [ 165 ] 2025 [ edit ] February: IEC 80000-13:2025 [ 166 ] revises the previous edition of this standard with the addition of new prefixes robi (symbol Ri ) and quebi ( Qi ) for binary multiples.

[...] Most important, from the point of view of editing, will be the ability to handle any characters or digits, from 1 to 6 bits long [...] the Shift Matrix to be used to convert a 60-bit word , coming from Memory in parallel, into characters , or " bytes " as we have called them, to be sent to the Adder serially. The 60 bits are dumped into magnetic cores on six different levels. Thus, if a 1 comes out of position 9, it appears in all six cores underneath. [...] The Adder may accept all or only some of the bits. [...] Assume that it is desired to operate on 4-bit decimal digits , starting at the right. The 0-diagonal is pulsed first, sending out the six bits 0 to 5, of which the Adder accepts only the first four (0–3). Bits 4 and 5 are ignored. Next, the 4 diagonal is pulsed. This sends out bits 4 to 9, of which the last two are again ignored, and so on. [...] It is just as easy to use all six bits in alphanumeric work, or to handle bytes of only one bit for logical analysis, or to offset the bytes by any number of bits. [...] ^ Buchholz, Werner (February 1977).

[...] The first reference found in the files was contained in an internal memo written in June 1956 during the early days of developing Stretch . A byte was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input–output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8-bit bytes was considered in August 1956 and incorporated in the design of Stretch shortly thereafter. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper "Processing Data in Bits and Pieces" by G A Blaauw , F P Brooks Jr and W Buchholz in the IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers , June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch) , edited by W Buchholz, McGraw-Hill Book Company (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows: Byte denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input–output units. A term other than character is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input–output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from bite , but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to bit .) System/360 took over many of the Stretch concepts, including the basic byte and word sizes, which are powers of 2. For economy, however, the byte size was fixed at the 8-bit maximum, and addressing at the bit level was replaced by byte addressing.
