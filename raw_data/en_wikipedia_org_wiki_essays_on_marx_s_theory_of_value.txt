Очерки по теории стоимости Маркса , the Russian language edition was first published in 1923. For many years, it was thought that there had only been three editions published in the Soviet Union until a copy of the fourth edition, 1929/1930, was discovered in the papers of Ichiro Nakayama deposited at the library of Hitotsubashi University . It is estimated that 10,000 copies were printed.

[ 1 ] The sole change in the fourth edition is an inclusion of "Replies to critics" which responds to criticism by S. Bessonov.

[ 1 ] The English translation was made by Miloš Samardžija and Fredy Perlman of the third edition in 1967, translating the book first into Serbo-Croatian . Samardžija travelled to the Soviet Union and requested access to a copy of the book at the V. I. Lenin State Library of the USSR was escorted off the premises empty handed. However, Perlman was able to locate a copy in the Library of Congress .

[ 2 ] Their translation was published by Black & Red, a publishing house that Perlman had set up in Detroit in 1971.

[ 2 ] In 1973, Black & Red planned to produce a reprint; Fredy Perlman's widow, Lorraine Perlman, was to describe the conflict which was to arise out of their attempt to collaborate with Black Rose press of Montreal.

[ 2 ] In the end Black & Red produced a reprint, and Black Rose also produced an edition.
