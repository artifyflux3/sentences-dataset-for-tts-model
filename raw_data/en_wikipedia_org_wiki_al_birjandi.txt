Astronomy [ edit ] Al-Birjandi was a pupil for Mansur ibn Muin al-Din al-Kashi, a member at the Samarkand Observatory, otherwise known as The Ulugh Beg Observatory .

[ 1 ] In discussing the structure of the cosmos, al-Birjandi continued Ali al-Qushji 's debate on the Earth's rotation .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In his analysis of what might occur if the Earth were moving, he develops a hypothesis similar to Galileo Galilei 's notion of "circular inertia ", [ 5 ] which he described in the following observational test (as a response to one of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi 's arguments): The small or large rock will fall to the Earth along the path of a line that is perpendicular to the plane ( sath ) of the horizon; this is witnessed by experience ( tajriba ). And this perpendicular is away from the tangent point of the Earth's sphere and the plane of the perceived ( hissi ) horizon. This point moves with the motion of the Earth and thus there will be no difference in place of fall of the two rocks.

[ 6 ] Works [ edit ] Al-Birjandi wrote some more than 13 books and treatises, including: [ 7 ] Sharh al-tadhkirah, a commentary on Tadhkira, al-Tusi 's memoir. This work provides explanations for the reader, and provides alternative views while assessing the viewpoints of predecessors, which is consistent with the Islamicate commentary tradition.

[ 8 ] The text, in some copies of the manuscript from 17th century, is written throughout in black and red ink with diagrams illustrating many of the astronomical elements discussed.

[ 9 ] The 11th chapter of the book was translated to Sanskrit in 1729 at Jaipur by Nayanasukhopadhyaya . The 11th chapter specifically talks about the Tusi Couple , mainly when applying those concepts to lunar theory.

[ 1 ] Birjandi objects the applications of celestial spheres resting between two points of motion. When talking about curvilinear or spherical concepts of the Tusi Couple, it makes a slight longitudinal inclination.

[ 1 ] A Persian, Muhammad Abida dictated it to Nayanasukha, allowing him to compose it in Sanskrit. Kusuba and Pingree present an edition of the Sanskrit, and in a separate section, an English translation facing the Arabic original. That chapter has attracted attention among European scholars since the late 19th century.

ISBN 978-90-04-12475-2 was published in 2001 by Brill Academic Publishers .

Sharh-i Bist Bab dar Ma'rifat-i A'mal-i al-Asturlab (Commentary on "Twenty Chapters Dealing with the Uses of the Astrolabe" of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi; Persian.

[ 11 ] Risalah fi Alat al-Rasad (Epistle on observational instruments); in Arabic.

Tadhkirat al-Ahbab fi Bayan al-Tahabub (Memoir of friends: concerning the explanation of friendship [of numbers]); in Arabic.

Birjandi contributed to many different fields besides his commentaries. His works included studies of ephemerides , instruments for astronomical observations, and cosmology. He also worked in determining the size and distance of planets that have been associated to Habib Allah.

[ 1 ] He also had works in the field of theology and made a series of almanacs in 1478/1479.
