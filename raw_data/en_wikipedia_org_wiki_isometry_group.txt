[ 1 ] Its identity element is the identity function .

[ 2 ] The elements of the isometry group are sometimes called motions of the space.

Every isometry group of a metric space is a subgroup of isometries. It represents in most cases a possible set of symmetries of objects/figures in the space, or functions defined on the space. See symmetry group .

A discrete isometry group is an isometry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries is a discrete set .

In pseudo-Euclidean space the metric is replaced with an isotropic quadratic form ; transformations preserving this form are sometimes called "isometries", and the collection of them is then said to form an isometry group of the pseudo-Euclidean space.

Examples [ edit ] The isometry group of the subspace of a metric space consisting of the points of a scalene triangle is the trivial group . A similar space for an isosceles triangle is the cyclic group of order two, C 2 . A similar space for an equilateral triangle is D 3 , the dihedral group of order 6 .

The isometry group of a two-dimensional sphere is the orthogonal group O(3).

[ 3 ] The isometry group of the n -dimensional Euclidean space is the Euclidean group E( n ).

[ 4 ] The isometry group of the Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane is the projective special unitary group PSU(1,1) .

The isometry group of the Poincaré half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane is PSL(2,R) .

The isometry group of Minkowski space is the Poincaré group .

[ 5 ] Riemannian symmetric spaces are important cases where the isometry group is a Lie group .
