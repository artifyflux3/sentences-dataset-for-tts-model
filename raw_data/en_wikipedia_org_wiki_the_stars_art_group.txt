It was founded by Ma Desheng and Huang Rui and included Wang Keping (王克平), Qu Leilei , Ah Cheng , Ai Weiwei , and Li Shuang as the only female member. A historically significant exhibition, now called the Star Art Exhibition , took place in late 1979 in Beihai Park , Beijing ,  outside the China Art Gallery .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] After the exhibition was closed by officials, the group staged a protest for cultural openness. They succeeded in reopening the exhibition.

[ 4 ] The exhibition took place between 23 November and 2 December, in which around 200,000 people attended the event.

[ 4 ] The group organized another exhibition the next year.

[ 4 ] Around and after 1983, the group disbanded, partly due to their members going into exile under political pressure, especially the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign of 1983.

[ 5 ] The Stars Art Group was a foundational movement of the contemporary Chinese avant-garde active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mostly self-trained, the Stars championed individualism and freedom of expression both in their work and public activities. Taking personal experience and social issues as their subject matter, they pointedly diverged from state-sanctioned Socialist Realism . The group's  member artists also included affiliates Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Wei, [ 6 ] Yan Li, Yang Yiping, Qu Leilei , Mao Lizi, Bo Yun, Zhong Ahcheng, Shao Fei, [ 7 ] and Ma Desheng.

[ 8 ] Arrest of Li Shuang [ edit ] Because of her radical movement in art and politics, and her relationship with a French diplomat, Emmanuel Bellefroid, Li Shuang was arrested by the government and received a two-year sentence.

[ 9 ] This led to a political tension between China and France at the time. Later an agreement was made between two countries and Li was released. This incident abolished the banned interracial marriage in China.
