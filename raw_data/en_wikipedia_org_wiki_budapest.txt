400 Area 473.3 ha Budapest [ a ] is the capital , most populous city , and one of the twenty counties of Hungary . It is Hungary's primate city with 1.7 million inhabitants and its greater metro area has a population of about 3.3 million, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] representing one-third of the country's population and producing above 40% of the country's economic output . Budapest is the political , economic , and cultural center of the country, among the ten largest cities in the European Union and the second largest urban area in Central and Eastern Europe . Budapest stands on the River Danube and is strategically located at the center of the Pannonian Basin , lying on ancient trade routes linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain .

Budapest is a global city , consistently ranked among the 50 most important cities in the world, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] belongs to the narrow group of cities with a GDP over US$100 billion , [ 21 ] named a global cultural capital as having high-quality human capital, [ 22 ] and is among the 35 most liveable cities in the world .

[ 23 ] The city is home to over 30 universities with more than 150,000 students , most of them attending large public research universities that are highly ranked worldwide in their fields, such as Eötvös Loránd University in natural sciences , [ 24 ] Budapest University of Technology in engineering and technology , [ 25 ] MATE in life sciences , [ 26 ] and Semmelweis University in medicine .

[ 27 ] Budapest also hosts various international organizations, including several UN agencies , [ 28 ] the WHO Budapest Centre , [ 29 ] IOM regional centre , [ 30 ] the EU headquarters of EIT and CEPOL , [ 31 ] [ 32 ] as well as the first foreign office of China Investment Agency .

[ 33 ] Budapest opened the first underground transit line on the European continent in 1896, [ 34 ] which is still in use as M1 Millennium Underground , and today the fixed-track metro and tram network forms the backbone of Budapest's public transport system and transports 2.2 million people daily, [ 35 ] making it a significant urban transit system .

The history of Budapest began with an early Celtic settlement transformed by the Romans into the town of Aquincum , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] capital of Lower Pannonia in the 1st century.

[ 36 ] Following the foundation of Hungary in the late 9th century, [ 38 ] the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241.

[ 39 ] It became royal seat in 1361, [ 39 ] with Buda becoming one of the European centers of renaissance culture by the 15th century under Matthias Corvinus .

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The siege of Buda in 1541 was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule, [ 43 ] and after the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda , Pest and Óbuda in 1873.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] By this time, Budapest had become the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , [ 46 ] a great power that dissolved in 1918 following World War I . The city was also the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 , Battle of Budapest in 1945, and Hungarian Revolution of 1956 .

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] The historic center of Budapest along the Danube is classified as a World Heritage Site due to its numerous notable monuments of classical architecture , from the 13th-century Matthias Church [ 49 ] to 19th-century landmarks such as Hungarian Parliament , State Opera House , the Museum of Fine Arts and St. Stephen's Basilica .

[ 50 ] Budapest has been a popular spa destination since Roman times and is considered the spa capital of Europe, [ 51 ] with more than 100 medicinal geothermal springs and the largest thermal water cave system.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] The city is home to the second-largest synagogue and third-largest parliament building in the world, [ 54 ] over 40 museums and galleries , [ 55 ] nearly ten Michelin-starred restaurants , and named among the 50 best food cities globally for its focus on distinctive Hungarian cuisine .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Budapest is also renowned for its nightlife, with ruin bars playing a significant role in it, [ 58 ] moreover the city has become a center for Hollywood film production in recent years.

[ 59 ] Budapest regularly hosts major global sporting events , with the practically 70,000-seat Puskás Aréna serving as one of the venues, which hosted most recently the 2023 UEFA Europa League final , 2020 UEFA Super Cup , will host 2026 UEFA Champions League final and city hosted the 2023 World Athletics Championships , 2017 and 2022 World Aquatics Championships . Budapest attracted 6 million international overnight visitors in 2024, making it one of the most popular destinations in Europe.

[ 60 ] Etymology and pronunciation [ edit ] The previously separate cities of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were officially unified in 1873 [ 61 ] and given the new name Budapest . Before this, the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as "Pest-Buda".

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Pest is often used pars pro toto for the entire city in contemporary colloquial Hungarian, [ 62 ] although it is also used to refer to all parts of the city east of the Danube. Conversely, Buda colloquially means all districts to the Danube's west—including the former Óbuda. The Danube islands—including Csepel , the city's XXI. district—are part of neither Buda nor Pest.

All varieties of English pronounce the -s- as in the English word pest . The -u in Buda- is pronounced either /u/ like food (as in US : / ˈ b uː d ə p ɛ s t / [ 64 ] ) or /ju/ like cue (as in UK : / ˌ b ( j ) uː d ə ˈ p ɛ s t , ˌ b ʊ d -, ˈ b ( j ) uː d ə p ɛ s t , ˈ b ʊ d -/ ). In Hungarian, the -s- is pronounced /ʃ/ as in wash ; in IPA: Hungarian: [ˈbudɒpɛʃt] ⓘ .

The origins of the names "Buda" and "Pest" are obscure. Buda was probably the name of the first constable of the fortress built on the Castle Hill in the 11th century [ 65 ] or a derivative of Bod or Bud , a personal name of Turkic origin, meaning 'twig'.

[ 66 ] or a Slavic personal name, Buda , the short form of Budimír , Budivoj .

[ 67 ] Linguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода ( voda , water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word buta ~ buda 'branch, twig'.

[ 68 ] According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages , "Buda" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda , brother of Hunnic ruler Attila .

Attila went in the city of Sicambria in Pannonia, where he killed Buda , his brother, and he threw his corpse into the Danube . For while Attila was in the west, his brother crossed the boundaries in his reign, because he named Sicambria after his own name Buda's Castle. And though King Attila forbade the Huns and the other peoples to call that city Buda's Castle, but he called it Attila's Capital, the Germans who were terrified by the prohibition named the city as Eccylburg, which means Attila Castle, however, the Hungarians did not care about the ban and call it Óbuda [Old Buda] and call it to this day.

— Mark of Kalt : Chronicon Pictum [ 69 ] The Scythians are certainly an ancient people and the strength of Scythia lies in the east, as we said above. And the first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet, and his people were called Magyars [Hungarians] after their King Magog, from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King Attila descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord's birth, coming down from Scythia , entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above the hot springs, and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian language is now called Budavár [Buda Castle] and by the Germans Etzelburg [Attila Castle] — Anonymus : Gesta Hungarorum [ 70 ] There are several theories about Pest. One [ 71 ] states that the name derives from Roman times , since there was a local fortress ( Contra-Aquincum ) called by Ptolemy "Pession" ("Πέσσιον", iii.7.§ 2).

[ 72 ] Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave, пещера , or peštera . A third cites пещ , or pešt , referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln.

[ 73 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Budapest For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Budapest .

Early history [ edit ] Buda during the Middle Ages , woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493) The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts [ 36 ] before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans . The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD.

[ 36 ] At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest.

[ 74 ] The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters , baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp.

[ 75 ] The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary . The archaeological site was turned into a museum with indoor and open-air sections.

[ 76 ] Meanwhile, settlement in the area east of the Danube, which was not part of the Roman Empire, remained Germanic and Sarmatian in character.

[ 77 ] The Magyar tribes led by Árpád , forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh , settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest, [ 38 ] [ 78 ] and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary .

[ 38 ] Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place of central power near what became Budapest.

[ 79 ] The Mongol invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain.

[ 44 ] [ 38 ] King Béla IV of Hungary , therefore, ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns [ 38 ] and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. German settlers were invited to rebuild and inhabit both Buda and Pest.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.

[ 39 ] [ 44 ] The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus . The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana , was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library .

[ 44 ] After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in Pécs in 1367 ( University of Pécs ), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 ( University of Óbuda ).

[ 82 ] The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473.

[ 83 ] Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around the year 1500.

[ 84 ] Retaking of Buda from the Ottoman Empire , painted by Frans Geffels in 1686 The Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well as in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.

[ 85 ] The Ottoman Rule lasted for more than 150 years.

[ 44 ] The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.

[ 38 ] Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later, including Rudas Baths and Király Baths . By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy.

[ 84 ] The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy as Royal Hungary .

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda , a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the Holy League 's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German , Croat , Dutch , Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech , Italian, French, Burgundian , Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen , and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda , and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár ( Timișoara ), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz , these territorial changes were officially recognized as the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule .

Contemporary history after Unification [ edit ] See also: Hungary during World War II Millennium Underground (1894–1896), the second oldest metro in the world (after the London Underground ) The Hungarian revolutionary army liberates the Buda castle in May 1849.

The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence [ 44 ] and modernisation. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary . This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest , lasting until World War I . In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube [ 86 ] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain . Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the "Jewish Mecca" [ 39 ] or "Judapest".

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Budapest also became an important center for the Aromanian diaspora during the 19th century.

[ 92 ] In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic ( Republic of Hungary ). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] The Hungarian State Opera House , built in the time of Austria-Hungary Bond of the City of Budapest, issued 1 May 1911 The Chain Bridge was destroyed during the Siege of Budapest .

Soviet tanks in Budapest (1956) In 1944, a year before the end of World War II , Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944 [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] ). From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest . Budapest sustained major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians died during the conflict.

All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.

[ 98 ] Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party , during the German occupation of Hungary , from 1944 to early 1945.

[ 99 ] Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.

[ 100 ] Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom.

Giorgio Perlasca , an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.

Following the capture of Hungary from Nazi Germany by the Red Army , Soviet military occupation ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic ( People's Republic of Hungary ). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era ).
On 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary . To their surprise, the central committee of the " Hungarian Working People's Party " did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park . Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.

[ 103 ] From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as " the happiest barrack " within the Eastern bloc , and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge , the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro 's east–west M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites .

Andrássy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway , Hősök tere , and Városliget ) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county , i.e., suburbanisation.

[ 104 ] In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 ( Fall of the Iron Curtain ) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into Memento Park . In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, Gábor Demszky .

[ 105 ] In October 2019, opposition candidate Gergely Karácsony won the Budapest mayoral election , meaning the first electoral blow for Hungary's nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán since coming to power in 2010.

[ 106 ] Geography [ edit ] Topography [ edit ] Satellite imagery of Budapest Budapest, strategically placed at the centre of the Pannonian Basin , lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain. By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna , 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw , 1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens , 1,235 kilometres (767 mi) north-east of Rome , 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan , 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague , 343 kilometres (213 mi) north-east of Zagreb , 748 kilometres (465 mi) north-east of Split and 1,329 kilometres (826 mi) north-west of Istanbul .

[ 107 ] The 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi) area of Budapest lies in Central Hungary , surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 km (16 and 18 mi) in the north–south, east–west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Óbuda Island and Margaret Island .

[ 44 ] The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is 230 m (755 ft) wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.

[ 44 ] The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank.

[ 108 ] Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.

[ 109 ] The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems , the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length 7,200 m or 23,600 ft) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length 2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János Hill , at 527 metres (1,729 feet) above sea level . The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 metres (315 feet) above sea level. Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the 525 square kilometres (203 square miles) occupied by the city, 83 square kilometres (32 square miles) is green area, park and forest.

[ 110 ] The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.

[ 111 ] The city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest.

[ 109 ] The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes .

[ 112 ] Budapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs (the others being Reykjavík in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria ). Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres (18 million US gallons) of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 °C. Some of these waters have been claimed to have medicinal effects due to their high mineral contents.

[ 109 ] Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Budapest Budapest has a transitional climate between a humid temperate climate ( Köppen : Cfa , Trewartha : Doak ), and a humid continental climate ( Köppen : Dfa , Trewartha : Dcao ), with warm to hot summers and chilly winters.

[ 113 ] Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.

Mean annual precipitation in Budapest is around 586 mm (23.1 in). On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy ( Venice ).

The city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the hardiness zone .

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site . Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like to see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture .

The next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church , built in the 12th century, [ 130 ] and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century.

[ 131 ] The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic , like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building [ 132 ] and the Matthias Church , where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).

[ 133 ] The next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture . One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House , St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences .

[ 134 ] During the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture , which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with "the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India".

[ 135 ] Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths . Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi . When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia . The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means congregational or Friday mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest) . The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon".

[ 135 ] The most famous Budapest bridge , the Chain Bridge , the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849 After 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.

[ 136 ] There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square . An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.

[ 136 ] The Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style.

Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum , the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president , the Sándor Palace . The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge .

[ 137 ] Budapest's two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade , both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station , which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.

[ 138 ] The Hungarian Parliament , completed in 1904 Art Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations.

[ 139 ] Art Nouveau in Hungary ( Szecesszió in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts . Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért , the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden .

[ 125 ] It is one of the world's outstanding urban landscapes and illustrates the great periods in the history of the Hungarian capital.

UNESCO [ 140 ] The second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats ( panelház ), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, forces Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city.

Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square , Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square . Numerous landmarks have been created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre , Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge , Megyeri Bridge , Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments . But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.

: kerület ), each with a mayor and municipal government elected separately from the general municipal government. The districts and the general municipal government have constitutionally and legally defined, non-overlapping areas of competence. Each district has a municipally recognized name, some of which correspond to how locals call that area or neighborhood (e.g., Belváros , V. district; Terézváros , VI. district), others which (e.g., Újbuda , XI. district) are neologisms. Street signs display the district and that neighborhood's colloquial name. The latter are often the names of villages that were gradually annexed to the city (e.g., Sashalom , Budafok ) or of superseded administrative units of former boroughs.

[ 146 ] After the unification of Buda, Pest, and Óbuda in 1873, Budapest initially had 10 districts. It was during the interwar period that Károly Szendy 's 1934-1944 mayoral administration first seriously considered annexing peripheral towns and villages. This only came about, however, after the rise of state communism in Hungary . In 1950, for reasons of social and industrial policy—including the Hungarian Working People's Party 's desire to proletarianize the traditionally right-wing suburbs—7 cities with county rights and 16 towns were annexed to the capital to form contemporary Greater Budapest (Hungarian: Nagy-Budapest ).

[ 147 ] This reorganized the city into 22 districts, a number that grew to 23 after Soroksár seceded from Pesterzsébet in 1994. The contemporary city thus consists of 6 districts in Buda, 16 in Pest, and Csepel . Today, districts I., II., XI., and XII. in Buda and V., VI., VII., VIII., and IX. in Pest make up the city center in its broadest sense, corresponding roughly to the 1873 municipal boundaries.

[ 148 ] [ 149 ] Budapest's districts are numbered according to three concentric semicircles. The I. district is a small area in central Buda, including the Castle Quarter . District II. is in Buda to the castle's northwest while district III. stretches along the northernmost part of Buda and includes the former Óbuda. District IV. continues this semicircle in northernmost Pest, but the V. district is in the very center of Pest and inaugurates a new circle that then loops back through Pest to Buda as the VI., VII., VIII., IX., XI., and XII. districts. Districts XIII., XIV., XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., XIX., XX., XXI., and XXII. form yet another semicircle in outermost Pest. Districts X. and XXIII. form irregularities within the overall pattern.

[ 165 ] These trends are also seen throughout the Budapest metropolitan area , which is home to 3.3 million people.

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] This amounts to about 34% of Hungary's population. In 2014, the city had a population density of 3,314 people/km 2 (8,580 people/sq mi), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities in Hungary. The population density of Elisabethtown-District VII is 30,989/km 2 (80,260/sq mi), which has the highest population density figure in Hungary and one of the highest in the world . For comparison, the density in Manhattan is 25,846/km 2 .

[ 168 ] Budapest is the fourth most "dynamically growing city" by population in Europe , [ 169 ] and the Euromonitor predicts a population increase of almost 10% between 2005 and 2030.

[ 170 ] The European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion says Budapest's population will increase by 10% to 30% only due to migration by 2050.

[ 171 ] A constant inflow of migrants in recent years has fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest to a greater extent than in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city's inhabitants allocate to necessary spending such as on food and non-alcoholic drinks.

[ 166 ] According to the 2016 microcensus, there were 1,764,263 people living in Budapest in 907,944 dwellings.

[ 172 ] Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapest's boundaries during working hours, and during special events. This fluctuation in the population is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.

[ 173 ] By ethnicity there were 1,697,039 (96.2%) Hungarians , 34,909 (2%) Germans , 16,592 (0.9%) Romani , 9,117 (0.5%) Romanians and 5,488 (0.3%) Slovaks .

[ 174 ] In Hungary people can declare multiple ethnic identities, hence the sum may exceed 100%.

[ 175 ] The share of ethnic Hungarians in Budapest (96.2%) is slightly lower than the national average (98.3%) due to the international migration.

[ 175 ] According to the 2011 census, 1,712,153 people (99.0%) speak Hungarian , of whom 1,692,815 people (97.9%) speak it as a first language , while 19,338 people (1.1%) speak it as a second language . Other spoken (foreign) languages were: English (536,855 speakers, 31.0%), German (266,249 speakers, 15.4%), French (56,208 speakers, 3.3%) and Russian (54,613 speakers, 3.2%).

[ 158 ] According to the same census, 1,600,585 people (92.6%) were born in Hungary, 126,036 people (7.3%) outside Hungary while the birthplace of 2,419 people (0.1%) was unknown.

[ 158 ] Although only 1.7% of the population of Hungary in 2009 were foreigners, 43% of them lived in Budapest, making them 4.4% of the city's population (up from 2% in 2001).

[ 159 ] Nearly two-thirds of foreigners living in Hungary were under 40 years old. The primary motivation for this age group living in Hungary was employment.

[ 159 ] Religion in Budapest (2022 census – of those who declared their religion (55.5%) Roman Catholic (40.7%) Calvinistic (13.6%) Lutheran (2.80%) Greek Catholic (1.80%) Orthodox (0.50%) Other Christian denomination (4.20%) Jewish (0.50%) Other religion (1.30%) Not religious (34.6%) Budapest is home to one of the most populous Christian communities in Central Europe, numbering 698,521 people (40.4%) in 2011.

[ 158 ] According to the 2011 census, there were 501,117 (29.0%) Roman Catholics , 146,756 (8.5%) Calvinists , 30,293 (1.8%) Lutherans , 16,192 (0.9%) Greek Catholics , 7,925 (0.5%) Jews and 3,710 (0.2%) Orthodox in Budapest. 395,964 people (22.9%) were irreligious while 585,475 people (33.9%) did not declare their religion.

[ 158 ] The city is also home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.

[ 177 ] [ 178 ] On national level, Budapest is the primate city of Hungary regarding business and the economy, accounting for 39% of the national income. The city had a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest regional economies in the European Union.

[ 179 ] According to Eurostat GDP, per capita in purchasing power parity is 147% of the EU average in Budapest, which means €37,632 ($42,770) per capita.

[ 153 ] Budapest is also among the Top 100 GDP performing cities in the world, measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers . The city was named as the 52nd most important business centre in the world in the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index , ahead of Beijing, São Paulo and Shenzhen and ranking 3rd (out of 65 cities) on the MasterCard Emerging Markets Index .

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] The city is 48th on the UBS The most expensive and richest cities in the world list, standing before cities such as Prague, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Buenos Aires .

[ 182 ] In a global city competitiveness ranking by the EIU , Budapest stands before Tel Aviv , Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg among others.

[ 183 ] The city is a major centre for banking and finance, real estate, retailing, trade, transportation, tourism, new media as well as traditional media , advertising, legal services , accountancy , insurance, fashion and the arts in Hungary and regionally. Budapest is home not only to almost all national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies. In 2014 there were 395.804 companies registered in the city.

[ 184 ] Most of these entities are headquartered in Budapest's Central Business District, in District V and District XIII . The retail market of the city (and the country) is also concentrated in the downtown area, among others, in the two largest shopping centres in Central and Eastern Europe , the 186,000 sqm WestEnd City Center and the 180,000 sqm Arena Plaza .

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] Budapest has notable innovation capabilities as a technology and start-up hub. Many start-ups are headquartered and begin their business in the city. Some of the best known examples are Prezi , LogMeIn and NNG . Budapest is the highest ranked Central and Eastern European city in the Innovation Cities' Top 100 index.

[ 187 ] A good indicator of the city's potential for innovation and research, is that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology chose Budapest for its headquarters, along with the UN, whose Regional Representation for Central Europe office is in the city, responsible for UN operations in seven countries.

[ 188 ] Moreover, the global aspect of the city's research activity is shown through the establishment of the European Chinese Research Institute in the city.

[ 189 ] Other important sectors also include, natural science research, information technology and medical research, non-profit institutions, and universities.

Islands [ edit ] Park on Margaret Island Aerial panorama with Margaret Island Széchenyi Thermal Bath in the City Park Gate of the Gellért Spa A number of islands can be found on the Danube in Budapest: Margaret Island ( Hungarian : Margit-sziget [ˈmɒrɡit.siɡɛt] ) is a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) long island and 0.965 square kilometres (238 acres) in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, swimming pools, an aqua park , athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting.

Csepel Island ( Hungarian : Csepel-sziget [ˈt͡ʃɛpɛlsiɡɛt] ) is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is 48 km (30 mi) long; its width is 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) and its area comprises 257 km 2 (99 sq mi). However, only the northern tip of the island is inside the city limits.

Hajógyári Island ( Hungarian : Hajógyári-sziget [ˈhɒjoːɟaːrisiɡɛt] ), also known as Óbuda Island ( Hungarian : Óbudai-sziget ), is a human-made island located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and dance clubs during the night.

Spas [ edit ] Night panorama from Gellért Hill with the illuminated Buda Castle , Matthias Church , Danube Chain Bridge , Parliament , Hungarian Academy of Sciences , St. Stephen's Basilica , Budapest Eye, and Vigadó Concert Hall One of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could use and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Budapest gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a "City of Spas". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the "Magic Bath" and "Cinetrip" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.

Construction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.

The Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a 10 metres (33 ft) diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.

The Gellért Baths and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.

The Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.

The Széchenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only "old" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.
