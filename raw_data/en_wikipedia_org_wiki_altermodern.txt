It is also the title of the Tate Britain 's fourth Triennial exhibition curated by Bourriaud.

Concept [ edit ] In his keynote speech to the 2005 Art Association of Australia & New Zealand Conference, Nicolas Bourriaud explained: [ 1 ] Artists are looking for a new modernity that would be based on translation: What matters today  is to translate the cultural values of cultural groups and  to connect them to the world network. This “reloading process” of  modernism according to the twenty-first-century issues could be called altermodernism, a movement connected to the creolisation of cultures and the fight for autonomy, but also the possibility of producing singularities in a more and more standardized world.

Altermodern can essentially be read as an artist working in a hypermodern world or with supermodern ideas or themes.

Exhibitions [ edit ] Tate Britain 2009 [ edit ] The Tate exhibition includes a series of four one-day events (called "Prologues"), aiming to "introduce and provoke debate" around the Triennial's themes. Each Prologue includes lectures, performances, film and a manifesto text and attempts to define what the curator sees as the four main facets of Altermodern: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The end of postmodernism Cultural hybridisation Travelling as a new way to produce forms [ clarification needed ] The expanding formats of art References [ edit ] ^ "[AAANZ 2005]: Nicolas Bourriaud - Keynote" .
