[ 142 ] 108 16 February 2021 03:59:37 [ 143 ] F9 B5 B1059-6 Cape Canaveral , SLC‑40 Starlink : Launch 19 (60 satellites) 15,600 kg (34,400 lb) LEO SpaceX Success Failure ( OCISLY ) Launch of 60 Starlink v1 satellites to a 550 km (340 mi) orbit at an inclination of 53° to expand internet constellation.

[ 144 ] A hole in a heat-shielding engine cover, which likely developed through fatigue, allowed recirculating hot exhaust gases to damage one of the Merlin 1D first-stage engines, causing it to shut down early during ascent.

Engine-out capability of the Falcon 9 allowed the mission to continue and successfully deploy the 60 Starlink satellites to orbit.

[ 145 ] The issue caused the booster to fail its landing attempt and miss the droneship Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) after its entry burn, breaking the longest streak of 24 landing successes (since surpassed).

[ 146 ] During this mission, GO Ms. Tree and GO Ms. Chief were used for the last time to recover the fairings; [ 147 ] [ 148 ] SpaceX retired the fairing catching program in favor of fairing fishing.

[ 149 ] Both fairing catching ships were retired from SpaceX use.
