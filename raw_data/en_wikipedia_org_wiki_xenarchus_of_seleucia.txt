Xenarchus, depicted as a medieval scholar in the Nuremberg Chronicle .

[ 1 ] Xenarchus ( Greek : Ξέναρχος ; 1st century BC) of Seleucia in Cilicia , was a Greek Peripatetic philosopher and grammarian . Xenarchus left home early, and devoted himself to the profession of teaching, first at Alexandria , afterwards at Athens , and last at Rome , where he enjoyed the friendship of Arius , and afterwards of Augustus ; and he was still living, in old age and honour, when Strabo wrote.

[ 2 ] Xenarchus disagreed with Aristotle on many issues. He denied the existence of the aether , composing a treatise entitled Against the Fifth Element .

[ 3 ] He is also mentioned by Simplicius , [ 4 ] by Julian the Apostate , [ 5 ] and by Alexander of Aphrodisias .
