( Discuss ) Proposed since August 2025.

In mathematics , transfinite numbers or infinite numbers are numbers that are " infinite " in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers. These include the transfinite cardinals , which are cardinal numbers used to quantify the size of infinite sets, and the transfinite ordinals , which are ordinal numbers used to provide an ordering of infinite sets.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term transfinite was coined in 1895 by Georg Cantor , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] who wished to avoid some of the implications of the word infinite in connection with these objects, which were, nevertheless, not finite .

[ citation needed ] Few contemporary writers share these qualms; it is now accepted usage to refer to transfinite cardinals and ordinals as infinite numbers . Nevertheless, the term transfinite also remains in use.

Notable work on transfinite numbers was done by Wacław Sierpiński : Leçons sur les nombres transfinis (1928 book) much expanded into Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers (1958, [ 7 ] 2nd ed. 1965 [ 8 ] ).

Definition [ edit ] Any finite natural number can be used in at least two ways: as an ordinal and as a cardinal. Cardinal numbers specify the size of sets (e.g., a bag of five marbles), whereas ordinal numbers specify the order of a member within an ordered set [ 9 ] (e.g., "the third man from the left" or "the twenty-seventh day of January"). When extended to transfinite numbers, these two concepts are no longer in one-to-one correspondence . A transfinite cardinal number is used to describe the size of an infinitely large set, [ 2 ] while a transfinite ordinal is used to describe the location within an infinitely large set that is ordered.

[ 9 ] [ failed verification ] The most notable ordinal and cardinal numbers are, respectively: ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } ( Omega ): the lowest transfinite ordinal number. It is also the order type of the natural numbers under their usual linear ordering.

ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} ( Aleph-null ): the first transfinite cardinal number. It is also the cardinality of the natural numbers. If the axiom of choice holds, the next higher cardinal number is aleph-one , ℵ ℵ 1 .

{\displaystyle \aleph _{1}.} If not, there may be other cardinals which are incomparable with aleph-one and larger than aleph-null. Either way, there are no cardinals between aleph-null and aleph-one.

The continuum hypothesis is the proposition that there are no intermediate cardinal numbers between ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} and the cardinality of the continuum (the cardinality of the set of real numbers ): [ 2 ] or equivalently that ℵ ℵ 1 {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}} is the cardinality of the set of real numbers. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory , neither the continuum hypothesis nor its negation can be proved.

Some authors, including P. Suppes and J. Rubin, use the term transfinite cardinal to refer to the cardinality of a Dedekind-infinite set in contexts where this may not be equivalent to "infinite cardinal"; that is, in contexts where the axiom of countable choice is not assumed or is not known to hold. Given this definition, the following are all equivalent: m {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}} is a transfinite cardinal. That is, there is a Dedekind infinite set A {\displaystyle A} such that the cardinality of A {\displaystyle A} is m .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}.} m + 1 = m .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}+1={\mathfrak {m}}.} ℵ ℵ 0 ≤ ≤ m .

{\displaystyle \aleph _{0}\leq {\mathfrak {m}}.} There is a cardinal n {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {n}}} such that ℵ ℵ 0 + n = m .

{\displaystyle \aleph _{0}+{\mathfrak {n}}={\mathfrak {m}}.} Although transfinite ordinals and cardinals both generalize only the natural numbers, other systems of numbers, including the hyperreal numbers and surreal numbers , provide generalizations of the real numbers .

[ 10 ] Examples [ edit ] In Cantor's theory of ordinal numbers, every integer number must have a successor.

[ 11 ] The next integer after all the regular ones, that is the first infinite integer, is named ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } . In this context, ω ω + 1 {\displaystyle \omega +1} is larger than ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } , and ω ω ⋅ ⋅ 2 {\displaystyle \omega \cdot 2} , ω ω 2 {\displaystyle \omega ^{2}} and ω ω ω ω {\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega }} are larger still. Arithmetic expressions containing ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } specify an ordinal number, and can be thought of as the set of all integers up to that number. A given number generally has multiple expressions that represent it, however, there is a unique Cantor normal form that represents it, [ 11 ] essentially a finite sequence of digits that give coefficients of descending powers of ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } .

Not all infinite integers can be represented by a Cantor normal form however, and the first one that cannot is given by the limit ω ω ω ω ω ω .

.

{\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega ^{\omega ^{...}}}} and is termed ε ε 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}} .

[ 11 ] ε ε 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}} is the smallest solution to ω ω ε ε = ε ε {\displaystyle \omega ^{\varepsilon }=\varepsilon } , and the following solutions ε ε 1 , .

, ε ε ω ω , .

, ε ε ε ε 0 , .

.

.

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{1},...,\varepsilon _{\omega },...,\varepsilon _{\varepsilon _{0}},...} give larger ordinals still, and can be followed until one reaches the limit ε ε ε ε ε ε .

.

.

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{\varepsilon _{\varepsilon _{...}}}} , which is the first solution to ε ε α α = α α {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{\alpha }=\alpha } . This means that in order to be able to specify all transfinite integers, one must think up an infinite sequence of names: because if one were to specify a single largest integer, one would then always be able to mention its larger successor. But as noted by Cantor, [ citation needed ] even this only allows one to reach the lowest class of transfinite numbers: those whose size of sets correspond to the cardinal number ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}} .
