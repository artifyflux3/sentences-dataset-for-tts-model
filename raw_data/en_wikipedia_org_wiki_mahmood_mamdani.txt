He is the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government and a professor of anthropology, political science and African studies at Columbia University .

[ 3 ] He also serves as the chancellor of Kampala International University in Uganda.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] He was previously the director of the Makerere Institute of Social Research (MISR) in Kampala , Uganda, from 2010 until 2022.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Mamdani specialises in the study of African and international politics, colonialism and post‐colonialism , and the politics of knowledge production.

Early life and education [ edit ] Mamdani was born on 23 April 1946 in Bombay , India, during the period of British colonial rule.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] He was raised in Kampala , Uganda, as part of the Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa . His parents, Gujarati Muslims , were born in the British territory of Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania), and moved to Bombay while his father attended college there.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The family returned to Dar es Salaam , Tanganyika when Mamdani was two, and moved to Uganda when he was five or six years old.

[ 10 ] He is an Indian-Ugandan.

[ 12 ] At the time, Uganda was racially segregated , including where people lived, the schools, the mosques, and children's play areas. For his primary school education, he first attended a madrasa , and then the Government Indian Primary School.

[ 10 ] He grew up speaking Gujarati , Urdu , and Swahili , and started studying English in sixth grade.

[ 10 ] After junior secondary school, he attended Old Kampala Senior Secondary School , where he was secretary of the Do-it-Yourself Physics club.

[ 13 ] Mamdani was one of 23 Ugandan students in the 1963 group of the Kennedy Airlift , a US-funded scholarship program that brought hundreds of East Africans to universities in the United States and Canada between 1959 and 1963.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Mamdani began studying at the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1967.

He was among the many students in the northern US who made the bus journey south to Montgomery, Alabama , organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in March 1965 to participate in the civil rights movement . This was during the time of, but distinct from, the Selma to Montgomery marches . He was jailed during the march and was allowed to make a phone call. Mamdani called the Ugandan Ambassador in Washington, D.C., for assistance. The ambassador asked him why he was "interfering in the internal affairs of a foreign country", to which he responded by saying that this was not an internal affair but a freedom struggle and that they too had gotten their freedom only last year.

[ 16 ] Soon after, he learned about Karl Marx 's work from an FBI visit.

[ 17 ] He then attended The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University and graduated in 1968 with a Master of Arts degree in political science and a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy degree in 1969. He obtained a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in government from Harvard University in 1974. His thesis was titled Politics and Class Formation in Uganda .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Career [ edit ] Mamdani returned to Uganda in early 1972 and was employed by Makerere University in Kampala as a teaching assistant at the same time conducting his doctoral research ; only to be expelled later that year by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin due to his ethnicity. He left Uganda for a refugee camp in the United Kingdom in early November.

[ 20 ] He left England in mid-1973 after being recruited to the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.

[ 16 ] In Dar es Salaam, he completed writing his thesis and was active with anti-Amin groups. In 1979, he attended the Moshi Conference as an observer and returned to Uganda after Amin was overthrown following the Uganda–Tanzania War [ 21 ] as a Frontier Interne of the World Council of Churches . He was posted to the Church of Uganda offices in Mengo .

[ citation needed ] In 1984, while attending a conference in Dakar , Senegal, he became stateless after his Ugandan citizenship was withdrawn by the government under Milton Obote because of his criticism of its policies.

[ 22 ] He returned to Dar es Salaam and was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor for the spring semester in 1986. After Obote was deposed for the second time, Mamdani once again returned to Uganda in June 1986.

[ 15 ] He was the founding director of the Centre for Basic Research (CBR), Uganda's first non-governmental research organisation, serving from 1987 to 2006.

[ 23 ] He was also a visiting professor at the University of Durban - Westville in South Africa (January to June 1993), at the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library in New Delhi (January to June in 1995), and at Princeton University (1995–96).

[ citation needed ] In 1996, he was appointed the inaugural holder of the AC Jordan chair of African studies at the University of Cape Town .

[ 24 ] He left after having disagreements with the administration over the draft of his syllabus for a foundation course on Africa called "Problematizing Africa".

[ 25 ] From 1998 to 2002, he served as president of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa . In December 2001, he gave a speech on "Making Sense of Violence in Postcolonial Africa" at the Nobel Centennial Symposium in Oslo, Norway.

[ 26 ] In 2008, in an open online poll, Mamdani was voted as the ninth "top public intellectual " in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by Prospect Magazine (UK) and Foreign Policy (US).

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] His essays have appeared in the London Review of Books and other publications.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ excessive citations ] Work [ edit ] Mamdani specialises in the study of African and international politics, colonialism and post‐colonialism , and the politics of knowledge production. His works explore the intersection between politics and culture, a comparative study of colonialism since 1452, the history of civil war and genocide in Africa, the Cold War and the War on Terror , and the theoretical history of human rights.

[ 34 ] His research as of 2016 took “as its point of departure his 1996 book, Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Colonialism ".

[ 35 ] In it, he argued that the post-colonial state cannot be understood without a clear analysis of the institutional colonial state. The nature of the colonial state in Africa was a response to the dilemma of the 'native question' and argued that it took on the form of a 'Bifurcated State'.

[ 36 ] This was characterised by 'direct rule' on the one hand which was a form of 'urban civil power' and focused on the exclusion of natives from civil freedoms guaranteed to citizens in civil society.

[ 37 ] Whilst on the other it was characterised by indirect rule which was rural in nature and involved the incorporation of 'natives' into a 'state enforced customary order' enforced by a 'rural tribal authority' which he termed as 'decentralised despotism'.

[ 37 ] This state was 'Janus faced' and 'contained a duality: two forms of power under a single hegemonic authority'.

[ 37 ] In the post-colonial realm, the urban sphere was to an extent deracialised but the rural one remained subject to quasi colonial control whether at the hands of conservative rulers for whom it provided their own power base or those of radical ones with centralised authoritarian projects of their own.

[ 38 ] In this way both experiences reproduced 'one part of the dual legacy of the bifurcated state and created their own distinctive version of despotism'.

[ 39 ] Mamdani analysed historical case studies in South Africa and Uganda to argue that colonial rule tapped into authoritarian possibilities whose legacies often persist after independence.

[ 40 ] Challenging conventional perceptions of apartheid in South Africa as exceptional, he argues that apartheid was the generic form of a European colony in Africa, encompassing aspects of indirect rule and association.

[ 41 ] In his 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror Mamdani said that suicide bombers should be recognized “as a category of soldier” and that it should be “understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism”.

[ 42 ] Some academics said this was not an advocacy of suicide bombing, but merely an analysis.

[ 43 ] Personal life [ edit ] Mamdani is married to Mira Nair , an Indian film director and producer. They met in Kampala, Uganda, in 1989 when Nair was conducting research for her film, Mississippi Masala , [ 15 ] and married in 1991. As of 2025 [update] , they live in Manhattan , New York City.

[ 44 ] Mamdani and Nair have a son, Zohran Mamdani . He is a member of the New York State Assembly , representing the 36th District in Queens , [ 45 ] and the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City in the 2025 election .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Honours and awards [ edit ] Awards [ edit ] 1997: Herskovits Prize for Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Colonialism [ 48 ] 1999: University of Cape Town Book Award for Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Colonialism [ 49 ] 2009: GDS Eminent Scholar Award from the International Studies Association [ 50 ] 2011: Lenfest Distinguished Faculty Award [ 51 ] 2012: Scholar of the Year at the 2nd Annual African Diaspora Awards for his immense contribution to African Scholarship [ 52 ] 2012: Ugandan Diaspora Award 2012 [ 23 ] In July 2017, Mamdani was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.
