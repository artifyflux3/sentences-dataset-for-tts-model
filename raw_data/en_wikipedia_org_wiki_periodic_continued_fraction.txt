For example, 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} can be expanded to the periodic continued fraction [ 1 ; 2 , 2 , 2 , .

This article considers only the case of periodic regular continued fractions . In other words, the remainder of this article assumes that all the partial denominators a i ( i ≥ 1) are positive integers. The general case, where the partial denominators a i are arbitrary real or complex numbers, is treated in the article convergence problem .

Purely periodic and periodic fractions [ edit ] Since all the partial numerators in a regular continued fraction are equal to unity we can adopt a shorthand notation in which the continued fraction shown above is written as x = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a k , a k + 1 , a k + 2 , … … , a k + m , a k + 1 , a k + 2 , … … , a k + m , … … ] = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a k , a k + 1 , a k + 2 , … … , a k + m ¯ ¯ ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{k},a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\dots ,a_{k+m},a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\dots ,a_{k+m},\dots ]\\&=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{k},{\overline {a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\dots ,a_{k+m}}}]\end{aligned}}} where, in the second line, a vinculum marks the repeating block.

[ 1 ] Some textbooks use the notation x = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a k , a ˙ ˙ k + 1 , a k + 2 , … … , a ˙ ˙ k + m ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{k},{\dot {a}}_{k+1},a_{k+2},\dots ,{\dot {a}}_{k+m}]\end{aligned}}} where the repeating block is indicated by dots over its first and last terms.

[ 2 ] If the initial non-repeating block is not present – that is, if k = -1, a 0 = a m and x = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a m − − 1 ¯ ¯ ] , {\displaystyle x=[{\overline {a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{m-1}}}],} the regular continued fraction x is said to be purely periodic . For example, the regular continued fraction [ 1 ; 1 , 1 , 1 , … … ] {\displaystyle [1;1,1,1,\dots ]} of the golden ratio φ is purely periodic, while the regular continued fraction [ 1 ; 2 , 2 , 2 , … … ] {\displaystyle [1;2,2,2,\dots ]} of 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is periodic, but not purely periodic. However, the regular continued fraction [ 2 ; 2 , 2 , 2 , … … ] {\displaystyle [2;2,2,2,\dots ]} of the silver ratio ⁠ σ σ = 2 + 1 {\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {2}}+1} is purely periodic.

As unimodular matrices [ edit ] Periodic continued fractions are in one-to-one correspondence with the real quadratic irrationals . The correspondence is explicitly provided by Minkowski's question-mark function . That article also reviews tools that make it easy to work with such continued fractions. Consider first the purely periodic part x = [ 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a m ¯ ¯ ] , {\displaystyle x=[0;{\overline {a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{m}}}],} This can, in fact, be written as x = α α x + β β γ γ x + δ δ {\displaystyle x={\frac {\alpha x+\beta }{\gamma x+\delta }}} with the α α , β β , γ γ , δ δ {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta } being integers, and satisfying α α δ δ − − β β γ γ = 1.

{\displaystyle \alpha \delta -\beta \gamma =1.} Explicit values can be obtained by writing S = ( 1 0 1 1 ) {\displaystyle S={\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\1&1\end{pmatrix}}} which is termed a "shift", so that S n = ( 1 0 n 1 ) {\displaystyle S^{n}={\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\n&1\end{pmatrix}}} and similarly a reflection, given by T ↦ ↦ ( − − 1 1 0 1 ) {\displaystyle T\mapsto {\begin{pmatrix}-1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}} so that T 2 = I {\displaystyle T^{2}=I} .  Both of these matrices are unimodular , arbitrary products remain unimodular. Then, given x {\displaystyle x} as above, the corresponding matrix is of the form [ 3 ] S a 1 T S a 2 T ⋯ ⋯ T S a m = ( α α β β γ γ δ δ ) {\displaystyle S^{a_{1}}TS^{a_{2}}T\cdots TS^{a_{m}}={\begin{pmatrix}\alpha &\beta \\\gamma &\delta \end{pmatrix}}} and one has x = [ 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a m ¯ ¯ ] = α α x + β β γ γ x + δ δ {\displaystyle x=[0;{\overline {a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{m}}}]={\frac {\alpha x+\beta }{\gamma x+\delta }}} as the explicit form. As all of the matrix entries are integers, this matrix belongs to the modular group S L ( 2 , Z ) .

{\displaystyle SL(2,\mathbb {Z} ).} Relation to quadratic irrationals [ edit ] A quadratic irrational number is an irrational real root of the quadratic equation a x 2 + b x + c = 0 {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0} where the coefficients a , b , and c are integers, and the discriminant , b 2 − − 4 a c {\displaystyle b^{2}-4ac} , is greater than zero. By the quadratic formula , every quadratic irrational can be written in the form ζ ζ = P + D Q {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {P+{\sqrt {D}}}{Q}}} where P , D , and Q are integers, D > 0 is not a perfect square (but not necessarily square-free), and Q divides the quantity P 2 − − D {\displaystyle P^{2}-D} (for example ( 6 + 8 ) / 4 {\displaystyle (6+{\sqrt {8}})/4} ). Such a quadratic irrational may also be written in another form with a square-root of a square-free number (for example ( 3 + 2 ) / 2 {\displaystyle (3+{\sqrt {2}})/2} ) as explained for quadratic irrationals .

By considering the complete quotients of periodic continued fractions, Euler was able to prove that if x is a regular periodic continued fraction, then x is a quadratic irrational number. The proof is straightforward. From the fraction itself, one can construct the quadratic equation with integral coefficients that x must satisfy.

Lagrange proved the converse of Euler's theorem: if x is a quadratic irrational, then the regular continued fraction expansion of x is periodic.

[ 4 ] Given a quadratic irrational x one can construct m different quadratic equations, each with the same discriminant, that relate the successive complete quotients of the regular continued fraction expansion of x to one another. Since there are only finitely many of these equations (the coefficients are bounded), the complete quotients (and also the partial denominators) in the regular continued fraction that represents x must eventually repeat.

Reduced surds [ edit ] The quadratic surd ζ ζ = P + D Q {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {P+{\sqrt {D}}}{Q}}} is said to be reduced if ζ ζ > 1 {\displaystyle \zeta >1} and its conjugate η η = P − − D Q {\displaystyle \eta ={\frac {P-{\sqrt {D}}}{Q}}} satisfies the inequalities − − 1 < η η < 0 {\displaystyle -1<\eta <0} . For instance, the golden ratio ϕ ϕ = ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 = 1.618033...

{\displaystyle \phi =(1+{\sqrt {5}})/2=1.618033...} is a reduced surd because it is greater than one and its conjugate ( 1 − − 5 ) / 2 = − − 0.618033...

{\displaystyle (1-{\sqrt {5}})/2=-0.618033...} is greater than −1 and less than zero. On the other hand, the square root of two 2 = ( 0 + 8 ) / 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}=(0+{\sqrt {8}})/2} is greater than one but is not a reduced surd because its conjugate − − 2 = ( 0 − − 8 ) / 2 {\displaystyle -{\sqrt {2}}=(0-{\sqrt {8}})/2} is less than −1.

Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which  represents a quadratic surd ζ is purely periodic if and only if ζ is a reduced surd. In fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if ζ is a reduced quadratic surd and η is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for ζ and for (−1/η) are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have ζ ζ = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a m − − 1 ¯ ¯ ] − − 1 η η = [ a m − − 1 ; a m − − 2 , a m − − 3 , … … , a 0 ¯ ¯ ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\zeta &=[{\overline {a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{m-1}}}]\\[3pt]{\frac {-1}{\eta }}&=[{\overline {a_{m-1};a_{m-2},a_{m-3},\dots ,a_{0}}}]\,\end{aligned}}} where ζ is any reduced quadratic surd, and η is its conjugate.

From these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If r > 1 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then r = [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , … … , a 2 , a 1 , 2 a 0 ¯ ¯ ] .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {r}}=[a_{0};{\overline {a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{2},a_{1},2a_{0}}}].} In particular, if n is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of √ n contains a repeating block of length m , in which the first m − 1 partial denominators form a palindromic string.

Length of the repeating block [ edit ] By analyzing the sequence of combinations P n + D Q n {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{n}+{\sqrt {D}}}{Q_{n}}}} that can possibly arise when ζ ζ = P + D Q {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {P+{\sqrt {D}}}{Q}}} is expanded as a regular continued fraction, Lagrange showed that the largest partial denominator a i in the expansion is less than 2 D {\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {D}}} , and that the length of the repeating block is less than 2 D .

More recently, sharper arguments [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] based on the divisor function have shown that the length of the repeating block for a quadratic surd of discriminant D is on the order of O ( D ln ⁡ ⁡ D ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}({\sqrt {D}}\ln {D}).} Canonical form and repetend [ edit ] The following iterative algorithm [ 8 ] can be used to obtain the continued fraction expansion in canonical form ( S is any natural number that is not a perfect square ): m 0 = 0 {\displaystyle m_{0}=0\,\!} d 0 = 1 {\displaystyle d_{0}=1\,\!} a 0 = ⌊ S ⌋ {\displaystyle a_{0}=\left\lfloor {\sqrt {S}}\right\rfloor \,\!} m n + 1 = d n a n − − m n {\displaystyle m_{n+1}=d_{n}a_{n}-m_{n}\,\!} d n + 1 = S − − m n + 1 2 d n {\displaystyle d_{n+1}={\frac {S-m_{n+1}^{2}}{d_{n}}}\,\!} a n + 1 = ⌊ S + m n + 1 d n + 1 ⌋ = ⌊ a 0 + m n + 1 d n + 1 ⌋ .

{\displaystyle a_{n+1}=\left\lfloor {\frac {{\sqrt {S}}+m_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}}}\right\rfloor =\left\lfloor {\frac {a_{0}+m_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}}}\right\rfloor \!.} Notice that m n , d n , and a n are always integers.
The algorithm terminates when this triplet is the same as one encountered before.
The algorithm can also terminate on a i when a i = 2 a 0 , [ 9 ] which is easier to implement.

The expansion will repeat from then on. The sequence [ a 0 ; a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , … … ] {\displaystyle [a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots ]} is the continued fraction expansion: S = a 0 + 1 a 1 + 1 a 2 + 1 a 3 + ⋱ ⋱ {\displaystyle {\sqrt {S}}=a_{0}+{\cfrac {1}{a_{1}+{\cfrac {1}{a_{2}+{\cfrac {1}{a_{3}+\,\ddots }}}}}}} Example [ edit ] To obtain √ 114 as a continued fraction, begin with m 0 = 0; d 0 = 1; and a 0 = 10 (10 2 = 100 and 11 2 = 121 > 114 so 10 chosen).

114 = 114 + 0 1 = 10 + 114 − − 10 1 = 10 + ( 114 − − 10 ) ( 114 + 10 ) 114 + 10 = 10 + 114 − − 100 114 + 10 = 10 + 1 114 + 10 14 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {114}}&={\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+0}{1}}=10+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-10}{1}}=10+{\frac {({\sqrt {114}}-10)({\sqrt {114}}+10)}{{\sqrt {114}}+10}}\\&=10+{\frac {114-100}{{\sqrt {114}}+10}}=10+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{14}}}.\end{aligned}}} m 1 = d 0 ⋅ ⋅ a 0 − − m 0 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ 10 − − 0 = 10 .

{\displaystyle m_{1}=d_{0}\cdot a_{0}-m_{0}=1\cdot 10-0=10\,.} d 1 = S − − m 1 2 d 0 = 114 − − 10 2 1 = 14 .

{\displaystyle d_{1}={\frac {S-m_{1}^{2}}{d_{0}}}={\frac {114-10^{2}}{1}}=14\,.} a 1 = ⌊ a 0 + m 1 d 1 ⌋ = ⌊ 10 + 10 14 ⌋ = ⌊ 20 14 ⌋ = 1 .

{\displaystyle a_{1}=\left\lfloor {\frac {a_{0}+m_{1}}{d_{1}}}\right\rfloor =\left\lfloor {\frac {10+10}{14}}\right\rfloor =\left\lfloor {\frac {20}{14}}\right\rfloor =1\,.} So, m 1 = 10; d 1 = 14; and a 1 = 1.

114 + 10 14 = 1 + 114 − − 4 14 = 1 + 114 − − 16 14 ( 114 + 4 ) = 1 + 1 114 + 4 7 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{14}}=1+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-4}{14}}=1+{\frac {114-16}{14({\sqrt {114}}+4)}}=1+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+4}{7}}}.} Next, m 2 = 4; d 2 = 7; and a 2 = 2.

114 + 4 7 = 2 + 114 − − 10 7 = 2 + 14 7 ( 114 + 10 ) = 2 + 1 114 + 10 2 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+4}{7}}=2+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-10}{7}}=2+{\frac {14}{7({\sqrt {114}}+10)}}=2+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{2}}}.} 114 + 10 2 = 10 + 114 − − 10 2 = 10 + 14 2 ( 114 + 10 ) = 10 + 1 114 + 10 7 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{2}}=10+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-10}{2}}=10+{\frac {14}{2({\sqrt {114}}+10)}}=10+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{7}}}.} 114 + 10 7 = 2 + 114 − − 4 7 = 2 + 98 7 ( 114 + 4 ) = 2 + 1 114 + 4 14 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{7}}=2+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-4}{7}}=2+{\frac {98}{7({\sqrt {114}}+4)}}=2+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+4}{14}}}.} 114 + 4 14 = 1 + 114 − − 10 14 = 1 + 14 14 ( 114 + 10 ) = 1 + 1 114 + 10 1 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+4}{14}}=1+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-10}{14}}=1+{\frac {14}{14({\sqrt {114}}+10)}}=1+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{1}}}.} 114 + 10 1 = 20 + 114 − − 10 1 = 20 + 14 114 + 10 = 20 + 1 114 + 10 14 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{1}}=20+{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}-10}{1}}=20+{\frac {14}{{\sqrt {114}}+10}}=20+{\frac {1}{\frac {{\sqrt {114}}+10}{14}}}.} Now, loop back to the second equation above.

Consequently, the simple continued fraction for the square root of 114 is 114 = [ 10 ; 1 , 2 , 10 , 2 , 1 , 20 ¯ ¯ ] .

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {114}}=[10;{\overline {1,2,10,2,1,20}}].\,} (sequence A010179 in the OEIS ) √ 114 is approximately 10.67707 82520. After one expansion of the repetend, the continued fraction yields the rational fraction 21194 1985 {\displaystyle {\frac {21194}{1985}}} whose decimal value is approx. 10.67707 80856, a relative error of
0.0000016% or 1.6 parts in 100,000,000.

Generalized continued fraction [ edit ] A more rapid method is to evaluate its generalized continued fraction . From the formula derived there : z = x 2 + y = x + y 2 x + y 2 x + y 2 x + ⋱ ⋱ = x + 2 x ⋅ ⋅ y 2 ( 2 z − − y ) − − y − − y 2 2 ( 2 z − − y ) − − y 2 2 ( 2 z − − y ) − − ⋱ ⋱ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {z}}={\sqrt {x^{2}+y}}&=x+{\cfrac {y}{2x+{\cfrac {y}{2x+{\cfrac {y}{2x+\ddots }}}}}}\\&=x+{\cfrac {2x\cdot y}{2(2z-y)-y-{\cfrac {y^{2}}{2(2z-y)-{\cfrac {y^{2}}{2(2z-y)-\ddots }}}}}}\end{aligned}}} and the fact that 114 is 2/3 of the way between 10 2 =100 and 11 2 =121 results in 114 = 1026 3 = 32 2 + 2 3 = 32 3 + 2 / 3 64 + 2 64 + 2 64 + 2 64 + ⋱ ⋱ = 32 3 + 2 192 + 18 192 + 18 192 + ⋱ ⋱ , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {114}}={\cfrac {\sqrt {1026}}{3}}={\cfrac {\sqrt {32^{2}+2}}{3}}&={\cfrac {32}{3}}+{\cfrac {2/3}{64+{\cfrac {2}{64+{\cfrac {2}{64+{\cfrac {2}{64+\ddots }}}}}}}}\\&={\cfrac {32}{3}}+{\cfrac {2}{192+{\cfrac {18}{192+{\cfrac {18}{192+\ddots }}}}}},\end{aligned}}} which is simply the aforementioned [ 10 ; 1 , 2 , 10 , 2 , 1 , 20 , 1 , 2 ] {\displaystyle [10;1,2,\,10,2,1,\,20,1,2]} evaluated at every third term. Combining pairs of fractions produces 114 = 32 2 + 2 3 = 32 3 + 64 / 3 2050 − − 1 − − 1 2050 − − 1 2050 − − ⋱ ⋱ = 32 3 + 64 6150 − − 3 − − 9 6150 − − 9 6150 − − ⋱ ⋱ , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {114}}={\cfrac {\sqrt {32^{2}+2}}{3}}&={\cfrac {32}{3}}+{\cfrac {64/3}{2050-1-{\cfrac {1}{2050-{\cfrac {1}{2050-\ddots }}}}}}\\&={\cfrac {32}{3}}+{\cfrac {64}{6150-3-{\cfrac {9}{6150-{\cfrac {9}{6150-\ddots }}}}}},\end{aligned}}} which is now [ 10 ; 1 , 2 , 10 , 2 , 1 , 20 , 1 , 2 ¯ ¯ ] {\displaystyle [10;1,2,{\overline {10,2,1,20,1,2}}]} evaluated at the third term and every six terms thereafter.
