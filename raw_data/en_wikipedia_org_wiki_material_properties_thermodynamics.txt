Each is directly related to a second order differential of a thermodynamic potential . Examples for a simple 1-component system are: Compressibility (or its inverse, the bulk modulus ) Isothermal compressibility κ κ T = − − 1 V ( ∂ ∂ V ∂ ∂ P ) T = − − 1 V ∂ ∂ 2 G ∂ ∂ P 2 {\displaystyle \kappa _{T}=-{\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial P}}\right)_{T}\quad =-{\frac {1}{V}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}G}{\partial P^{2}}}} Adiabatic compressibility κ κ S = − − 1 V ( ∂ ∂ V ∂ ∂ P ) S = − − 1 V ∂ ∂ 2 H ∂ ∂ P 2 {\displaystyle \kappa _{S}=-{\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial P}}\right)_{S}\quad =-{\frac {1}{V}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}H}{\partial P^{2}}}} Specific heat (Note - the extensive analog is the heat capacity ) Specific heat at constant pressure c P = T N ( ∂ ∂ S ∂ ∂ T ) P = − − T N ∂ ∂ 2 G ∂ ∂ T 2 {\displaystyle c_{P}={\frac {T}{N}}\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}\quad =-{\frac {T}{N}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}G}{\partial T^{2}}}} Specific heat at constant volume c V = T N ( ∂ ∂ S ∂ ∂ T ) V = − − T N ∂ ∂ 2 A ∂ ∂ T 2 {\displaystyle c_{V}={\frac {T}{N}}\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}\quad =-{\frac {T}{N}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}A}{\partial T^{2}}}} Coefficient of thermal expansion α α = 1 V ( ∂ ∂ V ∂ ∂ T ) P = 1 V ∂ ∂ 2 G ∂ ∂ P ∂ ∂ T {\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}\quad ={\frac {1}{V}}\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}G}{\partial P\partial T}}} where P is pressure , V is volume , T is temperature , S is entropy , and N is the number of particles .

For a single component system, only three second derivatives are needed in order to derive all others, and so only three material properties are needed to derive all others. For a single component system, the "standard" three parameters are the isothermal compressibility κ κ T {\displaystyle \kappa _{T}} , the specific heat at constant pressure c P {\displaystyle c_{P}} , and the coefficient of thermal expansion α α {\displaystyle \alpha } .

For example, the following equations are true: c P = c V + T V α α 2 N κ κ T {\displaystyle c_{P}=c_{V}+{\frac {TV\alpha ^{2}}{N\kappa _{T}}}} κ κ T = κ κ S + T V α α 2 N c P {\displaystyle \kappa _{T}=\kappa _{S}+{\frac {TV\alpha ^{2}}{Nc_{P}}}} The three "standard" properties are in fact the three possible second derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to temperature and pressure. Moreover, considering derivatives such as ∂ ∂ 3 G ∂ ∂ P ∂ ∂ T 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{3}G}{\partial P\partial T^{2}}}} and the related Schwartz relations, shows that the properties triplet is not independent. In fact,  one property function can be given as an expression of the two others, up to a reference state value.

[ 1 ] The second principle of thermodynamics has implications on the sign of some thermodynamic properties such isothermal compressibility.
