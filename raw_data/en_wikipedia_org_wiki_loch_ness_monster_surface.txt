The monster should really be infinitely long with an infinite number of loops.

A plot of a part of a Loch Ness monster surface.

In mathematics , the Loch Ness monster is a surface with infinite genus but only one end . It appeared named this way already in a 1981 article by Sullivan & Phillips (1981) . The surface can be constructed by starting with a plane (which can be thought of as the surface of Loch Ness ) and adding an infinite number of handles (which can be thought of as loops of the Loch Ness monster ).
