[ 1 ] Traditional artists or groups of artists receive the National Living Treasures Award (Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (GAMABA)) for their contributions to the country's intangible cultural heritage.

Ethnomedicine [ edit ] Hilot conducted by a specialist Ethnomedicine is one of the oldest traditional arts in the Philippines. Traditions (and objects associated with them) are performed by medical artisans and shamans. Practices, grounded on the physical elements, are an ancient science and art. Herbal remedies, complementing mental, emotional, and spiritual techniques, are also part of many traditions as well. The category was added to the GAMABA in 2020.

[ 3 ] Folk architecture [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of the Philippines Folk architecture in the Philippines varies by ethnic group, and structures are made of bamboo , wood, rock , coral , rattan , grass, and other materials. They include the hut-style bahay kubo , highland houses (known as bale ) with four to eight sides, the coral houses of Batanes which protect from the area's harsh, sandy winds, the royal torogan (engraved with an intricate okir motif) and palaces such as the Darul Jambangan (Palace of Flowers), the residence of the sultan of Sulu before colonization. Folk architecture also includes religious buildings, generally called spirit houses , which are shrines to protective spirits or gods.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Most are open-air, house-like buildings made of native materials.

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] Some were originally pagoda-like (a style continued by natives who converted to Islam), and are now rare.

[ 8 ] Other buildings have indigenous and Hispanic motifs ( bahay na bato architecture and its prototypes). Many bahay na bato buildings are in Vigan , a World Heritage Site .

[ 9 ] Folk structures range from simple, sacred stick stands to indigenous castles or fortresses (such as Batanes' ijangs and geological alterations such as the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras (another World Heritage Site).

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Painting of shamanhood and ethnomedicine, including rituals Some bahay na bato houses Dakay house, the oldest surviving coral houses in the Batanes still used today (c. 1887) Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras , World Heritage Site and a National Cultural Treasure Batad Rice Terraces Maritime transport [ edit ] Maritime transport includes boat houses, boat-making, and maritime traditions. These structures, traditionally made of wood chosen by elders and crafters, connected the islands. Although boats are believed to have been used in the archipelago for thousands of years, the earliest evidence of boat-making has been carbon-dated to 689 AD: the Butuan boats identified as large balangays .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In addition to the balangay, indigenous boats include the two-masted double-outrigger fishing armadahan , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] the avang trading ship, [ 19 ] the awang dugout canoes , [ 20 ] the balación sailing outrigger boat , [ 21 ] the bangka , [ 22 ] the bangka anak-anak canoe, [ 23 ] the salambáw -lifting basnigan , [ 24 ] the bigiw double-outrigger sailboat, [ 25 ] the birau dugout canoe, [ 23 ] the buggoh dugout canoe, [ 23 ] the casco barge, [ 26 ] the single mast and pointed chinarem , [ 19 ] the rough-sea open-deck chinedkeran , [ 19 ] the djenging double-outrigger plank boat, [ 23 ] the garay pirate ship, [ 27 ] the guilalo sailing outrigger ship, [ 28 ] the falua open-deck boat, [ 19 ] the junkun canoe, [ 23 ] the motorized junkung , [ 29 ] the outrigger karakoa and lanong warships, [ 30 ] [ 31 ] the lepa houseboat, [ 32 ] the ontang raft, [ 23 ] the owong lake canoe, [ 33 ] the open-deck fishing boat panineman , [ 19 ] the double-outrigger paraw sailboat, [ 34 ] the salisipan war canoe, [ 35 ] the tataya fishing boat, [ 19 ] the motorized tempel , the dinghy tiririt , [ 36 ] and the outrigger vinta .

[ 39 ] The weaving arts include basket weaving, back-strap loom weaving, headgear weaving, and fishnet weaving.

Cloth and mat weaving [ edit ] See also: Patadyong Banton cloth , the oldest surviving ikat textile in Southeast Asia (13th-14th century), a National Cultural Treasure Valuable textiles are made with a back strap loom .

[ 40 ] Fibers such as cotton, abaca , banana fiber, grass, and palm are used in Filipino weaving.

[ 41 ] There are a number of types of woven cloth. Pinilian is an Ilocano cotton cloth woven with a pangablan , using binakul , binetwagan , or tinumballitan styles. Bontoc weave emphasizes the concept of centeredness, key to the culture of the Bontoc people . The weave begins with the sides ( langkit ), followed by the pa-ikid (side panels), fatawil ( warp bands), and shukyong (arrows). The sinamaki weaving then begins, incorporating a tinagtakho (human figure), minatmata (diamond), and tinitiko (zigzag). The last is the center ( pa-khawa ), with the kan-ay (supplementary weft). Kalinga textiles contain geometric designs; one motif is a lozenge pattern known as inata-ata .

Piña is considered the finest indigenous Filipino textile.

Aklanon textiles are used in national costumes. Hablon is the textile of the Karay-a and Hiligaynon peoples. Tapestry woven by the Yakan people uses the bunga-sama supplementary weft weave, the siniluan warp-floating pattern, the inalaman supplementary-weft technique, and the pinantupan weft-band pattern.

Blaan weaving depicts crocodiles and curls. The Mandaya use a mud-dye technique. Meranaw textiles are used for the malong and other Maranao clothing.

T'nalak is a Tboli textile.

[ 42 ] The oldest known ikat textile in Southeast Asia is the Banton cloth, dating to the 13th to 14th centuries.

[ 43 ] Unlike cloth weaving with a loom, mats are woven by hand. They are woven in cool shade, and are kept cool to preserve their integrity. An example is the banig of Basey, where its weavers usually work in a cave. Fibers include banana, grass, and palm.

[ 44 ] Panel made of silk, piña, and metallic threads (1800s) Northern Luzon textile used in skirt Basketry [ edit ] Baskets have intricate designs, styles and forms for specific purposes, such as harvesting, rice storage, traveling, and sword storage.

Basket weaving is believed to have arrived with north-to-south human migration. Some of the finest baskets made are from Palawan , in the southwest. Materials vary by ethnic group, and include bamboo, rattan, pandan, cotton tassels, beeswax, abacá , bark, and dyes. Basketry patterns include closed crossed-over underweave, closed bamboo double-twill weave, and a spaced rattan pentagon pattern. Products include the tupil (lunch box), bukug (basket), kabil (carrying basket), uppig (lunch basket), tagga-i (rice basket), bay'ung (basket pouch), lig-o (winnowing tray), and binga (bag).

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Weaving traditions have been influenced by modern demands.

[ 47 ] Woven headpieces are common, and cultures use a variety of fibers to create headgear such as the Ivatan vakul and the snake headpiece of the Bontoc .

[ 48 ] Woven fish traps are a specialty of the Ilocano people .

[ 49 ] Broom weaving is another tradition, exemplified by the Kalinga people .

They were produced from the Agusan-Surigao area on Mindanao to Cebu , Palawan , and Luzon .

The Agusan image is a 2 kg (4.4 lb), 21-karat gold statuette found in 1917 on the Wawa River near Esperanza , Agusan del Sur , Mindanao , [ 56 ] dates to the ninth or tenth centuries. The image is commonly known as the Golden Tara, an allusion to its reported [ 57 ] identity as an image of a Buddhist Tara . The figure, about 178 mm (7.0 in) [ 58 ] tall, is of a female Hindu or Buddhist deity sitting cross-legged and wearing a headdress and other ornaments. It is on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] A bronze statue of Lokesvara was found in Isla Puting Bato in Tondo, Manila .

[ 61 ] An image of the Buddha was moulded on a clay medallion in bas-relief in the municipality of Calatagan. It reportedly resembles iconographic depictions of the Buddha in Siam , India, and Nepal : in a tribhanga [ 62 ] pose inside an oval nimbus . Scholars have noted a Mahayanic orientation in the image, since the boddhisattva Avalokiteśvara is also shown.

[ 63 ] Another gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan , is an image of Garuda , the bird who is the mount of Vishnu . The  Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in the caves has been linked to those in Oc Eo , in the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam . Crude bronze statues of the Hindu deity Ganesha were found by Henry Otley Beyer in 1921 in Puerto Princesa , Palawan, and in Mactan , Cebu . The statues were produced locally.

[ 61 ] A bronze statue of Avalokiteśvara was also excavated that year by Beyer in Mactan.

[ 61 ] A gold Kinnara was found in Surigao. Other gold relics include rings (some with images of Nandi ), jewellery chains , inscribed gold sheets, and gold plaques with repoussé images of Hindu deities.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Carving [ edit ] See also: Bulul Carving includes on woodcarving and the creation of folk non-clay sculptures.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Woodcarving [ edit ] Indigenous woodcarving by some ethnic groups dates to before the Hispanic arrival; the oldest may be fragments of a wooden boat dating to 320 AD.

[ 68 ] A variety of woods are used to make wood crafts, which include bululs.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] These wooden figures, known by a number of names, are found from north Luzon to southern Mindanao.

[ 71 ] Wood okir is crafted by ethnic groups in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Wood crafts of objects such as sword hilts and musical instruments depict ancient, mythical beings.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] Indigenous wood-crafting techniques have been utilized in Hispanic woodcarvings after colonization, such as in Paete .

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Religious Hispanic woodcarvings were introduced with Christianity, and are a fusion of indigenous and Hispanic styles. Paete is a center of religious Hispanic woodcarving.

[ 76 ] Such woodcarving also exists in many municipalities, where most crafts depict the life of Jesus and the Virgin Mary .

[ 79 ] Carvings may represent an ancestor or a deity who helps the spirit of a loved one enter the afterlife.

[ 80 ] Ancient carved burial urns have been found in many areas, notably in the Cotabato region.

[ 81 ] The Limestone tombs of Kamhantik , in Quezon province, are thought to initially have rock covers and were sarcophagi. They are believed to have been originally roofed, as evidenced by holes where beams have been placed.

[ 82 ] Stone grave marks are carved with okir motifs to aid the dead.

[ 83 ] Mountainsides are carved to form burial caves, especially in the highlands of northern Luzon; the Kabayan Mummies are an example.

[ 84 ] Marble carvings are centered in Romblon , and most (primarily Buddhist statues and related works) are exported.

[ 85 ] With the arrival of Christianity, stone carvings became widespread; most are church facades or statues, or statues and other crafts for personal altars.

[ 86 ] A notable stone carving is the facade of Miagao Church .

[ 87 ] Ivory carving has been practiced in the Philippines for a millennium; its oldest known ivory artifact is the Butuan Ivory Seal , dated to the ninth to 12th centuries.

[ 88 ] Ivory religious carvings (locally known as garing ) became widespread after ivory was imported to the Philippines from Asia, where carvings focused on Christian themes such as the Madonna and child, the Christ child, and the Sorrowful Mother.

[ 89 ] Many of the ivory carvings from the Philippines have gold and silver designs.

[ 89 ] The Filipino ivory trade has boomed because of the demand for carvings, [ 90 ] but the government has cracked down on the illegal trade. In 2013, the Philippines was the first country to destroy its ivory stock; the ivory trade has decimated the world's elephant and rhinoceros populations.

[ 91 ] Horns of dead carabaos have substituted for ivory in the country for centuries.

[ 92 ] Stone carvings at the facade of Miagao Church , World Heritage Site and a National Cultural Treasure Various ancient carved limestone burial urns Bas relief at Panay Church (1770s) Carved marbles from Romblon Virgin Mary ivory head with inlaid glass eyes (18-19th century) Visayan tenegre buffalo horn hilt Ivory carving of Christ Child with gold paint (1580–1640) Stamp of the Butuan Ivory Seal (9th-12th century) Our Lady of La Naval de Manila , the oldest Christian statue in the Philippines made of ivory (1593 or 1596) An ivory triptych (17th century) Mother-of-pearl relief (19th century) One of the carvings at the Basilica del Santo Niño Teeth filing is present in some ethnic groups in the country A likha portraying a god, one of only two likha that survived Spanish persecution and destruction Moro helmet, exterior made of carved carabao horn (18th century) Folk performing arts [ edit ] Folk dances, plays, and dramas are performed.

Folk writing (calligraphy) [ edit ] The Philippines has a number of indigenous scripts collectively known as suyat , each of which has its own calligraphy . Since 16th-century Spanish colonization, ethnolinguistic groups have used the scripts in a variety of media. By the end of the colonial era, only four suyat scripts survived and continue to be used: the Hanunó'o and Buhid scripts and those of the Tagbanwa and Palawan peoples . All four were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme as Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) in 1999.

The oldest folk drawings are rock drawings and engravings which include the Angono Petroglyphs in Rizal , created during the Neolithic (6000 to 2000 BC). The drawings have been interpreted as religious, with infant drawings to relieve sickness in children.

[ 132 ] Another petroglyph is in Alab (Bontoc), dated as not later than 1500 BC and containing fertility symbols such as the pudenda . Ancient petrographs are also found; those in Peñablanca and Singnapan are drawn with charcoal, and those in Anda (Bohol) are drawn with red hematite .

[ 133 ] Recently discovered petrographs in Monreal (Ticao) include drawings of monkeys, human faces, worms (or snakes), plants, dragonflies, and birds.

[ 134 ] Evidence indicates that indigenous Filipinos have been painting and glazing pottery for thousands of years. Pigments used for painting range from gold, yellow, reddish-purple, green, white, and blue-green to blue.

[ 135 ] Statues and other creations have also been painted with a variety of colors. Painting on skin is practiced, especially by the Yakan people.

[ 136 ] Tattooing was introduced by the Austronesian peoples thousands of years ago, and it developed into cultural symbols in a number of ethnic groups.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] It was first documented the 16th century, with the bravest Pintados (people of central and eastern Visayas) the most tattooed. Similar tattooed peoples were the Bicolanos of Camarines and the Tagalogs of Marinduque .

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Tattooed people in Mindanao include the Manobo , whose tattoo tradition is known as pang-o-túb .

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] The T'boli also tattoo their skin in the belief that the tattoos glow after death, guiding the soul in its journey to the afterlife.

[ 145 ] The best-known tattooed people may have been the Igorot people of highland Luzon. Only Tinglayan in Kalinga has traditional tattoo artists crafting batok ; they were headed by master tattooist and Kalinga matriarch Whang-od .

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] Traditional tattooing has experienced a revival after centuries of decline.

[ 153 ] Indigenous hats were widely worn until the 20th century (when they were replaced by Western styles), and are currently worn for festivals, rituals, or theatre.

[ 48 ] [ 154 ] Mask-making is an indigenous and imported tradition; some communities made masks before colonization, and other mask-making traditions were introduced by trade with Asia and the West. These masks are primarily worn during the Moriones and MassKara Festivals .

[ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] Puppet-making is a related art whose products are used in plays and festivals such as the Higantes Festival .

[ 158 ] Most indigenous masks are made of wood, and gold masks (made for the dead) were common in the Visayas region before Spanish colonization. Masks made of bamboo and paper, used in Lucban depict the typical Filipino farming family. Masks in Marinduque are used in pantomime; those in Bacolod depict egalitarian values, regardless of economic standards. Masks are worn in theatrical epics, especially those related to the Ramayana and the Mahabharata .

Of the Philippines' over 100 ethnic groups, the most accessorized may be the Kalinga people.

[ 160 ] The Gaddang people also use many accessories.

[ 161 ] The best-known accessory is the lingling-o , a pendant or amulet used from Batanes in the north to Palawan in the south.

[ 162 ] [ 163 ] The oldest known lingling-o has been dated to 500 BC and is made of nephrite .

[ 163 ] Shells have also traditionally been used for accessories.

[ 164 ] Gold is crafted by Filipino ethnic groups, and the country's best-known goldsmiths came from Butuan .

Regalia , jewelry, ceremonial weapons, tooth ornamentation, and ritualistic and funerary objects made of high-quality gold have been found at a number of sites, and the archipelago's gold culture flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries.
