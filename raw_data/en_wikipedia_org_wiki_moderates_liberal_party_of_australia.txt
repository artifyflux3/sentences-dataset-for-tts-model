[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The faction has been described as centre [ 6 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] to centre-right .

[ 12 ] The faction has supported ideologies such as economic liberalism , centrism and social liberalism , having a combination of economically liberal and socially progressive views. Since May 2025, the offices of Leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition have been occupied by Sussan Ley , who is the first woman to hold either position. She is a member of the Moderates and identifies as a republican , as do many other members of the Liberal Party.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] They compete with the Liberal Party's other two major factions: the Centre Right and the National Right .

Geographical base [ edit ] Moderate Liberals often represent inner-city and wealthy House of Representatives seats or are in the Senate .

[ 15 ] The Moderates are noted as having very little presence in the states of Queensland and Western Australia ; however, in Victoria , the nominal Moderate faction is not affiliated with those of the other states.

[ 15 ] The Moderates are the dominant faction in New South Wales and have provided all of the past three Liberal leaders in Tasmania (all of whom served as Premier ).

[ citation needed ] Membership [ edit ] Prominent moderates include former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , [ 16 ] former Foreign Affairs Minister and former Deputy Leader Julie Bishop , [ 17 ] former Defence Minister Christopher Pyne , [ 18 ] former Attorney-General George Brandis , [ 19 ] and former Liberal-turned-independent MP Julia Banks .

[ 20 ] Prominent moderates in the Morrison government included Senate leader Simon Birmingham , [ 21 ] Marise Payne , Paul Fletcher and Linda Reynolds .

[ 22 ] At the state level, three Liberal leaders are from this faction: Mark Speakman (the New South Wales Opposition Leader ), [ 23 ] , Jeremy Rockliff (the current Tasmanian Premier ) [ 24 ] and Vincent Tarzia (the South Australia Opposition Leader ). Prominent Moderates in New South Wales include Gladys Berejiklian (the 45th Premier of New South Wales ), [ 25 ] Matt Kean (the faction's leader in New South Wales and former deputy leader of the party), [ 26 ] Rob Stokes (a former Cabinet minister) [ 27 ] and Natalie Ward (the party's deputy leader in New South Wales).

[ 28 ] Prominent Moderates in other states include Georgie Crozier and David Southwick in Victoria; [ 29 ] John Gardner , Josh Teague (current South Australian Liberal deputy leader) and Tim Whetstone in South Australia ; [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and Peter Gutwein and Will Hodgman in Tasmania (who both served as Premier ).

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Current federal House members [ edit ] As of 4 July 2025 [update] .
