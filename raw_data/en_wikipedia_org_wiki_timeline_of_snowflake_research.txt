This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes. Artists, philosophers, and scientists have wondered at their shape, recorded them by hand or in photographs, and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes.

Wilson Alwyn Bentley (February 9, 1865 – December 23, 1931), also known as Snowflake Bentley, was an American meteorologist and photographer, who was the first known person to take detailed photographs of snowflakes and record their features.[1] He perfected a process of catching flakes on black velvet in such a way that their images could be captured before they either melted or sublimated.

Chronological list [ edit ] BC to 1900 [ edit ] 150 BCE [ 1 ] or 135 BCE [ 2 ] - Han Ying ( 韓嬰 ) compiled the anthology Han shi waizhuan , which includes a passage that contrasts the pentagonal symmetry of flowers with the hexagonal symmetry of snow.
