{\displaystyle \mu (A)=\mu (A\cap B)+\mu (A\setminus B).} For every set A ‚äÜ R n there exists a Borel set B ‚äÜ R n such that A ‚äÜ B and Œº ( A )¬†= Œº ( B ).

Notice that the set A need not be Œº -measurable: Œº ( A ) is however well defined as Œº is an outer measure.
An outer measure satisfying only the first of these two requirements is called a Borel measure , while an outer measure satisfying only the second requirement (with the Borel set B replaced by a measurable set B) is called a regular measure .

The Lebesgue outer measure on R n is an example of a Borel regular measure.

It can be proved that a Borel regular measure, although introduced here as an outer measure (only countably sub additive ), becomes a full measure ( countably additive ) if restricted to the Borel sets .
