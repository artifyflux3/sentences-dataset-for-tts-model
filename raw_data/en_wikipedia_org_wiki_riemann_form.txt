An alternating bilinear form α from Λ to the integers satisfying the following Riemann bilinear relations : the real linear extension α R : C g × C g → R of α satisfies α R ( iv , iw )=α R ( v , w ) for all ( v , w ) in C g × C g ; the associated hermitian form H ( v , w )=α R ( iv , w ) + i α R ( v , w ) is positive-definite .

(The hermitian form written here is linear in the first variable.) Riemann forms are important because of the following: The alternatization of the Chern class of any factor of automorphy is a Riemann form.

Conversely, given any Riemann form, we can construct a factor of automorphy such that the alternatization of its Chern class is the given Riemann form.

Furthermore, the complex torus C g /Λ admits the structure of an abelian variety if and only if there exists an alternating bilinear form α such that (Λ,α) is a Riemann form.
