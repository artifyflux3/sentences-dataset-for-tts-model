For places in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, see Rheide (disambiguation) .

In geology , a rheid / ˈ r iː ɪ d / is a substance whose temperature is below its melting point and whose deformation by viscous flow during the time of observation is at least three orders of magnitude (1,000 ×) greater than the elastic deformation under the given conditions.  A material is a rheid by virtue of the time of observation. The term, coined by S. Warren Carey in 1953, has the same Greek root as rheology , the science of viscoelasticity and nonlinear flow.

Types of rheids [ edit ] Almost any type of rock can behave as a rheid under appropriate conditions of temperature and pressure .  For example, the Earth 's mantle undergoes convection over long time-scales.  As the mantle supports the propagation of shear waves , it may be deduced that it is a solid and, therefore, behaving as a rheid when it undergoes said convection.

Granite has a measured viscosity at standard temperature and pressure of about 4.5×10 19 Pa·s [ 1 ] so it should be considered a rheid. Similarly halite , the mineral form of table salt , is a geological material that behaves as a rheid over relatively short time-periods.  As salt is buried by other types of sediments , it will often flow laterally towards regions of lower confining stress .  Through this mechanism, salt domes and other structures may form.  In some areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico , these structures often serve as traps for petroleum and natural gas .
