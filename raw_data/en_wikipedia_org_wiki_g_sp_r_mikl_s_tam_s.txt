Gáspár Miklós Tamás Born ( 1948-11-28 ) 28 November 1948 Cluj , Romania Died 15 January 2023 (2023-01-15) (aged 74) Budapest , Hungary Nationality Romanian Hungarian Education Education Babeș-Bolyai University Philosophical work Era 21st-century philosophy Region Western philosophy School Continental philosophy Libertarian socialism Main interests Political theory Notable ideas Post-fascism , ethnicism Signature Gáspár Miklós Tamás ( Hungarian : Tamás Gáspár Miklós ; 28 November 1948 – 15 January 2023), often referred to as TGM , [ 1 ] was a Romanian-born Hungarian political philosopher and public intellectual, influenced by Marxism and libertarian socialism . He was a contributor to online newspaper Mérce and to OpenDemocracy , where he wrote primarily about political and aesthetic questions. He was the father of British poet and writer Rebecca Tamás .

Biography [ edit ] Gáspár Miklós Tamás was born in today's Cluj , Romania, but emigrated to Budapest , Hungary, in 1978, where he lived for much of his life. His mother was Jewish and escaped being deported to Auschwitz because she was imprisoned for being a communist.

[ 2 ] As a dissident at the end of the state socialist period, he was initially a libertarian socialist . While in contact with libertarian authors, his perspective was distinct from the Budapest School , a major school of thought in Hungarian Neo-Marxism . He was also a member of the informal group called the " democratic opposition ".

[ citation needed ] From 1986 to 1988, he taught in the U.S., Britain, and France, and also continued his studies at Oxford University . At the beginning of the post-socialist era in 1989, he became committed to a liberal program, and was a leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ).

[ 3 ] As a representative of the party, he was a member of the Hungarian Parliament from 1989 to 1994, [ 4 ] and served the party's president through 1994, departing the party in 2000. He was a prominent democratic opponent of the Hungarian government under János Kádár [ 5 ] and Viktor Orbán .

[ 6 ] He became the Green Left 's president in 2010.

[ 7 ] Tamás was known for developing the concept of post-fascism [ 6 ] and the term ethnicism . In his words, Post-fascism finds its niche easily in the new world of global capitalism without upsetting the dominant political forms of electoral democracy and representative government. It does what I consider to be central to all varieties of fascism, including the post-totalitarian version. Sans Führer, sans one-party rule, sans SA or SS, post-fascism reverses the Enlightenment tendency to assimilate citizenship to the human condition.

Tamás died on 15 January 2023, at the age of 74.

[ 8 ] Personal life [ edit ] He described himself as a "conservative anarchist " [ 9 ] and a Marxist .
