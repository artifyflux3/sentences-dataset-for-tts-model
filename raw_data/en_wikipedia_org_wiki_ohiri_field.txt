Although the core of the Harvard campus is in Cambridge , the athletic complex lies within Boston. From its opening in 1983 [ 1 ] until 2010, it was home to the Harvard Crimson men's and women's soccer teams; with the opening of a new stadium now known as Jordan Field , [ 2 ] in September 2010, it has become the secondary home to both teams.

The stadium seats 1,500 people and has held as much as 5,200 people for NCAA tournament games.  It opened in 1983 and is named after former Harvard athlete Chris Ohiri.

Ohiri Field is notable for being the site of the first-ever napalm test on July 4, 1942.
