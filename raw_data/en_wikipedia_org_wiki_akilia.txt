Akilia is the location of a rock formation that has been proposed to contain the oldest known sedimentary rocks on Earth, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and perhaps the oldest evidence of life on Earth .

[ 3 ] Geology [ edit ] The rocks in question are part of a metamorphosed supracrustal sequence located at the south-western tip of the island. The sequence has been dated as no younger than 3.85 billion years old - that is,  in the Hadean eon - based on the age of an igneous band that cuts the rock.

[ 4 ] The supracrustal sequence contains layers rich in iron and silica , which are variously interpreted as banded iron formation , chemical sediments from submarine hot springs , or hydrothermal vein deposits.

Carbon in the rock, present as graphite , shows low levels of carbon-13 , [ 3 ] which may suggest an origin as isotopically light organic matter derived from living organisms.

[ 5 ] However, this interpretation is complicated because of high-grade metamorphism that  affected the Akilia rocks after their formation. The sedimentary origin, age and the carbon content of the rocks have been questioned.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] If the Akilia rocks do show evidence of life by 3.85 Ga, it would challenge models which suggest that Earth would not be hospitable to life at this time.
