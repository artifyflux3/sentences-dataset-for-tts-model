[ 50 ] Lending controversies [ edit ] Kochhar allegedly favoured Videocon Group in lending practices under influence of Deepak Kochhar and his close aide Sunil Bhuta.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] ICICI Bank said it has decided to institute an independent enquiry into the allegations.

[ 53 ] On 29 March 2018, the Indian Express first reported that Videocon group promoter Venugopal Dhoot provided crores of rupees allegedly to NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL), a firm he had set up with Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar and two relatives six months after the Videocon group got ₹3,250 crore as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012.

He allegedly transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for ₹9 lakh, six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank. The Videocon account was declared an NPA (Non-performing Assets) or a bad loan in 2017 according to the report. "The Income Tax department is also probing the acquisition of the swanky family residence of Chanda Kochhar, the CEO and MD of ICICI Bank, in South Mumbai by her husband Deepak Kochhar in a complex transaction involving firms linked to Videocon Group", reported the Indian Express.

The Indian Express also reported similar transactions and favourable loans granted by Kochhar allegedly to the Essar Group , which was also later classified as NPAs. Chanda Kochhar subsequently quit ICICI bank following these allegations and is currently being investigated.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] On 24 January 2019, Chanda, her husband Deepak, and industrialist Venugopal Dhoot were named in a CBI FIR for cheating and defrauding ICICI Bank to the tune of ₹1,730 crore. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) detailed the modus operandi and charged them with offences punishable under Section 120B (conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of IPC, section 7 (taking gratification) and 13(2) (criminal misconduct) read with 13(1)(d) (pecuniary advantage) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

[ 56 ] Following CBI action, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) lodged a case of money laundering against Chanda Kochhar in connection with loans disbursed by bank to the Videocon Group which later turned into NPAs.

[ 57 ] There are several public complaints sent to the Ministry of Finance , particular to the Union Finance Minister suggesting to withdraw esteemed civilian awards such as Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awarded to Chanda by the Union Government of India . The Enforcement Directorate attached the properties of Chanda Kochhar and her family in connection with the money laundering case on 10 January 2020. The book value of the attached assets was ₹78 crore according to ED.

[ 58 ] Chanda Kochhar was granted bail by the special PMLA court in February following her appearance before the court and honouring the summons issued against her. She has never been arrested in the case. The ED on 24 August 2021, Tuesday, submitted draft charges against Chanda Kochhar, her businessman-husband and other accused in a special PMLA court in connection with a money laundering case.

[ 59 ] The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) provided interim relief to Chanda Kochhar, against an order by markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on 14 June 2022, for not supplying the requisite documents to Kochhar. SAT directed Kochhar to file a fresh application before SEBI indicating the documents being sought for inspection.

[ 60 ] Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar have been arrested by Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday, 23 December 2022, in a case linked to alleged loan fraud charges.

[ 61 ] Chanda Kochhar, her husband, and Videocon Group's promoter, V N Dhoot, were charged with corruption in the Rs 3,250 crore loan fraud scam, in CBI's 11,000-page chargesheet lodged in late March 2023. On 26 June 2023 CBI said that Chanda Kochhar had conspired with the other accused and sanctioned credit facilities to the firms of the Videocon Group, which were ineligible for such loans. On 26 August 2009, a Rupee Term Loan (RTL) of Rs 300 crore was sanctioned to Videocon International Electronics Limited (VIEL) by the ICICI Bank. Out of the Rs 300 crore sanctioned to VIEL, Rs 64 crore was transferred by Dhoot to Deepak Kochhar's company. Thus, said CBI, Chanda accepted illegal gratification of Rs 64 crore as a reward and thereby misappropriated the bank's fund for her own use. Also, CBI argued that Chanda Kochhar got a flat in Churchgate transferred to her family trust, where Deepak was managing trustee, only for Rs 11 lakh in October 2016, whereas the flat was valued at Rs 5.25 crore in 1996.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] In September 2023, Kochhar and her husband were granted bail.

[ 64 ] In September 2024, the Supreme Court requested a response from Kochhar and Deepak in regards to the CBI's petition that challenges the Bombay High Court 's ruling that declared the Kocchar's arrest illegal.

[ 64 ] In November 2024, the Bombay High Court instructed the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) to avoid any coercive measures against Kochhar and the court also mandated that any questioning of her should occur strictly within standard working hours.

[ 65 ] The court order was in response to Kocchar's plea that she and her husband should be treated as senior citizens and not be subjected to extended questioning in the investigations.

[ 65 ] Personal life [ edit ] Kochhar resides in Mumbai, and is married to Deepak Kochhar, [ 66 ] [ 67 ] a wind energy entrepreneur and her business schoolmate. They have two children, a daughter [ 68 ] and a son.
