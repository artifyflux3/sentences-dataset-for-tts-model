Analogous to a supernova heralding the birth of a neutron star, a quark nova signals the creation of a quark star. The term quark-novae was coined in 2002 by Dr. Rachid Ouyed (currently at the University of Calgary , Canada) [ 1 ] and Drs. J. Dey and M. Dey (Calcutta University, India).

[ 2 ] The nova process [ edit ] When a neutron star spins down, [ further explanation needed ] it may convert to a quark star through a process known as quark deconfinement . The resultant star would have quark matter in its interior. The process would release immense amounts of energy, perhaps explaining the most energetic explosions in the universe; calculations have estimated that as much as 10 46 J could be released from the phase transition inside a neutron star.

[ 3 ] Quark-novae may be one cause of gamma ray bursts . According to Jaikumar and collaborators, they may also be involved in producing heavy elements such as platinum through r-process nucleosynthesis .

[ 4 ] Candidates [ edit ] Rapidly spinning neutron stars with masses between 1.5 and 1.8 solar masses are hypothetically the best candidates for conversion due to spin down of the star within a Hubble time . This amounts to a small fraction of the projected neutron star population. A conservative estimate based on this, indicates that up to two quark-novae may occur in the observable universe each day.

[ citation needed ] Hypothetically, quark stars would be radio-quiet, so radio-quiet neutron stars may be quark stars.

[ citation needed ] Observations [ edit ] Direct evidence for quark-novae is scant; however, recent observations of supernovae SN 2006gy , SN 2005gj and SN 2005ap may point to their existence.
