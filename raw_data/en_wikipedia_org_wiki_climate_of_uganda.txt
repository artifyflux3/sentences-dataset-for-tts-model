Uganda is located in Eastern Africa , West of Kenya , South of South Sudan , East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and North of Rwanda and Tanzania . While much of its border is on lakeshores, Uganda is landlocked with no access to the sea port but it is a fertile and well-watered country that consists of many lakes and rivers including the largest, Lake Victoria . The country sits in the heart of the Great Lakes region, with Lake Edward , Lake George and Lake Albert on its Western border, Lake Kyoga in the Eastern part of Uganda. It is found in Central Saharan Africa and receives reliable rainfall throughout the year. Rivers are River Nile the longest river in Africa, River Kagera , River Katonga , River Semiliki and River Sezibwa .

Equator Uganda2.jpg The climate is tropical and equatorial as well with two dry spells (December to February, June to August).

[ 1 ] While the Northeast of the country is semiarid [ 1 ] and Districts falling prey include Moroto, Kabong, Nakapiripiriti, Karenga. The terrain of Uganda mostly consist of plateaus surrounded by a rim of mountains including the Rwenzori mountain range.

[ 1 ] Notable national parks include Bwindi , Rwenzori Mountains which has snow on its peak, Margherita, Kibale , Mgahinga National Park , Mount Elgon National game Park , Kidepo National game Park and Queen Elizabeth National game Park , with thick forests to modify climate and to mention; Uganda's plant cover is Savannah.However, Forests also act as a source of Herbal Medicine.
Some geographical places like Jinja and Kapchorwa have water Springs like Muchsion falls, Bujagali falls, karuma falls and Sipii falls that aids Hydro Electric Power Generation and to cite out; Bujagali falls generates 5 MW that is exported to our physically disadvantaged neighbourhood in the names Rwanda and Burundi.

Inselbergs are common features in the geography of Uganda. The inselbergs are commonly made of granite , sometimes of gneiss and never of amphibolite or volcanic rock .

[ 2 ] Protruding quartzite hills tend to form ridges rather than "true inselbergs".

Climate [ edit ] Uganda has a warm tropical climate with temperatures falling in the 25 to 29 °C (77.0 to 84.2 °F) range on an average. The months from December to February are the hottest, but even during this season the evenings can be pleasant with temperatures in the 17 to 18 °C (62.6 to 64.4 °F) range.

[ 7 ] Most of Uganda receives an annual rainfall of 1,000 to 1,500 millimetres or 40 to 60 inches. The rainy seasons are from March to May and from September to November. During these months, heavy rains can make roads and terrains hard to traverse. The period from January to February and again from June to August are dry.

[ 7 ] In the north, there is only one rainy season from March to November, and a dry season from December to February.

[ edit ] Glaciers on the Rwenzori Mountains , like these on Mount Speke , are melting due to climate change.

Tea plantation in Uganda Women fighting food insecurity during harvests in dry season The effects of climate change in Uganda are increasingly severe, affecting the lives of the country's citizens and its environment.

[ 14 ] It has led to extreme weather events such as unpredictable, prolonged drought and rainfall .

[ 14 ] Uganda's climate is mostly tropical with regular rainfall and sunshine patterns. Due to climate change the seasons have changed, with the rainy season becoming more variable in length and droughts more ubiquitous, especially in eastern and northeastern Uganda.

[ 15 ] Climate trends have the potential to affect development of Uganda, due to the vulnerability of Uganda's diverse environment.
