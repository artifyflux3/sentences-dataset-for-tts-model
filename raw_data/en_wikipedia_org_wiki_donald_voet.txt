G. Voet) of Biochemistry and other textbooks.

Spouse Judith G. Voet Scientific career Fields Biochemistry Institutions University of Pennsylvania Thesis Some borane derivative structures (1967) Doctoral advisor William Lipscomb Other academic advisors Alexander Rich Donald Herman Voet (November 29, 1938 – April 11, 2023) was an American biochemist who was emeritus associate professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania . His laboratory used x-ray crystallography to understand structure-function relationships in proteins.

[ 1 ] He and his wife, Judith G. Voet , are authors of biochemistry text books that are widely used in undergraduate and graduate curricula.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Voet was born on November 29, 1938.

[ 6 ] He earned his B.S. in chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1960 and his Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard University with William N. Lipscomb, Jr.

in 1967.

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Career [ edit ] Voet completed his postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969 in the laboratory of Alexander Rich . He later became a professor in the chemistry department at the University of Pennsylvania. Voet and his wife were coeditors-in-chief of the journal Biochemical and Molecular Biology Education .

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] Death [ edit ] Voet died on April 11, 2023, at the age of 84.
