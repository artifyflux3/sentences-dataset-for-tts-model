In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and early [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), _**horror vacui**_ ([Latin:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")_horror of the vacuum_) or **plenism** ()—commonly stated as "**nature abhors a vacuum**", for example by [Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza "Spinoza")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-1)—is a hypothesis attributed to [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), later criticized by the [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") of [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") and [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius"), that nature contains no [vacuums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill the rarity of an incipient void.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Physica-2)

Aristotle also argued against the void in a more abstract sense: since a void is merely [nothingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing "Nothing"), following his teacher [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), nothingness cannot rightly be said to exist.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Furthermore, insofar as a void would be featureless, it could neither be encountered by the senses nor could its supposition lend additional explanatory power. [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") challenged the theory in the first century AD, but his attempts to create an artificial vacuum failed.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-genz-3) The theory was debated in the context of 17th-century [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics"), by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") and [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Shapin2011-4) among others, and through the early 18th century by [Sir Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Isaac_Newton "Sir Isaac Newton") and [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-sep-newton-stm-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Barrow2002-6)

As advanced by Aristotle in _Physics_:

> In a [void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy) "Void (astronomy)"), no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere; for why should it stop here rather than here? So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved [ad infinitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum "Ad infinitum"), unless something more powerful gets in its way.
> 
> 
> Further, things are now thought to move into the void because it yields; but in a void this quality is present equally everywhere, so that things should move in all directions.
> 
> 
> Further, the truth of what we assert is plain from the following considerations. We see the same weight or body moving faster than another for two reasons, either because there is a difference in what it moves through, as between water, air, and earth, or because, other things being equal, the moving body differs from the other owing to excess of weight or of lightness.
> 
> 
> Now the medium causes a difference because it impedes the moving thing, most of all if it is moving in the opposite direction, but in a secondary degree even if it is at rest; and especially a medium that is not easily divided, i.e. a medium that is somewhat dense. _A_, then, will move through _B_ in time _G_, and through _D_, which is thinner, in time _E_ (if the length of _B_ is equal to _D_), in proportion to the density of the hindering body. For let _B_ be water and _D_ air; then by so much as air is thinner and more incorporeal than water, _A_ will move through _D_ faster than through _B_. Let the speed have the same ratio to the speed, then, that air has to water. Then if air is twice as thin, the body will traverse _B_ in twice the time that it does _D_, and the time _G_ will be twice the time _E_. And always, by so much as the medium is more incorporeal and less resistant and more easily divided, the faster will be the movement.
> 
> 
> Now there is no ratio in which the void is exceeded by body, as there is no ratio of 0 to a number. For if 4 exceeds 3 by 1, and 2 by more than 1, and 1 by still more than it exceeds 2, still there is no ratio by which it exceeds 0; for that which exceeds must be divisible into the excess + that which is exceeded, so that will be what it exceeds 0 by + 0. For this reason, too, a line does not exceed a point unless it is composed of points! Similarly the void can bear no ratio to the full, and therefore neither can movement through the one to movement through the other, but if a thing moves through the thickest medium such and such a distance in such and such a time, it moves through the void with a speed beyond any ratio. For let _Z_ be void, equal in magnitude to _B_ and to _D_. Then if _A_ is to traverse and move through it in a certain time, _H_, a time less than _E_, however, the void will bear this ratio to the full. But in a time equal to _H_, _A_ will traverse the part _O_ of _A_. And it will surely also traverse in that time any substance _Z_ which exceeds air in thickness in the ratio which the time _E_ bears to the time _H_. For if the body _Z_ be as much thinner than _D_ as _E_ exceeds _H_, _A_, if it moves through _Z_, will traverse it in a time inverse to the speed of the movement, i.e. in a time equal to _H_. If, then, there is no body in _Z_, _A_ will traverse _Z_ still more quickly. But we supposed that its traverse of _Z_ when _Z_ was void occupied the time _H_. So that it will traverse _Z_ in an equal time whether _Z_ be full or void. But this is impossible. It is plain, then, that if there is a time in which it will move through any part of the void, this impossible result will follow: it will be found to traverse a certain distance, whether this be full or void, in an equal time; for there will be some body which is in the same ratio to the other body as the time is to the time.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Physica-2)

Plenism means "fullness", from Latin [plēnum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plenum#Latin "wikt:plenum"), English "plenty", cognate via Proto-Indo-European to "full". In [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), the term for the void is τὸ κενόν (_to kenón_).

The idea was restated as _"Natura abhorret vacuum"_ by [François Rabelais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais "François Rabelais") in his series of books titled [Gargantua and Pantagruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel "Gargantua and Pantagruel") in the 1530s.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Encarta-7) The theory was supported and restated by [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") in the early 17th century as _"Resistenza del vacuo"_. Galileo was surprised by the fact that water could not rise above a certain level in an aspiration tube in his [suction pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction_pump "Suction pump"), leading him to conclude that there is a limit to the phenomenon.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Dugas1988-8)[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") proposed a [plenic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plenum#English "wikt:plenum") interpretation of atomism to eliminate the void, which he considered incompatible with his concept of space.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-sep-newton-stm-5) The theory was rejected by later scientists, such as Galileo's pupil [Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli"), who repeated his experiment with [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)"). [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal") successfully repeated Galileo's and Torricelli's experiment and foresaw no reason why a perfect vacuum could not be achieved in principle.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-9) Scottish philosopher [Thomas Carlyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle "Thomas Carlyle") mentioned Pascal's experiment in the _[Edinburgh Encyclopædia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh\_Encyclop%C3%A6dia "Edinburgh Encyclopædia")_ in an 1823 article titled "Pascal".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui_(physics)#cite_note-Pascal-10)
