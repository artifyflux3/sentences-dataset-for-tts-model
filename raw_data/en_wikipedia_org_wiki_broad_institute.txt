Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (IPA: / b r oʊ d / , pronunciation respelling: BROHD ), [ 1 ] often referred to as the Broad Institute , is a biomedical and genomic research center located in Cambridge , Massachusetts , United States . The institute is independently governed and supported as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc., [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and it partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Harvard University , and the five Harvard teaching hospitals .

History [ edit ] The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists.

[ 4 ] One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of Whitehead Institute at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the Human Genome Project . As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by Harvard Medical School in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.

[ 5 ] Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002–2003 among philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad , MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Brigham and Women's Hospital , Children's Hospital Boston , the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute and the Massachusetts General Hospital ).

The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the institute.

[ 6 ] On September 4, 2008, the Broads announced an endowment of $400 million to make the Broad Institute a permanent establishment.

[ 7 ] In November 2013, they invested an additional $100 million to fund a second decade of research at the institute.

[ 8 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States , the Broad Institute ran laboratory tests for the virus for about 100 colleges and universities in the northeastern U.S.

[ 9 ] As of September 2020, the Broad was processing one out of every 20 COVID-19 tests in the nation.

Organizational structure [ edit ] The Broad Institute has 24 core faculty [ 10 ] and 195 associate members from Harvard, MIT, and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals.

[ 11 ] The Broad Institute is made up of three types of organizational units: core member laboratories, research programs, and platforms. The institute's scientific research programs include: [ 12 ] Cancer Program Program in Medical and Population Genetics Genome Biology and Cell Circuits Program Chemical Biology Program Metabolism Program Infectious Disease Program Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program Epigenomics Program Vertebrate Genomics Program The Broad Institute's platforms are teams of professional scientists who focus on the discovery, development, and optimization of the technological tools that Broad and other researchers use to conduct research. The platforms include: [ 13 ] Data Sciences Platform [ 14 ] Genomics Platform Imaging Platform Metabolite Profiling Platform Proteomics Platform Genetic Perturbation Platform Therapeutics Platform Therapeutics Projects Group The Broad Institute also supports the Data Visualization Initiative led by the Institute creative director Bang Wong , which is aimed at developing data visualizations to explore and communicate research findings.

[ 15 ] Core members [ edit ] The faculty and staff of the Broad Institute include physicians, geneticists, and molecular, chemical, and computational biologists. The faculty currently includes 24 core members, [ 16 ] whose labs are primarily located within the Broad Institute, and 195 associate members, whose primary labs are located at one of the universities or hospitals.

Facilities [ edit ] Facilities Merkin Building (415 Main St) Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research (75 Ames Street) The Broad Institute's facilities at 320 Charles Street in Cambridge , Massachusetts , house one of the largest genome sequencing centers in the world. As WICGR (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the Human Genome Project .

In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research .

[ 23 ] This seven-story 231,000-square-foot (21,500 m 2 ) building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. It was designed by Architects Elkus Manfredi with Lab Planner McLellan Copenhagen and was awarded high honors by R&D Magazine .

[ 24 ] In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street.

[ 25 ] On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square-foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge's Kendall Square .
