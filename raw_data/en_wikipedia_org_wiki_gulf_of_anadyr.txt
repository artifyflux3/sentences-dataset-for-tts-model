It has a total surface area of 200,000 km 2 (77,000 sq mi) Location [ edit ] The bay is roughly rectangular and opens to the southeast. The corners are (clockwise from the south) Cape Navarin (another source says the adjacent Cape Thaddeus), Anadyr Estuary , Kresta Bay and Cape Chukotsky on the Chukchi Peninsula .  It is about 250 mi (217 nmi; 402 km) across. A long gravel bar runs along the northeast shore for about 45 miles (39 nmi; 72 km) east from Kresta Bay. The Gulf of Anadyr is covered with ice normally 10 months a year.

Whales such as bowhead and gray may appear close to shore.

Civilization [ edit ] The town of Anadyr , the administrative centre of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug , is located on the Anadyr Estuary.

Provideniya , on Komsomolskaya Bay (formerly Emma Harbor; a branch of Provideniya Bay ), and Egvekinot , on Kresta Bay, are the next largest coastal settlements.
