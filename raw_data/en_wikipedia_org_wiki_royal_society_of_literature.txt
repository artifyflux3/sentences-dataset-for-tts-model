A charity that represents the voice of literature in the UK, the RSL has about 800 Fellows, elected from among the best writers in any genre currently at work. Additionally, Honorary Fellows are chosen from those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of literature, including publishers, agents, librarians, booksellers or producers. The society is a cultural tenant at London's Somerset House . The RSL is an independent charity and relies on the support of its Members, Patrons, Fellows and friends to continue its work.

History [ edit ] The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) was founded in 1820, with the patronage of George IV , to "reward literary merit and excite literary talent", [ 1 ] and its first president was Thomas Burgess , Bishop of St David's (who was later translated as Bishop of Salisbury ). From the beginning of the 21st century, Presidents have served four-year terms and the RSL has employed a professional director to oversee its membership and outreach programmes.

[ 2 ] From 2018, the RSL's patron has been Queen Camilla , who took over in the role from Queen Elizabeth II .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Fellowship [ edit ] Official seal Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature : are elected annually and accorded the privilege of using the post-nominal letters FRSL. Traditionally around 14 new fellows per year were elected, with a total number of about 500 being maintained.

[ 2 ] To be nominated for fellowship, a writer must have published two works of literary merit, and nominations must be seconded by an RSL fellow. All nominations are presented to members of the Council of the Royal Society of Literature, who vote biannually to elect new fellows. Newly elected fellows are introduced at the Society's annual general meeting and summer party. While the President reads a citation for each, they are invited to sign their names in the roll book which dates back to 1820, Additionally, Honorary Fellows are chosen from those who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of literature, including publishers, agents, librarians, booksellers or producers, or who have rendered special service to the RSL.

[ 5 ] Past fellows include Samuel Taylor Coleridge , J. R. R. Tolkien , W. B. Yeats , Rudyard Kipling , Thomas Hardy , George Bernard Shaw , Arthur Koestler , Chinua Achebe , Ruth Prawer Jhabvala , Robert Ardrey , Sybille Bedford , Muriel Spark , P. J. Kavanagh , Hilary Mantel , and Sir Roger Scruton . Present Fellows include Margaret Atwood , Bernardine Evaristo , David Hare , Kazuo Ishiguro , Andrew Motion , Paul Muldoon , Zadie Smith , Nadeem Aslam , Sarah Waters , J. K. Rowling , and Nick Cave .

[ 6 ] A newly created fellow inscribes his or her name on the society's official roll using either Byron 's pen, T. S. Eliot 's fountain pen , which replaced Dickens 's quill in 2013, [ 7 ] or (as of 2018) George Eliot 's pen, [ 8 ] with pens belonging to Jean Rhys and Andrea Levy being additional choices from 2020.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 2018, the RSL launched  the initiative "40 Under 40", which saw the election of 40 new fellows aged under 40.

[ 11 ] In 2020, the RSL celebrated its 200th anniversary with the announcement of RSL 200, "a five-year festival launched with a series of major new initiatives and 60 new appointments championing the great diversity of writing and writers in the UK".

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Initiatives included RSL Open (electing new Fellows from communities, backgrounds and experiences currently under-represented in UK literary culture), [ 14 ] and RSL International Writers (recognising the contribution of writers across the globe to literature in English).

[ 13 ] RSL 200 resulted in more than 60 new fellows and honorary fellows being elected annually between 2021 and 2024.

[ 6 ] [ 15 ] There are now more than 800 FRSLs.

[ 16 ] From 2023, the RSL began to be criticized over the new diversity of fellowship [ 17 ] and for not taking a strong enough stance about the stabbing of Salman Rushdie and the cancellation of Kate Clanchy .

[ 18 ] In February 2024, President Bernardine Evaristo defended the RSL in The Guardian over the changes to fellowship and issues of freedom of speech , and stated that the RSL "cannot take sides in writers' controversies and issues, but must remain impartial." [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In reply, Rushdie commented on X : "Just wondering if the Royal Society of Literature is 'impartial' about attempted murder?" [ 21 ] Publication of the RSL's annual magazine was delayed in connection with an article mentioning Israel.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In February 2024 the RSL referred itself to the Charity Commission in response to what it described as a "sustained campaign of misinformation being made against it".

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] In January 2025, Director Molly Rosenberg and Chair Daljit Nagra stepped down from their positions, [ 15 ] [ 26 ] and, following an annual general meeting, it was announced that the RSL would be implementing a governance review under the new leadership of Ruth Scurr .

[ 27 ] Publications [ edit ] The society publishes an annual magazine, the RSL Review , which includes features, interviews and essays.

[ 28 ] In 2000, the RSL published a volume that provides a description and history of the society, written by one of its fellows, Isabel Quigly .

[ 2 ] Membership [ edit ] From 2012, the  RSL established a membership programme offering a variety of events to members and the general public. Membership of the RSL is open to all.

[ 29 ] Outreach [ edit ] In 2021, the RSL launched "Literature Matters: Reading Together", a project aiming to make recreational reading accessible to young people across the UK.
