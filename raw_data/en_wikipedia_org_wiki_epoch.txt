Look up _**[epoch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epoch "wiktionary:epoch")**_ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

In [chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology "Chronology") and [periodization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodization "Periodization"), an **epoch** or **reference epoch** is an [instant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant "Instant") in time chosen as the origin of a particular [calendar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era "Calendar era"). The "epoch" serves as a reference point from which time is measured.

The moment of epoch is usually decided by congruity, or by following conventions understood from the epoch in question. The epoch moment or date is usually defined from a specific, clear event of change, an _epoch event_. In a more gradual change, a [deciding moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_no_return "Point of no return") is chosen when the _epoch criterion_ was reached.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_][_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

*   The [Yoruba calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_calendar "Yoruba calendar") (_Kọ́jọ́dá_) uses 8042 BC as the epoch, regarded as the year of the creation of [Ile-Ife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ile-Ife "Ile-Ife") by the god [Obatala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obatala "Obatala"), also regarded as the creation of the earth.
*   _[Anno Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Mundi "Anno Mundi")_ [lit. "Year of the World"] (years since the creation of the world) is used in 
    *   the [Byzantine calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_calendar "Byzantine calendar") (5509 BC).
    *   the [Hebrew calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar") (3761 BC).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-2)

*   The [Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_Calendar "Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar") uses the creation of the fourth world in 3114 BC.
*   [Olympiads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad "Olympiad"), the ancient Greek era of four-year periods between [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games "Ancient Olympic Games"), beginning in 776 BC.
*   _[Ab urbe condita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab\_urbe\_condita "Ab urbe condita")_ ("from the foundation of [the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome")"), used to some extent by [Roman calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar "Roman calendar") of the Roman imperial period (753 BC).
*   [Buddhist calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_calendar "Buddhist calendar") tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha "Buddha")'s _[parinirvana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parinirvana "Parinirvana")_).
*   The term [Hindu calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar "Hindu calendar") may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the _[Vikram Samvat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram\_Samvat "Vikram Samvat")_ (58 BC),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-3) also used in modern times as the national calendars of [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal "Nepal") and [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh "Bangladesh").
*   The [Julian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar") and [Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") calendars use as epoch the [Incarnation of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity) "Incarnation (Christianity)") as calculated in the 6th century by [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus "Dionysius Exiguus").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-4) (Subsequent research has shown that this moment is about four years after the best estimate for the [date of birth of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_birth_of_Jesus "Date of birth of Jesus").) This epoch was applied retrospectively to the Julian calendar, long after its original creation by [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar").
*   The epoch of the [Islamic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar "Islamic calendar") is the _[Hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra\_(Islam) "Hijra (Islam)")_ (AD 622). The year count in this calendar shifts relative to the solar year count, as the calendar is [purely lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar "Lunar calendar"): its year consists of 12 [lunations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunation "Lunation") and is thus ten or eleven days shorter than a solar year. This calendar denotes "lunar years" as _Anno Hegiræ_ ([since] the year of the _[Hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra\_(Islam) "Hijra (Islam)")_) or _AH_. This calendar is used in [Sunni Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam") and related sects.
*   The epoch of the official [Iranian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars "Iranian calendars") is also the _Hijra_, but it is a [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar"); each year begins at the Northern spring equinox. This calendar is used in [Shia Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam "Shia Islam") and related sects.

*   The [Bahá'í calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_calendar "Bahá'í calendar") is dated from the [vernal equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox") of the year the [Báb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1b "Báb") proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in _Váḥids_ of 19 years, and _Kull-i-Shay_ of 361 (19×19) years.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-5)
*   In [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand") in 1888 King [Chulalongkorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulalongkorn "Chulalongkorn") decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok "Bangkok") on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Thailand "Prime Minister of Thailand")[Phibunsongkhram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaek_Pibulsonggram "Plaek Pibulsonggram") decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [Thai solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_solar_calendar "Thai solar calendar") using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
*   In the [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar "French Republican Calendar"), a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [French First Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Republic "French First Republic") was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the _[Ancien Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien\_Regime "Ancien Regime")_).
*   The [Indian national calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_national_calendar "Indian national calendar"), introduced in 1957, follows the [Saka era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka_era "Saka era") (AD 78).
*   The [Minguo calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minguo_calendar "Minguo calendar") used by officials of [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") and [its predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%9349) "Republic of China (1912–49)") dates from January 1, 1912, the first year after the [Xinhai Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution "Xinhai Revolution"), which overthrew the [Qing Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty").
*   [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") used a system that starts in 1912 (= [Juche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche "Juche") 1), the year of the birth of its founder [Kim Il-Sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-Sung "Kim Il-Sung") until 2024.
*   The [Fascist Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_Fascista "Era Fascista") dates to [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussolini "Mussolini")'s [March on Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Rome "March on Rome") in 1922, and was in use only in countries under hegemony of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. It has been defunct since the fall of the [Italian Social Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Social_Republic "Italian Social Republic") in 1945.
*   In the scientific [Before Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present") system of numbering years for purposes of [radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating "Radiocarbon dating"), the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the specific date January 1 is quite unnecessary, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#cite_note-7)
*   Different branches of [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry "Freemasonry") have selected different years to date their documents according to a Masonic era, such as the _[Anno Lucis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Lucis "Anno Lucis")_ (A.L.).
*   The [Holocene calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar "Holocene calendar") uses 10,000 BC as the epoch, the beginning of the [Holocene epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_epoch "Holocene epoch") on the [geological time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_time_scale "Geological time scale").

The official [Japanese system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_era_name "Japanese era name") numbers years from the accession of the current [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan "Emperor of Japan"), regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. A similar [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_era_name "Chinese era name") existed in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the [Xuantong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuantong "Xuantong") period). With the establishment of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) "Republic of China (1912–1949)") in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

*   Events in the [_Star Wars_ universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_universe "Star Wars universe") are conventionally dated using an epoch of the [Battle of Yavin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin "Battle of Yavin").
*   Events in the [Avatar: The Last Airbender universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_(franchise) "Avatar: The Last Airbender (franchise)") are conventionally dated using an epoch of the genocide of the air nomads.

An [epoch in computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing) "Epoch (computing)") is the time at which the representation is zero. For example, [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time "Unix time") is represented as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, not counting [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second "Leap second").

An [epoch in astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)") is a reference time used for consistency in calculation of positions and orbits. A common astronomical epoch is J2000, which is noon on January 1, 2000, [Terrestrial Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time").

An epoch in [geochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology "Geochronology") is a [time period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_period "Time period"), typically in the order of tens of millions of years. The current epoch is the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene").
