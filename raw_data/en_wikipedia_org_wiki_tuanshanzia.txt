Proterozoic Archean Had.

Tuanshanzia linearis Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: incertae sedis Genus: Tuanshanzia Yan, 1995 Type species Tuanshanzia lanceolata Yan, 1995 Species T. parva Chen et al., 2023 T. linearis Chen et al., 2023 T. fasciaria Yan and Liu, 1997 T. platyphylla Yan and Liu, 1997 Tuanshanzia is a genus of Proterozoic eukaryote, known from several locations across China and India, including the Gaoyuzhuang and Chuanlinggou formations, the eponymous Tuanshanzi Formation, [ 1 ] as well as the Vindhya Basin.

[ 2 ] It is probably an alga , although its exact classification is currently unclear.

Tuanshanzia seems to be part of a wider group of elongate Proterozoic algae, alongside Changchengia and Eopalmaria .

[ 3 ] Description [ edit ] A restoration of Tuanshanzia fasciaria Tuanshanzia specimens range from 4 to 30 cm (1.6 to 11.8 in) long, and are often preserved as carbonaceous films with a wide range of shapes, varying by species. The type, T. lanceolata has a lanceolate shape, whereas other species have shapes ranging from oval to elongated. As a form taxon, Tuanshanzia is likely paraphyletic , although as no practical alternative exists it remains a valid genus. The genus is named after the Tuanshanzi Formation, where it was first discovered, while the various species are named after their morphology.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 2 ] Many of the specimens from the Tuanshanzi Formation are likely microbial mat fragments due to their rough edges and irregularity, however some are likely actual algae due to smooth and regular margins, alongside carbon isotope analysis showing similarities to eukaryotes.
