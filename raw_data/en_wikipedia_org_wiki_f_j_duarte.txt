A. Piper Other academic advisors J. C. Ward R. E. Aitchison Francisco Javier "Frank" Duarte (born c. 1954) is a laser physicist and author/editor of several books on tunable lasers .

[ 1 ] His research on physical optics and laser development has won several awards, including an Engineering Excellence Award in 1995 for the invention of the N-slit laser interferometer .

Research [ edit ] Laser oscillators [ edit ] Duarte and Piper introduced multiple-prism near-grazing-incidence grating cavities which originally were disclosed as copper-laser -pumped narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillators.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Subsequently, he developed narrow-linewidth multiple-prism grating configurations for high-power CO 2 laser oscillators [ 4 ] and solid-state tunable organic laser oscillators.

[ 5 ] [ citation needed ] Intracavity dispersion theory [ edit ] Duarte also conceived the multiple-prism dispersion theories for tunable narrow-linewidth laser oscillators , [ 6 ] and multiple-prism laser pulse compression , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] which are summarized in several of his books.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The introduction to this theory is the generalized multiple-prism dispersion equation [ 6 ] ∇ ∇ λ λ ϕ ϕ 2 , m = H 2 , m ∇ ∇ λ λ n m + ( k 1 , m k 2 , m ) − − 1 ( H 1 , m ∇ ∇ λ λ n m ± ± ∇ ∇ λ λ ϕ ϕ 2 , ( m − − 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \nabla _{\lambda }\phi _{2,m}=H_{2,m}\nabla _{\lambda }n_{m}+(k_{1,m}k_{2,m})^{-1}{\bigg (}H_{1,m}\nabla _{\lambda }n_{m}\pm \nabla _{\lambda }\phi _{2,(m-1)}{\bigg )}} which has found a variety of applications.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Tunable lasers for isotope separation [ edit ] His tunable narrow-linewidth laser oscillator configurations [ 3 ] [ 14 ] have been adopted by various research groups working  on uranium atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS).

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] This work was supported by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission .

[ 14 ] During the course of this research, Duarte writes that he did approach the then federal minister for energy, Sir John Carrick , to advocate for the introduction of an AVLIS facility in Australia.

[ 18 ] In 2002, he participated in research that led to the isotope separation of lithium using narrow-linewidth tunable diode lasers .

[ 19 ] Solid state organic dye lasers [ edit ] From the mid-1980s to early 1990s Duarte and scientists from the US
Army Missile Command developed ruggedized narrow-linewidth laser oscillators tunable directly in the visible spectrum.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] This constituted the first disclosure, in the open literature, of a tunable narrow-linewidth laser tested on a rugged terrain.  This research led to experimentation with polymer gain media and in 1994 Duarte reported on the first narrow-linewidth tunable solid state dye laser oscillators.

[ 5 ] These dispersive oscillator architectures were then refined to yield single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle .

[ 22 ] Organic gain media [ edit ] Joint research, with R. O. James, on solid-state organic-inorganic materials, led to the discovery of polymer- nanoparticle gain media and to the emission of tunable low-divergence homogeneous laser beams from this class of media.

[ 23 ] In 2005, Duarte and colleagues were the first to demonstrate    directional coherent emission from an electrically excited organic semiconductor .

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] These experiments utilized a tandem OLED within an integrated interferometric configuration.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Duarte's work in this area began with the demonstration of narrow-linewidth laser emission using coumarin -tetramethyl dyes [ 26 ] [ 27 ] which offer high conversion efficiency and wide tunability in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

[ 28 ] Interferometry and quantum optics [ edit ] Duarte and colleagues demonstrated the superposition of diffraction patterns over N -slit interferograms.  This interferogram corresponds to the interferometric character b ( N = 3 slits) and exhibits a diffraction pattern superimposed on the right outer wing (see text).

In the late 1980s, he invented the digital N -slit laser interferometer for applications in imaging and microscopy .

[ 29 ] Concurrently, he applied Dirac’s notation to describe quantum mechanically its interferometric and propagation characteristics.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] A further innovation in this interferometer was the use of extremely elongated Gaussian beams, width to height ratios of up to 2000:1, for 
sample illumination.

[ 32 ] This research  also led to the generalized N-slit interferometric equation that was then applied to describe classical optics phenomena such as interference , diffraction , refraction , and reflection , in a generalized and unified quantum approach [ 33 ] [ 34 ] that includes positive and negative refraction.

[ 35 ] He also derived the cavity linewidth equation , for dispersive laser oscillators, using quantum mechanical principles.

[ 36 ] Further developments include very large N -slit laser interferometers to generate and propagate interferometric characters for secure free-space optical communications .

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Interferometric characters is a term coined in 2002 to link interefometric signals to alphanumerical characters (see figure's legend).

[ 37 ] These experiments provided the first observation of diffraction patterns superimposed over propagating interference signals, thus demonstrating non-destructive (or soft) interception of propagating interferograms.

[ 38 ] A spin-off of this research, with applications to the aviation industry, resulted from the discovery that N -slit laser interferometers are very sensitive detectors of clear air turbulence .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] Duarte provides a description of quantum optics, almost entirely via Dirac's notation, in his book Quantum Optics for Engineers .

[ 40 ] In this book he derives the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement, | ψ ψ ⟩ = 1 2 ( | x ⟩ 1 | y ⟩ 2 − − | y ⟩ 1 | x ⟩ 2 ) {\displaystyle \left|\psi \right\rangle ={1 \over {\sqrt {2}}}(\left|x\right\rangle _{1}\left|y\right\rangle _{2}-\left|y\right\rangle _{1}\left|x\right\rangle _{2})} which he calls the Pryce - Ward probability amplitude, from an N -slit interferometric perspective.  It is this | ψ ψ ⟩ {\displaystyle \left|\psi \right\rangle } that becomes the probability | ψ ψ ⟩ | ψ ψ ⟩ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \left|\psi \right\rangle \left|\psi \right\rangle ^{*}} disclosed by Pryce and Ward.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Duarte also emphasizes a pragmatic non-interpretational approach to quantum mechanics.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 44 ] Career [ edit ] Macquarie University [ edit ] At Macquarie University , Duarte studied quantum physics under John Clive Ward and semiconductor physics under Ronald Ernest Aitchison .  His PhD research was on laser physics and his supervisor was James A. Piper .

In the area of university politics, he established and led the Macquarie science reform movement , [ 45 ] [ 46 ] that transformed the degree structure of the university.  Macquarie's science reform, was widely supported by local scientists including physicists R. E. Aitchison , R. E. B. Makinson , A. W. Pryor , and J. C. Ward .
In 1980, Duarte was elected as one of the Macquarie representatives to the Australian Union of Students from where he was expelled, and then reinstated, for "running over the tables." [ citation needed ] Following completion of his PhD work, Duarte did post doctoral research, with B. J. Orr at the University of New South Wales , and then back at Macquarie University .

American phase [ edit ] In 1983, Duarte traveled to the United States to assume a physics professorship at the University of Alabama .  In 1985 he joined the Imaging Research Laboratories, at the Eastman Kodak Company , where he remained until 2006.  While at Kodak he was chairman of Lasers '87 and subsequent conferences in this series.

[ 47 ] Duarte has had a long association with the US Army Missile Command and the US Army Aviation and Missile Command , where he has participated (with R. W. Conrad and T. S. Taylor [ 21 ] ) in directed energy research.

He was elected Fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics in 1987) and a Fellow of the Optical Society of America in 1993.

[ 48 ] In 1995, he received the Engineering Excellence Award for "the invention of an electrooptic coherent interferometer for direct applications to imaging diagnostics of  transparent surfaces, such as photographic film and film substrates.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] and in 2016, he was awarded the David Richardson Medal for "seminal contributions to the physics and technology of multiple-prism arrays for narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillators and laser pulse compression," [ 51 ] from the Optical Society.

Personal [ edit ] Duarte's polarization rotator Duarte was born in Santiago, Chile , and traveled to Sydney, Australia , as a teenager.  There, he lived first in Strathfield and then in the northern small town of Cowan .  In the  United States he resided for a brief period in Tuscaloosa, Alabama , and then moved to Western New York .
