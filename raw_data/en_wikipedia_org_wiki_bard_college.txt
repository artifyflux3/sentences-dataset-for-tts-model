The campus overlooks the Hudson River and Catskill Mountains within the Hudson River Historic District and is a National Historic Landmark .

Founded in 1860, the institution consists of a liberal arts college and a conservatory . The college offers undergraduate and graduate programs.

[ 4 ] The college has a network of over 35 affiliated programs, institutes, and centers, spanning twelve cities, five U.S. states, seven countries, and four continents.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] Origins and early years [ edit ] John Bard , founder of St. Stephen's College During much of the nineteenth century, the land since owned by Bard was mainly composed of several country estates . These estates were called Blithewood, Bartlett, Sands and Ward Manor/Almont.

[ 6 ] A map c.

1867 showing the various estates in the Town of Red Hook In 1853, John Bard and Margaret Bard purchased a part of the Blithewood estate and renamed it Annandale. John Bard was the grandson of Samuel Bard , a prominent doctor, a founder of Columbia University 's medical school ,  and physician to George Washington .

[ 7 ] John Bard was also the nephew of John McVickar, a professor at Columbia University .

[ 8 ] The family had strong connections with the Episcopal Church .

[ 9 ] The following year, in 1854, John and Margaret established a parish school on their estate in order to educate the area's children. A wood-frame cottage , known today as Bard Hall, served as a school on weekdays and a chapel on weekends. In 1857, the Bards expanded the parish by building the Chapel of the Holy Innocents next to Bard Hall.

[ 10 ] During this time, John Bard remained in close contact with the New York leaders of the Episcopal Church. The church suggested that he found a theological college .

[ 11 ] With the promise of outside financial support, John Bard donated the unfinished chapel, and the surrounding 18 acres (7.3 ha), to the diocese in November 1858. In March 1860, "St. Stephen's College" was founded. In 1861, construction began on the first St. Stephen's College building, a stone collegiate Gothic dormitory called Aspinwall, after early trustee John Lloyd Aspinwall, brother of William Henry Aspinwall . During its initial years, the college relied on wealthy benefactors, like trustee Cornelius Vanderbilt , for funding.

[ 12 ] The college began taking shape within four decades. In 1866, Ludlow Hall, an administrative building, was erected. Preston Hall was built in 1873 and used as a refectory. A set of four dormitories, collectively known as Stone Row, were completed in 1891. And in 1895, the Greek Revival Hoffman Memorial Library was built.

[ 13 ] The school officially changed its name to Bard College in 1934 in honor of its founder.

[ 14 ] Growth and secularization [ edit ] In the 20th century, social and cultural changes amongst New York's high society would bring about the demise of the great estates. In 1914, Louis Hamersley purchased the fire-damaged Ward Manor/Almont estate and erected a Tudor style mansion and gatehouse, or what is today known as Ward Manor.

[ 15 ] Hamersley expanded his estate in 1926 by acquiring the abandoned Cruger's Island estate. That same year, after Hamersley's combined estate was purchased by William Ward, it was donated to charity and served as a retirement home for almost four decades.

[ 16 ] By the mid-1900s, Bard's campus significantly expanded. The Blithewood estate was donated to the college in 1951, and in 1963, Bard purchased 90 acres (36 ha) of the Ward Manor estate, including the main manor house. The rest of the Ward Manor estate became the 900-acre (360 ha) Tivoli Bays nature preserve .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In 1919, Bernard Iddings Bell became Bard's youngest president at the age of 34. His adherence to classical education, decorum, and dress eventually clashed with the school's push towards Deweyism and secularization, and he resigned in 1933.

[ 19 ] In 1928, Bard merged with Columbia University , serving as an undergraduate school similar to Barnard College . Under the agreement, Bard remained affiliated with the Episcopal Church and retained control of its finances. The merger raised Bard's prestige; however, it failed to provide financial support to the college during the Great Depression .

[ 20 ] So dire was Bard's financial situation that in 1932, then-Governor of New York and College trustee Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a telegram to the likes of John D. Rockefeller Jr.

, George Eastman and Frederick William Vanderbilt requesting donations for the college.

[ 21 ] On May 26, 1933, Donald Tewksbury , a Columbia professor, was appointed dean of the college. Although dean for only four years, Tewksbury had a lasting impact on the school. Tewksbury, an educational philosopher, had extensive ideas regarding higher education. While he was dean, Tewksbury steered the college into a more secular direction and changed its name from St. Stephen's to Bard. He also placed a heavy academic emphasis on the arts, something atypical of colleges at the time, and set the foundations for Bard's Moderation and Senior Project requirement.

[ 20 ] [ 22 ] While Tewksbury never characterized Bard's curriculum as " progressive ," the school would later be considered an early adopter of progressive education. In his 1943 study of early progressive colleges, titled General Education in the Progressive College , Louis T. Benezet used Bard as one of his three case studies .

[ 20 ] [ 23 ] During the 1940s, Bard provided a haven for intellectual refugees fleeing Europe. These included Hannah Arendt , the political theorist, Stefan Hirsch , the precisionist painter; Felix Hirsch , the political editor of the Berliner Tageblatt ; the violinist Emil Hauser; the linguist Hans Marchand ; the noted psychologist Werner Wolff; and the philosopher Heinrich Blücher .

[ 20 ] Arendt is buried at Bard, alongside her husband Heinrich Blücher, as is eminent novelist Philip Roth .

[ 24 ] In 1944, as a result of World War II , enrollment significantly dropped putting financial stress on the college. In order to increase enrollment, the college became co-educational, thereby severing all ties with Columbia. The college became an independent, secular, institution in 1944. Enrollment more than doubled, from 137 students in 1944, to 293 in 1947.

[ 25 ] Late twentieth and early twenty-first century [ edit ] Donald Fagen and Walter Becker 's experiences at Bard prompted them to write the 1973 song " My Old School " for their rock group, Steely Dan .

[ 26 ] The song was motivated by the 1969 drug bust at Bard in which the college administration colluded.

[ 27 ] The DA involved was G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate notoriety.

[ 28 ] Fagen wrote another Steely Dan song, " Rikki Don't Lose That Number ", about novelist, artist and former Bard faculty spouse Rikki Ducornet .

[ 29 ] In 2020, Bard College and Central European University became the founding members of the Open Society University Network, a collaborative global education initiative endowed with US$1 billion. As part of this new initiative, the college received a US$100 million gift from the Open Society Foundations which ranks among the largest financial contributions to a U.S. institution in recent history.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 2021, philanthropist George Soros made a $500 million endowment pledge to Bard College. It is one of the largest pledges of money ever made to higher education in the United States.

[ 32 ] In June 2021, Bard College was declared an " undesirable organization " in Russia, becoming the first international higher education organization to be branded with this designation.

[ 33 ] Bard president Botstein hypothesized that this tag was due their association with and funding from the Open Society Foundations which was also classified as undesirable in Russia and related conspiracy theories about George Soros .

[ 34 ] College leaders [ edit ] At various times, the leaders of the college have been titled president, warden or dean.

[ 35 ] They are listed below: George Franklin Seymour (1860–1861) Thomas Richey (1861–1863) Robert Brinckerhoff Fairbairn (1863–1898) Lawrence T. Cole (1899–1903) Thomas R. Harris (1904–1907) William Cunningham Rodgers (1909–1919) Bernard Iddings Bell (1919–1933) Donald George Tewksbury (1933–1937) Harold Mestre (1938–1939) Charles Harold Gray (1940–1946) Edward C. Fuller (1946–1950) James Herbert Case Jr.

(1950–1960) Reamer Kline (1960–1974) Leon Botstein (1975–present) Campus [ edit ] The campus of Bard College is in Annandale-on-Hudson , a hamlet in Dutchess County, New York , United States, in the town of Red Hook . It contains more than 70 buildings with a total gross building space of 1,167,090 sq ft (108,426 m 2 ) and was listed as a census-designated place in 2020.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Campus buildings represent varied architectural styles , but the campus remains heavily influenced by the Collegiate Gothic and Postmodern styles.

Bard's historic buildings are associated with the early development of the college and the history of the Hudson River estates ( see Bard College History ).

[ 15 ] During a late twentieth-century building boom, the college embraced a trend of building signature buildings designed by prominent architects like Venturi , Gehry , and Viñoly .

[ 38 ] In January 2016, Bard purchased Montgomery Place , a 380-acre (150 ha) estate adjacent to the Bard campus, with significant historic and cultural assets. The estate consists of a historic mansion, a farm, and some 20 smaller buildings. The college purchased the property from Historic Hudson Valley, the historical preservation organization that had owned Montgomery Place since the late 1980s. The addition of this property brings Bard's total campus size to nearly 1,000 acres (400 ha) along the Hudson River in Annandale-on-Hudson , New York.

[ 39 ] In late 2023, Bard purchased 260 acres of land adjacent to the Montgomery Place campus in Barrytown , which used to be the campus of the Unification Theological Seminary . The property, originally owned by the Livingston and later Aspinwall families, features a mansion designed by William Appleton Potter . It was acquired by the De La Salle Brothers in 1928, who completed a large seminary and normal institute there in 1931. In turn, the property was sold in 1974 to the Unification Church .

[ 40 ] Bard intended to use the space to provide new studios for the Center for Human Rights and the Arts and administrative offices for the Open Society University Network (OSUN) , of which Bard is a founding member. However, Bard College at Simon's Rock announced that it would be moving into the property in fall 2025.

[ 41 ] The purchase of the property brings Bard's total acreage to 1260 acres (510 ha).

[ 42 ] The area around the campus first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census, [ 43 ] with a population of 358.

[ 44 ] The college has an amount of housing for faculty members.

[ 45 ] School-age dependents in this faculty housing are in the Red Hook Central School District (the CDP is within this school district).
