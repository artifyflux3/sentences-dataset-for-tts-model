Overview [ edit ] The closed-loop transfer function is measured at the output. The output signal can be calculated from the closed-loop transfer function and the input signal.  Signals may be waveforms , images , or other types of data streams .

An example of a closed-loop block diagram, from which a transfer function may be computed, is shown below: The summing node and the G ( s ) and H ( s ) blocks can all be combined into one block, which would have the following transfer function: Y ( s ) X ( s ) = G ( s ) 1 + G ( s ) H ( s ) {\displaystyle {\dfrac {Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\dfrac {G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}}} G ( s ) {\displaystyle G(s)} is called the feed forward transfer function, H ( s ) {\displaystyle H(s)} is called the feedback transfer function, and their product G ( s ) H ( s ) {\displaystyle G(s)H(s)} is called the open-loop transfer function .

Derivation [ edit ] We define an intermediate signal Z (also known as error signal ) shown as follows: Using this figure we write: Y ( s ) = G ( s ) Z ( s ) {\displaystyle Y(s)=G(s)Z(s)} Z ( s ) = X ( s ) − − H ( s ) Y ( s ) {\displaystyle Z(s)=X(s)-H(s)Y(s)} Now, plug the second equation into the first to eliminate Z(s): Y ( s ) = G ( s ) [ X ( s ) − − H ( s ) Y ( s ) ] {\displaystyle Y(s)=G(s)[X(s)-H(s)Y(s)]} Move all the terms with Y(s) to the left hand side, and keep the term with X(s) on the right hand side: Y ( s ) + G ( s ) H ( s ) Y ( s ) = G ( s ) X ( s ) {\displaystyle Y(s)+G(s)H(s)Y(s)=G(s)X(s)} Therefore, Y ( s ) ( 1 + G ( s ) H ( s ) ) = G ( s ) X ( s ) {\displaystyle Y(s)(1+G(s)H(s))=G(s)X(s)} ⇒ ⇒ Y ( s ) X ( s ) = G ( s ) 1 + G ( s ) H ( s ) {\displaystyle \Rightarrow {\dfrac {Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\dfrac {G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}}} See also [ edit ] Federal Standard 1037C Open-loop controller Control theory § Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control References [ edit ] This article incorporates public domain material from Federal Standard 1037C .
