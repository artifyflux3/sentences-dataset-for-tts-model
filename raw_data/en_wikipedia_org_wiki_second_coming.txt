The idea is based on messianic prophecies and is part of most Christian eschatologies .

In Islamic eschatology , Jesus ( ʿĪsā ibn Maryam ) is also believed to return in the end times. According to Islamic belief, he will descend from Heaven to defeat the false messiah ( al-Masih ad-Dajjal ), restore justice, and reaffirm monotheism. His return is regarded as one of the major signs of the Day of Judgment , and he is viewed as a revered prophet, not divine, in Islamic theology.

[ 1 ] Other faiths have various interpretations of it.

Terminology [ edit ] See also: Theophany and Christophany Several different terms are used to refer to the Second Coming of Christ: In the New Testament , the Greek word ἐπιφάνεια ( epiphaneia , appearing) is used six times to refer to the return of Christ.

[ 2 ] The Greek New Testament uses the Greek term parousia (παρουσία, meaning "arrival", "coming", or "presence") 24 times, seventeen of them concerning Christ. However, parousia has the distinct reference to a period of time rather than an instant in time. At Matthew 24:37 , the word parousia is used to clearly describe the period of time in which Noah lived. The Greek word eleusis , which means "coming", is not interchangeable with parousia . So this parousia or "presence" would be unique and distinct from anything that had occurred before.

[ 3 ] The word is also used six times referring to individuals ( Stephanas , Fortunatus and Achaicus , [ 4 ] Titus , [ 5 ] and Paul the Apostle [ 6 ] ) and once referring to the "coming of the lawless one ".

[ 7 ] Gustav Adolf Deissmann (1908) [ 8 ] showed that the Greek word parousia occurred as early as the 3rd century BC to describe the visit of a king or dignitary to a city – a visit arranged in order to show the visitor's magnificence to the people.

In Islam, the term Rajʽa ( Arabic : الرجعة , romanized : al-rajʿah , lit.

'Return') refers to the Second Coming.

[ 9 ] The term is most commonly used by Shia Muslims .

[ 9 ] Specific date predictions and claims [ edit ] Main article: Predictions and claims for the Second Coming Views about the nature of the Second Coming vary among Christian denominations and among individual Christians. Many specific dates have been predicted for the Second Coming, some now in the distant past, others still in the future.

He will come again in his glory to judge the living and the dead , and his kingdom will have no end. ... We look for the resurrection of the dead , and the life of the world to come .

A 2010 survey showed that about 40% of Americans believe that Jesus is likely to return by 2050. This varies from 58% of white evangelical Christians, through 32% of Catholics to 27% of white mainline Protestants.

[ 11 ] Belief in the Second Coming was popularised in the US in the late nineteenth century by the evangelist Dwight L. Moody and the premillennial interpretation became one of the core components of Christian fundamentalism in the 1920s.

Early Christianity [ edit ] See also: Olivet Discourse § Imminence , and Historical Jesus § Apocalyptic prophet Jesus told his disciples , Truly I tell you, this generation [greek: genea ] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

— Matthew 24:34–35, Mark 13:30–31, Luke 21:32–33 [ 12 ] The most common English translation of genea is "generation", [ 13 ] which led some to conclude that the Second Coming was to be witnessed by the people living in the same generation as Jesus. According to historian Charles Freeman , early Christians expected Jesus to return within a generation of his death, and the non-occurrence of the second coming surprised them.

[ 14 ] N. T. Wright disputes this.

[ 15 ] In most German Bibles, genea is instead translated as "family/lineage" (Geschlecht).

[ 16 ] Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (slægt, släkte and slekt, respectively).

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word "generation" as it was used in the King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct translation of genea in the context of the second coming is "kind of people" (specifically the "good" kind of people; the disciple's kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14 , the King James version uses "generation" in this wide and outdated sense, when it declares that "God is in the generation of the righteous".

[ 20 ] According to Larsen, the Oxford Universal Dictionary states that the latest attested use of genea in the sense of "class, kind or set of persons" dates from 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of "generation" in the English language has narrowed considerably since then.

[ 21 ] Bible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that genea is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in the New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24 . In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word genea here denotes the "bad kind of people", because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23). He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars who support the different views: "This generation" refers to Jesus's contemporaries who would witness "all these things" [πάντα ταῦτα] as outlined in verses 4–31, including Jesus' second coming (Davies & Allison 1997: 367–368; Hare 1993: 281; Maddox 1982: 111–115). Because Jesus' contemporaries did not witness his second coming, some contend that Jesus erred in his predictions (Luz 2005: 209; cf. Schweitzer 1910: 356–364).

"This generation" refers to Jesus's contemporaries who would witness "all these things" as outlined in verses 4–22 or 4–28, pointing to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE and everything leading up to it. Jesus' second coming (vv. 29–31) is thus excluded from "all these things" (Blomberg 1992: 364; Carson 1984: 507; France 2007: 930; Hagner 1995: 715).

"This generation" points to the Ἰουδαῖοι [Jews or Judaeans], implying that they as a race would last until the Parousia (Hendriksen 1973: 868–869; Schweizer 1976: 458).

In patristic opinion, "this generation" points to the church against which the gates of Hades would not prevail (cf.

Chrysostom , Hom. Matt. 77:1; Eusebius , Frag. in Lc. ad loc).

'This generation' points to some future generation, from Matthew's perspective, that sees "all these things" (Bock 1996: 538–539; Conzelmann 1982: 105).

The words "take place" or "have happened" [γένηται] are interpreted as an ingressive aorist : "to begin" or "to have a beginning". In other words, "all these things" would start to happen in the generation of Jesus' present disciples, but would not necessarily finish in their time (Cranfield 1954: 291; Talbert 2010: 270).

"This generation" points to a certain kind of people in accordance with the pejorative connotations to "generation" [γενεά] elsewhere in the gospel (Morris 1992: 613; Nelson 1996: 385; Rieske 2008: 225; see, e.g., Mt 11:16; 12:39, 41–42, 45; 16:4; 17:17; 23:36). While DeBruyn (2010: 190) and Lenski (1943: 953) interpret the expression in a similar way, they connect "this generation" to a certain kind of people from the Ἰουδαῖοι who resisted Jesus (cf. view 3 discussed earlier).

[ 22 ] Preterism [ edit ] Main article: Preterism The position associating the Second Coming with 1st century events such as the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Jewish Temple in AD 70 is known as Preterism.

[ 23 ] Some Preterists see this "coming of the Son of Man in glory" primarily fulfilled in Jesus's death on the cross. They believe the apocalyptic signs are already fulfilled including " the sun will be dark ", [ 24 ] the "powers ... will be shaken", [ 25 ] and "then they will see".

[ 26 ] Yet some critics note that many are missing, such as "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up." [ 27 ] [ 28 ] And "Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Catholicism [ edit ] The Last Judgment by Michelangelo (1541) in the Sistine Chapel , Rome According to the Catholic Church , the second coming will happen in a single moment, suddenly and unexpectedly (not even the angels, saints, or demons know when it will occur).

[ 31 ] It will cause the fullness of the reign of God and the consummation of the universe and mankind.

[ 32 ] The fullness of the reign of God means God fully manifests the victory he won over his enemies (sin, suffering, and Satan) on the Cross.

[ 33 ] Just as God gradually revealed himself to Israel until the birth of Jesus, [ 34 ] so also God gradually manifests his victory through the church's sacraments (baptism, forgiving sin, exorcising Satan, holy unction, relieving suffering, etc.), [ 35 ] until the moment when he will fully manifest his victory through the consummation of the universe and mankind, e.g., by granting the universe and mankind a share in Jesus' resurrection (the universe being transfigured and the dead being resurrected, judged, and recompensed).

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The church does not believe the second coming will happen via a catastrophe (such as a nuclear war or extinction event ), [ 38 ] reincarnation (such as someone claiming to be Jesus), [ 39 ] social or technological progress (such as mankind abolishing slavery or curing disease), or ascendancy (such as the church having political power).

[ 40 ] Nor does the church believe in double predestination .

[ 41 ] The second coming is suspended until Jesus is recognized by "all of Israel", [ 42 ] and it will be followed by a final and ultimate temptation to sin – in this case, apostasy – caused by the antichrist .

[ 43 ] Yet there are three things that hasten the second coming: the celebration of the Eucharist ; [ 44 ] Christians living with the mind of Jesus; [ 45 ] and Christians praying for the Second Coming.

[ 46 ] Like many Christian denominations, the church considers this second coming of Christ to be the final and eternal judgment by God of the people in every nation [ 47 ] resulting in the glorification of some and the punishment of others. The concept is found in all the Canonical gospels , particularly the Gospel of Matthew .

A decisive factor in this Last Judgment during the second coming of Christ will be the question of whether the corporal and spiritual works of mercy were practised or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of mercy, charity and justice. Therefore, and according to the Biblical sources ( Matthew 25:31 – 46 ), the conjunction of the Last Judgment and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art .

[ 48 ] Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy [ edit ] The Last Judgement by the Armenian manuscript illuminator Toros Roslin , 1262 It is the traditional view of Orthodox Christians , preserved from the early Church, that the Second Coming will be a sudden and unmistakable incident, like "a flash of lightning".

[ 49 ] They hold the general view that Jesus will not spend any time on the earth in ministry or preaching, but come to judge mankind.

[ 50 ] They teach that the ministry of the Antichrist will take place right before the Second Coming.

[ 50 ] The Ethiopian Orthodox Church , a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion of churches, teaches that the second coming of Jesus will be radically different from his first coming, which "was to save the lost world".

[ 51 ] Orthodox layman Alexander Kalomiros explains the original Church's position regarding the Second Coming in River of Fire [ 52 ] and Against False Union , [ 53 ] stating that those who contend that Christ will reign on earth for a thousand years "do not wait for Christ, but for the Antichrist". The idea of Jesus returning to this earth as a king is a heretical concept to the Church, equated to "the expectations of the Jews who wanted the Messiah to be an earthly King." The Church instead teaches that which it has taught since the beginning.

[ clarification needed ] Lutheranism and Anglicanism [ edit ] The Second Coming of Christ stained glass window at St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Charleston, South Carolina , United States A reference to the second coming is contained in the Nicene Creed and Apostles Creed , which is recited during the Lutheran and Anglican liturgies: "He [Jesus] shall come again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and His kingdom shall have no end." An analogous statement is also in the biblical Pauline Creed ( 1 Corinthians 15:23 ).

[ 54 ] The Lutheran and Anglican churches proclaim the Mystery of Faith in their liturgies: "Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again." [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Methodism [ edit ] Methodist denominations teach that the Second Coming is connected with the Last Judgment, as professed in the Creeds.

[ 58 ] Methodist denominations differ on the nature of the Second Coming. For example, the United Methodist Church does not teach that there will be a " rapture ".

[ 59 ] On the other hand, the Evangelical Methodist Church Conference teaches, with regard to the Second Coming of Christ: [ 60 ] We believe that the coming of our Lord is to be personal and pre-millenial, also that it is imminent. We must distinguish between the Rapture—His coming in the air to receive his saints, which may occur at any moment, and the Revelation—His coming down to earth with His saints, the latter of which will not occur until after the gathering of Israel, the manifestation of Antichrist, and other prophesied events. Ezek. 36:24, 37:21; Matt. 24:27; 25:13; 26-29; Acts 1:9-11; I Thess. 4:14-17; II Thess. 2:8-10; Rev. 19:20; 20:4; 22:12 [ 60 ] Latter Day Saint movement [ edit ] Main article: Second Coming in Mormonism The standard works of the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), say that Christ will return, as stated in the Bible. They also teach that When the Savior comes again, He will come in power and glory to claim the earth as His kingdom. His Second Coming will mark the beginning of the Millennium. The Second Coming will be a fearful, mournful time for the wicked, but it will be a day of peace for the righteous.

[ 61 ] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its leaders do not make predictions of the actual date of the Second Coming. Mormons believe Jesus appeared to his "new world disciples" in the Americas sometime after his crucifixion. This is a central tenet of the religion.

[ 62 ] Latter-day Saints have particularly distinct and specific interpretations of what are considered to be signs stated in the Book of Revelation .

[ 63 ] According to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the restored gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming.

[ 64 ] Church members believe that there will be increasingly severe wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other man-made and natural disasters prior to the Second Coming.

[ 65 ] Seventh-day Adventists [ edit ] Main article: Seventh-day Adventist eschatology Fundamental Belief #25 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church states: The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour's coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ's coming is imminent. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Jehovah's Witnesses [ edit ] Jehovah's Witnesses rarely use the term "second coming", preferring the term "presence" as a translation of parousia .

[ 68 ] They believe that Jesus' comparison of "the presence of the Son of man" with "the days of Noah" at Matthew 24:37–39 and Luke 17:26–30 suggests a duration rather than a moment of arrival.

[ 69 ] They also believe that biblical chronology points to 1914 [ 70 ] as the start of Christ's "presence", which continues until the final battle of Armageddon . Other biblical expressions they correlate with this period include "the time of the end" ( Daniel 12:4 ), "the conclusion of the system of things" ( Matthew 13:40 , 49 ; 24:3 ) and "the last days" ( 2 Timothy 3:1 ; 2 Peter 3:3 ).

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] Witnesses believe Christ's millennial reign begins after Armageddon.

[ 73 ] Emanuel Swedenborg and the New Church [ edit ] Emanuel Swedenborg , an 18th-century scientist turned theologian, taught that his time (that historians have called the Age of Enlightenment ) was an age of darkness and doubt for the Christian church. Historian Marguerite Beck Block writes, Now therefore it was time for a new church to be founded upon the earth, and for this purpose it was necessary for the Lord Himself to make his Second Coming to the sons of men.

"The night is followed by a morning which is the coming of the Lord. ... The prevailing opinion in the churches at the present day is, that when the Lord shall come for the last judgment. He will appear in the clouds of heaven with angels and the sound of trumpets, etc.," but this opinion is erroneous. The Second Coming of the Lord is not a coming in person, but in spirit and in the Word, which is from 
Him, and is Himself. ... Heretofore it has not been known that 'the clouds of heaven' mean the Word in the sense of the letter, and that the 'glory and power' in which He is then to come, mean the spiritual sense of the Word, because no one as yet has had the least conjecture that there is a spiritual sense in the Word, such as this sense is in itself. But as the Lord has now opened to me the spiritual sense of the Word, and has granted me to be associated with angels and spirits in their world as one of them, it is now disclosed.

... This Second Coming of the Lord is effected by means of a man to whom the Lord has manifested Himself in Person, and whom He has filled with His Spirit, that he may teach the doctrines of the New Church from the Lord by means of the Word. ... That the Lord manifested Himself before me. His servant, and sent me to this office, ... I affirm in truth." [ 74 ] Esoteric Christian teachings [ edit ] See also: Last Judgment (Esoteric Christian tradition) In Max Heindel 's teaching, there is a distinction between the cosmic Christ, or Christ without, and the Christ within .

[ 75 ] According to this tradition, the Christ within is regarded as the true Saviour who needs to be born within each individual [ 76 ] in order to evolve toward the future Sixth Epoch in the Earth's etheric plane , that is, toward the "new heavens and a new earth": [ 77 ] the New Galilee .

[ 78 ] The Second Coming or Advent of the Christ is not in a physical body, [ 79 ] but in the new soul body of each individual in the etheric plane of the planet [ 80 ] where man "shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air." [ 81 ] The "day and hour" of this event is not known.

[ 82 ] The esoteric Christian tradition teaches that first there will be a preparatory period as the Sun enters Aquarius , an astrological concept, by precession: the coming Age of Aquarius .

[ 83 ] Islam [ edit ] Traditional view [ edit ] Main articles: Jesus in Islam and Islamic eschatology In Islam, Jesus (or Isa ; Arabic : عيسى ʿĪsā ) is considered to be a Messenger of God and the masih (messiah) who was sent to guide banī isrā'īl (the Israelites) with a new scripture, the Injīl (Gospel).

[ 84 ] The belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is required in Islam , and a requirement of being a Muslim . However, Muslims believe that Jesus was never crucified or resurrected, instead ascending directly into heaven. Additionally, they do not recognize Jesus as the Son of God , as they believe God has no equals, but rather that he was a prophet. The Quran states that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary . Muslims believe that Jesus performed all the miracles in the Gospels (with God's permission). The pertinent verses in Sura An-Nisa 4:157 reads "And for their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.' And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but another was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain." 4:158 continues "rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise." The Quran refers to a conversation between Jesus and God on judgement day in Sura Al-Ma'idah 5:116, 5:117. Jesus is questioned 5:116 "Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?" To which Jesus replies 5:117 "I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: "Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!" And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them." And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?" He will answer, "Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen. 5:116 I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: "Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!" And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me, You were the Witness over them—and You are a Witness over all things. 5:117 In the Quran, the second coming of Jesus is heralded in Sura Az-Zukhruf as a sign of the Day of Judgment .

And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way. 43:61 [ 85 ] Ibn Kathir presents this verse as proof of Jesus' second coming in the Quran in his exegesis Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim .

[ 86 ] There are also hadiths that foretell Jesus' future return such as: [ 87 ] Sahih al-Bukhari , Volume 3, Book 43: Kitab-ul-`Ilm (Book of Knowledge), Hadith Number 656: Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts).

[ 88 ] The Umayyad Mosque in Damascus , where according to Islamic tradition Jesus will appear close to the Day of Judgment According to Islamic tradition, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by the Mahdi ( lit . "the rightly guided one"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against the al-Masih ad-Dajjal (literally "the false messiah", synonymous with the Antichrist ) and his followers.

[ 89 ] Jesus will descend at the point of a white minaret , east of Damascus , dressed in saffron robes—his head anointed. He will then join the Mahdi in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered in Islam as a Muslim (one who submits to God) and one of God's messengers, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist Dajjal, and then everyone from the People of the Book ( ahl al-kitāb , referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community.

Sahih Muslim , 41:7023 After the death of the Mahdi, Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog), ancient tribes that will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks.

[ 89 ] Jesus' rule is said to be around forty years, after which he will die (since according to Islam, Jesus did not die on the cross but was taken up to heaven and continues to live until his return in the second coming). Muslims will then perform the Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) for him and bury him in the city of Medina in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad .

[ 87 ] Ahmadiyya [ edit ] Ghulam Main article: Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam The Ahmadiyya movement believe that the promised Mahdi and Messiah arrived in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908). This is widely rejected by other Muslims, who do not regard Ahmadis as a legitimate sect of Islam.

The Ahmadiyya movement interpret the Second Coming of Jesus prophesied as being that of a person "similar to Jesus" ( mathīl-i ʿIsā ) and not his physical return, in the same way as John the Baptist resembled the character of the biblical prophet Elijah in Christianity. Ahmadis believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (the founder of the movement) demonstrated that the prophecy in Muslim and Christian religious texts were traditionally misunderstood to suggest that Jesus of Nazareth himself would return, and hold that Jesus survived the crucifixion and later died a natural death. Ahmadis consider Ghulam, in both his character and teachings, to be representative of Jesus, and that he attained the same spiritual rank of Prophethood as Jesus. Thus, Ahmadis believe this prediction was fulfilled and continued by his movement.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Baháʼí Faith [ edit ] The Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh According to the Baháʼí Faith , the Second Coming is a gradual process that coincides with the advancement of human civilization from the beginning of humanity. It teaches that the founders of the major world religions each represent a return of the Word and Spirit of God as a new, unique personification sent by God, who introduces new teachings, laws and revelations, such that all major religions are part of a progressive revelation . Each Coming is said to build upon the major world religions emerging from earlier ages, verifying previous spiritual truths, and fulfilling its prophesies regarding a future return or coming. In this context, the Second Coming is depicted as a continuation of God's will in one continuous faith, with different names as presented by the founders of each religion as the voice of God at different times in history.

Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was a manifestation of the returned Christ, understood as a reappearance of the Word and Spirit of God: O thou who art waiting, tarry no longer, for He is come. Behold His Tabernacle and His Glory dwelling therein. It is the Ancient Glory, with a new Manifestation.

[ 92 ] He wrote to Pope Pius IX , He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with clouds... He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven even as He came down from it the first time. Beware that thou dispute not with Him even as the Pharisees disputed with Him without a clear token or proof.

[ 93 ] He referred to himself as the Ancient of Days and the Pen of Glory , [ 94 ] and also claimed: This is the Father foretold by Isaiah, and the Comforter concerning Whom the Spirit had covenanted with you. Open your eyes, O concourse of bishops, that ye may behold your Lord seated upon the Throne of might and glory.

[ 95 ] Baha'u'llah also wrote, Say: We, in truth, have given Ourself as a ransom for your own lives. Alas, when We came once again, We beheld you fleeing from Us, whereat the eye of My loving-kindness wept sore over My people." [ 94 ] Followers of the Baháʼí Faith believe that prophecies of the second coming of Jesus (along with prophecies from other religions) were fulfilled by his forerunner the Báb in 1844 and then by the events occurring during the days of Bahá'u'lláh.

[ 96 ] They believe that the fulfillment of Christian prophecies by Baha'u'llah is similar to Jesus' fulfillment of Jewish prophecies, where in both cases people were expecting the literal fulfillment of apocalyptic statements that led to rejections of the Return, instead of accepting fulfillment in symbolic and spiritual ways. Baháʼís understand that the return of the Christ with a new name was intended by Jesus to be a Return in a spiritual sense, due to Jesus explaining in the Gospels that the return of Elijah in John the Baptist was a return in a spiritual sense.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] Judaism [ edit ] Main article: Judaism's view of Jesus See also: Rejection of Jesus Judaism teaches that Jesus is one of the false Jewish Messiah claimants because he failed to fulfill any Messianic prophecies , which include: Build the Third Temple ( Ezekiel 37:26–28 ).

Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel ( Isaiah 43:5–6 ).

Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore." ( Isaiah 2:4 ) Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: "God will be King over all the world―on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One" ( Zechariah 14:9 ).

[ 99 ] Regarding the Christian idea that these prophecies will be fulfilled during a "second coming," Ohr Samayach states "we find this to be a contrived answer, since there is no mention of a second coming in the Jewish Bible. Second, why couldn't God accomplish His goals the first time round?" [ 100 ] Rabbi David Wolpe believes that the Second Coming was "grown out of genuine disappointment. [...] When Jesus died, true believers had to theologically compensate for the disaster." [ 101 ] Rastafari [ edit ] In the early developments of the Rastafari religion, Haile Selassie (the Ethiopian Emperor) was regarded as a member of the House of David , is worshipped as God incarnate , [ 102 ] and is thought to be the "black Jesus" and "black messiah" – the second coming of Christ.

[ 103 ] It was claimed that Marcus Garvey preached the coming of the black messiah on the eve of Selassie's coronation. Due to this prophecy, Selassie was the source of inspiration of the poor and uneducated Christian populations of Jamaica , who believed that the Emperor would liberate the black people from the subjugation of European colonists.

[ 104 ] Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary [ edit ] Main article: The Second Coming of Christ (book) In modern times some traditional Indian religious leaders have moved to embrace Jesus as an avatar , or incarnation, of God. In light of this, the Indian guru Paramahansa Yogananda , author of Autobiography of a Yogi , wrote an extensive commentary on the Gospels published in 2004 as a two-volume set: The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You .

[ 105 ] The book offers a mystical interpretation of the Second Coming in which it is understood to be an inner experience, something that takes place within the individual heart. In the introduction of this book, Yogananda wrote that the true Second Coming is the resurrection within you of the Infinite Christ Consciousness. Also stated in the Book of Luke – "Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you." ( Luke 17:21 ) Daya Mata wrote in the preface of The Second Coming of Christ that the "...scriptural treatise thus represents the inclusive culmination of Paramahansa Yogananda's divine commission to make manifest to the world the essence of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ." In sharing her memories of when she wrote down his words, she shares – "the great Guru, his face radiantly enraptured, as he records for the world the inspired exposition of the Gospel teachings imparted to him through direct, personal communion with Jesus of Nazareth." [ 105 ] Larry Dossey , M.D., wrote that "Paramahansa Yogananda's The Second Coming of Christ is one of the most important analyses of Jesus' teachings that exists. ... Many interpretations of Jesus' words divide peoples, cultures, and nations; these foster unity and healing, and that is why they are vital for today's world".

[ 106 ] In modern culture [ edit ] Jesus Christ returning to earth has been a theme in several movies and books, for example: The Seventh Sign – 1988 film starring Demi Moore about a pregnant lady who discovers the Second Coming of Christ has rented a room from her, in order to begin the countdown that will trigger the Apocalypse .

Left Behind – Film and book franchise (1995–mid 2010s) built by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins based on the time-period before, during and after the Second Coming of Christ.

Thief In the Night by William Bernard Sears – Non-fictional book about identifying clues and symbols from the Biblical prophecies of the return of the Christ that have been overlooked or misunderstood, which concludes that Baháʼu'lláh fulfilled the prophecies (2002) [1961]. Oxford, UK: George Ronald.

^ Catholic Encyclopedia: General Judgment : "Few truths are more often or more clearly proclaimed in Scripture than that of the general judgment. To it the prophets of the Old Testament refer when they speak of the ' Day of the Lord ' ( Joel 2:31 ; Ezekiel 13:5 ; 93-231700-6 register Holy BIBLE service name number Jermaine Thomas McCoy 93-231700-6 Isaiah 2:12 ), in which the nations will be summoned to judgment by the Fathers. In the New Testament the Parousia, or coming of Christ as Judge of the world, is an oft-repeated doctrine. The Saviour Himself not only foretells the event but graphically portrays its circumstances ( Matthew 24:27 sqq.;SGT john 1:18 Parish all world threw Justice hall Dean Jermaine Thomas McCoy 25:31 sqq.). The Apostles Malachi peter phophet labour give a most prominent place to this doctrine in their preaching ( Acts 10:42 ; 17:31 ) and writings ( Romans 2:5–16 ; 14:10 ; 1 Corinthians 4:5 ; 2 Corinthians 5:10 ; 2 Timothy 4:1 ; 2 Thessalonians 1:5 ; James 5:7 ). Besides the name Parusia (parousia), or Advent ( 1 Corinthians 15:23 ; 2 Thessalonians 2:19 ), the Second Coming is also called Epiphany, epiphaneia, or Appearance ( 2 Thessalonians 2:8 ; 1 Timothy 6:14 ; 2 Timothy 4:1 ; Titus 2:13 ), and Apocalypse (apokalypsis), or Revelation ( 2 Thessalonians 2:7 ; 1 Peter 4:13 ). The time of the Second Coming is spoken of as 'that Day' ( 2 Timothy 4:8 ), 'the day of the Lord' ( 1 Thessalonians 5:2 ), 'the day of Christ' ( Philemon 1:6 ), 'the day of the Son of Man' ( Luke 17:30 ), 'the last day' ( John 6:39–40 ). The belief in the general judgment has prevailed at all times and in all places within the Church. It is contained as an article of faith in all the ancient creeds: 'He ascended into heaven. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead' ( Apostles' Creed ). The two shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead' ( Nicene Creed ). 'From thence they shall come to judge the living and the dead, at whose coming all men must rise with their bodies and are to render an account of their deeds' ( Athanasian Creed ). Relying on the authority of Papias , several Fathers of the first four centuries advanced the theory of a thousand years' terrestrial reign of Christ with the saints to precede the end of the World (see article on MILLENNIUM). Though this idea is interwoven with the eschatological teachings of those writers, it in no way detracted from their belief in a universal world-judgment. Patristic testimony to this dogma is clear and unanimous." ^ Bühren, Ralf van (January 2017).
