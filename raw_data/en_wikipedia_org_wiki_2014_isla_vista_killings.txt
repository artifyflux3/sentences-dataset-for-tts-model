In Rodger's apartment, he ambushed and stabbed to death his two roommates and their friend, killing them separately as they arrived. About two hours later, he drove to a sorority house and, after failing to gain entry, he shot three women walking near the sorority house, two of whom died. He then drove past a nearby delicatessen , and shot and killed a man who was inside. Following this, he drove around Isla Vista, shooting and wounding several pedestrians from his car, and striking others with his car. He twice exchanged gunfire with police and was injured in the hip. After Rodger's car crashed into a parked vehicle, he was found dead inside with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded a video titled "Elliot Rodger's Retribution", in which he outlined his planned attack and his motives, to the video-sharing platform YouTube . In the video, Rodger said he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and sexually active men because he envied them. He also emailed a lengthy, autobiographical manuscript to friends, family members and his therapist; the document appeared on the Internet and became widely known as his manifesto. In the document, Rodger described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over his inability to find a girlfriend , his hatred of women , his contempt for couples, and his plans for "retribution".

Background Main article: Elliot Rodger Undated driver's license photo of Rodger Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger was born on July 24, 1991, in London, England.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Rodger faced mental health problems as a child; he struggled in social situations, often cried in crowds, and displayed repetitive behaviors. He repeatedly talked about killing himself but had no history of violence. In 2007, he was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified . As an adult, he showed anger toward couples and had difficulties socializing.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Rodger wrote a 137-page manifesto titled My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger about his life and frustrations at having never had sexual intercourse, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] a situation for which he blamed women.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In his manifesto, Rodger wrote about his plan to carry out an attack, calling it a "Day of Retribution".

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Initially, Rodger was unsure whether to target Santa Barbara City College or Isla Vista for his attacks, but ultimately chose Isla Vista.

[ 3 ] He had planned to drive to his father's home where he intended to kill his stepmother Soumaya Akaaboune and half-brother.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] He intended to steal their car and drive it back to Isla Vista, targeting the Alpha Phi sorority house with plans to kill its occupants before setting it on fire. Rodger then planned to shoot and run over as many people with the car as possible in Isla Vista.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Rodger planned to target the Alpha Phi sorority house.

Rodger posted videos to YouTube describing his views on life and frustrations at his romantic failures.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In April 2014, he uploaded to YouTube videos expressing his deep loneliness and frustration at his unsuccessful attempts to attracting a girlfriend.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] He also posted on misogynistic and anti-feminism online forums like PUAHate.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Denizens of these forums, including Rodger, identified themselves as "involuntary celibates" or " incels "; they discussed their difficulties with finding a romantic or sexual partner, and expressed disdain towards women and pick-up artists .

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In February 2012, after being unable to find a girlfriend, Rodger wrote in his manifesto that his attack had become a possibility.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] He became fixated on winning a lottery, believing gaining wealth was the only way for him to attain a sexual experience.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] By June 2012, Rodger wrote he would not carry out his attacks if he won the Mega Millions jackpot. When he did not win the jackpot in September 2012, he visited a gun range in Oxnard, California . In November 2012, he bought Powerball lottery tickets, but after failing to win, he began to actively plan his attack.

[ 33 ] He purchased firearms between December 2012 and 2014.

[ 33 ] From February through April 2014, Rodger visited gun ranges and purchased ammunition.

[ 36 ] In August 2013, Rodger, having rejected Halloween 2013 as the attack date due to concerns over the police presence, [ 39 ] decided to delay his attack until early 2014, eventually selecting April 26, 2014, as the new date for his attack.

[ 33 ] [ 40 ] On April 24, due to illness, he postponed his attack to May 24, 2014.

[ 33 ] [ 39 ] Attacks A map showing the order and locations of Rodger's attacks Apartment stabbings Despite initially selecting May 24 as the date for his attacks, Rodger unexpectedly initiated his attacks a day earlier.

[ 33 ] Rodger, carrying a six-inch (150 mm) "SRK" knife and a nine-inch (230 mm) hunting knife , ambushed his 20-year-old roommate Weihan "David" Wang upon his return to their apartment. Wang tried to defend himself but was stabbed 15 times, suffering 23 slashes.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Rodger moved Wang's body to the corner of a bedroom, threw it face-down on the floor, and partially covered it with blankets, towels, and clothing.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Soon after, Rodger attacked his other roommate, 20-year-old Cheng Yuan "James" Hong, after he entered the apartment. Despite his attempts to defend himself, Hong was overwhelmed, receiving 25 stab wounds and 12 slashes.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 41 ] Five of the stab wounds were inflicted on Hong's back after he died.

[ 4 ] [ 42 ] Rodger dragged Hong's body to the same bedroom, throwing it face down and half-on-top of Wang's body, and concealed it with blankets and clothing.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Nineteen-year-old George Chen, a friend of Hong and Wang, arrived at the apartment to visit them.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Upon entering, Rodger ambushed Chen, inflicting 94 stab wounds and 11 slashes as Chen attempted to defend himself.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Rodger left Chen's bleeding body in a bathroom. He attempted to clean the apartment and hide evidence of the earlier stabbings as each victim entered using bathroom towels and paper towels, which quickly became soaked in blood. Despite his efforts, blood remained splattered on the hallways and walls.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 50 ] Rodger visiting a Starbucks hours before his shooting rampage Rodger's final journal entry after killing his first three victims After failing to clean up the blood, Rodger changed out of his blood-drenched clothes and entangled them with his bed sheets. He showered, put on new clothes, and went to a Starbucks coffee house around 7:38 p.m.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] He purchased a triple-vanilla latte while texting his mother saying he was done with school and would call her later.

[ 51 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] He returned to his apartment and wrote in his journal: I had to tear some pages out because I feared my intentions would be discovered. I taped them back together as fast as I could. This is it. In one hour I will have my revenge on this cruel world. I HATE YOU ALLLL! DIE.

[ 51 ] [ 56 ] Minutes before his planned attack on the Alpha Phi sorority house, Rodger uploaded a seven-minute video called "Elliot Rodger's Retribution" to the video-sharing platform YouTube.

[ a ] Rodger recorded two takes of his "Retribution" video in his car, the first attempt at which was interrupted by a passing jogger.

[ 51 ] In the second take he uploaded, Rodger is seen sitting in his car at sunset reciting scripted lines and emitting fake laughter.

[ b ] In the video, Rodger said he was frustrated at remaining a virgin at 22, that he would "punish" women for rejecting him despite being an " alpha male " and a "Supreme Gentleman", and expressed his hatred for sexually active men.

[ c ] Rodger then emailed his 137-page manifesto to 34 people, including his parents, therapists, former teachers, and childhood friends, with the message: [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] "Attached is Elliot Rodger's life story, which explains how I came to be the way I am".

[ 51 ] Shootings and vehicle attacks The gas can Rodger was going to use to burn down the Alpha Phi sorority house At around 9:15 p.m., Rodger arrived at the Alpha Phi sorority house with three semi-automatic pistols, additional ammunition strapped to his waist, and a full gas can .

[ 51 ] The sorority house had a heavy, wooden, double door with an electronic keypad.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] Rodger tried to open the house's door, pulling on the handle then typing on the keypad numerous times. He then aggressively knocked on the door for over three minutes. Approximately 40 residents of the sorority house were visiting Las Vegas while those remaining felt too tired to answer the door.

[ d ] Rodger became frustrated at the unanswered door and set down the gas can.

[ 51 ] Rodger returned to his car and, around 9:27 p.m., noticed three women walking near the sorority house; these were 19-year-old Veronika Weiss, 22-year-old Katherine "Katie" Cooper, and a 20-year-old woman, all of whom were members of the sorority Delta Delta Delta .

[ e ] As the women were walking back to their Delta Delta Delta sorority house, Rodger slowly approached them in his car and fired multiple shots at them through an open window.

[ f ] As Rodger sped away, the 20-year-old woman managed to call her mother, repeatedly crying she was going to die.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The coffee shop Rodger fired into People heard screaming and saw the three women bleeding on the grass, and rushed to a sheriff's deputy for help. The deputy quickly arrived and applied pressure to the 20-year-old woman's wounds. One person began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to Cooper, and another tried to comfort Weiss by holding her head and speaking to her. More bystanders arrived, and the deputy told them to check if the women had a pulse and to start chest compressions. Additional sheriff's deputies arrived and started helping, while another bystander used a sweatshirt to apply pressure to one of Cooper's gunshot wounds. Despite their efforts, Cooper and Weiss died from their injuries.

[ g ] Weiss was shot seven times, with six bullets striking between her legs, buttocks, and groin. The fatal shot pierced her heart and both lungs. Cooper was shot eight times and suffered multiple fatal injuries, including gunshots to her lungs and the side of her head.

[ 81 ] [ 93 ] A bystander then took over the aid of the 20-year-old woman while deputies chased down Rodger. Bystanders told the 20-year-old woman's mother on her phone her daughter would survive.

[ 54 ] He drove to a store called IV Deli Mart, where he fired a barrage at nearby individuals.

[ h ] Christopher "Chris" Michaels-Martinez, 20, who was at the deli's entrance, was shot once in the chest when he turned around to look at Rodger's car, resulting in injuries to his liver and the right ventricle of his heart.

[ i ] Michaels-Martinez entered the store but fell to the ground. People inside took cover as Rodger continued to fire shots into the store, shattering windows.

[ j ] Rodger then drove away. Despite CPR attempts from five bystanders and sheriff's deputies, Michaels-Martinez died.

[ k ] CCTV image of people in Pizza My Heart hiding as Rodger fired into it Rodger continued driving, struck a man with his vehicle, and knocked him into the air.

[ 54 ] [ 110 ] While driving on Trigo Road, Rodger arrived at a pizza restaurant called Pizza My Heart and opened fire on a couple exiting it.

[ 93 ] The man was shot in the left arm and the woman was shot in her upper-right forearm.

[ 5 ] [ 111 ] The man ran in the opposite direction while the woman ran back into the restaurant. Rodger fired shots into the restaurant before speeding away.

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] Driving on the wrong side of the road in Embarcadero del Norte, Rodger shot a female cyclist in the right thigh.

[ 5 ] [ 93 ] [ 110 ] He then encountered a woman walking alone. Rodger called out: "Hey, what's up?", making the woman acknowledge him as she continued walking.

[ l ] He raised a gun from his car window, leading the woman to initially believe it was an airsoft gun , then shot at her numerous times, narrowly missing her head, and prompting her to run away and scream for help.

[ m ] Rodger's corpse and crashed BMW after the killings The Sig Sauer P226 pistol Rodger used during the shootings The two knives Rodger used to kill his two roommates and their friend Rodger then drove to Del Playa Drive, where he saw a sheriff's deputy and fired shots. As he sped away, the deputy returned fire, discharging a single round.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] Rodger then struck two men with his car, [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] driving to Camino Del Sur where he shot a man in the right forearm and right buttocks. Rodger proceeded to Sabado Tarde Road, hitting a male cyclist and two male skateboarders. He encountered two men in a driveway and shot them several times.

[ 5 ] [ 93 ] [ 124 ] [ 129 ] Near Little Acorn Park, Rodger saw four sheriff's deputies, engaged three of them in a shootout, and received a gunshot wound to his hip.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] At around 9:35 p.m., Rodger turned onto several streets, put the gun to his head, and pulled the trigger, [ 51 ] causing his car to veer and hit a male cyclist, who tumbled on the vehicle and damaged the car's windshield. Rodger's car eventually crashed into a parked vehicle.

[ 74 ] [ 133 ] As police officers surrounded Rodger's car, they mistakenly handcuffed the injured cyclist, initially suspecting him to be a second assailant. Realizing their error, they gave him medical attention, acknowledging him as a victim.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Upon searching Rodger's vehicle, police discovered his body and found a gunshot wound to his head.

[ n ] Vehicle search Inside Rodger's car, police found a Glock 34 Long Slide handgun with seven loaded, 10-round magazines; two SIG Sauer P226 handguns with 34 loaded, ten-round magazines; over 500 rounds of live ammunition; and the two knives he used to kill his two roommates and their friend. The shootings lasted eight minutes, during which Rodger discharged approximately 55 9mm rounds.

[ o ] During the shootings, Rodger used one Sig Sauer P226 pistol, which was discovered on the driver's seat of his car.

Linderman then called her, told her Rodger had sent an email, and advised her to check it. Li Chin accessed the email, which contained his manifesto.

[ w ] She also discovered her son's "Retribution" video online and immediately called his cellphone, which went to voicemail. Rodger's mother then called Santa Barbara police, telling them she needed to locate Rodger.

[ x ] Li Chin then called Rodger's father, Peter Rodger , who was dining with friends, and told him what she had found. Li Chin, alone, drove toward Isla Vista while his father, stepmother, and their friends traveled in another car.

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] [ 187 ] As they separately approached Isla Vista, Li Chin called Rodger's apartment building manager, asking them to check if her son was in his room. The manager told her there had been a shooting and car chase, and they would have to wait until morning to check.

[ 51 ] Rodger's father kept hitting redial on his phone trying to contact his son. As they neared Isla Vista, they heard reports on the radio that an active shooter in a black BMW was near UCSB.

[ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] Both of Rodger's parents then received a call from a sheriff's detective, who asked them whether their son had ever owned any guns. Li Chin was shocked by the inquiry because Rodger had never shown any interest in guns.

[ 51 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] She told police Rodger had social problems and saw a therapist and that she had been unable to contact him. The detective instructed Rodger's parents to meet them at a parking lot near Isla Vista. Li Chin arrived there first, and was followed by Peter, Akaaboune, and their friends.

[ 51 ] [ 190 ] When a sheriff arrived around 1 a.m., Li Chin demanded to know her son's whereabouts. The sheriff said Rodger had been found dead and that his driver's license confirmed his identity. Devastated by the news of Rodger's death, his parents believed he was a victim of the incidents until hours later, when they saw reports on the internet.

[ 51 ] [ 190 ] [ 192 ] Searches and questioning Rodger's apartment room Some of the pillows and bedsheets Rodger practiced stabbing repeatedly before killing his first three victims Police obtained a search warrant and conducted a protective sweep of Rodger's apartment around midnight on May 24. They had grown concerned for the safety of Rodger's two roommates and feared he might have set booby traps in the apartment. After removing a window screen, police found Chen's body lying in a fetal position on the bathroom floor.

[ 93 ] [ 99 ] [ 193 ] They breached the apartment and also found the bodies of Hong and Wang in their bedroom.

[ 93 ] [ 193 ] In Rodger's room, which was messy, police found pharmacy documents for prescriptions, two gun cleaning kits, empty ammunition boxes and magazines, energy drinks, lottery tickets, a copy of The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene , video games, and a Starbucks coffee cup.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] Police also found a folding knife, a "zombie killer" knife with a ten-inch (250 mm) blade, an eighteen-inch (460 mm)-blade machete, a sledgehammer, and other knives. Police discovered a long-sleeve shirt and jeans that were soaked in dried blood and entangled in Rodger's bedsheets. They found multiple stab marks on his bedsheets and pillows, indicating that Rodger was practicing how to stab before attacking his roommates and their friend. Police also discovered two journals in which Rodger expressed his growing frustration at his inability to form relationships with women, a hand-drawn illustration of a stabbing, and a printed version of his 137-page manifesto. Rodger's laptop was found displaying the YouTube "Retribution" video, which showed that it had just finished uploading.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 193 ] The clothes Rodger wore while killing his two roommates and their friend Rodger's two journals Screenshot of Rodger's "Retribution" video confirming it was uploaded on YouTube Police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) executed search warrants at the homes of Rodger's parents, first at his father's home in Woodland Hills and then at his mother's house in West Hills.

[ 194 ] [ 195 ] Police also obtained search warrants for the cellphone records of Rodger and his roommates. Upon examining Rodger's cellphone, they found over 492 images and videos, including over 200 selfies.

[ 3 ] [ 196 ] Due to his attacks, media swarmed Rodger's family, who received death threats, forcing them to move every two days.

[ 51 ] [ 197 ] Li Chin became worried about her daughter's safety and sent her to live with family abroad temporarily. Li Chin and Peter stayed at a hotel, and met with friends at a restaurant to discuss their situation.

[ 51 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Multiple of the weapons found in Rodger's apartment An autopsy of Rodger's body concluded he died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head.

[ 42 ] [ 200 ] In June 2014, his body was cremated and released from the coroner's office to his family, who held a private ceremony and planned to hold a funeral in England later that year.

[ 201 ] Rodger's aunt described him as a "loner" and a "sick, disturbed young man" who was "very dark" and "very depressed".

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] [ 204 ] She questioned how Rodger was allowed to access firearms despite showing signs of mental decline and criticized the United States and its gun laws.

[ 205 ] [ 206 ] [ 207 ] She also offered her condolences to the victims and their families.

[ 208 ] [ 209 ] [ 210 ] In interviews with the Daily Mail and Kent Online , Rodger's paternal grandmother described him as "very sick" and a "disturbed boy", mentioning that if her husband was still alive, he would be in "terrible shock".

[ 202 ] [ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ] In June 2014, Rodger's father met with Richard Martinez, the father of Michaels-Martinez, to discuss Michaels-Martinez and his life.

[ y ] During an interview, Peter told Barbara Walters despite his son's long history of social problems and years of therapy, he never thought his son was capable of murder. Peter said his son was good at hiding his true emotions, expressed sorrow for the pain caused to the victims' families, and said he would help prevent future mass killings.

[ z ] Five years after Rodger's attack, his mother searched mass shootings online and found threat assessment . She later began participating in threat assessment training sessions, sharing her experiences and hoping people will find warning signs of individuals in mental distress.

[ 51 ] [ 223 ] Memorials Memorial service at Harder Stadium , May 27 Memorials at the University of California, Los Angeles On May 24, 2014, at Anisq'Oyo Park in Isla Vista, students and the wider community attended a candlelight gathering to remember the victims.

[ 224 ] [ 225 ] [ 226 ] Three days later, on May 27, UCSB canceled classes and held a "day of mourning and reflection" at the university's Harder Stadium .

[ 227 ] [ 228 ] [ 229 ] More than 20,000 people attended the memorial, where Michaels-Martinez's father read statements from the families of Hong and Wang.

[ 230 ] [ 231 ] [ 232 ] He also spoke about his son and repeatedly yelled "not one more" to the crowd.

[ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] On May 29, over 2,000 people gathered for a paddle-out memorial, where students chanted, sang, and threw flowers into the ocean.

[ 236 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ] Reactions On social media Rodger's killings inspired the hashtag # YesAllWomen After the attacks, PUAHate closed its forums, causing its members to go to other chatrooms and forums.

[ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] [ 242 ] On social media and in the comments on Rodger's YouTube videos, some men empathized with Rodger's views and difficulties; some said being ignored by women was a valid reason for murdering women.

[ 243 ] [ 244 ] [ 245 ] Some users on social media described Rodger as attractive and wondered how he failed to get a girlfriend. Other users acknowledged his physical appearance but contended that he failed to gain attention from women because he was mentally disturbed and had expectations that women should approach him instead.

[ 246 ] [ 247 ] A Facebook page named "Elliot Rodger Is an American Hero" was created, calling on men to share their thoughts and pay tribute to Rodger for his "ultimate sacrifice in the struggle against feminazi ideology".

[ 248 ] [ 249 ] [ 250 ] The page also shared Rodger's "Retribution" video, and several users expressed support for his quest for vengeance against women.

[ 251 ] [ 252 ] Activists reported the page for promoting hate speech, harassment, and violence, and initiated a campaign on Twitter encouraging others to report the page to Facebook.

[ 253 ] [ 254 ] Facebook said the page did not infringe upon its community standards, leading to widespread criticism on Twitter.

[ 253 ] [ 255 ] The page, along with several other fan pages, were later deactivated, with Facebook citing its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities as the rationale for the decision.

[ 253 ] [ 256 ] Following Rodger's misogynistic attacks and the identification of his hatred of women as a motivating factor, some Twitter users employed the hashtag # NotAllMen to express "not all men" act the same as Rodger or would commit similar attacks.

[ 257 ] [ 258 ] [ 259 ] Other men on social media argued that his attacks were not misogynistic because Rodger killed more men than women, that he was mentally ill, and the lack of gun control in the United States was to blame for the attacks.

[ 260 ] [ 261 ] [ 262 ] The hashtag faced criticism for diverting attention away from the broader issue of the dangers against women.

[ 263 ] [ 264 ] [ 265 ] In a bid to shift the focus back to the misogyny and sexism experienced by women, two Twitter users introduced the hashtag # YesAllWomen , saying all women endure sexism and misogyny.

[ 266 ] [ 267 ] [ 268 ] Within four days of its inception, the #YesAllWomen hashtag had been used 1.2 million times on Twitter, quickly eclipsing previous hashtags that aimed to highlight violence and sexism against women.

[ 269 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] Rodger and his attacks brought the incel community to mainstream attention and were praised by young men around the world who identified as incels.

[ aa ] Incels post tribute songs, and others distributed t-shirts with Rodger's image.

[ 277 ] [ 278 ] [ 279 ] Incels refer to Rodger as a "saint" and a "hero", celebrating "Saint Elliot Day" on every anniversary of his attacks.

[ ab ] Incels also refer to Rodger as "E.R.", and his mass killings have inspired similar crimes.

[ ac ] Incels involved in or suspected of other mass killings have frequently cited Rodger as an influence, often referring to their attacks as "going E.R." [ ad ] On April 23, 2018, 25-year-old Alek Minassian killed eleven people and injured fifteen others in Toronto, Canada, by driving a van into pedestrians.

[ ae ] Before his attack, Minassian posted on his Facebook profile: "Private (Recruit) Minassian Infantry 00010, wishing to speak to Sgt 4chan please. C23249161. The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!" [ 300 ] [ 301 ] [ 302 ] [ 303 ] In other media Controversy over publication of Rodger's videos and manifesto Several news networks limited the use of Rodger's "Retribution" video for fear of triggering copycat crimes .

[ af ] On May 24, 2014, YouTube took down Rodger's "Retribution" video, stating it broke the platform's rules by showing a threat of violence.

[ 304 ] [ 305 ] [ 306 ] Experts noted taking down the video would cause it to be increasingly shared across the internet.

[ 307 ] Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam resigned after receiving negative media attention by adding annotations on the website to Rodger's manifesto, calling Rodger's sister "smokin hot", and describing the document as "beautifully written".

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] [ 310 ] Genius CEO Tom Lehman said in a statement Moghadam's comments "went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny".

[ 311 ] [ 312 ] [ 313 ] Misogyny The attacks sparked discussion of broader issues of violence against women and misogyny.

[ 314 ] [ 315 ] According to the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at the Hague , Rodger's attacks were an act of misogynist terrorism .

[ 316 ] [ 317 ] [ 318 ] The US Secret Service described it as "misogynistic extremism".

[ 319 ] [ 320 ] [ 321 ] Writer M.E. Williams objected to Rodger being labeled the "virgin killer", saying that implies "one possible cause of male aggression is a lack of female sexual acquiescence".

[ 322 ] Amanda Hess, writing for Slate , said although Rodger killed more men than women, his motivations were misogynistic because his reason for hating the men he attacked was that he thought they stole the women he felt entitled to.

[ 260 ] Writing for Reason , Cathy Young wrote that it seemed like a "good example of stretching the concept into meaninglessness – or turning it into unfalsifiable quasi-religious dogma", and that Rodger also wrote hateful messages about other men.

[ 323 ] Film critic Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post attributed the attacks to Hollywood's "sexist movie monoculture", which she said is largely produced by white men.

[ 324 ] [ 325 ] [ 326 ] Hornaday criticized the Canadian actor Seth Rogen and the American director Judd Apatow , stating Rogen's role in the 2014 film Neighbors and Apatow's directing encourage "outsized frat-boy fantasies", making people like Rodger feel "unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of 'sex and fun and pleasure'." [ 327 ] [ 328 ] [ 329 ] On Twitter, Rogen called her criticisms "horribly insulting and misinformed." [ 327 ] Gun control and mental health President Barack Obama talking about the killings to former Tumblr CEO David Karp The attacks renewed calls for gun control and improvements in the American healthcare system .

[ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 332 ] [ 333 ] Sheriff Bill Brown said Rodger's actions and copycat attacks were due to shortcomings in the mental-health treatment system, noted a widespread shortfall in resources for community mental health care, and criticized inadequate communication from healthcare professionals regarding people who suffer from suicidal or homicidal thoughts.

[ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 336 ] Several legislators in California demanded an evaluation of the interaction between the deputies and Rodger on April 30, 2014.

[ 337 ] [ 338 ] [ 339 ] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched an investigation on the Sheriff's Office's handling of the situation.

[ 340 ] The deputies did not consult the California gun ownership database, which showed Rodger had purchased at least two handguns.

[ 337 ] [ 341 ] [ 342 ] They also did not examine the YouTube videos that led Rodger's parents to contact them.

[ 343 ] [ 344 ] [ 345 ] Subsequently, the Sheriff's Office concluded the responding deputies followed all rules and conducted themselves professionally in accordance with both state law and departmental guidelines.

[ 346 ] [ 347 ] [ 348 ] Despite California having one of the strictest gun laws in the United States, Rodger, despite having undergone several years of psychiatric treatment, passed all necessary background checks. Because he had neither been institutionalized for mental health issues nor had a criminal history, he was able to purchase three firearms.

[ 349 ] [ 350 ] [ 351 ] In California, at the time, undergoing mental health treatment did not disqualify people for applying for firearms. When the mental health hotline informed the police of Rodger's threats on YouTube, the absence of an immediate threat meant the police lacked the authority to search his apartment, search the gun registry, or confiscate any firearms without a warrant based on probable cause.

[ 352 ] [ 353 ] [ 354 ] Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut advocated for the reinstatement of gun-control measures previously declined by Congress following the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting , saying such legislation might have prevented Rodger's shooting spree.

[ 355 ] [ 356 ] [ 357 ] Blumenthal noted the necessity of refocusing gun-control initiatives around mental health issues, and the urgent need for enhanced resources to support people with mental illnesses.

[ 358 ] [ 359 ] [ 360 ] In his address, Michaels-Martinez's father attributed the attacks to the "craven, irresponsible" actions of politicians and the National Rifle Association (NRA), accusing the NRA of prioritizing gun rights above public safety.

[ 361 ] [ 362 ] [ 363 ] Subsequently, Martinez said he wanted members of Congress to stop calling him to offer condolences for his son's death and appealed to the public to unite with him in "demanding immediate action" on gun control from Congress members.

[ 364 ] [ 365 ] [ 366 ] He extended his sympathies toward Rodger's parents.

[ 367 ] [ 368 ] [ 369 ] Timothy F. Murphy , a Pennsylvania Representative and clinical psychologist, presented his bipartisan mental-health reform as a solution and called on Congress to enact it.

[ 370 ] [ 371 ] [ 372 ] Santa Barbara Assembly members Das Williams and Nancy Skinner introduced legislation that would allow law enforcement, close relatives, or roommates to request a court order for the confiscation of firearms from individuals deemed a serious risk to themselves or others.

[ 373 ] [ 374 ] [ 375 ] State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson also proposed a bill enforcing officers to consult a state firearms registry during assessments of potential threats to personal or public safety.

[ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] Jackson's bill received unanimous Senate approval in August 2014.

[ 379 ] [ 380 ] [ 381 ] Williams' and Skinner's bill passed through both legislative chambers but was opposed by the NRA and other groups advocating for Second Amendment rights, and launched statewide robocall campaigns against it. Williams noted the external origin of the calls and maintained the legislation had received significant bipartisan support.

[ 382 ] [ 383 ] [ 384 ] Governor Jerry Brown ultimately signed both bills into law in September 2014, [ 385 ] [ 386 ] [ 387 ] making California the first state to enact a red flag law that allows family members to petition courts to remove weapons from persons deemed a threat.

[ 388 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] Lawsuits In March 2015, Hong's, Wang's, and Chen's parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against Santa Barbara County, the Sheriff's department, Capri Apartments, and the property management company, claiming negligence and breaches of the victims' constitutional right to due process .

[ 391 ] [ 392 ] [ 393 ] They alleged since Rodger moved into the Capri Apartments in 2011, he insulted and fought with a lot of his roommates and displayed odd behavior, but the apartment owners failed to conduct reasonable background checks before assigning Hong and Wang as his roommates, and failed to warn them Rodger had had serious conflicts with his previous roommates.

[ 394 ] [ 395 ] [ 396 ] They also alleged the county and its Sheriff's Department violated their rights to due process by ignoring repeated "red flags" that indicated Rodger was violent and unstable, even after a mental health worker saw Rodger's YouTube videos and contacted authorities to report Rodger appeared to be a danger to himself and others.

[ 397 ] [ 398 ] [ 399 ] By June 2015, the lawsuit was in early stages of litigation, with the defendants denying any wrongdoing.

[ 398 ] On October 28, 2015, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter removed Santa Barbara County and the Sheriff's department from the lawsuit, determining the county had not infringed upon the plaintiffs' constitutional rights under federal law and that the Sheriff's department did not act neglectfully, nor did their procedures and guidelines contribute to the harm they suffered. The judge concluded the victims' parents failed to sufficiently demonstrate a violation of their due-process rights, and although the judge dismissed the state-law claims within the lawsuits in federal court, he allowed the claims to be re-submitted. The victims' parents proceeded to re-file their claims on November 20, 2015, in state court.

[ 400 ] Capri Apartments and the property management company sought to have the lawsuit dismissed but their motion was denied on February 10, 2017. By May 2017, a trial date was scheduled for September 15 the same year.

[ 401 ] The lawsuit was settled nearly a week and a half before the trial was due to start. Despite the property management company's denial of a settlement, an attorney for the victim's parents said a confidential settlement had been reached; according to the Santa Barbara Independent , the settlement was for $20 million.

[ 402 ] In June 2015, the parents of Cooper filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Santa Barbara County and UCSB, claiming that there were failures in mandatory responsibilities as well as negligent hiring and training of deputies. They claimed the welfare check performed on Rodger by sheriff's deputies on April 30 was inadequate because the deputies failed to review Rodger's YouTube videos or check the gun registry. They also highlighted several "red flags", including a report made by Rodger to campus police about someone damaging his car and his involvement in a fight at a party. In October 2015, Judge Colleen Stern determined that the lawsuit did not meet the required legal standards to proceed but allowed them to submit a revised complaint by November 10 of that year. Cooper's parents' lawyer told Noozhawk they believed the judge's ruling was largely influenced by the legal safeguards that protect government entities from being sued for the choices made by police.

[ 403 ] In June 2015, the cyclist who was struck by Rodger's vehicle and subsequently handcuffed filed a civil lawsuit against Santa Barbara County, the Sheriff's department, Rodger's parents, and UCSB, citing negligence, false imprisonment, and civil rights infringements for being handcuffed and not given immediate medical attention after the collision.

[ 134 ] [ 404 ] [ 405 ] The lawsuit alleged both campus police and the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department did not adequately investigate Rodger despite his release of several YouTube videos indicating his potential threat to others. Additionally, it alleged Rodger's parents were negligent in allowing their mentally unstable son access to a vehicle.

[ 136 ] [ 406 ] [ 407 ] Impact on media In August 2015, a trailer for an independent indie horror film titled Del Playa was released on YouTube. Directed by Shaun Hart and produced by Josh Berger and Berger Bros. Entertainment, the film follows a college student who embarks on a killing spree after facing romantic rejection and bullying.

[ 408 ] [ 409 ] Its title references Del Playa Drive, a street in Isla Vista, and the film includes footage shot in Isla Vista and UCSB.

[ 410 ] [ 411 ] Hours after the trailer's release, a UCSB student launched a Change.org petition demanding that its release be stopped, arguing that the movie too closely resembled Rodger and his attacks.

[ 412 ] [ 413 ] The petition urged the producers to rename the film and donate to a memorial fund set up for the victims, ultimately gathering over 20,000 signatures.

[ 414 ] [ 415 ] In response, Hart issued a statement apologizing to those offended and clarifying that the film was not inspired by Rodger, but intended to focus on the issues of bullying.

[ 416 ] [ 417 ] Originally slated for release in October 2015, [ 418 ] [ 419 ] because Del Playa faced significant backlash, Hart decided to push the film back. In December 2016, he announced that the film would come out in 2017, commenting that many Isla Vista residents had since "graduated and moved on with their lives". Hart insisted he never intended to offend anyone, describing the film as "art" that was pushed into "boundaries, inciting societal and emotional revelation". He said writing the movie was his way of processing the attacks and coming to terms with them. He predicted Del Playa would be moderate success and promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to charity.

[ 420 ] [ 421 ] The film was ultimately released to streaming platforms on July 21, 2017.

[ 422 ] [ 423 ] Depiction in popular culture "Holden's Manifesto" , an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit , is based on this event.

[ 424 ] [ 425 ] [ 426 ] The 2023 science fiction film The Beast features a character, played by George MacKay , inspired by Rodger. The film contains re-creations of Rodger's YouTube videos.

[ 427 ] [ 428 ] [ 429 ] Rodger was mentioned several times in the Criminal Minds episode "Alpha Male" .

[ 430 ] [ 431 ] Chanel Miller recounts her experience as a student at UCSB during the event in her 2019 memoir Know My Name .

Saint Elliot is a description of Rodger as a martyr due to his violent actions (Squirrel, 2018). A word frequency search of Saint Elliot reveals 25 occurrences within incels.co; a word tree query on Saint Elliot reveals that conversations featured the adoration and justification of his actions. Incels.co members also celebrated a "Happy Saint Elliot's Day" on May 23, the date of his shooting, favoring Rodger's actions. As a result, the term "Saint Elliot" is assigned to VERA-2's Glorification of Violent Action risk factor as it is as a term of adoration of incel-inspired violence against women.

No misogynist killer articulated the terroristic intention behind his selected target more clearly than 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, who set out on his 'War on Women' to 'punish all females for the crime of depriving me of sex.' The autobiography he left behind—which has been taken as a manifesto for the incel ideology—spells this out.
