This article is about the taxonomic grouping of related organisms and is not to be confused with the ecological grouping of unrelated plant taxa in phytosociology .

The hierarchy of biological classification 's eight major taxonomic ranks . A phylum contains one or more classes. Intermediate minor rankings are not shown.

In biological classification , class ( Latin : classis ) is  a taxonomic rank , as well as a taxonomic unit, a taxon , in that rank. It is a group of related taxonomic orders.

[ a ] Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are domain , kingdom , phylum , order , family , genus , and species , with class ranking between phylum and order.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name – and not just called a top-level genus (genus summum) – was first introduced by French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in the classification of plants that appeared in his Eléments de botanique of 1694.

Insofar as a general definition of a class is available, it has historically been conceived as embracing taxa that combine a distinct grade of organization—i.e. a 'level of complexity', measured in terms of how differentiated their organ systems are into distinct regions or sub-organs—with a distinct type of construction, which is to say a particular layout of organ systems.

[ 2 ] This said, the composition of each class is ultimately determined by the subjective judgment of taxonomists .

In the first edition of his Systema Naturae (1735), [ 3 ] Carl Linnaeus divided all three of his kingdoms of nature ( minerals , plants , and animals ) into classes. Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient "artificial key" according to his Systema Sexuale , largely based on the arrangement of flowers. In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the APG system in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the flowering plants up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal clades . Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.

[ 4 ] The class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until George Cuvier 's embranchements , first called Phyla by Ernst Haeckel , [ 5 ] were introduced in the early nineteenth century.
