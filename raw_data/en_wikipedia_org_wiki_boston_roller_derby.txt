The league was founded as Boston Derby Dames in May 2005, and is a founding member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The league's all-star team, the Boston Massacre, was one of the top 25 WFTDA Division 1 teams in the world through most of the duration of the divisional ranking system introduced in early 2013, and as of December 31, 2015, the Massacre was ranked at 21.

[ 3 ] Boston won the WFTDA Division 2 Championship in 2017 and the North America East Continental Cup in 2018.

Boston Roller Derby is skater-owned and -operated, sporting more than 70 full-time skaters who both skate and work as part of their duties.

[ 4 ] BRD plays at Aleppo Shriners Auditorium in Wilmington for all home team games and Simoni Ice Rink in Cambridge for its all-star match-ups against rival teams from around the world.

In late October 2015, Boston Roller Derby announced its new name as part of a rebrand "to better reflect the diversity of our community." [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Early history [ edit ] Original Boston Derby Dames logo Boston Roller Derby was founded by Sarah Doom [ 7 ] and Ivana Clobber in 2005 after Doom helped found Providence Roller Derby .

[ citation needed ] The league was formally established as an LLC in the state of Massachusetts by the founding executive board members Andrea Lenco, Sarah Kingan, Alison McAlear, Carroll Cunningham, Eva McCloskey, Lindsay Crudele, and Rebecca Allen the same year. The league began with a travel team called The Boston Massacre (Boston's all-star travel team) and was followed by the addition of three home teams: the Cosmonaughties, Nutcrackers, and Wicked Pissahs. The Boston Massacre had its first game in December 2005, against the Sin City Rollergirls .

[ 8 ] The home teams began competing the following year (March 2006).

[ 9 ] In 2008 Boston added the Boston B Party, to allow home team skaters to play against neighboring leagues without having to be at the all-star level; [ 10 ] in 2012, the B Party became the Massacre's official farm team.

[ 11 ] Boston Roller Derby's Training and Recreation program was also founded in 2012.

[ 12 ] The program offers newer skaters a place to learn and grow on the league, and allows transfer skaters from other leagues to become acclimated to Boston's skating style and requirements before being placed on a home team.

Teams [ edit ] Boston Roller Derby is composed of four home teams, the Harbor Horrors, Cosmonaughties, Nutcrackers, and Wicked Pissahs; an all-star travel team, the Boston Massacre; an interleague B-team, the Boston B Party; and an interleague training team, the Common.

[ 13 ] In addition, Boston offers a Training and Recreation program (TRT), for new and transferring skaters who wish to learn how to play roller derby.

[ 14 ] It is divided up into two levels—non-contact and contact—each named after a line of Boston's MBTA service. Once skaters graduate from the TRT program, they're eligible to be drafted to a home team and to skate with the Train Wrecks. The TRT program accepts new trainees and transfers on a three-month cycle; [ 15 ] the application period is approximately one month before the cycle begins.

Boston also provides a training program for those looking to become roller derby officials.
