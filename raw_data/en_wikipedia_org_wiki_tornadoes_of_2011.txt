Extremely destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States , Bangladesh , Brazil and Eastern India , but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

There were 1,721 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in 2011, which was the third highest on any year on record, with only 2024 and 2004 having more confirmed tornadoes. Unlike 2004 and 2024, 2011 was a catastrophic and an extremely deadly year for tornadoes; worldwide, at least 571 people perished due to tornadoes: 12 in Bangladesh, two in South Africa , one each in New Zealand , the Philippines , Russia and Canada, and 553 in the United States (compared to 564 deaths in the prior ten years combined). Due mostly to several extremely large tornado outbreaks in the middle and end of April and in late May, the year finished well above average in almost every category, with six EF5 tornadoes and nearly enough total tornado reports to eclipse the mark of 1,817 tornadoes recorded in 2004, the current record year for total number of tornadoes.

The 553 confirmed fatalities marks the second-most tornadic deaths in a single year in U.S. history, behind only 1925 in terms of fatalities attributed to tornadic activity. Most of the damage and over two-thirds of the total fatalities in 2011 were caused by a late-April Super Outbreak and an EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri , in late May, becoming the costliest tornado on record.

A graph of the number of tornadoes in 2011 compared to the average tornado season.

An ongoing outbreak at the end of 2010 continued into the first three hours of 2011. During that period seven tornadoes developed in Mississippi. However, during the remainder of the month, tornadic activity was suppressed by a cold air mass, with nine additional tornadoes – all weak – taking place.

[ 5 ] This inactivity continued through much of February before a pattern shift. Two consecutive outbreaks took place on February 25 and 27 – 28, producing a combined 55 tornadoes. Overall, 63 tornadoes were confirmed in the month, making it the fourth most active February on record.

[ 6 ] Activity in March was split between the start and end of the month, and with a total of 75 tornadoes recorded, it ran slightly above average for the month.

In early April, a prolific severe weather event produced 46 tornadoes and more than 1,200 reports of wind damage, setting the tone for the month.

[ 7 ] A nearly continuous series of major tornado outbreaks followed thereafter in the remainder of April, including two extreme multi-day tornado outbreaks that were among the largest in U.S. history (one of them also one of the deadliest and the costliest) and two other large tornado outbreaks, resulting in an incredibly active month from start to finish; it was the most active month for tornadoes on record and by an extremely large margin the most active April, with 773 tornadoes in total.

[ 8 ] In an abrupt reversal, the activity did not continue into May (normally the most active month for tornadoes), however, and the first half was remarkably quiet, becoming one of the least active Mays on record by the middle of the month. The lack of activity continued for three weeks until a tornado outbreak sequence began on May 21, and a deadly tornado hit Joplin, Missouri the following day in the event. The outbreak sequence continued for the next several days, with 241 confirmed tornadoes, bringing the month of May near average.

The first day of June brought a rare outbreak into New England. Several tornadoes occurred, some of which were destructive. However, another reversal took place afterward and much of June was fairly quiet, with the exception of an active period in the third week of the month which included a moderate tornado outbreak . July was also relatively quiet for the most part with below normal activity, occurring mostly within the northern Plains. August was more quiet with below normal activity and only 59 confirmed tornadoes. September and October were also below average. November was somewhat more active, primarily due to two moderate outbreaks in the first half of the month. December saw a return to inactivity for most of the month, but there was a small outbreak of 13 tornadoes on December 22, making it the final tornado outbreak of the year.

The strongest of these, rated EF3 with winds of 145 mph (233 km/h), reached 0.75 mi (1.21 km) in width along its 23.45 mi (37.74 km) track and caused significant damage along MS 19 . Several structures were damaged or destroyed and two people were injured. Near MS 35 , thousands of trees were uprooted by the tornado. Another EF3 tornado formed near Macon , damaging or destroying several structures, and one person was injured. Overall damage in the state from tornadoes amounted to $10.4 million.

[ 9 ] February 24 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 3 6 5 0 0 0 Several tornadoes occurred across the Southern United States. The most significant tornado was in the southeastern part of Nashville, Tennessee where significant damage was reported near Hickory Hollow Mall and near Percy Priest Lake in the evening (with widespread wind damage all across Middle Tennessee ), and a tornado emergency was declared shortly thereafter for areas to the northeast in Wilson County where another tornado developed, causing injuries. Both tornadoes were rated EF2. Other tornadoes formed, with varying degrees of damage in the Missouri Bootheel , West Tennessee , Mississippi , southwestern Kentucky and parts of Arkansas including three others rated EF2.The overall damage from this system amounted to $1,500,000.

Another severe weather event developed on February 27 and continued into February 28 across the Midwest and South. While a large portion of the damage was due to damaging straight-line winds, at least 35 tornadoes were reported across several states. The most destructive tornado was in Franklin County, Tennessee on the afternoon of February 28 where one person was killed by an EF2 tornado. It was the first fatal tornado of 2011. Another strong tornado, rated EF3, resulted in houses destroyed near Eminence, Kentucky .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Concentrated tornado activity also occurred in parts of Missouri and Illinois with 22 tornadoes in the region, some as strong as EF2, related to a series of squall lines with many embedded tornadoes. None of those tornadoes resulted in any fatalities. Overall damages from this system amounted to $12,800,000.

It formed in a squall line , which hit portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. A deadly EF2 tornado struck Rayne, Louisiana early that afternoon, killing a mother while she protected her daughter.

[ 14 ] about 12 others were injured. Initial assessments indicate that 62 homes were destroyed and 50 more damaged. Two EF0 tornadoes were also confirmed in eastern North Carolina .

March 8–9 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 5 10 5 0 0 0 Several tornadoes formed on March 8 into March 9 from North Texas eastward to the Florida Panhandle , with Louisiana hardest hit. The most destructive tornadoes, rated EF2, began just north of New Orleans in St. Tammany Parish .

[ 15 ] March 21–23 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 7 4 3 1 0 0 A tornado developed in the afternoon of March 21 near Maxwell, California , and crossed I-5 . It caused no known damage and was on the ground for only a few minutes. The same system produced more severe weather ahead of a dry line across eastern Nebraska, where tornadoes were reported northeast of Omaha. Later, a cluster of supercells began producing tornadoes in south-central Iowa, where a tornado was reported in Greenfield, Iowa , and at least 2 tornadoes were reported near Winterset, Iowa . Several funnel clouds were reported in Des Moines. These funnels were associated with the storm that produced the first tornado to hit Greenfield and Winterset.

On March 23, more tornadoes and severe weather developed with the most significant tornadoes occurring in East Tennessee where significant damage was reported. Near Greenback in Blount County, an EF3 tornado was confirmed with severe damage in the area. Another notable tornado was recorded in southwestern Pennsylvania , most notably in Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania . It was rated EF2.

On March 29, a warm front over the Gulf of Mexico associated with an upper-level low over Texas moved northward into the Gulf Coast States , bringing scattered severe weather.

[ 16 ] In Louisiana, three tornadoes transpired, including an EF1 which caused a three-story building to collapse.

[ 17 ] In Mississippi , one person was killed after lightning caused a house fire. A strong microburst also took place in Copiah County , producing winds up to 110 mph (180 km/h).

[ 18 ] Activity shifted into central Florida on March 30 as a frontal boundary stalled out across the state. During the two-day period, ten tornadoes occurred and a series of squall lines produced widespread wind damage on March 31.

[ 19 ] Significant damage took place in several communities and damage exceeded $5 million.

[ 20 ] Seven people were injured when one of the tornadoes hit a local festival.

Storms in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois brought severe thunderstorms to the areas. A tornado watch was issued for Iowa and Illinois as the storms rolled through, and later a severe thunderstorm watch for northeastern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. However, there were no reported tornadoes.

[ 22 ] Continuing eastward, the system entered an environment favoring tornadic development. Two tornadoes were reported in Kentucky during the early afternoon, both rated EF2 and resulting in injuries.

[ 7 ] Near Hopkinsville , a tornado, confirmed by local emergency services, caused significant damage to a manufacturing plant.

[ 23 ] Numerous buildings were reported to be destroyed, trapping residents within debris.

[ 24 ] In addition to the tornadoes, there was widespread wind damage (over 1,400 severe weather reports were received by the Storm Prediction Center , with the vast majority being damaging winds) as an extremely large squall line /serial derecho tracked across the southern United States with wind gusts as high as 90 mph (145 km/h) reported across 20 states, [ 7 ] killing at least 9 people, one of the deaths was as a result of an EF2 tornado in Dodge County, Georgia . Numerous power outages also took place due to the extensive wind damage. Nearly 100,000 and 147,000 residences lost power in Tennessee and Georgia respectively.

A large storm system with an associated frontal boundary moved northward and eastward across the central United States beginning on April 8. While initial severe weather was limited, a lone supercell broke out ahead of a mesoscale convective system in Pulaski County, Virginia on the eastern end of the warm front that evening. Two tornadoes were confirmed, one of which was rated EF2 and caused severe damage in Pulaski, Virginia . Numerous houses were damaged and eight people were injured.

[ 27 ] During the afternoon of April 9, supercells developed along the warm front and tracked through parts of Kentucky , Tennessee , Virginia , and North Carolina , generating softball sized hail and eight more tornadoes.

[ 28 ] During the evening of April 9, several severe thunderstorms developed across Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. A single supercell became tornadic over extreme western Iowa, producing a family of ten tornadoes over the course of five hours.

[ 28 ] The first was 0.75 mi (1.21 km) wide and struck Mapleton, Iowa , [ 29 ] destroying about 100 homes. Due to a 20-minute warning time, no fatalities took place and only 14 to 16 people were injured. Officials blocked off the town and Governor Terry Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for the town.

[ 30 ] Additional tornadic activity developed on April 10 across Wisconsin with several more tornadoes reported there.

April 14–16 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 52 81 32 13 0 0 Main article: Tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011 During the afternoon of April 14, a significant tornado outbreak started setting up. A PDS ( Particularly Dangerous Situation ) tornado watch was issued for much of eastern Oklahoma .

[ 31 ] Supercells explosively developed over central Oklahoma. Storm chasers in the region reported several funnel clouds and two tornadoes, neither of which resulted in damage. Several tornadoes were confirmed through storm chaser video and local emergency management services. A large, intense, multiple-vortex tornado caused severe damage in the towns of Atoka and Tushka where many houses were destroyed or flattened. Numerous injuries were reported in the latter of these areas.

[ 32 ] Two people were killed and 25 more injured in Tushka.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] In Arkansas , 2 people were killed when an EF1 downed a tree which landed on a house.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] During the late-night hours into the morning of April 15, tornadic activity lessened. However, by the late morning hours, supercell thunderstorms developed again over parts of Mississippi , and tornadoes began to develop again. A tornado emergency was declared for the northern Jackson metropolitan area as a result at shortly after 11:00 am CDT (1600 UTC). A destructive tornado moved across the area with severe damage and multiple injuries according to WLBT coverage. That afternoon, Mississippi State University spotters confirmed a large tornado in east-central Mississippi and west-central Alabama and another tornado emergency was issued.

ABC 33/40 coverage reported that the tornado was 3/4 mile (1.2 km) in width. Over 90 tornado sightings were reported that day and at least eight people were killed in Mississippi and Alabama.

On April 16, another PDS tornado watch, along with a "high risk" alert from the SPC were issued for central and eastern North Carolina. At least 24 died and 135 were seriously injured in what became North Carolina's worst tornado outbreak in 25 years; tornadoes also struck South Carolina , Virginia , Maryland and Pennsylvania .

[ 37 ] Twelve of the North Carolina deaths took place in Bertie County ; tornado emergencies were issued for Raleigh , Snow Hill , and Wilson at the height of the outbreak. In North Carolina, twelve supercells produced at least 25 tornadoes, with at least 32 counties affected. A total of 21 businesses and 440 homes were destroyed, 63 of those homes in Raleigh ; about 92 businesses and 6,189 homes suffered significant damage, 184 of those homes in Raleigh.

Yet another severe weather event developed across the Midwest and southern Great Plains on April 19 as another dynamic low pressure system tracked across the area. Thunderstorms began in the late afternoon and early evening with large hail and several tornadoes. Significant damage was reported near Bowling Green, Missouri and Girard, Illinois as a result of tornadoes, the latter of which was rated EF3. Another large tornado was reported near Octavia , Oklahoma before the supercells merged into a very large squall line . Overnight, the squall line tracked eastward with widespread wind damage and many embedded tornadoes across several states, a few as strong as EF2, but most were brief and weak. In the early hours of April 20, 2011, a tornado tore through a neighborhood in Oregon, Ohio , leaving some significant damage but no injuries. Also, three tornadoes struck New Albany, Indiana , and Jeffersonville, Indiana . Both are cities just north of Louisville, Kentucky [ 40 ] Severe weather once again developed across parts of the Midwest on April 22. The hardest-hit area was parts of the St. Louis metropolitan area . A destructive tornado tracked across the region with severe damage in several communities including houses destroyed in communities such as Bridgeton , Ferguson , Florissant , Hazelwood , Maryland Heights and New Melle .

Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was hard hit with severe damage to numerous facilities there and injuries reported. Windows were blown out of the terminals there and airplanes were flipped in the field. Concourse C was the hardest hit, taking nearly a year to reopen; it reopened on April 2, 2012.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] The tornado was given a rating of EF4 based on finding of flattened houses in Bridgeton. Following assessments by the local National Weather Service, it was determined that a single tornado tracked for 22 miles (35 km) through parts of Missouri and Illinois, reaching a maximum width of 0.4 miles (0.64 km). Elsewhere, there were several reported tornadoes, including an EF2 tornado which tracked through Henderson , Webster and Union County .

[ 43 ] A few more tornadoes were reported on April 23–24; however, most did not cause any severe damage, though one EF2 tornado caused structural damage in the town of Bardwell, Kentucky .

With 367 confirmed tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities, the outbreak ranks as the largest and one of the worst in United States history. More than three dozen tornadoes were confirmed each day of the event, with 42 on April 25, 55 on April 26, a 24-hour record of 223 on April 27, and 47 on April 28. In terms of violent tornadoes, the event ranks third with 15 EF4/5 rated tornadoes, behind the 1974 Super Outbreak and 1965 Palm Sunday outbreak .

A large outbreak was possible for April 25–27 as the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe weather for three consecutive days, centered over Arkansas through Tennessee . By the late-afternoon hours of April 25, several tornadoes had been reported across a few states, including two which caused significant damage in Oklahoma and Texas. At 3:25 pm CST (2025 UTC), the SPC issued a PDS tornado watch for much of Arkansas and parts of Missouri , Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana .

[ 44 ] Tornadoes were scattered that day until early evening, when an intense tornadic cell tracked near the Little Rock metropolitan area and a tornado emergency was declared for Vilonia, Arkansas . A 1.5-mile (2.4 km) wide EF2 tornado then caused extensive damage in Vilonia. At least four people are known to have died in the town with many more injured.

On April 27, a large tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama , killing 44 people.

[ 45 ] The Tuscaloosa mayor called the damage "catastrophic." The same tornado hit the northern suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama , shortly thereafter, killing 20 more people. Television reporters in Birmingham, filming the tornado, reported that even from miles away, the
funnel was so wide that they could not zoom their cameras out far enough to get the entire funnel into the frame at once. Over 200 tornadoes were reported during the SPC's reporting day of 1200 Z April 27 (7:00 am CDT ) to 1200Z April 28 (7:00 am CDT).

[ 46 ] 324 tornadic deaths were confirmed as a result of the outbreak, with as many as 238 in Alabama alone. The overall death toll also includes 32 deaths in Tennessee, 31 in Mississippi, 14 in Georgia, 5 in Arkansas, and 4 in Virginia, according to state officials.

On April 27, President Barack Obama approved Governor Robert Bentley 's request for emergency federal assistance including search and rescue support.

On April 28, 2011, the National Weather Service sent out people to survey the damage; however, with the large number of tornadoes across Alabama, the reports were not finalized for months. By April 30, the death toll from the event (including death tolls from flooding and other severe weather) stood at more than 340 people across six states.

On a lesser note, an F0 tornado (the Fujita scale was still used in Canada ) downed trees and ripped siding off store buildings in Fergus, Ontario on April 27.

At the same time, another system formed to the southeast of Emporia, Kansas . The Brown County system developed produced a couple tornadoes over Shawnee County, Kansas , including one near Topeka that caused minor damage. Meanwhile, the Emporia system moved to the northeast, where an EF3 tornado heavily damaged the town of Reading, Kansas . One person was killed, several others were injured, and at least 20 houses were destroyed.

[ 48 ] Several other tornadoes occurred in the region that evening, all of which were in the EF0–EF1 range.

A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for much of the Midwest south to Oklahoma for May 22. The first tornadic supercell that day developed in the mid-afternoon hours over the western Twin Cities with a swath of damage, especially in and around Minneapolis , Minnesota.

[ 50 ] An intense tornado also tracked towards Harmony, Minnesota that afternoon and a tornado emergency was issued. Late that afternoon, at about 5:15 p.m. CDT (2215 UTC), a very large and intense multiple-vortex tornado resulted in catastrophic damage in Joplin, Missouri . Many houses and businesses were flattened and some even were blown away in Joplin, the main hospital was heavily damaged and many people were reported to have been trapped in destroyed houses.

The Weather Channel video showed entire communities flattened. Early reports suggested there were at least 125 fatalities, [ 51 ] [ 52 ] but the death toll was eventually confirmed at 158, with another 1,000+ injured.

[ 53 ] This tornado was given a rating of EF5.

Late in the afternoon on May 24, supercells began forming over western Kansas and Oklahoma , as the National Weather Service predicted a dangerous tornado outbreak. As a line of powerful cells began to take shape, trained spotters reported large tornadoes near El Reno , Oklahoma and in rural Grady County, Oklahoma. One of these swept from Binger to Guthrie , destroying many homes and causing at least nine fatalities. This tornado was rated an EF5, the sixth of the year and second of the outbreak sequence. Three other EF4 tornadoes developed among the many other tornadoes that day.

At around 10:00 p.m. EDT on May 25, an EF3 tornado hit the city of Bedford, Indiana .

U.S. Route 50 was temporarily closed due to heavy debris. A tornado reportedly formed in Keyser, WV and tracked as far as Berkeley Springs. Three tornadoes also hit the Sacramento Valley of California, north of Sacramento . One tornado—rated EF1—struck east of Artois , uprooting hundreds of almond trees and causing damage to farm equipment and roofing materials.
