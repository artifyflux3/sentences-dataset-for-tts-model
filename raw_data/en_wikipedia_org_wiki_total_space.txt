A cylindrical hairbrush showing the intuition behind the term fiber bundle . This hairbrush is like a fiber bundle in which the base space is a cylinder and the fibers ( bristles ) are line segments. The mapping π π : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B} would take a point on any bristle and map it to its root on the cylinder.

In mathematics , and particularly topology , a fiber bundle ( Commonwealth English : fibre bundle ) is a space that is locally a product space , but globally may have a different topological structure . Specifically, the similarity between a space E {\displaystyle E} and a product space B × × F {\displaystyle B\times F} is defined using a continuous surjective map , π π : E → → B , {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B,} that in small regions of E {\displaystyle E} behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of B × × F {\displaystyle B\times F} to B .

{\displaystyle B.} The map π π , {\displaystyle \pi ,} called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space E {\displaystyle E} is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, B {\displaystyle B} as the base space , and F {\displaystyle F} the fiber .

In the trivial case, E {\displaystyle E} is just B × × F , {\displaystyle B\times F,} and the map π π {\displaystyle \pi } is just the projection from the product space to the first factor.  This is called a trivial bundle . Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the Möbius strip and Klein bottle , as well as nontrivial covering spaces .  Fiber bundles, such as the tangent bundle of a manifold and other more general vector bundles , play an important role in differential geometry and differential topology , as do principal bundles .

Mappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that "commute" with the projection maps are known as bundle maps , and the class of fiber bundles forms a category with respect to such mappings.  A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to E {\displaystyle E} is called a section of E .

{\displaystyle E.} Fiber bundles can be specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transition maps between the local trivial patches lie in a certain topological group , known as the structure group , acting on the fiber F {\displaystyle F} .

History [ edit ] In topology , the terms fiber (German: Faser ) and fiber space ( gefaserter Raum ) appeared for the first time in a paper by Herbert Seifert in 1933, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] but his definitions are limited to a very special case. The main difference from the present day conception of a fiber space, however, was that for Seifert what is now called the base space (topological space) of a fiber (topological) space E was not part of the structure, but derived from it as a quotient space of E . The first definition of fiber space was given by Hassler Whitney in 1935 [ 4 ] under the name sphere space , but in 1940 Whitney changed the name to sphere bundle .

[ 5 ] The theory of fibered spaces, of which vector bundles , principal bundles , topological fibrations and fibered manifolds are a special case, is attributed to Herbert Seifert , Heinz Hopf , Jacques Feldbau , [ 6 ] Whitney, Norman Steenrod , Charles Ehresmann , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Jean-Pierre Serre , [ 10 ] and others.

Fiber bundles became their own object of study in the period 1935–1940. The first general definition appeared in the works of Whitney.

[ 11 ] Whitney came to the general definition of a fiber bundle from his study of a more particular notion of a sphere bundle , [ 12 ] that is a fiber bundle whose fiber is a sphere of arbitrary dimension .

[ 13 ] Formal definition [ edit ] A fiber bundle is a structure ( E , B , π π , F ) , {\displaystyle (E,\,B,\,\pi ,\,F),} where E , B , {\displaystyle E,B,} and F {\displaystyle F} are topological spaces and π π : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B} is a continuous surjection satisfying a local triviality condition outlined below. The space B {\displaystyle B} is called the base space of the bundle, E {\displaystyle E} the total space , and F {\displaystyle F} the fiber . The map π π {\displaystyle \pi } is called the projection map (or bundle projection ). We shall assume in what follows that the base space B {\displaystyle B} is connected .

We require that for every x ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle x\in B} , there is an open neighborhood U ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle U\subseteq B} of x {\displaystyle x} (which will be called a trivializing neighborhood) such that there is a homeomorphism φ φ : π π − − 1 ( U ) → → U × × F {\displaystyle \varphi :\pi ^{-1}(U)\to U\times F} (where π π − − 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(U)} is given the subspace topology , and U × × F {\displaystyle U\times F} is the product space) in such a way that π π {\displaystyle \pi } agrees with the projection onto the first factor. That is, the following diagram should commute : Local triviality condition where proj 1 : U × × F → → U {\displaystyle \operatorname {proj} _{1}:U\times F\to U} is the natural projection and φ φ : π π − − 1 ( U ) → → U × × F {\displaystyle \varphi :\pi ^{-1}(U)\to U\times F} is a homeomorphism. The set of all { ( U i , φ φ i ) } {\displaystyle \left\{\left(U_{i},\,\varphi _{i}\right)\right\}} is called a local trivialization of the bundle.

Thus for any p ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle p\in B} , the preimage π π − − 1 ( { p } ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(\{p\})} is homeomorphic to F {\displaystyle F} (since this is true of proj 1 − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( { p } ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {proj} _{1}^{-1}(\{p\})} ) and is called the fiber over p {\displaystyle p} . Every fiber bundle π π : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B} is an open map , since projections of products are open maps. Therefore B {\displaystyle B} carries the quotient topology determined by the map π π .

{\displaystyle \pi .} A fiber bundle ( E , B , π π , F ) {\displaystyle (E,\,B,\,\pi ,\,F)} is often denoted F ⟶ ⟶ E → π π B {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{}\\F\longrightarrow E\ {\xrightarrow {\,\ \pi \ }}\ B\\{}\end{matrix}}} that, in analogy with a short exact sequence , indicates which space is the fiber, total space and base space, as well as the map from total to base space.

A smooth fiber bundle is a fiber bundle in the category of smooth manifolds . That is, E {\displaystyle E} , B {\displaystyle B} , and F {\displaystyle F} are required to be smooth manifolds and all the functions above are required to be smooth maps .

Examples [ edit ] Trivial bundle [ edit ] Let E = B × × F {\displaystyle E=B\times F} and let π π : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B} be the projection onto the first factor. Then π π {\displaystyle \pi } is a fiber bundle (of F {\displaystyle F} ) over B .

{\displaystyle B.} Here E {\displaystyle E} is not just locally a product but globally one. Any such fiber bundle is called a trivial bundle . Any fiber bundle over a contractible CW-complex is trivial.

Nontrivial bundles [ edit ] Möbius strip [ edit ] The Möbius strip is a nontrivial bundle over the circle.

Perhaps the simplest example of a nontrivial bundle E {\displaystyle E} is the Möbius strip . It has the circle that runs lengthwise along the center of the strip as a base B {\displaystyle B} and a line segment for the fiber F {\displaystyle F} , so the Möbius strip is a bundle of the line segment over the circle. A neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of π π ( x ) ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle \pi (x)\in B} (where x ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle x\in E} ) is an arc ; in the picture, this is the length of one of the squares. The preimage π π − − 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(U)} in the picture is a (somewhat twisted) slice of the strip four squares wide and one long (i.e. all the points that project to U {\displaystyle U} ).

A homeomorphism ( φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } in § Formal definition ) exists that maps the preimage of U {\displaystyle U} (the trivializing neighborhood) to a slice of a cylinder: curved, but not twisted. This pair locally trivializes the strip. The corresponding trivial bundle B × × F {\displaystyle B\times F} would be a cylinder , but the Möbius strip has an overall "twist". This twist is visible only globally; locally the Möbius strip and the cylinder are identical (making a single vertical cut in either gives the same space).

Klein bottle [ edit ] A similar nontrivial bundle is the Klein bottle , which can be viewed as a "twisted" circle bundle over another circle. The corresponding non-twisted (trivial) bundle is the 2- torus , S 1 × × S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}\times S^{1}} .

The Klein bottle immersed in three-dimensional space.

A torus.

Covering map [ edit ] A covering space is a fiber bundle such that the bundle projection is a local homeomorphism . It follows that the fiber is a discrete space .

Vector and principal bundles [ edit ] A special class of fiber bundles, called vector bundles , are those whose fibers are vector spaces (to qualify as a vector bundle the structure group of the bundle—see below—must be a linear group ). Important examples of vector bundles include the tangent bundle and cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. From any vector bundle, one can construct the frame bundle of bases , which is a principal bundle (see below).

Another special class of fiber bundles, called principal bundles , are bundles on whose fibers a free and transitive action by a group G {\displaystyle G} is given, so that each fiber is a principal homogeneous space . The bundle is often specified along with the group by referring to it as a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle. The group G {\displaystyle G} is also the structure group of the bundle. Given a representation ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } of G {\displaystyle G} on a vector space V {\displaystyle V} , a vector bundle with ρ ρ ( G ) ⊆ ⊆ Aut ( V ) {\displaystyle \rho (G)\subseteq {\text{Aut}}(V)} as a structure group may be constructed, known as the associated bundle .

Sphere bundles [ edit ] Main article: Sphere bundle A sphere bundle is a fiber bundle whose fiber is an n -sphere . Given a vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} with a metric (such as the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold ) one can construct the associated unit sphere bundle , for which the fiber over a point x {\displaystyle x} is the set of all unit vectors in E x {\displaystyle E_{x}} . When the vector bundle in question is the tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle TM} , the unit sphere bundle is known as the unit tangent bundle .

A sphere bundle is partially characterized by its Euler class , which is a degree n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} cohomology class in the total space of the bundle. In the case n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} the sphere bundle is called a circle bundle and the Euler class is equal to the first Chern class , which characterizes the topology of the bundle completely. For any n {\displaystyle n} , given the Euler class of a bundle, one can calculate its cohomology using a long exact sequence called the Gysin sequence .

{\displaystyle X.} Mapping tori of homeomorphisms of surfaces are of particular importance in 3-manifold topology .

Quotient spaces [ edit ] If G {\displaystyle G} is a topological group and H {\displaystyle H} is a closed subgroup , then under some circumstances, the quotient space G / H {\displaystyle G/H} together with the quotient map π π : G → → G / H {\displaystyle \pi :G\to G/H} is a fiber bundle, whose fiber is the topological space H {\displaystyle H} . A necessary and sufficient condition for ( G , G / H , π π , H {\displaystyle G,\,G/H,\,\pi ,\,H} ) to form a fiber bundle is that the mapping π π {\displaystyle \pi } admits local cross-sections ( Steenrod 1951 , §7).

The most general conditions under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if G {\displaystyle G} is a Lie group and H {\displaystyle H} a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem ), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One example of this is the Hopf fibration , S 3 → → S 2 {\displaystyle S^{3}\to S^{2}} , which is a fiber bundle over the sphere S 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}} whose total space is S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} . From the perspective of Lie groups, S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} can be identified with the special unitary group S U ( 2 ) {\displaystyle SU(2)} . The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle U(1)} , and the quotient S U ( 2 ) / U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle SU(2)/U(1)} is diffeomorphic to the sphere.

More generally, if G {\displaystyle G} is any topological group and H {\displaystyle H} a closed subgroup that also happens to be a Lie group, then G → → G / H {\displaystyle G\to G/H} is a fiber bundle.

Sections [ edit ] Main article: Section (fiber bundle) A section (or cross section ) of a fiber bundle π π {\displaystyle \pi } is a continuous map f : B → → E {\displaystyle f:B\to E} such that π π ( f ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (f(x))=x} for all x in B . Since bundles do not in general have globally defined sections, one of the purposes of the theory is to account for their existence. The obstruction to the existence of a section can often be measured by a cohomology class, which leads to the theory of characteristic classes in algebraic topology .

The most well-known example is the hairy ball theorem , where the Euler class is the obstruction to the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere having a nowhere vanishing section.

Often one would like to define sections only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A local section of a fiber bundle is a continuous map f : U → → E {\displaystyle f:U\to E} where U is an open set in B and π π ( f ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (f(x))=x} for all x in U . If ( U , φ φ ) {\displaystyle (U,\,\varphi )} is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over U . Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps U → → F {\displaystyle U\to F} . Sections form a sheaf .

Structure groups and transition functions [ edit ] Fiber bundles often come with a group of symmetries that describe the matching conditions between overlapping local trivialization charts. Specifically, let G be a topological group that acts continuously on the fiber space F on the left. We lose nothing if we require G to act faithfully on F so that it may be thought of as a group of homeomorphisms of F . A G - atlas for the bundle ( E , B , π π , F ) {\displaystyle (E,B,\pi ,F)} is a set of local trivialization charts { ( U k , φ φ k ) } {\displaystyle \{(U_{k},\,\varphi _{k})\}} such that for any φ φ i , φ φ j {\displaystyle \varphi _{i},\varphi _{j}} for the overlapping charts ( U i , φ φ i ) {\displaystyle (U_{i},\,\varphi _{i})} and ( U j , φ φ j ) {\displaystyle (U_{j},\,\varphi _{j})} the function φ φ i φ φ j − − 1 : ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) × × F → → ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) × × F {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}\varphi _{j}^{-1}:\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)\times F\to \left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)\times F} is given by φ φ i φ φ j − − 1 ( x , ξ ξ ) = ( x , t i j ( x ) ξ ξ ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}\varphi _{j}^{-1}(x,\,\xi )=\left(x,\,t_{ij}(x)\xi \right)} where t i j : U i ∩ ∩ U j → → G {\displaystyle t_{ij}:U_{i}\cap U_{j}\to G} is a continuous map called a transition function . Two G -atlases are equivalent if their union is also a G -atlas. A G -bundle is a fiber bundle with an equivalence class of G -atlases. The group G is called the structure group of the bundle. This is related to the gauge group in physics , which is the group of automorphisms of the principal G -bundle that leave the base space unchanged.

In the smooth category, a G -bundle is a smooth fiber bundle where G is a Lie group and the corresponding action on F is smooth and the transition functions are all smooth maps.

The transition functions t i j {\displaystyle t_{ij}} satisfy the following conditions t i i ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle t_{ii}(x)=1\,} t i j ( x ) = t j i ( x ) − − 1 {\displaystyle t_{ij}(x)=t_{ji}(x)^{-1}\,} t i k ( x ) = t i j ( x ) t j k ( x ) .

{\displaystyle t_{ik}(x)=t_{ij}(x)t_{jk}(x).\,} The third condition applies on triple overlaps U i ∩ U j ∩ U k and is called the cocycle condition (see Čech cohomology ). The importance of this is that the transition functions determine the fiber bundle (if one assumes the Čech cocycle condition).

A principal G -bundle is a G -bundle where the fiber F is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of G itself (equivalently, one can specify that the action of G on the fiber F is free and transitive, i.e.

regular ). In this case, it is often a matter of convenience to identify F with G and so obtain a (right) action of G on the principal bundle.

Bundle maps [ edit ] Main article: Bundle map It is useful to have notions of a mapping between two fiber bundles.  Suppose that M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} are base spaces, and π π E : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{E}:E\to M} and π π F : F → → N {\displaystyle \pi _{F}:F\to N} are fiber bundles over M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} , respectively.  A bundle map or bundle morphism consists of a pair of continuous [ 14 ] functions φ φ : E → → F , f : M → → N {\displaystyle \varphi :E\to F,\quad f:M\to N} such that π π F ∘ ∘ φ φ = f ∘ ∘ π π E {\displaystyle \pi _{F}\circ \varphi =f\circ \pi _{E}} .  That is, the following diagram is commutative : For fiber bundles with structure group G {\displaystyle G} and whose total spaces are (right) G {\displaystyle G} -spaces (such as a principal bundle), bundle morphisms are also required to be G {\displaystyle G} - equivariant on the fibers. This means that φ φ : E → → F {\displaystyle \varphi :E\to F} is also G {\displaystyle G} -morphism from one G {\displaystyle G} -space to another, that is, φ φ ( x s ) = φ φ ( x ) s {\displaystyle \varphi (xs)=\varphi (x)s} for all x ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle x\in E} and s ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle s\in G} .

In case the base spaces M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} coincide, then a bundle morphism over M {\displaystyle M} from the fiber bundle π π E : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{E}:E\to M} to π π F : F → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{F}:F\to M} is a map φ φ : E → → F {\displaystyle \varphi :E\to F} such that π π E = π π F ∘ ∘ φ φ {\displaystyle \pi _{E}=\pi _{F}\circ \varphi } . This means that the bundle map φ φ : E → → F {\displaystyle \varphi :E\to F} covers the identity of M {\displaystyle M} . That is, f ≡ ≡ i d M {\displaystyle f\equiv \mathrm {id} _{M}} and the following diagram commutes: Assume that both π π E : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{E}:E\to M} and π π F : F → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{F}:F\to M} are defined over the same base space M {\displaystyle M} . A bundle isomorphism is a bundle map ( φ φ , f ) {\displaystyle (\varphi ,\,f)} between π π E : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{E}:E\to M} and π π F : F → → M {\displaystyle \pi _{F}:F\to M} such that f ≡ ≡ i d M {\displaystyle f\equiv \mathrm {id} _{M}} and such that φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is also a homeomorphism.

[ 15 ] Differentiable fiber bundles [ edit ] In the category of differentiable manifolds , fiber bundles arise naturally as submersions of one manifold to another. Not every (differentiable) submersion f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\to N} from a differentiable manifold M to another differentiable manifold N gives rise to a differentiable fiber bundle. For one thing, the map must be surjective, and ( M , N , f ) {\displaystyle (M,N,f)} is called a fibered manifold . However, this necessary condition is not quite sufficient, and there are a variety of sufficient conditions in common use.

If M and N are compact and connected , then any submersion f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\to N} gives rise to a fiber bundle in the sense that there is a fiber space F diffeomorphic to each of the fibers such that ( E , B , π π , F ) = ( M , N , f , F ) {\displaystyle (E,B,\pi ,F)=(M,N,f,F)} is a fiber bundle.  (Surjectivity of f {\displaystyle f} follows by the assumptions already given in this case.) More generally, the assumption of compactness can be relaxed if the submersion f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\to N} is assumed to be a surjective proper map , meaning that f − − 1 ( K ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(K)} is compact for every compact subset K of N . Another sufficient condition, due to Ehresmann (1951) , is that if f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\to N} is a surjective submersion with M and N differentiable manifolds such that the preimage f − − 1 { x } {\displaystyle f^{-1}\{x\}} is compact and connected for all x ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle x\in N,} then f {\displaystyle f} admits a compatible fiber bundle structure ( Michor 2008 , §17).

Generalizations [ edit ] The notion of a bundle applies to many more categories in mathematics, at the expense of appropriately modifying the local triviality condition; cf.

principal homogeneous space and torsor (algebraic geometry) .

In topology, a fibration is a mapping π π : E → → B {\displaystyle \pi :E\to B} that has certain homotopy-theoretic properties in common with fiber bundles.  Specifically, under mild technical assumptions a fiber bundle always has the homotopy lifting property or homotopy covering property (see Steenrod (1951 , 11.7) for details).  This is the defining property of a fibration.

A section of a fiber bundle is a "function whose output range is continuously dependent on the input." This property is formally captured in the notion of dependent type .
