It is derived from approximating just intervals using multiples of a single interval without, as is standard in equal temperaments , requiring an octave (2:1). It may be approximated by splitting the perfect fifth (3:2) into 20 equal parts (3:2 1 ⁄ 20 ≈35.1 cents), [ citation needed ] by splitting the neutral third into two equal parts, or ten equal parts of approximately 35.1 cents each ( Play ⓘ ) for 34.188 steps per octave.

[ 1 ] The scale step may also precisely be derived from using 20:11 (B ↓ , 1035 cents, Play ⓘ ) to approximate the interval 3:2 ⁄ 5:4 , [ 2 ] which equals 6:5 (E ♭ , 315.64 cents, Play ⓘ ). Thus the step is approximately 35.099 cents and there are 34.1895 per octave.
