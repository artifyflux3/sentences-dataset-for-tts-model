[ 1 ] At a later date he moved to the city of Baghdad , where most of his achievements occurred. He is mostly renowned for designing and creating astronomical instruments, astrolabes and as an astrologer. His most well known scientific achievement is his construction and description of an astrolabe that he called ( al-kurah dhat al-kursi) an astrolabe which could be used for all latitudes. The only surviving work of his is a book by the name of Kitab al-'amal bil Kurah ( On the use of the Spherical astrolabe ).
