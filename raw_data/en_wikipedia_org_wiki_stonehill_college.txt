History [ edit ] In the autumn of 1934, the Holy Cross Fathers in North Dartmouth began to look for new quarters because of increasing seminary enrollment. The current Stonehill campus was purchased from Mrs. Frederick Lothrop Ames Jr. on October 17, 1935. The initial purchase included 350 acres (1.4 km 2 ) and the original Ames mansion; the congregation purchased the remaining 190 acres (0.77 km 2 ) from Mrs. Cutler two years later.

Frederick Lothrop Ames Jr.

was the great-grandson of Oliver Ames Sr.

The first building built by the college was the Science Building which opened in February 1949.  In 1974, the building was renovated and renamed the Tracy Science Building in honor of David Tracy, a former Stonehill advisor and trustee. After the opening of the Shields Science Center in 2009, the building was converted to be used by university administration and was renamed Merkert-Tracy Hall.
