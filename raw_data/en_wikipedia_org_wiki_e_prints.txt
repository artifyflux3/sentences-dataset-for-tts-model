In academic publishing , an eprint or e-print is a digital version of a research document (usually a journal article, but could also be a thesis , conference paper, book chapter, or a book) that is accessible online, usually as green open access , whether from a local institutional or 
a central digital repository .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] When applied to journal articles, the term "eprints" covers both preprints (before peer review ) and postprints (after peer review).

Digital versions of materials other than research documents are not usually called e-prints, but some other name, such as e-books .
