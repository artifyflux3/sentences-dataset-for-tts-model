( August 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A gerontoplast is a plastid that develops from a chloroplast during the senescing of plant foliage .

[ 1 ] Gerontoplast development is generally seen to be the process of grana being unstacked, loss of thylakoid membranes , and large accumulation of plastoglobuli .

Transformation of chloroplasts to gerontoplasts [ edit ] The term gerontoplast was first introduced in 1977 to define the unique features of the plastid formed during leaf senescence.

[ 2 ] The process of senescence brings about regulated dismantling of cellular organelles involved in photosynthesis . Chloroplasts responsible for gas exchange in stomata are the last organelles to degrade during senescence, and give plants the green color.

[ 1 ] The formation of gerontoplasts from chloroplasts during senescence involves extensive structural modifications of the thylakoid membrane with the concomitant formation of a large number of plastoglobuli with lipophilic materials. The envelope of the plastid, however, remains intact.
