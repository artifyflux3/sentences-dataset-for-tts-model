In [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), **dynamic pressure** (denoted by q or Q and sometimes called **velocity pressure**) is the quantity defined by:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure#cite_note-LJC3.5-1)

![Image 1: {\displaystyle q={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \,u^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/195e8defff286e108571af869f6af39158047771)
where (in [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") units):

*   q is the dynamic [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") in [pascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (i.e., [N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)")/[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre")2),
*   œÅ (Greek letter rho) is the fluid [mass density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_density "Mass density") (e.g. in kg/m 3), and
*   u is the [flow speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_speed "Flow speed") in m/s.

It can be thought of as the fluid's [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") per unit [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume").

For [incompressible flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_flow "Incompressible flow"), the dynamic pressure of a fluid is the difference between its total pressure and [static pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_pressure "Static pressure"). From [Bernoulli's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_law "Bernoulli's law"), dynamic pressure is given by

![Image 2: {\displaystyle p_{0}-p_{\text{s}}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \,u^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13a9cd8cd188013cb9f93f5f5cce119215d9e831)
where _p_ 0 and _p_ s are the total and static pressures, respectively.

Dynamic pressure is the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") per unit volume of a fluid. Dynamic pressure is one of the terms of [Bernoulli's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_equation#Bernoulli_equations "Bernoulli's equation"), which can be derived from the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") for a fluid in motion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure#cite_note-LJC3.5-1)

At a stagnation point the dynamic pressure is equal to the difference between the [stagnation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_pressure "Stagnation pressure") and the [static pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_pressure "Static pressure"), so the dynamic pressure in a flow field can be measured at a stagnation point.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure#cite_note-LJC3.5-1)

Another important aspect of dynamic pressure is that, as [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") shows, the [aerodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics") stress (i.e. [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(physics) "Stress (physics)") within a structure subject to aerodynamic forces) experienced by an aircraft travelling at speed ![Image 3: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is proportional to the air density and square of ![Image 4: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597), i.e. proportional to ![Image 5: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d). Therefore, by looking at the variation of ![Image 6: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) during flight, it is possible to determine how the stress will vary and in particular when it will reach its maximum value. The point of maximum aerodynamic load is often referred to as _[max q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max\_q "Max q")_ and it is a critical parameter in many applications, such as launch vehicles.

Dynamic pressure can also appear as a term in the incompressible [Navier-Stokes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equation "Navier-Stokes equation") which may be written:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+\rho (\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} -\rho \nu \,\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} =-\nabla p+\rho \mathbf {g} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2ed23b9a45199900197be4859c49a52f3f0b64f)
By a [vector calculus identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identity "Vector calculus identity") (![Image 8: {\displaystyle u=|\mathbf {u} |}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/749d1e473990f1f1a5c1e59f3d178acf4942d6d8))

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \nabla (u^{2}/2)=(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} +\mathbf {u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf {u} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c0e53d85757b01f380112a693266ef0558b115c3)
so that for incompressible, [irrotational flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrotational_flow "Irrotational flow") (![Image 10: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {u} =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a522a7d1316f10b7430ea494ca6d275d51b3d0e)), the second term on the left in the Navier-Stokes equation is just the gradient of the dynamic pressure. In [hydraulics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics "Hydraulics"), the term ![Image 11: {\displaystyle u^{2}/2g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba8b0a562cac2a0d3e2a03b4f00c9acadf335e52) is known as the [hydraulic velocity head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head "Hydraulic head") (h v) so that the dynamic pressure is equal to ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \rho gh_{v}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4dde80bb1d2021c6c6dfe53d36f614c9773e587).

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/VenturiFlow.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VenturiFlow.png)

A flow of air through a [venturi meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_meter "Venturi meter"), showing the columns connected in a U-shape (a [manometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometer "Manometer")) and partially filled with water. The meter is "read" as a differential pressure head in cm or inches of water and is equivalent to the difference in [velocity head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_head "Velocity head").

The dynamic pressure, along with the static pressure and the pressure due to elevation, is used in [Bernoulli's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle "Bernoulli's principle") as an [energy balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics "First law of thermodynamics") on a [closed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system "Closed system"). The three terms are used to define the state of a closed system of an [incompressible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_flow "Incompressible flow"), constant-density fluid.

When the dynamic pressure is divided by the product of fluid density and [acceleration due to gravity, g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity"), the result is called [velocity head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_head "Velocity head"), which is used in head equations like the one used for [pressure head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_head "Pressure head") and [hydraulic head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head "Hydraulic head"). In a venturi flow meter, the _differential pressure head_ can be used to calculate the _differential velocity head_, which are equivalent in the adjacent picture. An alternative to _velocity head_ is _dynamic head_.

Many authors define _dynamic pressure_ only for incompressible flows. (For compressible flows, these authors use the concept of [impact pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_pressure "Impact pressure").) However, the definition of _dynamic pressure_ can be extended to include compressible flows.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure#cite_note-3)

For compressible flow the [isentropic relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_nozzle_flow#Supersonic_flow "Isentropic nozzle flow") can be used (also valid for incompressible flow):
