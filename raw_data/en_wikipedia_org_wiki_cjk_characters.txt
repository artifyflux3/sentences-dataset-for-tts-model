Translation of "That old man is 72 years old" in [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"), [Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese "Cantonese"), [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese "Mandarin Chinese") (in [simplified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters") and [traditional characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters")), [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), and [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language").

In [internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization "Internationalization and localization"), **CJK characters** is a collective term for [graphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphemes "Graphemes") used in the [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese "Written Chinese"), [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system "Japanese writing system"), and [Korean writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_writing_system "Korean writing system"), which each include [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters"). It can also go by **CJKV** to include [Chữ Nôm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%AF_N%C3%B4m "Chữ Nôm"), the Chinese-origin [logographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram "Logogram") script formerly used for the [Vietnamese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"), or **CJKVZ** to also include [Sawndip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawndip "Sawndip"), used to write the [Zhuang languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_languages "Zhuang languages").

Character repertoire
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CJK_characters&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Character repertoire")]

[Standard Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin_Chinese "Standard Mandarin Chinese") and [Standard Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Cantonese "Standard Cantonese") are written almost exclusively in [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters"). Over 3,000 characters are required for general literacy, with up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters—general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 2,136 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters. As of 2013, some South Korean students were still expected to learn [1,800 characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Hanja_for_educational_use "Basic Hanja for educational use").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-1)

Other scripts used for these languages, such as [bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo "Bopomofo") and the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script")-based [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin") for Chinese, [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") and [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") for Japanese, and [hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul "Hangul") for Korean, are not strictly "CJK characters", although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.

The [sinologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinology "Sinology") Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.

Until the early 20th century, [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese "Classical Chinese") was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language") was written in the _[chữ Nôm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%AF\_N%C3%B4m "Chữ Nôm")_ script, consisting of Chinese characters with many characters created locally. Since the 1920s, the script since then used for recording literature has been the Latin-based [Vietnamese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet "Vietnamese alphabet").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoulmas1991113%E2%80%93115-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeFrancis1977-3)

The number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding"), requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings. The 16-bit fixed width encodings, such as those from [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") up to and including version 2.0, are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a 16-bit encoding can accommodate—Unicode 5.0 has some 70,000 Han characters—and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the [GB 18030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030 "GB 18030") character set.

Although CJK encodings have common character sets, the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies, and are mutually incompatible. [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") has attempted, with some controversy, to unify the character sets in a process known as [Han unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification "Han unification").

CJK character encodings should consist minimally of Han characters plus language-specific phonetic scripts such as [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"), [bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo "Bopomofo"), hiragana, katakana and hangul.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-4)

CJK character encodings include:

*   [Big5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big5 "Big5") (the most prevalent encoding before Unicode was implemented)
*   [CCCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Character_Code_for_Information_Interchange "Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange")

*   [EUC-JP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUC-JP "EUC-JP")
*   [EUC-KR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUC-KR "EUC-KR")
*   [GB 2312](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_2312 "GB 2312") (subset and predecessor of GB 18030)
*   [GB 18030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030 "GB 18030") (mandated standard in the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China"))

*   [KS X 1001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KS_X_1001 "KS X 1001")
*   [KPS 9566](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPS_9566 "KPS 9566")
*   [Shift-JIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-JIS "Shift-JIS")
*   [TRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_(encoding) "TRON (encoding)")
*   [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")

The CJK character sets take up the bulk of the assigned [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") code space. There is much controversy among Japanese experts of Chinese characters about the desirability and technical merit of the [Han unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification "Han unification") process used to map multiple Chinese and Japanese character sets into a single set of unified characters.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

All three languages can be written both [left-to-right and top-to-bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts") (right-to-left and top-to-bottom in ancient documents), but are usually considered left-to-right scripts when discussing encoding issues.

Libraries cooperated on encoding standards for [JACKPHY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JACKPHY "JACKPHY") characters in the early 1980s. According to [Ken Lunde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Lunde "Ken Lunde"), the abbreviation "CJK" was a registered [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") of [Research Libraries Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Libraries_Group "Research Libraries Group")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-:0-5) (which merged with [OCLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCLC "OCLC") in 2006). The trademark owned by OCLC between 1987 and 2009 has now expired.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters#cite_note-6)
