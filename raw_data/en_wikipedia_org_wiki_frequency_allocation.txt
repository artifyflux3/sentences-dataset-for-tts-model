Find sources: "Frequency allocation" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) US frequency allocations chart, 2016 Frequency allocation (or spectrum allocation ) is the part of spectrum management dealing with the designation and regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum into frequency bands , normally done by governments in most countries.

[ 1 ] Because radio propagation does not stop at national boundaries, governments have sought to harmonise the allocation of RF bands and their standardization.

ITU definition [ edit ] The International Telecommunication Union defines frequency allocation as being of "a given frequency band for the purpose of its use by one or more terrestrial or space radiocommunication services or the radio astronomy service under specified conditions".

[ 2 ] Frequency allocation is also a special term, used in national frequency administration . Other terms are: ITU-terms pertaining to frequency regulation Frequency distribution to: ITU languages ITU RR (article) French English Spanish Arabic Chinese Russian Radiocommunication services attribution (attribuer) allocation (to allocate) atribución (atribuir) 划分 распределение (распределять) 1.16 Regions or countries allotissement (allotir) allotment (to allot) adjudicación (adjudicar) 分配 выделение (выделять) 1.17 Radio stations assignation (assigner) assignment (to assign) asignación (asignar) 指配 присвоение (присваивать) 1.18 Bodies [ edit ] Several bodies set standards for frequency allocation, including: International Telecommunication Union (ITU) European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) To improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, most service allocations are incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations within the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. Allocations are: primary secondary exclusive or shared utilization, within the responsibility of national administrations.

Allocations of military usage will be in accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations. In NATO countries, military mobile utilizations are made in accordance with the NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).

Examples [ edit ] Some of the bands listed (e.g., amateur 1.8–29.7 MHz) have gaps / are not continuous allocations.
