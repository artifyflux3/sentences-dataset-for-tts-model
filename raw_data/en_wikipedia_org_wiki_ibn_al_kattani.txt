Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn al-Husayn Ibn al-Kattani al-Madhiji ( Arabic : ابن الكتاني ) (951–1029), sometimes nicknamed "al-Mutatabbib" ( المتطبب the physician), was a well-known Arab scholar, philosopher, physician, astrologer, man of letters, and poet.

Born in Córdoba in the Caliphate of Cordoba , he wrote books on logic, inference and deduction.

For some time he was the personal physician of Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir , sultan of al-Andalus , and wrote The Treatment of Dangerous Diseases Appearing Superficially on the Body ( Mu`alajat al-amrad al-khatirah al-badiyah `ala al-badan min kharij ). It was cited by later writers, but thought to be now lost, until a copy of it was discovered among the manuscripts now at the National Library of Medicine . Much of the treatise is on the subject of poisonous bites.

[ 1 ] Al-Kattani also wrote an anthology of Andalusian poetry, and became especially famous by his book on metaphor in Andalusian poetry.

He died in Saragossa in 1029.
