Essentially, lithification is a process of porosity destruction through compaction and cementation . Lithification includes all the processes which convert unconsolidated sediments into sedimentary rocks .

Petrifaction , though often used as a synonym, is more specifically used to describe the replacement of organic material by silica in the formation of fossils .
