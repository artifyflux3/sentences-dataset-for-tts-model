Groups [ edit ] There are three polyhedral groups: The tetrahedral group of order 12, rotational symmetry group of the regular tetrahedron . It is isomorphic to A 4 .

The conjugacy classes of T are: identity 4 × rotation by 120°, order 3, cw 4 × rotation by 120°, order 3, ccw 3 × rotation by 180°, order 2 The octahedral group of order 24, rotational symmetry group of the cube and the regular octahedron . It is isomorphic to S 4 .

The conjugacy classes of O are: identity 6 × rotation by ±90° around vertices, order 4 8 × rotation by ±120° around triangle centers, order 3 3 × rotation by 180° around vertices, order 2 6 × rotation by 180° around midpoints of edges, order 2 The icosahedral group of order 60, rotational symmetry group of the regular dodecahedron and the regular icosahedron . It is isomorphic to A 5 .

The conjugacy classes of I are: identity 12 × rotation by ±72°, order 5 12 × rotation by ±144°, order 5 20 × rotation by ±120°, order 3 15 × rotation by 180°, order 2 These symmetries double to 24, 48, 120 respectively for the full reflectional groups. The reflection symmetries have 6, 9, and 15 mirrors respectively. The octahedral symmetry, [4,3] can be seen as the union of 6 tetrahedral symmetry [3,3] mirrors, and 3 mirrors of dihedral symmetry Dih 2 , [2,2].

Pyritohedral symmetry is another doubling of tetrahedral symmetry.

The conjugacy classes of full tetrahedral symmetry, T d ≅ S 4 , are: identity 8 × rotation by 120° 3 × rotation by 180° 6 × reflection in a plane through two rotation axes 6 × rotoreflection by 90° The conjugacy classes of pyritohedral symmetry, T h , include those of T, with the two classes of 4 combined, and each with inversion: identity 8 × rotation by 120° 3 × rotation by 180° inversion 8 × rotoreflection by 60° 3 × reflection in a plane The conjugacy classes of the full octahedral group, O h ≅ S 4 × C 2 , are: inversion 6 × rotoreflection by 90° 8 × rotoreflection by 60° 3 × reflection in a plane perpendicular to a 4-fold axis 6 × reflection in a plane perpendicular to a 2-fold axis The conjugacy classes of full icosahedral symmetry, I h ≅ A 5 × C 2 , include also each with inversion: inversion 12 × rotoreflection by 108°, order 10 12 × rotoreflection by 36°, order 10 20 × rotoreflection by 60°, order 6 15 × reflection, order 2 Chiral polyhedral groups [ edit ] Chiral polyhedral groups Name ( Orb.
