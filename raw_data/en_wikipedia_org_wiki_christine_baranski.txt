[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The episode was pulled from syndication by Paramount .

[ 19 ] Baranski had an uncredited role in the series Now and Again as the voice of Roger's overbearing wife Ruth, who was never seen by viewers.

Acting style and screen persona [ edit ] Although recognized for her versatility across genres and performing media, Baranski is particularly known for playing sophisticated and highly educated upper-class women.

[ 25 ] Consequently, the media began alluding to the resemblance between this repeated on-screen persona and Baranski's real personality.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Caroline Hallemann of Town & Country notes that, "For years, the award-winning actress has been the definition of on-screen sophistication." [ 29 ] In 2017, the actress told Zac Posen for Interview Magazine , "What I'm getting at is if your career is not predicated on just your physical beauty, you're able to project a sophistication. You can take sophisticated to your grave. You can be that worldly woman, that woman who looks beautiful dressed up." [ 30 ] On the other hand, Baranski humorously addressed these claims during her appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , "Everybody thinks this is, you know, this sophisticated lady, this New York type, these characters that I play, they think that's me. They should be in a room alone with me when I watch the Buffalo Bills. It is loud." [ 31 ] Personal life [ edit ] Baranski was married to actor Matthew Cowles from October 1983 until his death on May 22, 2014.

[ 32 ] Together, they had two daughters, Isabel (b. 1984), a lawyer, and Lily (b. 1987), an actress.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] She lives in Connecticut. She is a practising Catholic , at times accompanying her friend Robert King , the co-creator of The Good Fight, on the walk home during filming in 2021 following Sunday Mass .
