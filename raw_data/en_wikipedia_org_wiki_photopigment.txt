The term is generally applied to the non-protein chromophore moiety of photosensitive chromoproteins , such as the pigments involved in photosynthesis and photoreception . In medical terminology, "photopigment" commonly refers to the photoreceptor proteins of the retina .

[ 1 ] Photosynthetic pigments [ edit ] Main article: Photosynthetic pigment Photosynthetic pigments convert light into biochemical energy. Examples for photosynthetic pigments are chlorophyll , carotenoids and phycobilins .

[ 2 ] These pigments enter a high-energy state upon absorbing a photon which they can release in the form of chemical energy. This can occur via light-driven pumping of ions across a biological membrane (e.g. in the case of the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin ) or via excitation and transfer of electrons released by photolysis (e.g. in the photosystems of the thylakoid membranes of plant chloroplasts ).

[ 2 ] In chloroplasts , the light-driven electron transfer chain in turn drives the pumping of protons across the membrane.

[ 2 ] Photoreceptor pigments [ edit ] Main article: Photoreceptor protein The pigments in photoreceptor proteins either change their conformation or undergo photoreduction when they absorb a photon.

[ 3 ] This change in the conformation or redox state of the chromophore then affects the protein conformation or activity and triggers a signal transduction cascade.

[ 3 ] Examples of photoreceptor pigments include: [ 4 ] retinal (in rhodopsin ) flavin (in cryptochrome ) bilin (in phytochrome ) Photopigments of the vertebrate retina [ edit ] Main article: Opsin In medical terminology, the term photopigment is applied to opsin -type photoreceptor proteins, specifically rhodopsin and photopsins , the photoreceptor proteins in the retinal rods and cones of vertebrates that are responsible for visual perception , but also melanopsin and others.
