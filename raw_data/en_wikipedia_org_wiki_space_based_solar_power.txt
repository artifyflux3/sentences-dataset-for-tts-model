A step by step diagram on space based solar power.

**Space-based solar power** (**SBSP** or **SSP**) is the concept of collecting [solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power "Solar power") in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") with solar power satellites (SPS) and distributing it to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). Its advantages include a higher collection of energy due to the lack of [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") and absorption by the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), the possibility of very little night, and a better ability to orient to face the Sun. Space-based solar power systems convert [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") to some other form of energy (such as [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave")) which can be transmitted through the atmosphere to receivers on the Earth's surface.

[Solar panels on spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels_on_spacecraft "Solar panels on spacecraft") have been in use since 1958, when [Vanguard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_I "Vanguard I") used them to power one of its radio transmitters; however, the term (and acronyms) above are generally used in the context of large-scale transmission of energy for use on Earth.

Various SBSP proposals have been researched since the early 1970s,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-ESA-SBSP-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-DOE-SBSP-2) but as of 2014 none is economically viable with the space launch costs. Some technologists propose lowering launch costs with [space manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_manufacturing "Space manufacturing") or with radical new space launch technologies [other than rocketry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch "Non-rocket spacelaunch").

Besides cost, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit. Since wires extending from [Earth's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Surface "Earth") to an orbiting satellite are not feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally include the [wireless power transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transmission "Wireless power transmission") with its associated conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy, power a [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") transmitter or [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave [rectenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectenna "Rectenna")) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances in fiction, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the necessarily vast size of the receiving antennas would still require large blocks of land near the end users. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_damage "Radiation damage") and [micrometeoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeoroid "Micrometeoroid") damage, could also become a concern for SBSP.

As of 2020, SBSP is being actively pursued by Japan, China,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-3) Russia, India, the United Kingdom,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-4) and the US.

In 2008, Japan passed its Basic Space Law which established space solar power as a national goal.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-5)[JAXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA "JAXA") has a roadmap to commercial SBSP.

In 2015, the [China Academy for Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Academy_for_Space_Technology "China Academy for Space Technology") (CAST) showcased its roadmap at the International Space Development Conference. In February 2019, _[Science and Technology Daily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_and\_Technology\_Daily "Science and Technology Daily")_ (科技日报, Keji Ribao), the official newspaper of the [Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Science_and_Technology_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China"), reported that construction of a testing base had started in Chongqing's Bishan District. CAST vice-president Li Ming was quoted as saying China expects to be the first nation to build a working space solar power station with practical value. Chinese scientists were reported as planning to launch several small- and medium-sized space power stations between 2021 and 2025.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-7) In December 2019, [Xinhua News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency "Xinhua News Agency") reported that China plans to launch a 200-tonne SBSP station capable of generating megawatts (MW) of electricity to Earth by 2035.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-8)

In May 2020, the [US Naval Research Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Research_Laboratory "United States Naval Research Laboratory") conducted its first test of solar power generation in a satellite.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-9) In August 2021, the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology") (Caltech) announced that it planned to launch a SBSP test array by 2023, and at the same time revealed that [Donald Bren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren "Donald Bren") and his wife Brigitte, both Caltech trustees, had been since 2013 funding the institute's Space-based Solar Power Project, donating over $100 million.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-caltech2023edu-11) A Caltech team successfully demonstrated beaming power to earth in 2023.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-caltech2023edu-11)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Space_to_ground_microwave%2C_laser_pilot_beam.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space_to_ground_microwave,_laser_pilot_beam.png)

A laser pilot beam guides the microwave power transmission to a rectenna

In 1941, science fiction writer [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov") published the science fiction short story "[Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(short_story) "Reason (short story)")", in which a space station transmits energy collected from the Sun to various planets using microwave beams. The SBSP concept, originally known as satellite solar-power system (SSPS), was first described in November 1968.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-12) In 1973 [Peter Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Glaser "Peter Glaser") was granted U.S. patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances (e.g. from an SPS to Earth's surface) using [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") from a very large antenna (up to one square kilometer) on the satellite to a much larger one, now known as a [rectenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectenna "Rectenna"), on the ground.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Glaser-13)

Glaser then was a vice president at [Arthur D. Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_D._Little "Arthur D. Little"), Inc. NASA signed a contract with ADL to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974. They found that, while the concept had several major problems– chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space– it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-FS-14)

### Concept development and evaluation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Concept development and evaluation")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/NASA_solar_power_satellite_concept_1976.jpg/250px-NASA_solar_power_satellite_concept_1976.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_solar_power_satellite_concept_1976.jpg)

Artist's concept of a solar power satellite in place. Shown is the assembly of a microwave transmission antenna. The solar power satellite was to be located in a geosynchronous orbit, 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth's surface. NASA 1976

Between 1978 and 1986, the [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") authorized the [Department of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy "United States Department of Energy") (DoE) and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") to jointly investigate the concept. They organized the Satellite Power System Concept Development and Evaluation Program.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-16) The study remains the most extensive performed to date (budget $50 million).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Mankins-17) Several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such a project. They include:

*   Resource Requirements (Critical Materials, Energy, and Land)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-18)
*   Financial/Management Scenarios[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-20)
*   Public Acceptance[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-21)
*   State and Local Regulations as Applied to Satellite Power System Microwave Receiving Antenna Facilities[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-22)

*   Space Transportation[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-34)

The project was not continued with the change in administrations after the [1980 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_elections "1980 United States elections"). The [Office of Technology Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Technology_Assessment "Office of Technology Assessment") concluded that "Too little is currently known about the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of SPS to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment. In addition, without further research an SPS demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-35)

In 1997, NASA conducted its "Fresh Look" study to examine the modern state of SBSP feasibility. In assessing "What has changed" since the DOE study, NASA asserted that the "US National Space Policy now calls for NASA to make significant investments in technology (not a particular vehicle) to drive the costs of ETO _[Earth to Orbit]_ transportation down dramatically. This is, of course, an absolute requirement of space solar power."[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-36)

Conversely, [Pete Worden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Worden "Pete Worden") of NASA claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the Arizona desert, with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit. Worden referred to possible solutions as speculative and not available for decades at the earliest.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-ReferenceA-37)

On November 2, 2012, China proposed a space collaboration with India that mentioned SBSP, "may be Space-based Solar Power initiative so that both India and China can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-38)

### Exploratory Research and Technology program

SERT Integrated Symmetrical Concentrator SPS concept.NASA

In 1999, NASA initiated its **Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program** (SERT) for the following purposes:[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-42)

*   Perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts.
*   Evaluate studies of the general feasibility, design, and requirements.
*   Create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced SSP technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications.
*   Formulate a preliminary plan of action for the U.S. (working with international partners) to undertake an aggressive technology initiative.
*   Construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical space solar power (SSP) elements.

SERT went about developing a solar power satellite (SPS) concept for a future [gigawatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigawatt "Gigawatt") space power system, to provide electrical power by converting the Sun's energy and beaming it to Earth's surface, and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies. SERT proposed an [inflatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflatable_space_structures "Inflatable space structures")[photovoltaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic "Photovoltaic")[gossamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing_terminology#G "Textile manufacturing terminology") structure with concentrator lenses or [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrating_solar_power "Concentrating solar power")[heat engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_engine "Heat engine") to convert [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") into electricity. The program looked both at systems in [Sun-synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit "Sun-synchronous orbit") and [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit"). Some of SERT's conclusions:

*   The increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built.
*   The environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic.
*   Renewable energy is a compelling approach, both philosophically and in engineering terms.
*   Many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity, because of inherent land and water requirements.
*   Based on their Concept Definition Study, space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion.
*   Solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin.
*   Space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches.
*   The economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies (not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available); however, the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options.
*   Space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-43)
*   [Launch costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems "Comparison of orbital launch systems") in the range of $100–$200 per kilogram of payload from [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") to [Geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") are needed if SPS is to be economically viable.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Mankins-17)

### Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency")]

The May 2014 [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE") Spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article "It's Always Sunny in Space" by Susumu Sasaki.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-44) The article stated, "It's been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades, but space-based solar power could at last become a reality—and within 25 years, according to a proposal from researchers at the [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo")-based [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency") (JAXA)."

JAXA announced on 12 March 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity. This is the standard plan for this type of power.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-ATarantola-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-PKT-46) On 12 March 2015 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts (kW) of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters (m) away.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-47)

Aetherflux is a venture-funded company focused on beaming solar power, funded with US$50 million. It plans a constellation of small [Low Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit "Low Earth Orbit") satellites, using infrared lasers. Ground stations are about 5–10 m (16–33 ft) in diameter. It is partially supported this financial year by the [US Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Defense "US Department of Defense")'s Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-48)

Advantages and disadvantages
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Advantages and disadvantages")]

The SBSP concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the Earth's surface for the collection of solar power:

*   It is always [solar noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon#Solar_noon "Noon") in space and full sun.
*   Collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight, owing to the lack of obstructions such as [atmospheric gasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_gasses "Atmospheric gasses"), [clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), dust and other weather events. Consequently, the intensity in orbit is approximately 144% of the maximum attainable intensity on Earth's surface.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   A satellite could be illuminated over 99% of the time and be in Earth's [shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow "Shadow") a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-49) Orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), generally for 24 hours per day, whereas earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29% of the day.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-ReferenceB-50)
*   Power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most. A collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical [baseload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseload "Baseload") or [peak load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_load "Peak load") power needs.
*   Reduced [plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant") and [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") interference.
*   SBSP does not emit greenhouse gases unlike oil, gas, ethanol, and coal plants. Space based solar power also does not depend on or compete with scarce fresh water resources, unlike coal and nuclear plants.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-51)
*   SBSP generates forty times more than solar panels, and bring almost zero percent of hazardous waste to our environment. It also allows for electricity to be generated continuously, twenty four hours a day, ninety nine percent of the year.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-52)
*   If the clean energy that is provided from space-based solar power account for just five percent of our national energy consumption, our carbon footprint would be significantly reduced.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-53)

The SBSP concept also has a number of problems:

*   The large cost of launching a satellite into space. For 6.5 kg/kW, the cost to place a power satellite in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) cannot exceed $200/kg if the power cost is to be competitive.
*   Microwave optic requires gigawatt scale to compensate for [Airy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk "Airy disk") beam spreading. Typically a 1 km disk in geosynchronous orbit transmitting at 2.45 GHz spreads out to 10 km at Earth distance.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-54)
*   Inability to constrain power transmission inside tiny beam angles. For example, a beam of 0.002 degrees (7.2 arc seconds) is required to stay within a one kilometer receiving antenna target from geostationary altitude. The most advanced directional [wireless power transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer "Wireless power transfer") systems as of 2019 spread their [half power beam width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_power_beam_width "Half power beam width") across at least 0.9 arc degrees.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-58)
*   Inaccessibility: Maintenance of an earth-based solar panel is relatively simple, but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically. In addition to cost, astronauts working in GEO are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically.
*   The space environment is hostile; PV panels (if used) suffer about eight times the degradation they would on Earth (except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere).[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-59)
*   [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") is a major hazard to large objects in space, particularly for large structures such as SBSP systems in transit through the debris below 2000 km. Already in 1978, astrophysicist [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler "Donald J. Kessler") warned against a self-propagating collision cascade during the assembly of the SPS modules in LEO, which is now known as [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-61) Collision risk is much reduced in GEO since all the satellites are moving in the same direction at very close to the same speed.
*   The broadcast frequency of the microwave downlink (if used) would require isolating the SBSP systems away from other satellites. GEO space is already well used and would require coordinating with the [ITU-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-R "ITU-R").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-62)
*   The large size and corresponding cost of the receiving station on the ground. The cost has been estimated at a billion dollars for 5 GW by SBSP researcher [Keith Henson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Henson "Keith Henson").
*   Energy losses during several phases of conversion from photons to electrons to photons back to electrons.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-64)
*   [Waste heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_heat "Waste heat") disposal in space power systems is difficult to begin with, but becomes intractable when the entire spacecraft is designed to absorb as much solar radiation as possible. Traditional [spacecraft thermal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_thermal_control "Spacecraft thermal control") systems such as radiative vanes may interfere with solar panel occlusion or power transmitters.
*   Decommissioning costs: The cost of deorbiting the satellites at the end of their [service life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_life "Service life") to prevent them from exacerbating the orbital [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") problem due to impacts with asteroidal, cometary, and planetary debris[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-65) is likely to be significant. While the future cost of imparting [Delta-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-V "Delta-V") is difficult to estimate, the amount of Delta-V that must be imparted to transfer a satellite from GEO to GTO is 1472 m/s 2. If, upon reentry, the disintegrating satellite would release hazardous chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere, then the additional expenses of disassembling the satellite and deorbiting the environmentally hazardous components within a space vehicle with [downmass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downmass "Downmass") capabilities must be factored into the decommissioning costs.

Artist's concept of a solar disk on top of a LEO to GEO electrically powered [space tug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tug "Space tug").

Space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-DOE-SBSP-2)

1.   collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto [solar cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell "Solar cell") or heaters for thermal systems
2.   [wireless power transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transmission "Wireless power transmission") to Earth via [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") or [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser")
3.   receiving power on Earth via a [rectenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectenna "Rectenna"), a microwave antenna

The space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity (other than relatively weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will have to cope with space hazards such as [micrometeors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeor "Micrometeor") and [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flares "Solar flares"). Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: [photovoltaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic "Photovoltaic") (PV) and [solar dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy "Solar thermal energy") (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. [Wireless power transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transmission "Wireless power transmission") was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.

### Microwave power transmission

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Microwave power transmission")]

[William C. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_C._Brown "William C. Brown") demonstrated in 1964, during [Walter Cronkite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite "Walter Cronkite")'s [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") News program, a microwave-powered model [helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter") that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam. Between 1969 and 1975, Bill Brown was technical director of a [JPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPL "JPL")[Raytheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon "Raytheon") program that beamed 30 [kW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt "Kilowatt") of power over a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km) at 9.6% efficiency.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-68)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Brown-69)

The beam does spread out due to diffraction. At 2.45 GHz, a one km phased array transmitting antenna at GEO spreads to about 10 km diameter to the first zero ring.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-70) The overall transmission efficiency is close to 50% depending on many factors. [[1]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150016560/downloads/20150016560.pdf)

Microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at [Goldstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_Deep_Space_Communications_Complex "Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex") in California (1975)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Brown-69)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-72) and Grand Bassin on [Reunion Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_Island "Reunion Island") (1997).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-73)

More recently, microwave power transmission has been demonstrated, in conjunction with solar energy capture, between a mountaintop in Maui and the island of Hawaii (92 miles away), by a team under [John C. Mankins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Mankins "John C. Mankins").[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-75) Technological challenges in terms of array layout, single radiation element design, and overall efficiency, as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research, as it was demonstrated by the Special Session on "Analysis of Electromagnetic Wireless Systems for Solar Power Transmission" held during the 2010 [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE") Symposium on Antennas and Propagation.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-76) In 2013, a useful overview was published, covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground. It includes an introduction to SPS, current research and future prospects.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Sasaki-77) Moreover, a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the Proceedings of the IEEE.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-MASSA-78)

### Laser power beaming

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Laser power beaming")]

[Laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") power beaming was envisioned by some at NASA as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser. In 1989, it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991, the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of [laser power beaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_power_beaming "Laser power beaming") for supplying power to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-79)

### Laser Solar Satellites

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Laser Solar Satellites")]

Laser Solar Satellites are smaller in size, meaning that they have to work as a group with other similar satellites. There are many pros to Laser Solar Satellites, specifically regarding their lower overall costs in comparison to other satellites. While the cost is lower than other satellites, there are various safety concerns, and other concerns regarding this satellite.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-80) Laser-emitting solar satellites only need to venture about 400 km into space, but because of their small generation capacity, hundreds or thousands of laser satellites would need to be launched in order to create a sustainable impact. A single satellite launch can range from fifty to four hundred million dollars. Lasers could be helpful for the energy from the sun harvested in space, to be returned back to Earth in order for terrestrial power demands to be met.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-81)

The main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit, LEO requires several satellites before they are producing nearly continuous power.

Power beaming from [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1 km diameter transmitting antenna and a 10 km diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at [2.45 GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band "ISM band"). These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased [atmospheric absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_absorption "Water absorption") and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the [thinned array curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinned_array_curse "Thinned array curse"), it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.[_[original research?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research "Wikipedia:No original research")_]

A collection of LEO ([low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit")) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO ([geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit")) space-based solar power.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-82)

### Earth-based receiver

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Earth-based receiver")]

The Earth-based [rectenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectenna "Rectenna") would likely consist of many short [dipole antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna "Dipole antenna") connected via [diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"). Microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85% efficiency.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-83) With a conventional microwave antenna, the reception efficiency is better, but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater. Rectennas would likely be several kilometers across.

### In space applications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: In space applications")]

A laser SBSP could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the Moon or Mars, saving on mass costs to land the power source. A spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means. In a 2012 report presented to NASA on space solar power, the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind space solar power could be for solar electric propulsion systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-85)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-86)

One problem with the SBSP concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched.

Much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which raises the possibility that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include [ion thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster "Ion thruster") or [nuclear propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_propulsion "Nuclear propulsion"). Infrastructure including solar panels, power converters, and power transmitters will have to be built in order to begin the process. This will be extremely expensive and maintaining them will cost even more.

To give an idea of the scale of the problem, assuming a solar panel mass of 20 kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 [metric tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tons "Metric tons"),[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-87) all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. This is, however, far from the state of the art for flown spacecraft, which as of 2015 was 150 W/kg (6.7 kg/kW), and improving rapidly.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-88) Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1 kg/kW,[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-89) meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. Beyond the mass of the panels, overhead (including boosting to the desired orbit and stationkeeping) must be added.

Launch costs for 4 GW to LEO |  | 1 kg/kW | 5 kg/kW | 20 kg/kW |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $1/kg (Minimum cost at ~$0.13/kWh power, 100% efficiency) | $4M | $20M | $80M |
| $2000/kg (ex: [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy")) | $8B | $40B | $160B |
| $10000/kg (ex: [Ariane V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_V "Ariane V")) | $40B | $200B | $800B |

To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch missions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-90) or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the [full cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_full-cost_accounting "Environmental full-cost accounting") to the environment from CO 2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively).

Building from space
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Building from space")]

### From lunar materials launched in orbit

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: From lunar materials launched in orbit")]

[Gerard O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill "Gerard K. O'Neill"), noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, proposed building the SPS's in orbit with materials from the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-91)[Launch costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon#Launch_costs "Colonization of the Moon") from the Moon are potentially much lower than from Earth because of the lower [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") and lack of [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag"). This 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of NASA's space shuttle. This approach would require substantial upfront capital investment to establish [mass drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver "Mass driver") on the Moon.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-92) Nevertheless, on 30 April 1979, the Final Report ("Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction") by General Dynamics' Convair Division, under NASA contract NAS9-15560, concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than Earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10 GW capacity each.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-93)

In 1980, when it became obvious NASA's launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic, O'Neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-94) This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially [self-replicating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine#Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions "Self-replicating machine") on the lunar surface under [remote control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence "Telepresence") of workers stationed on Earth. The high [net energy gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_energy_gain "Net energy gain") of this proposal derives from the Moon's much shallower [gravitational well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_well "Gravitational well").

Having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of SPS being built. The low cost per pound of lunar materials in O'Neill's vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites. Advanced techniques for launching from the Moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials. Some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the [lunar space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_space_elevator "Lunar space elevator"), first described by Jerome Pearson.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-95) It would require establishing [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon") mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Physicist Dr [David Criswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Criswell "David Criswell") suggests the Moon is the optimum location for solar power stations, and promotes lunar-based solar power.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-96)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-97)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-98) The main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials, using [in-situ resource utilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_resource_utilization "In-situ resource utilization"), with a [teleoperated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_manipulator "Remote manipulator") mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors, and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells,[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-99) which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to SBSP designs. Power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the Moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project. A demo project of 1 GW starts at $50 billion.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-100) The [Shimizu Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimizu_Corporation "Shimizu Corporation") use combination of lasers and microwave for the [Luna Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_Ring "Luna Ring") concept, along with power relay satellites.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-101)[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-102)

[Asteroid mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining "Asteroid mining") has also been seriously considered. A NASA design study[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-103) evaluated a 10,000-ton mining vehicle (to be assembled in orbit) that would return a 500,000-ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit. Only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload. The rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine, which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload. Assuming that 100% of the returned asteroid was useful, and that the asteroid miner itself couldn't be reused, that represents nearly a 95% reduction in launch costs. However, the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids; thus far, we have only estimates of their composition.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-104) One proposal is to capture the asteroid [Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis "99942 Apophis") into Earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 GW each or the larger asteroid 1999 AN10, which is 50 times the size of Apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-gigawatt solar power satellites[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-105)

The potential exposure of humans and animals on the ground to the high power microwave beams is a significant concern with these systems. At the Earth's surface, a suggested SPSP microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23 mW/cm 2.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-intensity-106) While this is less than 1/4 the [solar irradiation constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight#Intensity_in_the_Solar_System "Sunlight"), microwaves penetrate much deeper into tissue than sunlight, and at this level would exceed the current United States [Occupational Safety and Health Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Act "Occupational Safety and Health Act") (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves at 10 mW/cm 2[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-107) At 23 mW/cm 2, studies show humans experience significant deficits in spatial learning and memory.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-Zhi_Wang_Hu_2017_p.-108) If the diameter of the proposed SPSP array is increased by 2.5x, the energy density on the ground increases to 1 W/cm 2.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-109) At this level, the [median lethal dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose "Median lethal dose") for mice is 30-60 seconds of microwave exposure.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-apps.dtic.mil_f957-110) While designing an array with 2.5x larger diameter should be avoided, the [dual-use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use "Dual-use") military potential of such a system is readily apparent.

With good array sidelobe design, outside the receiver may be less than the OSHA long-term levels[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-111) as over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna. However, any accidental or intentional mis-pointing of the satellite could be deadly to life on Earth within the beam.

Exposure to the beam can be minimized in various ways. On the ground, assuming the beam is pointed correctly, physical access must be controllable (e.g., via fencing). Typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a [Faraday Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_Cage "Faraday Cage")), which will intercept the microwaves.[_[original research?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research "Wikipedia:No original research")_] Other aircraft ([balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon "Balloon"), [ultralight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight "Ultralight"), etc.) can avoid exposure by using controlled airspace, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. In addition, a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore,[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-112)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-113) but this presents serious problems, including corrosion, mechanical stresses, and biological contamination.

A commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective [phased array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array "Phased array") antenna/rectenna. A "pilot" microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. If the phase offset to the pilot is chosen the same for all elements, the transmitted beam should be centered precisely on the rectenna and have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-IEEE_602864-114) Such a system would not focus its power beam very effectively anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied.

Non-typical configurations and architectural considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space-based_solar_power&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Non-typical configurations and architectural considerations")]

The typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number (several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of Earth's energy requirements) of individual satellites in GEO. The typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 GW range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltaics (PV) as the energy collector / conversion. The most typical transmission designs are in the 1–10 GHz (2.45 or 5.8 GHz) RF band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere. Materials for the satellites are sourced from, and manufactured on Earth and expected to be transported to LEO via re-usable rocket launch, and transported between LEO and GEO via chemical or electrical propulsion. In summary, the architecture choices are:

*   Location = GEO
*   Energy Collection = PV
*   Satellite = Monolithic Structure
*   Transmission = RF
*   Materials & Manufacturing = Earth
*   Installation = RLVs to LEO, Chemical to GEO

There are several interesting design variants from the reference system:

Alternate energy collection location: While GEO is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to Earth, simplified pointing and tracking, very small time in occultation, and scalability to meet all global demand several times over, other locations have been proposed:

*   Sun Earth L1: Robert Kennedy III, Ken Roy & David Fields have proposed a variant of the L1 sunshade called "Dyson Dots"[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-136) where a multi-terawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of LEO sun-synchronous receiver satellites. The much farther distance to Earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture.
*   Lunar surface: [David Criswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Criswell "David Criswell") has proposed using the Lunar surface itself as the collection medium, beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in Earth Orbit. The chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch. Disadvantages include the much longer distance, requiring larger transmission systems, the required "overbuild" to deal with the lunar night, and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-137)
*   MEO: MEO systems have been proposed for in-space utilities and beam-power propulsion infrastructures. For example, see Royce Jones' paper.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-138)
*   Highly elliptical orbits: Molniya, Tundra, or Quazi Zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets, requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-139)
*   Sun-sync LEO: In this near Polar Orbit, the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the Sun as they rotate around Earth. This is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy, and its proximity to Earth requires smaller (and therefore less massive) transmitting apertures. However disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations, or storing energy for a burst transmission. This orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris.
*   Equatorial LEO: Japan's SPS 2000 proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial LEO in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-140)
*   Earth's surface: Narayan Komerath has proposed a space power grid where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit, across to another satellite and down to receivers.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-141)

Energy collection: The most typical designs for solar power satellites include photovoltaics. These may be planar (and usually passively cooled), concentrated (and perhaps actively cooled). However, there are multiple interesting variants.

*   Solar thermal: Proponents of solar thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators. Advantages of this method might include overall system mass (disputed), eliminating degradation due to solar-wind damage, and radiation tolerance. One recent thermal solar power satellite design by [Keith Henson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Henson "Keith Henson") and others has been visualized here. [Thermal Space Solar Power concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Lrj35HcbQ) A related concept is here: [Beamed Energy Bootstrapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkZkINrJaA) The proposed radiators are thin wall plastic tube filled with low pressure (2.4 kPa) and temperature (20 deg C) steam.
*   Solar pumped laser: Japan has pursued a [solar-pumped laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-pumped_laser "Solar-pumped laser"), where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to Earth.
*   Stellaser: A hypothetical concept of a very large laser where a star provides both the lasing energy and the lasing medium, producing a steerable energy beam of unrivaled power.
*   Fusion decay: This version of a power-satellite is not "solar". Rather, the vacuum of space is seen as a "feature not a bug" for traditional fusion. Per Paul Werbos, after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   [Solar wind loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson%E2%80%93Harrop_satellite "Dyson–Harrop satellite"): Also called a [Dyson–Harrop satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson%E2%80%93Harrop_satellite "Dyson–Harrop satellite"). Here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the Sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electro-magnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop.
*   Direct mirrors: Early concepts for direct mirror re-direction of light to planet Earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the Earth is quite large. Lewis Fraas has explored an array of parabolic mirrors to augment existing solar arrays.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-142)

Alternate satellite architecture: The typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss, one or more collectors, one or more transmitters, and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors. The entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized. Alternative designs include:

*   Swarms of smaller satellites: Some designs propose swarms of free-flying smaller satellites. This is the case with several laser designs, and appears to be the case with CALTECH's Flying Carpets.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-143) For RF designs, an engineering constraint is the [thinned array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinned_array_curse "Thinned array curse") problem.
*   Free floating components: [Solaren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaren "Solaren") has proposed an alternative to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are free-flying.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-144)
*   Spin stabilization: NASA explored a spin-stabilized thin film concept.
*   Photonic laser thruster (PLT) stabilized structure: Young Bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-145)

Transmission: The most typical design for energy transmission is via an RF antenna at below 10 GHz to a rectenna on the ground. Controversy exists between the benefits of Klystrons, Gyrotrons, Magnetrons and solid state. Alternate transmission approaches include:

*   Laser: Lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power, however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency. Lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures. However, a highly concentrated beam has eye-safety, fire safety, and weaponization concerns. Proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns. A laser-based approach must also find alternate ways of coping with clouds and precipitation.
*   Atmospheric waveguide: Some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to create an atmospheric waveguide through which concentrated microwaves could flow.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-146)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-147)[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-148)
*   Nuclear synthesis: [Particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerators "Particle accelerators") based in the inner solar system (whether in orbit or on a planet such as [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)")) could use solar energy to synthesize nuclear fuel from naturally occurring materials. While this would be highly inefficient using current technology (in terms of the amount of energy needed to manufacture the fuel compared to the amount of energy contained in the fuel) and would raise obvious [nuclear safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_safety "Nuclear safety") issues, the basic technology upon which such an approach would rely on has been in use for decades, making this possibly the most reliable means of sending energy especially over very long distances - in particular, from the inner solar system to the outer solar system.

Materials and manufacturing: Typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on Earth, and use Earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant. Variants include:

*   Lunar materials: Designs exist for Solar Power Satellites that source >99% of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of "vitamins" from other locations. Using materials from the Moon is attractive because launch from the Moon is in theory far less complicated than from Earth. There is no atmosphere, and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration, pressure and temperature loads. Launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and bypass the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely. Launch from the Moon the GEO also requires far less energy than from Earth's much deeper gravity well. Building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the Moon.
*   Self-replication on the Moon: NASA explored a self-replicating factory on the Moon in the early 1980s.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-149) More recently, Justin Lewis-Webber proposed a method of speciated manufacture of core elements[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-150) based upon John Mankins SPS-Alpha design.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-151)[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-152)
*   Asteroidal materials: Some asteroids are thought to have even lower Delta-V to recover materials than the Moon, and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access.
*   In-space/in-situ manufacturing: With the advent of in-space additive manufacturing, concepts such as SpiderFab might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-153)

Method of installation / Transportation of Material to Energy Collection Location: In the reference designs, component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets (usually fully reusable launch systems) to LEO, after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to GEO. The desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost. Alternate concepts include:

*   Lunar chemical launch: ULA has recently showcased a concept for a fully re-usable chemical lander XEUS to move materials from the Lunar surface to LLO or GEO.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-154)
*   Lunar [mass driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver "Mass driver"): Launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult. An unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron.
*   [Lunar space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_space_elevator "Lunar space elevator"): An equatorial or near-equatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point. This is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver.
*   [Space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator "Space elevator"): A ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in Geostationary orbit, allowing climbers to climb up to GEO. Problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length (36,000 km!) with adequate strength, management of collisions with satellites and space debris, and lightning.
*   MEO Skyhook: As part of an AFRL study, Roger Lenard proposed a MEO Skyhook. It appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in MEO can be constructed of available materials. The bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a "non-keplerian orbit". A re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit (travelling much slower than typical orbital speed). The payload is transferred and it climbs the cable. The cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propulsion and/or electromagnetic effects.
*   [MAGLEV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev "Maglev") launch / [StarTram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTram "StarTram"): John Powell has a concept for a very high mass-flow system. In a first-gen system, built into a mountain, accelerates a payload through an evacuated MAGLEV track. A small on-board rocket circularizes the payload.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-155)
*   Beamed energy launch: [Kevin Parkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_L.G._Parkin "Kevin L.G. Parkin") and [Escape Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Dynamics "Escape Dynamics") both have concepts[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_note-156) for ground-based irradiation of a mono-propellant launch vehicle using RF energy. The RF energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in NERVA-style nuclear-thermal. LaserMotive has a concept for a laser-based approach.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power#cite_ref-109 "Jump up")**An increase in space array diameter of 2.5x increases the array element count by 6.25x, which increases total power transmitted by this factor. In addition for a coherent microwave beam, the ground spot area decreases by 6.25x, therefore the power density on ground increases by 6.25 2 = 40x. This increases the proposed 23 W/cm 2 to about 1 W/cm 2

Several scenarios for the buildup of industry in space are described. One scenario involves a manufacturing facility, with a crew of three, entirely on the lunar surface. Another scenario involves a fully automated manufacturing facility, remotely supervised from the earth, with provision for occasional visits by repair crews. A third case involves a crewed facility on the Moon for operating a mass-driver launcher to transport lunar materials to a collection point in space and for replicating mass-drivers.
