[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The term is also used to refer to unread books on a bookshelf meant for reading later.

The term originated in the Meiji era (1868–1912) as Japanese slang.

[ 4 ] It combines elements of the terms tsunde-oku ( 積んでおく ; "to pile things up ready for later and leave") , and dokusho ( 読書 ; "reading books") .

[ citation needed ] There are suggestions to use the word in the English language and include it in dictionaries like the Collins Dictionary .

[ 4 ] The American author and bibliophile A. Edward Newton commented on a similar state in 1921.

[ 5 ] In his 2007 book The Black Swan , Nassim Nicholas Taleb popularized the term " antilibrary ", which was coined by Umberto Eco to characterize Jonathan Swift's description of a library in Gulliver's Travels and has been compared with tsundoku .
