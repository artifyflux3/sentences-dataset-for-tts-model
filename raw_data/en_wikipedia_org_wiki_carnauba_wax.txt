[ 3 ] It is known as the "Queen of Waxes".

[ 4 ] In its pure state, it is usually available in the form of hard yellow-brown flakes. It is obtained by collecting and drying the leaves, beating them to loosen the wax, then refining and bleaching it.

[ 5 ] As a food additive, its E number is E903 .

Composition [ edit ] Carnauba palm Carnauba consists mostly of aliphatic esters (40 wt%), diesters of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (21.0 wt%), ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids (13.0 wt%), and fatty alcohols (12 wt%). The compounds are predominantly derived from acids and alcohols in the C26-C30 range. It is distinctive for its high content of diesters and its methoxycinnamic acid .

[ 6 ] It is sold in grades of T1, T3 and T4 according to its purity level, which is accomplished by filtration, centrifugation and bleaching.

Chocolate dragées coated with carnauba wax Properties [ edit ] As it creates a glossy finish, carnauba wax is used in automobile waxes, shoe polishes , dental floss , food products (such as sweets ), polishes for musical instruments, and floor and furniture waxes and polishes. It is commonly used for paper coatings in the United States.

[ 7 ] It is also used in some surfboard waxes .

[ citation needed ] Due to its hypoallergenic and emollient properties as well as its gloss, carnauba wax is used as a thickener in cosmetics such as lipstick, eyeliner, mascara , eye shadow, foundation, deodorant, and skincare and sun care preparations.

[ citation needed ] It is also used to make cutler's resin for attaching handles to bladed tools and weapons.

It is the finish of choice for most briar tobacco smoking pipes .

[ citation needed ] Although too brittle to be used alone, carnauba wax is often combined with other waxes (principally beeswax ) to treat and waterproof leather products, where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather's hardness and durability.

It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a coating to make tablets easier to swallow. A very small amount (less than 1/100 of 1% by weight, e.g. 30 grams per 300 kg) is sprinkled onto a batch of sprayed and dried tablets then tumbled for a few minutes to coat them.

[ citation needed ] In 1890 carnauba wax was patented as a replacement for the standard paraffin /beeswax mixture used in phonograph cylinders .

Carnauba wax may be used as a mold release agent for manufacturing fibre-reinforced plastics . An aerosol form is made by dissolving it in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE , carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy , epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types. It is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.

[ 8 ] It is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B , which is a blend of RDX and TNT .

Production and export [ edit ] In 2006, Brazil produced 22,409 tons of carnauba wax, of which 14% was solid and 86% was in powder form.
There are 20 to 25 exporters of carnauba wax in Brazil who, after buying it from middlemen or directly from farmers, refine the wax before shipping it to the rest of the world. 
The four largest exporters are Pontes , Brasil Ceras , Foncepi, and Carnauba do Brasil, who together account for around €25 million of the export market. According to the German television program Markencheck , conditions for many carnauba production workers are quite poor; one Brazilian Labor Ministry official found conditions "that could be described as slavery." [ 9 ] [ 10 ] According to the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade , the major destinations for exported carnauba wax are: United States (25%) Japan (15–25%) Germany (10–15%) Netherlands (5%) Italy (5%) China (5%) Other countries (13%) The Initiative for Responsible Carnauba (IRC) was founded in 2018 as part of the Private Business Action for Biodiversity project, in association with the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) . Its aim is to foster responsible production that respects workers’ rights and preserves biodiversity. In an established working group with 20 local manufacturers and international distributors and brands, the IRC has set social, traceability and biodiversity standards and helped local producers implement them, with the UEBT's support.

[ 11 ] In collaboration with the local NGO Associação Caatinga, the Initiative has created a manual of good practices for the sector [ 12 ] and 12 short learning videos, [ 13 ] available on YouTube and sharable via WhatsApp, to inform field workers of their rights and about good biodiversity practices.
