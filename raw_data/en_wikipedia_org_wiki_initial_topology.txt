The subspace topology and product topology constructions are both special cases of initial topologies. Indeed, the initial topology construction can be viewed as a generalization of these.

The dual notion is the final topology , which for a given family of functions mapping to a set Y {\displaystyle Y} is the finest topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} that makes those functions continuous.

Definition [ edit ] Given a set X {\displaystyle X} and an indexed family ( Y i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(Y_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} of topological spaces with functions f i : X → → Y i , {\displaystyle f_{i}:X\to Y_{i},} the initial topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } on X {\displaystyle X} is the coarsest topology on X {\displaystyle X} such that each f i : ( X , τ τ ) → → Y i {\displaystyle f_{i}:(X,\tau )\to Y_{i}} is continuous .

Definition in terms of open sets If ( τ τ i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(\tau _{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a family of topologies X {\displaystyle X} indexed by I ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle I\neq \varnothing ,} then the least upper bound topology of these topologies is the coarsest topology on X {\displaystyle X} that is finer than each τ τ i .

{\displaystyle \tau _{i}.} This topology always exists and it is equal to the topology generated by ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I τ τ i .

{\textstyle \bigcup _{i\in I}\tau _{i}.} [ 3 ] If for every i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} σ σ i {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}} denotes the topology on Y i , {\displaystyle Y_{i},} then f i − − 1 ( σ σ i ) = { f i − − 1 ( V ) : V ∈ ∈ σ σ i } {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}\left(\sigma _{i}\right)=\left\{f_{i}^{-1}(V):V\in \sigma _{i}\right\}} is a topology on X {\displaystyle X} , and the initial topology of the Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} by the mappings f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} is the least upper bound topology of the I {\displaystyle I} -indexed family of topologies f i − − 1 ( σ σ i ) {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}\left(\sigma _{i}\right)} (for i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} ).

[ 3 ] Explicitly, the initial topology is the collection of open sets generated by all sets of the form f i − − 1 ( U ) , {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}(U),} where U {\displaystyle U} is an open set in Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} for some i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} under finite intersections and arbitrary unions.

Sets of the form f i − − 1 ( V ) {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}(V)} are often called cylinder sets . If I {\displaystyle I} contains exactly one element , then all the open sets of the initial topology ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} are cylinder sets.

Examples [ edit ] Several topological constructions can be regarded as special cases of the initial topology.

The subspace topology is the initial topology on the subspace with respect to the inclusion map .

The product topology is the initial topology with respect to the family of projection maps .

The inverse limit of any inverse system of spaces and continuous maps is the set-theoretic inverse limit together with the initial topology determined by the canonical morphisms.

The weak topology on a locally convex space is the initial topology with respect to the continuous linear forms of its dual space .

Given a family of topologies { τ τ i } {\displaystyle \left\{\tau _{i}\right\}} on a fixed set X {\displaystyle X} the initial topology on X {\displaystyle X} with respect to the functions id i : X → → ( X , τ τ i ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{i}:X\to \left(X,\tau _{i}\right)} is the supremum (or join) of the topologies { τ τ i } {\displaystyle \left\{\tau _{i}\right\}} in the lattice of topologies on X .

{\displaystyle X.} That is, the initial topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is the topology generated by the union of the topologies { τ τ i } .

{\displaystyle \left\{\tau _{i}\right\}.} A topological space is completely regular if and only if it has the initial topology with respect to its family of ( bounded ) real-valued continuous functions.

Every topological space X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology with respect to the family of continuous functions from X {\displaystyle X} to the Sierpiński space .

Properties [ edit ] Characteristic property [ edit ] The initial topology on X {\displaystyle X} can be characterized by the following characteristic property: A function g {\displaystyle g} from some space Z {\displaystyle Z} to X {\displaystyle X} is continuous if and only if f i ∘ ∘ g {\displaystyle f_{i}\circ g} is continuous for each i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} [ 4 ] Characteristic property of the initial topology Note that, despite looking quite similar, this is not a universal property . A categorical description is given below.

A filter B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} on X {\displaystyle X} converges to a point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} if and only if the prefilter f i ( B ) {\displaystyle f_{i}({\mathcal {B}})} converges to f i ( x ) {\displaystyle f_{i}(x)} for every i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} [ 4 ] Evaluation [ edit ] By the universal property of the product topology , we know that any family of continuous maps f i : X → → Y i {\displaystyle f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}} determines a unique continuous map f : X → → ∏ ∏ i Y i x ↦ ↦ ( f i ( x ) ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{4}f:\;&&X&&\;\to \;&\prod _{i}Y_{i}\\[0.3ex]&&x&&\;\mapsto \;&\left(f_{i}(x)\right)_{i\in I}\\\end{alignedat}}} This map is known as the evaluation map .

[ citation needed ] A family of maps { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\}} is said to separate points in X {\displaystyle X} if for all x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} in X {\displaystyle X} there exists some i {\displaystyle i} such that f i ( x ) ≠ ≠ f i ( y ) .

{\displaystyle f_{i}(x)\neq f_{i}(y).} The family { f i } {\displaystyle \{f_{i}\}} separates points if and only if the associated evaluation map f {\displaystyle f} is injective .

The evaluation map f {\displaystyle f} will be a topological embedding if and only if X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology determined by the maps { f i } {\displaystyle \{f_{i}\}} and this family of maps separates points in X .

{\displaystyle X.} Hausdorffness [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology induced by { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} and if every Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} is Hausdorff, then X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff space if and only if these maps separate points on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 3 ] Transitivity of the initial topology [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology induced by the I {\displaystyle I} -indexed family of mappings { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} and if for every i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} the topology on Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} is the initial topology induced by some J i {\displaystyle J_{i}} -indexed family of mappings { g j : Y i → → Z j } {\displaystyle \left\{g_{j}:Y_{i}\to Z_{j}\right\}} (as j {\displaystyle j} ranges over J i {\displaystyle J_{i}} ), then the initial topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} is equal to the initial topology induced by the ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I J i {\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigcup \limits _{i\in I}J_{i}}} -indexed family of mappings { g j ∘ ∘ f i : X → → Z j } {\displaystyle \left\{g_{j}\circ f_{i}:X\to Z_{j}\right\}} as i {\displaystyle i} ranges over I {\displaystyle I} and j {\displaystyle j} ranges over J i .

{\displaystyle J_{i}.} [ 5 ] Several important corollaries of this fact are now given.

In particular, if S ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle S\subseteq X} then the subspace topology that S {\displaystyle S} inherits from X {\displaystyle X} is equal to the initial topology induced by the inclusion map S → → X {\displaystyle S\to X} (defined by s ↦ ↦ s {\displaystyle s\mapsto s} ). Consequently, if X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology induced by { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} then the subspace topology that S {\displaystyle S} inherits from X {\displaystyle X} is equal to the initial topology induced on S {\displaystyle S} by the restrictions { f i | S : S → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{\left.f_{i}\right|_{S}:S\to Y_{i}\right\}} of the f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} to S .

{\displaystyle S.} [ 4 ] The product topology on ∏ ∏ i Y i {\displaystyle \prod _{i}Y_{i}} is equal to the initial topology induced by the canonical projections pr i : ( x k ) k ∈ ∈ I ↦ ↦ x i {\displaystyle \operatorname {pr} _{i}:\left(x_{k}\right)_{k\in I}\mapsto x_{i}} as i {\displaystyle i} ranges over I .

{\displaystyle I.} [ 4 ] Consequently, the initial topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} is equal to the inverse image of the product topology on ∏ ∏ i Y i {\displaystyle \prod _{i}Y_{i}} by the evaluation map f : X → → ∏ ∏ i Y i .

{\textstyle f:X\to \prod _{i}Y_{i}\,.} [ 4 ] Furthermore, if the maps { f i } i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}\right\}_{i\in I}} separate points on X {\displaystyle X} then the evaluation map is a homeomorphism onto the subspace f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} of the product space ∏ ∏ i Y i .

{\displaystyle \prod _{i}Y_{i}.} [ 4 ] Separating points from closed sets [ edit ] If a space X {\displaystyle X} comes equipped with a topology, it is often useful to know whether or not the topology on X {\displaystyle X} is the initial topology induced by some family of maps on X .

{\displaystyle X.} This section gives a sufficient (but not necessary) condition.

A family of maps { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} separates points from closed sets in X {\displaystyle X} if for all closed sets A {\displaystyle A} in X {\displaystyle X} and all x ∉ A , {\displaystyle x\not \in A,} there exists some i {\displaystyle i} such that f i ( x ) ∉ ∉ cl ⁡ ⁡ ( f i ( A ) ) {\displaystyle f_{i}(x)\notin \operatorname {cl} (f_{i}(A))} where cl {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} } denotes the closure operator .

Theorem . A family of continuous maps { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} separates points from closed sets if and only if the cylinder sets f i − − 1 ( V ) , {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}(V),} for V {\displaystyle V} open in Y i , {\displaystyle Y_{i},} form a base for the topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} It follows that whenever { f i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}\right\}} separates points from closed sets, the space X {\displaystyle X} has the initial topology induced by the maps { f i } .

{\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}\right\}.} The converse fails, since generally the cylinder sets will only form a subbase (and not a base) for the initial topology.

If the space X {\displaystyle X} is a T 0 space , then any collection of maps { f i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}\right\}} that separates points from closed sets in X {\displaystyle X} must also separate points. In this case, the evaluation map will be an embedding.

Initial uniform structure [ edit ] Main article: Uniform space If ( U i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {U}}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a family of uniform structures on X {\displaystyle X} indexed by I ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle I\neq \varnothing ,} then the least upper bound uniform structure of ( U i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {U}}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is the coarsest uniform structure on X {\displaystyle X} that is finer than each U i .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}_{i}.} This uniform always exists and it is equal to the filter on X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} generated by the filter subbase ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I U i .

{\displaystyle {\textstyle \bigcup \limits _{i\in I}{\mathcal {U}}_{i}}.} [ 6 ] If τ τ i {\displaystyle \tau _{i}} is the topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by the uniform structure U i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}_{i}} then the topology on X {\displaystyle X} associated with least upper bound uniform structure is equal to the least upper bound topology of ( τ τ i ) i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle \left(\tau _{i}\right)_{i\in I}.} [ 6 ] Now suppose that { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} is a family of maps and for every i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} let U i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}_{i}} be a uniform structure on Y i .

{\displaystyle Y_{i}.} Then the initial uniform structure of the Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} by the mappings f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} is the unique coarsest uniform structure U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} on X {\displaystyle X} making all f i : ( X , U ) → → ( Y i , U i ) {\displaystyle f_{i}:\left(X,{\mathcal {U}}\right)\to \left(Y_{i},{\mathcal {U}}_{i}\right)} uniformly continuous .

[ 6 ] It is equal to the least upper bound uniform structure of the I {\displaystyle I} -indexed family of uniform structures f i − − 1 ( U i ) {\displaystyle f_{i}^{-1}\left({\mathcal {U}}_{i}\right)} (for i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} ).

[ 6 ] The topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is the coarsest topology on X {\displaystyle X} such that every f i : X → → Y i {\displaystyle f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}} is continuous.

[ 6 ] The initial uniform structure U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is also equal to the coarsest uniform structure such that the identity mappings id : ( X , U ) → → ( X , f i − − 1 ( U i ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} :\left(X,{\mathcal {U}}\right)\to \left(X,f_{i}^{-1}\left({\mathcal {U}}_{i}\right)\right)} are uniformly continuous.

[ 6 ] Hausdorffness : The topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by the initial uniform structure U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is Hausdorff if and only if for whenever x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y\in X} are distinct ( x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} ) then there exists some i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} and some entourage V i ∈ ∈ U i {\displaystyle V_{i}\in {\mathcal {U}}_{i}} of Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} such that ( f i ( x ) , f i ( y ) ) ∉ V i .

{\displaystyle \left(f_{i}(x),f_{i}(y)\right)\not \in V_{i}.} [ 6 ] Furthermore, if for every index i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} the topology on Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} induced by U i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}_{i}} is Hausdorff then the topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by the initial uniform structure U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is Hausdorff if and only if the maps { f i : X → → Y i } {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\}} separate points on X {\displaystyle X} [ 6 ] (or equivalently, if and only if the evaluation map f : X → → ∏ ∏ i Y i {\textstyle f:X\to \prod _{i}Y_{i}} is injective) Uniform continuity : If U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is the initial uniform structure induced by the mappings { f i : X → → Y i } , {\displaystyle \left\{f_{i}:X\to Y_{i}\right\},} then a function g {\displaystyle g} from some uniform space Z {\displaystyle Z} into ( X , U ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {U}})} is uniformly continuous if and only if f i ∘ ∘ g : Z → → Y i {\displaystyle f_{i}\circ g:Z\to Y_{i}} is uniformly continuous for each i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} [ 6 ] Cauchy filter : A filter B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} on X {\displaystyle X} is a Cauchy filter on ( X , U ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {U}})} if and only if f i ( B ) {\displaystyle f_{i}\left({\mathcal {B}}\right)} is a Cauchy prefilter on Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} for every i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} [ 6 ] Transitivity of the initial uniform structure : If the word "topology" is replaced with "uniform structure" in the statement of " transitivity of the initial topology " given above, then the resulting statement will also be true.

Categorical description [ edit ] In the language of category theory , the initial topology construction can be described as follows. Let Y {\displaystyle Y} be the functor from a discrete category J {\displaystyle J} to the category of topological spaces T o p {\displaystyle \mathrm {Top} } which maps j ↦ ↦ Y j {\displaystyle j\mapsto Y_{j}} . Let U {\displaystyle U} be the usual forgetful functor from T o p {\displaystyle \mathrm {Top} } to S e t {\displaystyle \mathrm {Set} } . The maps f j : X → → Y j {\displaystyle f_{j}:X\to Y_{j}} can then be thought of as a cone from X {\displaystyle X} to U Y .

{\displaystyle UY.} That is, ( X , f ) {\displaystyle (X,f)} is an object of C o n e ( U Y ) := ( Δ Δ ↓ ↓ U Y ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cone} (UY):=(\Delta \downarrow {UY})} —the category of cones to U Y .

{\displaystyle UY.} More precisely, this cone ( X , f ) {\displaystyle (X,f)} defines a U {\displaystyle U} -structured cosink in S e t .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Set} .} The forgetful functor U : T o p → → S e t {\displaystyle U:\mathrm {Top} \to \mathrm {Set} } induces a functor U ¯ ¯ : C o n e ( Y ) → → C o n e ( U Y ) {\displaystyle {\bar {U}}:\mathrm {Cone} (Y)\to \mathrm {Cone} (UY)} . The characteristic property of the initial topology is equivalent to the statement that there exists a universal morphism from U ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {U}}} to ( X , f ) ; {\displaystyle (X,f);} that is, a terminal object in the category ( U ¯ ¯ ↓ ↓ ( X , f ) ) .

{\displaystyle \left({\bar {U}}\downarrow (X,f)\right).} Explicitly, this consists of an object I ( X , f ) {\displaystyle I(X,f)} in C o n e ( Y ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cone} (Y)} together with a morphism ε ε : U ¯ ¯ I ( X , f ) → → ( X , f ) {\displaystyle \varepsilon :{\bar {U}}I(X,f)\to (X,f)} such that for any object ( Z , g ) {\displaystyle (Z,g)} in C o n e ( Y ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cone} (Y)} and morphism φ φ : U ¯ ¯ ( Z , g ) → → ( X , f ) {\displaystyle \varphi :{\bar {U}}(Z,g)\to (X,f)} there exists a unique morphism ζ ζ : ( Z , g ) → → I ( X , f ) {\displaystyle \zeta :(Z,g)\to I(X,f)} such that the following diagram commutes: The assignment ( X , f ) ↦ ↦ I ( X , f ) {\displaystyle (X,f)\mapsto I(X,f)} placing the initial topology on X {\displaystyle X} extends to a functor I : C o n e ( U Y ) → → C o n e ( Y ) {\displaystyle I:\mathrm {Cone} (UY)\to \mathrm {Cone} (Y)} which is right adjoint to the forgetful functor U ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle {\bar {U}}.} In fact, I {\displaystyle I} is a right-inverse to U ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {U}}} ; since U ¯ ¯ I {\displaystyle {\bar {U}}I} is the identity functor on C o n e ( U Y ) .
