The J band is the transmission window (1.1 to 1.4 μm) centred on 1.25 micrometres. (The gap between the J band and lower bands is too small to be visible at this scale; as a result they blend together and appear to comprise a single, contigous band.) In infrared astronomy , the J band refers to an atmospheric transmission window (1.1 to 1.4 μm) centred on 1.25 micrometres (in the near-infrared ).

Betelgeuse is the brightest near-IR source in the sky with a J band magnitude of −2.99.

[ 1 ] The next brightest stars in the J band are Antares (−2.7), R Doradus (−2.6), Arcturus (−2.2), and Aldebaran (−2.1).

[ 2 ] In the J band Sirius is the 9th brightest star.

The J band is a frequent source of ground based observations since the wavelengths it covers pass through clouds and other atmospheric gasses .

[ 3 ] The waveband does however suffer from contamination by water vapor lines and hydroxide emission lines leading to relatively high photometric error.

[ 4 ] It can be used to scrutinize the photosphere of giant and supergiant stars while mostly avoiding opacities from molecular bands and also has access to the 1080 nm He I line which is useful in the study of circumstellar disk interactions around T-Tauri stars .

[ 5 ] J, H and K-band spectroscopy is also commonly used to observe and research brown dwarfs [ 6 ] and directly imaged exoplanets .
