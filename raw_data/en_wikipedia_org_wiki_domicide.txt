[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It includes the widespread destruction of a living environment, forcing the incumbent humans to move elsewhere.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] The concept of domicide originated in the 1970s, but only assumed its present meaning in 2022, after a report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Rajagopal has argued that international law should be amended to consider domicide to be a war crime .

[ 6 ] Examples [ edit ] Notable historical examples of domicide include: the American Bombing of Tokyo , which was the most destructive and deadly non-nuclear bombing in human history, [ 7 ] the bombing of Warsaw and Dresden and the destruction perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia .

[ 8 ] The Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most destructive campaigns in recent history.

[ 9 ] Balakrishnan Rajagopal, advisor to the United Nations on dams and Special Rapporteur on adequate housing accused Israel of committing domicide in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza war .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] John Porteus and Sandra Smith in their book Domicide: The Global Destruction of Home also highlight the Indian Removal Act as a definite case of domicide.
