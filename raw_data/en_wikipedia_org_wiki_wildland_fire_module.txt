A wildland fire module (WFM), formerly fire use module (FUM), is a 7–10 person team of firefighting personnel dedicated to planning, monitoring and starting fires. They may be deployed anywhere in the United States for resource benefits (fire use), prescribed fire and hazard fuel reduction projects.

[ 1 ] As interagency national resource personnel, wildland fire modules have expertise in the areas of fire monitoring, ignition, holding and suppression, prescribed fire preparation and implementation support, hazard fuels reduction, and fire effects monitoring.

Wildland fire modules are funded by different US government agencies including the National Park Service , U.S. Forest Service , and the Bureau of Land Management .

The Nature Conservancy is the sole non-government entity to sponsor and support a wildland fire module.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] In 1995, the National Park Service (NPS) founded several FUMs and hosted them in five different park units across the United States: Bandelier NM , Saguaro NP , Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity NRA , Zion NP , and Yellowstone NP . In 1999, the NPS created four more modules: Black Hills FUM, Cumberland Gap FUM, Great Smokes FUM, and Buffalo River FUM.

The modules were developed with the primary purpose of assisting the National Park units with fire use (wildland fire and prescribed fire). Secondarily, the modules were intended to be used in monitoring fire effects, and manually reducing hazard fuels on various park units. Modules were also anticipated to be used to assist other agencies in fire use and fuels treatment projects when all the park unit objectives were met.

[ 3 ] Other modules came into existence as the use and flexibility of fire use modules became more apparent. The most notable of these wildland fire modules includes ones stationed on the Stanislaus National Forest , Ashley National Forest , and The Nature Conservancy's Southern Rockies.

[ 4 ] Since 2005, the U.S. Forest Service has also implemented the use of wildland fire modules throughout the country. As of 2025, there are 69 wildland fire modules in the United States.

[ 5 ] These modules are highly qualified and extremely effective in a variety of fire ground operations ranging from basic suppression to extremely accurate fire behavior analysis and other tactical predictive services.

Configurations [ edit ] A typical module consists of the following positions: [ 6 ] (1) Module leader – GS-7/8/9 permanent full-time (1) Assistant module leader – GS-6/7 permanent full-time (2) Lead crewmember (squad leader) – GS-5/6 subject-to-furlough and permanent full-time (3–6) Crewmembers – GS 3/4/5 temporary, subject-to-furlough, and permanent full-time.

All WFM personnel strive to meet the following goals: 1.5-mile run in a time of 11 minutes or less 45 sit-ups in 60 seconds 25 pushups in 60 seconds 7 pull-ups See also [ edit ] Controlled burn Hotshot Crew Smokejumper Helitack Wildland fire engine Wildland fire tender Glossary of wildland fire terms Wildland fire suppression References [ edit ] ^ "Wildland Fire Modules" .
