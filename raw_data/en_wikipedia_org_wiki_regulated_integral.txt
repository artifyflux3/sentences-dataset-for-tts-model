The use of the regulated integral instead of the Riemann integral has been advocated by Nicolas Bourbaki and Jean Dieudonné .

Definition [ edit ] Definition on step functions [ edit ] Let [ a , b ] be a fixed closed , bounded interval in the real line R . A real-valued function φ : [ a , b ] → R is called a step function if there exists a finite partition Π Π = { a = t 0 < t 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < t k = b } {\displaystyle \Pi =\{a=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots <t_{k}=b\}} of [ a , b ] such that φ is constant on each open interval ( t i , t i +1 ) of Π; suppose that this constant value is c i ∈ R . Then, define the integral of a step function φ to be ∫ ∫ a b φ φ ( t ) d t := ∑ ∑ i = 0 k − − 1 c i | t i + 1 − − t i | .

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}\varphi (t)\,\mathrm {d} t:=\sum _{i=0}^{k-1}c_{i}|t_{i+1}-t_{i}|.} It can be shown that this definition is independent of the choice of partition, in that if Π 1 is another partition of [ a , b ] such that φ is constant on the open intervals of Π 1 , then the numerical value of the integral of φ is the same for Π 1 as for Π.

Extension to regulated functions [ edit ] A function f : [ a , b ] → R is called a regulated function if it is the uniform limit of a sequence of step functions on [ a , b ]: there is a sequence of step functions ( φ n ) n ∈ N such that || φ n − f || ∞ → 0 as n → ∞; or, equivalently, for all ε > 0, there exists a step function φ ε such that || φ ε − f || ∞ < ε ; or, equivalently, f lies in the closure of the space of step functions, where the closure is taken in the space of all bounded functions [ a , b ] → R and with respect to the supremum norm || ⋅ || ∞ ; or equivalently, for every t ∈ [ a , b ) , the right-sided limit f ( t + ) = lim s ↓ ↓ t f ( s ) {\displaystyle f(t+)=\lim _{s\downarrow t}f(s)} exists, and, for every t ∈ ( a , b ] , the left-sided limit f ( t − − ) = lim s ↑ ↑ t f ( s ) {\displaystyle f(t-)=\lim _{s\uparrow t}f(s)} exists as well.

Define the integral of a regulated function f to be ∫ ∫ a b f ( t ) d t := lim n → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ a b φ φ n ( t ) d t , {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t:=\lim _{n\to \infty }\int _{a}^{b}\varphi _{n}(t)\,\mathrm {d} t,} where ( φ n ) n ∈ N is any sequence of step functions that converges uniformly to f .

One must check that this limit exists and is independent of the chosen sequence, but this
is an immediate consequence of the continuous linear extension theorem of elementary
functional analysis: a bounded linear operator T 0 defined on a dense linear subspace E 0 of a normed linear space E and taking values in a Banach space F extends uniquely to a bounded linear operator T : E → F with the same (finite) operator norm .

Properties of the regulated integral [ edit ] The integral is a linear operator : for any regulated functions f and g and constants α and β , ∫ ∫ a b α α f ( t ) + β β g ( t ) d t = α α ∫ ∫ a b f ( t ) d t + β β ∫ ∫ a b g ( t ) d t .

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}\alpha f(t)+\beta g(t)\,\mathrm {d} t=\alpha \int _{a}^{b}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t+\beta \int _{a}^{b}g(t)\,\mathrm {d} t.} The integral is also a bounded operator : every regulated function f is bounded, and if m ≤ f ( t ) ≤ M for all t ∈ [ a , b ], then m | b − − a | ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ a b f ( t ) d t ≤ ≤ M | b − − a | .

{\displaystyle m|b-a|\leq \int _{a}^{b}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t\leq M|b-a|.} In particular: | ∫ ∫ a b f ( t ) d t | ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ a b | f ( t ) | d t .

{\displaystyle \left|\int _{a}^{b}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t\right|\leq \int _{a}^{b}|f(t)|\,\mathrm {d} t.} Since step functions are integrable and the integrability and the value of a Riemann integral are compatible with uniform limits, the regulated integral is a special case of the Riemann integral.

Extension to functions defined on the whole real line [ edit ] It is possible to extend the definitions of step function and regulated function and the associated integrals to functions defined on the whole real line . However, care must be taken with certain technical points: the partition on whose open intervals a step function is required to be constant is allowed to be a countable set, but must be a discrete set , i.e. have no limit points ; the requirement of uniform convergence must be loosened to the requirement of uniform convergence on compact sets , i.e.

closed and bounded intervals; not every bounded function is integrable (e.g. the function with constant value 1). This leads to a notion of local integrability .

Extension to vector-valued functions [ edit ] The above definitions go through mutatis mutandis in the case of functions taking values in a Banach space X .
