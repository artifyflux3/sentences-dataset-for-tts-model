848277860 Links Journal homepage Online access Bioinformatics is a biweekly peer-reviewed open-access scientific journal covering research and software in bioinformatics and computational biology . It is the official journal of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), together with PLOS Computational Biology .

The journal was established as Computer Applications in the Biosciences ( CABIOS ) in 1985. The founding editor-in-chief was Robert J. Beynon.

[ 1 ] In 1998, the journal obtained its current name and established an online version of the journal.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is published by Oxford University Press and, as of 2014, the editors-in-chief are Alfonso Valencia and Janet Kelso .

[ 4 ] Previous editors include Chris Sander , Gary Stormo , Christos Ouzounis, Martin Bishop, and Alex Bateman . In 2014, these five editors were appointed the first Honorary Editors of Bioinformatics .

[ 5 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2024 impact factor of 5.4.

From 1998 to 2004, Bioinformatics was the official journal of the ISCB. In 2004, as many ISCB members had institutional subscriptions to Bioinformatics , ISCB decided not to renew its contract with the journal.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] As of 2005, [update] PLOS Computational Biology became the official ISCB journal.

[ 6 ] In January 2009 Bioinformatics again became an official journal of the ISCB, alongside PLOS Computational Biology .

[ 8 ] The proceedings of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference and the European Conference on Computational Biology have been published in special issues of Bioinformatics since 2001 and 2002, respectively.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Following budget problems, Greek universities dropped their subscriptions to Bioinformatics in 2013.
