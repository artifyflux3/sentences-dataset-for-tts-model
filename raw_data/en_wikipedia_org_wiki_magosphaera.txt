Ovular phase of the Magosphere - 2. Segmentation of the egg inside the cyst. - 3. An adult magosphere whose surface is at the focus of the microscope. - 4. The same one, whose equatorial plane is placed at the microscope's focus to show the internal disposition of the cells. - 5, 6, 7: Cells of the Magosphere after their isolation, taking various amoeboid forms before encysting to become an egg.

Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Protozoa Clade : Catallacta Genus: Magosphaera Species: M. planula Binomial name Magosphaera planula Haeckel , 1869 Magosphaera planula was a spherical multiflagellated multicellular microorganism discovered by Ernst Haeckel in September 1869 while he was collecting sponges off Gisøy island off the coast of Norway . He claimed to have seen it break up into separate cells which then became amoeboid . Nobody else has found it, and he kept no specimens of it. It played an important part in theories of metazoan phylogeny into the early 20th century.
