In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **Cartesian coordinate system** (, ) in a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") is a [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") that specifies each [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") uniquely by a pair of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") called _coordinates_, which are the [signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_numbers "Positive and negative numbers") distances to the point from two fixed [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular")[oriented lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line "Oriented line"), called _[coordinate lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate\_line "Coordinate line")_, _coordinate axes_ or just _axes_ (plural of _axis_) of the system. The point where the axes meet is called the _[origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin\_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)")_ and has (0, 0) as coordinates. The axes [directions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") represent an [orthogonal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_basis "Orthogonal basis"). The combination of origin and basis forms a [coordinate frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_frame "Coordinate frame") called the **Cartesian frame**.

Similarly, the position of any point in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") can be specified by three _Cartesian coordinates_, which are the signed distances from the point to three mutually perpendicular planes. More generally, _n_ Cartesian coordinates specify the point in an _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") for any [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")_n_. These coordinates are the signed distances from the point to _n_ mutually perpendicular fixed [hyperplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane").

Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is (_x_ − _a_)2 + (_y_ − _b_)2 = _r_ 2 where _a_ and _b_ are the coordinates of the center (_a_, _b_) and _r_ is the radius.

Cartesian coordinates are named for [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), whose invention of them in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics by allowing the expression of problems of geometry in terms of [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")) can be described by [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") involving the coordinates of points of the shape. For example, a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") of radius 2, centered at the origin of the plane, may be described as the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of all points whose coordinates _x_ and _y_ satisfy the equation _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 = 4; the [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"), the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter") and the [tangent line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line "Tangent line") at any point can be computed from this equation by using [integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") and [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative"), in a way that can be applied to any curve.

Cartesian coordinates are the foundation of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis"), [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), multivariate [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") and more. A familiar example is the concept of the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function"). Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics"), [computer-aided geometric design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_geometric_design "Computer-aided geometric design") and other [geometry-related data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry").

The adjective _Cartesian_ refers to the French [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") and [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher")[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), who published this idea in 1637 while he was resident in the Netherlands. It was independently discovered by [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat"), who also worked in three dimensions, although Fermat did not publish the discovery.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-1) The French cleric [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#Mathematics "Nicole Oresme") used constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-2)

Both Descartes and Fermat used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-3) The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' _[La Géométrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La\_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie "La Géométrie")_ was translated into Latin in 1649 by [Frans van Schooten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten "Frans van Schooten") and his students. These commentators introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes's work.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-4)

The development of the Cartesian coordinate system would play a fundamental role in the development of the [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-5) The two-coordinate description of the plane was later generalized into the concept of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_spaces "Vector spaces").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-6)

Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes, such as the [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system "Polar coordinate system") for the plane, and the [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") and [cylindrical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system "Cylindrical coordinate system") for three-dimensional space.

An [affine line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_line "Affine line") with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system is called a _number line_. Every point on the line has a real-number coordinate, and every real number represents some point on the line.

There are two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_freedom "Degree of freedom") in the choice of Cartesian coordinate system for a line, which can be specified by choosing two distinct points along the line and assigning them to two distinct [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") (most commonly zero and one). Other points can then be uniquely assigned to numbers by [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation "Linear interpolation"). Equivalently, one point can be assigned to a specific real number, for instance an _origin_ point corresponding to zero, and an [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_orientation "Curve orientation") length along the line can be chosen as a unit, with the orientation indicating the correspondence between directions along the line and positive or negative numbers.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-7) Each point corresponds to its signed distance from the origin (a number with an absolute value equal to the distance and a + or − sign chosen based on direction).

A [geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") of the line can be represented by a [function of a real variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_a_real_variable "Function of a real variable"), for example [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") of the line corresponds to addition, and [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)") the line corresponds to multiplication. Any two Cartesian coordinate systems on the line can be related to each-other by a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function") (function of the form ![Image 3: {\displaystyle x\mapsto ax+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae7527719a79cc12409d36c3dfef7323548fbdd3)) taking a specific point's coordinate in one system to its coordinate in the other system. Choosing a coordinate system for each of two different lines establishes an [affine map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") from one line to the other taking each point on one line to the point on the other line with the same coordinate.

A Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (also called a **rectangular coordinate system** or an **orthogonal coordinate system**[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-:0-8)) is defined by an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") lines (axes), a single [unit of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_length "Unit of length") for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line "Number line"). For any point _P_, a line is drawn through _P_ perpendicular to each axis, and the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number. The two numbers, in that chosen order, are the _Cartesian coordinates_ of _P_. The reverse construction allows one to determine the point _P_ given its coordinates.

The first and second coordinates are called the _[abscissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscissa "Abscissa")_ and the _[ordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinate "Ordinate")_ of _P_, respectively; and the point where the axes meet is called the _origin_ of the coordinate system. The coordinates are usually written as two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in (3, −10.5). Thus the origin has coordinates (0, 0), and the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin, have coordinates (1, 0) and (0, 1).

In mathematics, physics, and engineering, the first axis is usually defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right, and the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards. (However, in some [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") contexts, the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards.) The origin is often labeled _O_, and the two coordinates are often denoted by the letters _X_ and _Y_, or _x_ and _y_. The axes may then be referred to as the _X_-axis and _Y_-axis. The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values.

A [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system is called a **Cartesian plane**. In a Cartesian plane, one can define canonical representatives of certain geometric figures, such as the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") (with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin), the [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square "Unit square") (whose diagonal has endpoints at (0, 0) and (1, 1)), the [unit hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_hyperbola "Unit hyperbola"), and so on.

The two axes divide the plane into four [right angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle"), called _quadrants_. The quadrants may be named or numbered in various ways, but the quadrant where all coordinates are positive is usually called the _first quadrant_.

If the coordinates of a point are (_x_, _y_), then its [distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line "Distance from a point to a line") from the _X_-axis and from the _Y_-axis are |_y_| and |_x_|, respectively; where |·| denotes the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value_(algebra) "Absolute value (algebra)") of a number.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Coord_system_CA_0.svg/250px-Coord_system_CA_0.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coord_system_CA_0.svg)

A three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, with origin _O_ and axis lines _X_, _Y_ and _Z_, oriented as shown by the arrows. The tick marks on the axes are one length unit apart. The black dot shows the point with coordinates _x_ = 2, _y_ = 3, and _z_ = 4, or (2, 3, 4).

A Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space consists of an ordered triplet of lines (the _axes_) that go through a common point (the _origin_), and are pair-wise perpendicular; an orientation for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes. As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line. For any point _P_ of space, one considers a plane through _P_ perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and interprets the point where that plane cuts the axis as a number. The Cartesian coordinates of _P_ are those three numbers, in the chosen order. The reverse construction determines the point _P_ given its three coordinates.

Alternatively, each coordinate of a point _P_ can be taken as the distance from _P_ to the plane defined by the other two axes, with the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis.

Each pair of axes defines a _coordinate plane_. These planes divide space into eight _[octants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octant\_(solid\_geometry) "Octant (solid geometry)")_. The octants are:

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(+x,+y,+z)&&(-x,+y,+z)&&(+x,-y,+z)&&(+x,+y,-z)\\(+x,-y,-z)&&(-x,+y,-z)&&(-x,-y,+z)&&(-x,-y,-z)\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b75c6ee0f0d78eb6a7dee3bc93587ebb5ee87fb)

The coordinates are usually written as three numbers (or algebraic formulas) surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas, as in (3, −2.5, 1) or (_t_, _u_ + _v_, _π_/2). Thus, the origin has coordinates (0, 0, 0), and the unit points on the three axes are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1).

Standard names for the coordinates in the three axes are _abscissa_, _ordinate_ and _applicate_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-9) The coordinates are often denoted by the letters _x_, _y_, and _z_. The axes may then be referred to as the _x_-axis, _y_-axis, and _z_-axis, respectively. Then the coordinate planes can be referred to as the _xy_-plane, _yz_-plane, and _xz_-plane.

In mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts, the first two axes are often defined or depicted as horizontal, with the third axis pointing up. In that case the third coordinate may be called _height_ or _altitude_. The orientation is usually chosen so that the 90-degree angle from the first axis to the second axis looks counter-clockwise when seen from the point (0, 0, 1); a convention that is commonly called _the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand\_rule "Right-hand rule")_.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cartesian_coordinate_surfaces.png/250px-Cartesian_coordinate_surfaces.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian_coordinate_surfaces.png)

 The [coordinate surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system#Coordinate_surface "Coordinate system") of the Cartesian coordinates (_x_, _y_, _z_). The _z_-axis is vertical and the _x_-axis is highlighted in green. Thus, the red plane shows the points with _x_ = 1, the blue plane shows the points with _z_ = 1, and the yellow plane shows the points with _y_ = −1. The three surfaces intersect at the point _P_ (shown as a black sphere) with the Cartesian coordinates (1, −1, 1).

Since Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous, the points of a Cartesian plane can be identified with pairs of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"); that is, with the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product")![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}=\mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd1ccce2a9e51985a297fe9cb76a94c9afa24e1d), where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is the set of all real numbers. In the same way, the points in any [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension _n_ be identified with the [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") (lists) of _n_ real numbers; that is, with the Cartesian product ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d).

The concept of Cartesian coordinates generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other, and/or different units along each axis. In that case, each coordinate is obtained by projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis (or, in general, to the [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") defined by all the other axes). In such an _[oblique coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique\_coordinate\_system "Oblique coordinate system")_ the computations of distances and angles must be modified from that in standard Cartesian systems, and many standard formulas (such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance) do not hold (see [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane "Affine plane")).

Notations and conventions
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Notations and conventions")]

The Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in [parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parentheses "Parentheses") and separated by commas, as in (10, 5) or (3, 5, 7). The origin is often labelled with the capital letter _O_. In analytic geometry, unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters (_x_, _y_) in the plane, and (_x_, _y_, _z_) in three-dimensional space. This custom comes from a convention of algebra, which uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values (such as the coordinates of points in many geometric problems), and letters near the beginning for given quantities.

These conventional names are often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering, although other letters may be used. For example, in a graph showing how a [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") varies with [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), the graph coordinates may be denoted _p_ and _t_. Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the _x-axis_, the _y-axis_, the _t-axis_, etc.

Another common convention for coordinate naming is to use subscripts, as (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, ..., _x_ _n_) for the _n_ coordinates in an _n_-dimensional space, especially when _n_ is greater than 3 or unspecified. Some authors prefer the numbering (_x_ 0, _x_ 1, ..., _x_ _n_−1). These notations are especially advantageous in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"): by storing the coordinates of a point as an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type"), instead of a [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) "Record (computer science)"), the [subscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript "Subscript") can serve to index the coordinates.

In mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the first coordinate (traditionally called the [abscissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscissa "Abscissa")) is measured along a [horizontal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane "Horizontal plane") axis, oriented from left to right. The second coordinate (the [ordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinate "Ordinate")) is then measured along a [vertical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction "Vertical direction") axis, usually oriented from bottom to top. Young children learning the Cartesian system, commonly learn the order to read the values before cementing the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axis concepts, by starting with 2D mnemonics (for example, 'Walk along the hall then up the stairs' akin to straight across the _x_-axis then up vertically along the _y_-axis).

Computer graphics and [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing "Image processing"), however, often use a coordinate system with the _y_-axis oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in [display buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer "Framebuffer").

For three-dimensional systems, a convention is to portray the _xy_-plane horizontally, with the _z_-axis added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the _x_-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left. If a diagram ([3D projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection "3D projection") or [2D perspective drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)")) shows the _x_- and _y_-axis horizontally and vertically, respectively, then the _z_-axis should be shown pointing "out of the page" towards the viewer or camera. In such a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system, the _z_-axis would appear as a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right, depending on the presumed viewer or camera [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)"). In any diagram or display, the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary. However, the orientation of the axes relative to each other should always comply with the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule"), unless specifically stated otherwise. All laws of physics and math assume this [right-handedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness), which ensures consistency.

For 3D diagrams, the names "abscissa" and "ordinate" are rarely used for _x_ and _y_, respectively. When they are, the _z_-coordinate is sometimes called the **applicate**. The words _abscissa_, _ordinate_ and _applicate_ are sometimes used to refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-:0-8)

### Quadrants and octants

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Quadrants and octants")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg/250px-Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg)

The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system

The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called _quadrants_,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-:0-8) each bounded by two half-axes. These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral "Roman numeral"): I (where the coordinates both have positive signs), II (where the abscissa is negative − and the ordinate is positive +), III (where both the abscissa and the ordinate are −), and IV (abscissa +, ordinate −). When the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom, the numbering goes [counter-clockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise "Clockwise") starting from the upper right ("north-east") quadrant.

Similarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines a division of space into eight regions or **octants**,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-:0-8) according to the signs of the coordinates of the points. The convention used for naming a specific octant is to list its signs; for example, (+ + +) or (− + −). The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions is the **[orthant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthant "Orthant")**, and a similar naming system applies.

### Euclidean transformations

The [Euclidean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane_isometry "Euclidean plane isometry") or **Euclidean motions** are the ([bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective")) mappings of points of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") to themselves which preserve distances between points. There are four types of these mappings (also called isometries): [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)"), [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") and [glide reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection "Glide reflection").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-11)

[Translating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers (_a_, _b_) to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set. That is, if the original coordinates of a point are (_x_, _y_), after the translation they will be

![Image 17: {\displaystyle (x',y')=(x+a,y+b).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d55e7205584f1956fbda574fd7ae9d7e71a80ae)

To [rotate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(geometry) "Rotation (geometry)") a figure [counterclockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise "Clockwise") around the origin by some angle ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (_x_,_y_) by the point with coordinates (_x'_,_y'_), where

![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \\y'&=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e8193cc301ba228063af7ecdf292c2b8c7e76d3)

Thus:

![Image 20: {\displaystyle (x',y')=((x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta \,),(x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta \,)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce9f7cd7ae4908e5a226f687c4dcfaa9c8995fb6)

If (_x_, _y_) are the Cartesian coordinates of a point, then (−_x_, _y_) are the coordinates of its [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_rotations_and_reflections "Coordinate rotations and reflections") across the second coordinate axis (the y-axis), as if that line were a mirror. Likewise, (_x_, −_y_) are the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis (the x-axis). In more generality, reflection across a line through the origin making an angle ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) with the x-axis, is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (_x_, _y_) by the point with coordinates (_x_′,_y_′), where

![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \\y'&=x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b50fb88510752090d6b3256d99672b01a5b77ee)

Thus: ![Image 23: {\displaystyle (x',y')=((x\cos 2\theta +y\sin 2\theta \,),(x\sin 2\theta -y\cos 2\theta \,)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fe2674eddd7ed77d14b8b496ce4d81692fcd3cb)

A glide reflection is the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line. It can be seen that the order of these operations does not matter (the translation can come first, followed by the reflection).

#### General matrix form of the transformations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: General matrix form of the transformations")]

All [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") of the plane can be described in a uniform way by using matrices. For this purpose, the coordinates ![Image 24: {\displaystyle (x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41cf50e4a314ca8e2c30964baa8d26e5be7a9386) of a point are commonly represented as the [column matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_matrix "Column matrix")![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3abb48a7f7870f760433546c11670df316e7656e) The result ![Image 26: {\displaystyle (x',y')}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8a15d455ed3a65797ebe92e0c6a42e7ce98f007) of applying an affine transformation to a point ![Image 27: {\displaystyle (x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41cf50e4a314ca8e2c30964baa8d26e5be7a9386) is given by the formula ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\end{pmatrix}}=A{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}}+b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/234b1eba3d12960348d3be9ea98868ccc3525035) where ![Image 29: {\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}\\A_{2,1}&A_{2,2}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6b846e076103f02659c165063157cee699648c9) is a 2×2 [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix "Square matrix") and ![Image 30: {\displaystyle b={\begin{pmatrix}b_{1}\\b_{2}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3073cf890eb6e8c4211c337ce7aaf839ce786cd7) is a column matrix.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-12) That is, ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=xA_{1,1}+yA_{1,1}+b_{1}\\y'&=xA_{2,1}+yA_{2,2}+b_{2}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a1878a255e842f1bfd8e4526acc19d4d551e7f7)

Among the affine transformations, the [Euclidean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_transformation "Euclidean transformation") are characterized by the fact that the matrix ![Image 32: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix"); that is, its columns are [orthogonal vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_vectors "Orthogonal vectors") of [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") one, or, explicitly, ![Image 33: {\displaystyle A_{1,1}A_{1,2}+A_{2,1}A_{2,2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1e71755433af57b5200ab0e3b3cde09c51b3be3) and ![Image 34: {\displaystyle A_{1,1}^{2}+A_{2,1}^{2}=A_{1,2}^{2}+A_{2,2}^{2}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dae118e2762ce9b91929932b7dcc19d19ae34098)

This is equivalent to saying that _A_ times its [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose "Transpose") is the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix"). If these conditions do not hold, the formula describes a more general [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation").

The transformation is a translation [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if")_A_ is the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix"). The transformation is a rotation around some point if and only if _A_ is a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix"), meaning that it is orthogonal and ![Image 35: {\displaystyle A_{1,1}A_{2,2}-A_{2,1}A_{1,2}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9b240b759b71f8ed4fe21d934d4f3326a374d1c)

A reflection or glide reflection is obtained when, ![Image 36: {\displaystyle A_{1,1}A_{2,2}-A_{2,1}A_{1,2}=-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/627678f49648e2b518f28763b45f37e77003f01b)

Assuming that translations are not used (that is, ![Image 37: {\displaystyle b_{1}=b_{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c723fb6d6a3638ef8ab8e83a53d560f1696b97a)) transformations can be [composed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices. In the general case, it is useful to use the [augmented matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_matrix "Augmented matrix") of the transformation; that is, to rewrite the transformation formula ![Image 38: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\1\end{pmatrix}}=A'{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5538a625293fa065aa9b23a55796bd156fa30662) where ![Image 39: {\displaystyle A'={\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{1,2}&b_{1}\\A_{2,1}&A_{2,2}&b_{2}\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3b2f2b320591de641d8f6047d60da8405e8f5f1) With this trick, the composition of affine transformations is obtained by multiplying the augmented matrices.

### Affine transformation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Affine transformation")]

[![Image 40](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/2D_affine_transformation_matrix.svg/250px-2D_affine_transformation_matrix.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2D_affine_transformation_matrix.svg)

Effect of applying various 2D affine transformation matrices on a unit square (reflections are special cases of scaling)

[Affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") are transformations that map lines to lines, but may change distances and angles. As said in the preceding section, they can be represented with augmented matrices: ![Image 41: {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}A_{1,1}&A_{2,1}&b_{1}\\A_{1,2}&A_{2,2}&b_{2}\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\1\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41c3e0951139f1cc03919447df9dee7e20d6f5b6)

The Euclidean transformations are the affine transformations such that the 2×2 matrix of the ![Image 42: {\displaystyle A_{i,j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f379f42961dd620c7a05dc1c538117ec105877d) is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix "Orthogonal matrix").

The augmented matrix that represents the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") of two affine transformations is obtained by multiplying their augmented matrices.

Some affine transformations that are not Euclidean transformations have received specific names.

An example of an affine transformation which is not Euclidean is given by scaling. To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number _m_. If (_x_, _y_) are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates

![Image 43: {\displaystyle (x',y')=(mx,my).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c7aa538d48f3d97fca0dc6e6d4ad0c87230fa096)

If _m_ is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if _m_ is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.

A [shearing transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping "Shear mapping") will push the top of a square sideways to form a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"). Horizontal shearing is defined by:

![Image 44: {\displaystyle (x',y')=(x+ys,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9871cabfbe5f97c991406190280a5ebdea9967f5)

Shearing can also be applied vertically:

![Image 45: {\displaystyle (x',y')=(x,xs+y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a738a9e3d84c6850e505debbfbe964b9b8c64e1)

Orientation and handedness
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Orientation and handedness")]

[![Image 46](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Rechte-hand-regel.jpg/250px-Rechte-hand-regel.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg)

The [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule")

Fixing or choosing the _x_-axis determines the _y_-axis up to direction. Namely, the _y_-axis is necessarily the [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to the _x_-axis through the point marked 0 on the _x_-axis. But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative. Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called _handedness_) of the Cartesian plane.

The usual way of orienting the plane, with the positive _x_-axis pointing right and the positive _y_-axis pointing up (and the _x_-axis being the "first" and the _y_-axis the "second" axis), is considered the _positive_ or _standard_ orientation, also called the _right-handed_ orientation.

A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the _[right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand\_rule "Right-hand rule")_. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the _x_-axis to the _y_-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.

The other way of orienting the plane is following the _left-hand rule_, placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.

When pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis towards positive, the curvature of the fingers indicates a positive rotation along that axis.

Regardless of the rule used to orient the plane, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation. Switching any one axis will reverse the orientation, but switching both will leave the orientation unchanged.

### In three dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: In three dimensions")]

[![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg/250px-Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg)

Fig. 7 – The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.

[![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Right_hand_cartesian.svg/250px-Right_hand_cartesian.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Right_hand_cartesian.svg)

Fig. 8 – The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes

Once the _x_- and _y_-axes are specified, they determine the [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") along which the _z_-axis should lie, but there are two possible orientations for this line. The two possible coordinate systems, which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-13) The standard orientation, where the _xy_-plane is horizontal and the _z_-axis points up (and the _x_- and the _y_-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the _xy_-plane if observed from _above_ the _xy_-plane) is called **right-handed** or **positive**.

[![Image 49](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/3D_Cartesian_Coodinate_Handedness.jpg/250px-3D_Cartesian_Coodinate_Handedness.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Cartesian_Coodinate_Handedness.jpg)

3D Cartesian coordinate handedness

The name derives from the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule"). If the [index finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger "Index finger") of the right hand is pointed forward, the [middle finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_finger "Middle finger") bent inward at a right angle to it, and the [thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb "Thumb") placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative orientation of the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axes in a _right-handed_ system. The thumb indicates the _x_-axis, the index finger the _y_-axis and the middle finger the _z_-axis. Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.

Figure 7 depicts a left and a right-handed coordinate system. Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point _towards_ the observer, whereas the "middle"-axis is meant to point _away_ from the observer. The red circle is _parallel_ to the horizontal _xy_-plane and indicates rotation from the _x_-axis to the _y_-axis (in both cases). Hence the red arrow passes _in front of_ the _z_-axis.

Figure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as "flipping in and out" between a [convex](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convex "wikt:convex") cube and a [concave](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concave "wikt:concave") "corner". This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the space. Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system. Thus the "correct" way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the _x_-axis as pointing _towards_ the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.

Representing a vector in the standard basis
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_coordinate_system&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Representing a vector in the standard basis")]

A point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system may also be represented by a position [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-14) If the coordinates represent spatial positions (displacements), it is common to represent the vector from the origin to the point of interest as ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1). In two dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) can be written as:

![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b314439fb208f26860eacddbb878e7c83c6a1d78)

where ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c981894d231e081378f98f474b5b368068ace133) and ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/753de7491cee3b69ed6401d1f9c56cd0a9f09212) are [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vectors "Unit vectors") in the direction of the _x_-axis and _y_-axis respectively, generally referred to as the _[standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\_basis "Standard basis")_ (in some application areas these may also be referred to as [versors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor "Versor")). Similarly, in three dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates ![Image 54: {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22a8c93372e8f8b6e24d523bd5545aed3430baf4) can be written as:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#cite_note-15)![Image 55: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} +z\mathbf {k} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/557378b34f29a80fdb8ccf95997c9106ca0fb27e)

where ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} ={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8cd3d23c199969d4acf470cf1584de38c135b459)![Image 57: {\displaystyle \mathbf {j} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/12f338adc9bbe187c14992944691d461f6502e5f) and ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} ={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab0d046ac2dae27878e4aff6cc08f5dab5bedbe5)

There is no _natural_ interpretation of multiplying vectors to obtain another vector that works in all dimensions, however there is a way to use [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") to provide such a multiplication. In a two-dimensional cartesian plane, identify the point with coordinates (_x_, _y_) with the complex number _z_ = _x_ + _iy_. Here, _i_ is the [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit "Imaginary unit") and is identified with the point with coordinates (0, 1), so it is _not_ the unit vector in the direction of the _x_-axis. Since the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number, this identification provides a means to "multiply" vectors. In a three-dimensional cartesian space a similar identification can be made with a subset of the [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion").
