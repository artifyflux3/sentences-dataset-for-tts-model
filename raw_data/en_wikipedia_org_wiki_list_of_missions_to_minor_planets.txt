Most missions to minor planets have been to asteroids or dwarf planets.

An artist's impression of New Horizons ' close encounter with the Plutonian system Spacecraft visits to minor planets have mostly been flybys, and have ranged from dedicated missions to incidental flybys and targets of opportunity for spacecraft that have already completed their missions. The first spacecraft to visit an asteroid was Pioneer 10 , which flew past an unnamed asteroid on 2 August 1972; a distant incidental encounter while the probe was en route to Jupiter . The first dedicated mission was NEAR Shoemaker , which was launched in February 1996, and entered orbit around 433 Eros in February 2000, having first flown past 253 Mathilde .

NEAR was also the first spacecraft to land on an asteroid, surviving what was intended to be an impact with Eros at 20:01 on 12 February 2001 at the planned end of its mission. As a result of its unexpected survival, the spacecraft's mission was extended until 1 March to allow data to be collected from the surface.

Missions [ edit ] There have been thirty-three overall missions towards minor planets, with four of them being flyby missions that were not intended to explore minor planets, marked in grey background.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Many minor planets are in two domains: Asteroid belt , between 2–3 AU (0.30–0.45 billion km) Kuiper belt , between 30–60 AU (4.5–9.0 billion km) Mission Spacecraft Launch date Carrier rocket Operator Destination Mission type Outcome – Pioneer 10 Pioneer 10 2 March 1972 Atlas SLV-3C Centaur-D Star-37E NASA Unnamed asteroid [ 3 ] Flyby — 307 Nike — Distant incidental flybys en route to Jupiter; closest approaches occurred on 2 August 1972 and 2 December 1972, respectively, with a distance of 8.8 million km (5.5 million mi).

– Galileo project Galileo 18 October 1989 Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-34 / IUS NASA 951 Gaspra Flyby Successful 243 Ida Successful Incidental flybys en route to Jupiter; flyby of 951 Gaspra occurred on 29 October 1991 with closest approach of 1,604 kilometres (997 mi) at 22:37 UTC; flyby of 243 Ida occurred on 28 August 1993 with closest approach of 2,410 kilometres (1,500 mi) at 16:51:59 UTC; [ 4 ] discovered Dactyl 1 DSPSE Clementine 25 January 1994 Titan II(23)G NASA 1620 Geographos Flyby Spacecraft failure Attitude control failure; failed to leave geocentric orbit after first phase of mission exploring the Moon . Flyby had been planned for August 1994 [ 5 ] 2 Discovery 1 NEAR Shoemaker 17 February 1996 Delta II 7925 NASA 253 Mathilde Flyby Successful 433 Eros Orbiter Mostly successful Closest approach to Mathilde was 1,212 kilometres (753 mi) at 12:56 UTC on 27 June 1997. Three days before arrival at Eros the orbiter aborted a burn resulting in failure to enter orbit, instead flew past at 3,827 kilometres (2,378 mi) at 18:41:23 on 23 December 1998. Insertion reattempted successfully on 14 February 2000. Impacted asteroid at 20:01 on 12 February 2001 at end of mission, but survived impact and continued to operate on surface until 1 March.

[ 10 ] Braille flyby added to mission following loss of ability to reach Wilson–Harrington. Closest approach 28.3 kilometres (17.6 mi) at 04:46 UTC [ 10 ] on 29 July 1999. Intended to pass within 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) but this was not achieved due to a computer failure; poor-quality images returned as a result.
