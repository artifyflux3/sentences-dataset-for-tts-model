H. Dodwell The Cambridge Shorter History of India is a 1934 book on Indian history edited by H. H. Dodwell and published by the Cambridge University Press .

Description [ edit ] This work is based on published volumes of The Cambridge History of India but claims to be "far from a mere resumé of the larger work".

[ 1 ] The book is divided into three sections: Ancient India (by John Allan ), Moslem India (by T. Wolseley Haig ), and British India (by Dodwell).

[ 2 ] The book has been criticised for devoting almost half its volume to sixty years of British rule (until the Government of India Act 1919 ); [ 2 ] although the first half of the book was also considered too technical and "almost unreadable." [ 3 ] The 1958 reprint by S. Chand & Co.

contains additional chapters by R. R. Sethi on "The Last Phase (1919–1947)".
