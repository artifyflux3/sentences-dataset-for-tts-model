Award Fulbright Program Awarded for Grants for U.S. professors ("scholars"), graduating college seniors and graduate students ("students"), young professionals ("specialists"), and artists to research, study, or teach English abroad Sponsored by Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State Established August 1946 (79 years ago) ( 1946-08 ) Website fulbrightprogram .org The Fulbright Program , including the Fulbright–Hays Program , is one of several United States cultural exchange programs with the goal of improving intercultural relations , cultural diplomacy , and intercultural competence between the people of the United States and other countries through the mutual exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills. The program was founded by United States Senator J. William Fulbright in 1946, and has been considered as one of the most prestigious scholarships in the United States.

[ 1 ] Via the program, competitively selected American citizens including students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists, and artists may receive scholarships or grants to study, conduct research, teach, or exercise their talents abroad; and citizens of other countries may qualify to do the same in the United States. The program provides approximately 8,000 grants annually, comprising roughly 1,600 grants to U.S. students, 1,200 to U.S. scholars, 4,000 to foreign students, 900 to foreign visiting scholars, and several hundred to teachers and professionals.

[ 2 ] The Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations such as the Institute of International Education and operates in over 160 countries around the world.

[ 3 ] The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the Fulbright Program and receives funding from the United States Congress via annual appropriation bills . Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S.

[ 4 ] In 49 countries, a bi-national Fulbright Commission administers and oversees the Fulbright Program. In countries that have an active program but no Fulbright Commission, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. embassy oversees the Fulbright Program. More than 370,000 people have participated in the program since it began; 62 Fulbright alumni have been awarded for a Nobel Prize ; 88 have won Pulitzer Prizes .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] J. William Fulbright , U.S. Senator (D-AR), the program's founder Founding [ edit ] The Fulbright Program's mission is to bring a little more knowledge, a little more reason, and a little more compassion into world affairs and thereby increase the chance that nations will learn at last to live in peace and friendship.

[ 7 ] — Senator J. William Fulbright In 1945, Senator J. William Fulbright proposed a bill to use the proceeds from selling surplus U.S. government war property to fund international exchange between the U.S. and other countries. With the crucial timing of the aftermath of the Second World War and with the pressing establishment of the United Nations, the Fulbright Program was an attempt to promote peace and understanding through educational exchange. The bill devised a plan to forgo the debts foreign countries amassed during the war in return for funding an international educational program.

[ 8 ] It was through the belief that this program would be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions and future leaders wherever they may be.

[ 9 ] In August 1946, Congress created the Fulbright Program in what became the largest education exchange program in history. The program was expanded by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 , introduced by Representative Wayne Hays and known as Fulbright–Hays Act. It made possible participation in international fairs and expositions, including trade and industrial fairs; translations; funding for American studies programs; funds to promote medical, scientific, cultural, and educational research and development; and modern foreign language training.

[ 10 ] The program operates on a bi-national basis; each country has entered into an agreement with the U.S. government. The first countries to sign agreements were China in 1947 and Burma , the Philippines, and Greece in 1948.

[ 9 ] Originally, the program was administered by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars , but in 1996 these responsibilities were transferred to the Institute of International Education .

[ 11 ] 21st century [ edit ] In March 2024, the Russian government declared the Institute of International Education (IIE) and Cultural Vistas as "undesirable" in Russia.

[ 12 ] This decision effectively ended the Fulbright Program, which had been established in the USSR during the 1973–74 academic year.

[ 13 ] In February 2025, the Trump administration initiated a funding freeze on State Department programs, including the Fulbright Program, disrupting financial support for thousands of scholars.

[ 14 ] The suspension impacted over 19,000 participants.

[ 15 ] 2025 board resignations and political interference [ edit ] On June 11, 2025, eleven of the twelve members of the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned in protest, citing what they described as "unlawful" political interference by the Trump administration.

[ 16 ] The board, which provides oversight for the international Fulbright exchange program, alleged that political appointees at the U.S. Department of State blocked or delayed awards for the 2025–26 academic year and subjected more than 1,200 foreign finalists to unauthorized ideological screening. The board’s open letter stated that review criteria were improperly influenced by applicants’ positions on topics such as climate change, race, and gender.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The resignations prompted concern from higher education leaders and U.S. lawmakers. Senator Jeanne Shaheen stated that the alleged interference “politicizes one of our most respected international education programs” and could harm the U.S.'s global academic credibility.

[ 24 ] — Senator J. William Fulbright The Fulbright Program exchanges scholars and students with numerous countries in bilateral partnerships managed by commissions for each country. It provides funding for U.S. persons to visit other countries in the U.S. Student Program, U.S. Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, and others, and enables foreign nationals to visit the United States in programs such as the Foreign Student Program, Visiting Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program.

Candidates recommended for Fulbright grants have high academic achievement, a compelling project proposal or statement of purpose, demonstrated leadership potential, and flexibility and adaptability to interact successfully with the host community.

Fulbright grants are awarded in almost all academic disciplines, except clinical medical research involving patient contact. Fulbright grantees' fields of study span the fine arts, humanities, social sciences, mathematics, natural and physical sciences, and professional and applied sciences.

[ 25 ] Student grants [ edit ] The Fulbright Degree Program funds graduate education for international students wanting to study in the United States. Students apply for the scholarship in their home country and after a long process, they can pursue a Masters or Ph.D. program in the United States.

[ 26 ] The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers fellowships for U.S. graduating college seniors, graduate students, young professionals, and artists to research, study, or teach English abroad for one academic year. The program facilitates cultural exchange through direct interaction on an individual basis in the classroom, field, home, and in routine tasks, allowing the grantee to gain an appreciation of others' viewpoints and beliefs, the way they do things, and the way they think. The application period opens in the spring of each year.
