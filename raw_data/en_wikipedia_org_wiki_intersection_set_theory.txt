Intersection The intersection of two sets A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} represented by circles.

A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} is in red.

Type Set operation Field Set theory Statement The intersection of A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} is the set A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} of elements that lie in both set A {\displaystyle A} and set B {\displaystyle B} .

Symbolic statement A ∩ ∩ B = { x : x ∈ ∈ A and x ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle A\cap B=\{x:x\in A{\text{ and }}x\in B\}} In set theory , the intersection of two sets A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} denoted by A ∩ ∩ B , {\displaystyle A\cap B,} [ 1 ] is the set containing all elements of A {\displaystyle A} that also belong to B {\displaystyle B} or equivalently, all elements of B {\displaystyle B} that also belong to A .

{\displaystyle A.} [ 2 ] Notation and terminology [ edit ] Intersection is written using the symbol " ∩ ∩ {\displaystyle \cap } " between the terms; that is, in infix notation . For example: { 1 , 2 , 3 } ∩ ∩ { 2 , 3 , 4 } = { 2 , 3 } {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}\cap \{2,3,4\}=\{2,3\}} { 1 , 2 , 3 } ∩ ∩ { 4 , 5 , 6 } = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}\cap \{4,5,6\}=\varnothing } Z ∩ ∩ N = N {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \cap \mathbb {N} =\mathbb {N} } { x ∈ ∈ R : x 2 = 1 } ∩ ∩ N = { 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {R} :x^{2}=1\}\cap \mathbb {N} =\{1\}} The intersection of more than two sets (generalized intersection) can be written as: ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 n A i {\displaystyle \bigcap _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}} which is similar to capital-sigma notation .

For an explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the table of mathematical symbols .

Definition [ edit ] Intersection of three sets: A ∩ ∩ B ∩ ∩ C {\displaystyle ~A\cap B\cap C} Intersections of the unaccented modern Greek , Latin , and Cyrillic scripts, considering only the shapes of the letters and ignoring their pronunciation Example of an intersection with sets The intersection of two sets A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} denoted by A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} , [ 3 ] is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A {\displaystyle A} and B .

{\displaystyle B.} In symbols: A ∩ ∩ B = { x : x ∈ ∈ A and x ∈ ∈ B } .

{\displaystyle A\cap B=\{x:x\in A{\text{ and }}x\in B\}.} That is, x {\displaystyle x} is an element of the intersection A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} if and only if x {\displaystyle x} is both an element of A {\displaystyle A} and an element of B .

{\displaystyle B.} [ 3 ] For example: The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.

The number 9 is not in the intersection of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of odd numbers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}, because 9 is not prime.

Intersecting and disjoint sets [ edit ] We say that A {\displaystyle A} intersects (meets) B {\displaystyle B} if there exists some x {\displaystyle x} that is an element of both A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} in which case we also say that A {\displaystyle A} intersects (meets) B {\displaystyle B} at x {\displaystyle x} . Equivalently, A {\displaystyle A} intersects B {\displaystyle B} if their intersection A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap B} is an inhabited set , meaning that there exists some x {\displaystyle x} such that x ∈ ∈ A ∩ ∩ B .

{\displaystyle x\in A\cap B.} We say that A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are disjoint if A {\displaystyle A} does not intersect B .

{\displaystyle B.} In plain language, they have no elements in common.

A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are disjoint if their intersection is empty , denoted A ∩ ∩ B = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle A\cap B=\varnothing .} For example, the sets { 1 , 2 } {\displaystyle \{1,2\}} and { 3 , 4 } {\displaystyle \{3,4\}} are disjoint, while the set of even numbers intersects the set of multiples of 3 at the multiples of 6.

Algebraic properties [ edit ] See also: List of set identities and relations and Algebra of sets Binary intersection is an associative operation; that is, for any sets A , B , {\displaystyle A,B,} and C , {\displaystyle C,} one has A ∩ ∩ ( B ∩ ∩ C ) = ( A ∩ ∩ B ) ∩ ∩ C .

{\displaystyle A\cap (B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C.} Thus the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity: either of the above can be written as A ∩ ∩ B ∩ ∩ C {\displaystyle A\cap B\cap C} . Intersection is also commutative . That is, for any A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} one has A ∩ ∩ B = B ∩ ∩ A .

{\displaystyle A\cap B=B\cap A.} The intersection of any set with the empty set results in the empty set; that is, that for any set A {\displaystyle A} , A ∩ ∩ ∅ ∅ = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A\cap \varnothing =\varnothing } Also, the intersection operation is idempotent ; that is, any set A {\displaystyle A} satisfies that A ∩ ∩ A = A {\displaystyle A\cap A=A} . All these properties follow from analogous facts about logical conjunction .

Intersection distributes over union and union distributes over intersection. That is, for any sets A , B , {\displaystyle A,B,} and C , {\displaystyle C,} one has A ∩ ∩ ( B ∪ ∪ C ) = ( A ∩ ∩ B ) ∪ ∪ ( A ∩ ∩ C ) A ∪ ∪ ( B ∩ ∩ C ) = ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ∩ ∩ ( A ∪ ∪ C ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)\\A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)\end{aligned}}} Inside a universe U , {\displaystyle U,} one may define the complement A c {\displaystyle A^{c}} of A {\displaystyle A} to be the set of all elements of U {\displaystyle U} not in A .

{\displaystyle A.} Furthermore, the intersection of A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} may be written as the complement of the union of their complements, derived easily from De Morgan's laws : A ∩ ∩ B = ( A c ∪ ∪ B c ) c {\displaystyle A\cap B=\left(A^{c}\cup B^{c}\right)^{c}} Arbitrary intersections [ edit ] Further information: Iterated binary operation The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary nonempty collection of sets.
If M {\displaystyle M} is a nonempty set whose elements are themselves sets, then x {\displaystyle x} is an element of the intersection of M {\displaystyle M} if and only if for every element A {\displaystyle A} of M , {\displaystyle M,} x {\displaystyle x} is an element of A .

{\displaystyle A.} In symbols: ( x ∈ ∈ ⋂ ⋂ A ∈ ∈ M A ) ⇔ ⇔ ( ∀ ∀ A ∈ ∈ M , x ∈ ∈ A ) .

{\displaystyle \left(x\in \bigcap _{A\in M}A\right)\Leftrightarrow \left(\forall A\in M,\ x\in A\right).} The notation for this last concept can vary considerably.

Set theorists will sometimes write " ⋂ ⋂ M {\displaystyle \bigcap M} ", while others will instead write " ⋂ ⋂ A ∈ ∈ M A {\displaystyle {\bigcap }_{A\in M}A} ".
The latter notation can be generalized to " ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I A i {\displaystyle {\bigcap }_{i\in I}A_{i}} ", which refers to the intersection of the collection { A i : i ∈ ∈ I } .

{\displaystyle \left\{A_{i}:i\in I\right\}.} Here I {\displaystyle I} is a nonempty set, and A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} is a set for every i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} In the case that the index set I {\displaystyle I} is the set of natural numbers , notation analogous to that of an infinite product may be seen: ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i .

{\displaystyle \bigcap _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}.} When formatting is difficult, this can also be written " A 1 ∩ ∩ A 2 ∩ ∩ A 3 ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3}\cap \cdots } ".  This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example, see the article on σ-algebras .

Nullary intersection [ edit ] Conjunctions of the arguments in parentheses The conjunction of no argument is the tautology (compare: empty product ); accordingly the intersection of no set is the universe .

In the previous section, we excluded the case where M {\displaystyle M} was the empty set ( ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } ). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection M {\displaystyle M} is defined as the set (see set-builder notation ) ⋂ ⋂ A ∈ ∈ M A = { x : for all A ∈ ∈ M , x ∈ ∈ A } .

{\displaystyle \bigcap _{A\in M}A=\{x:{\text{ for all }}A\in M,x\in A\}.} If M {\displaystyle M} is empty, there are no sets A {\displaystyle A} in M , {\displaystyle M,} so the question becomes "which x {\displaystyle x} 's satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be every possible x {\displaystyle x} . When M {\displaystyle M} is empty, the condition given above is an example of a vacuous truth . So the intersection of the empty family should be the universal set (the identity element for the operation of intersection), [ 4 ] but in standard ( ZF ) set theory, the universal set does not exist.

However, when restricted to the context of subsets of a given fixed set X {\displaystyle X} , the notion of the intersection of an empty collection of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} is well-defined.  In that case, if M {\displaystyle M} is empty, its intersection is ⋂ ⋂ M = ⋂ ⋂ ∅ ∅ = { x ∈ ∈ X : x ∈ ∈ A for all A ∈ ∈ ∅ ∅ } {\displaystyle \bigcap M=\bigcap \varnothing =\{x\in X:x\in A{\text{ for all }}A\in \varnothing \}} .  Since all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} vacuously satisfy the required condition, the intersection of the empty collection of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} is all of X .

{\displaystyle X.} In formulas, ⋂ ⋂ ∅ ∅ = X .

{\displaystyle \bigcap \varnothing =X.} This matches the intuition that as collections of subsets become smaller, their respective intersections become larger; in the extreme case, the empty collection has an intersection equal to the whole underlying set.

Also, in type theory x {\displaystyle x} is of a prescribed type τ τ , {\displaystyle \tau ,} so the intersection is understood to be of type s e t τ τ {\displaystyle \mathrm {set} \ \tau } (the type of sets whose elements are in τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } ), and we can define ⋂ ⋂ A ∈ ∈ ∅ ∅ A {\displaystyle \bigcap _{A\in \emptyset }A} to be the universal set of s e t τ τ {\displaystyle \mathrm {set} \ \tau } (the set whose elements are exactly all terms of type τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } ).
