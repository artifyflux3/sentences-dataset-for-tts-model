Rugby team Boston Full name Boston Rugby Football Club Union USA Rugby Founded 1960 ; 65 years ago ( 1960 ) Ground(s) Union Point Sports Complex , Weymouth, Massachusetts President Joseph Dolan Coach(es) Brennan Moore, Ben Glauser League(s) NERFU Team kit Official website www .brfc .org Boston Rugby Football Club (also known as BRFC ) is a rugby union team based in Weymouth, Massachusetts , US. The club competes in, and is governed by, the New England Rugby Football Union (their LAU), the Northeast Rugby Union (their TAU), and USA Rugby .

The club was established in 1960, but they would not be recognized as a nationally competitive club until they were accepted into Super League , the premier division of club rugby in the United States. The club has also contributed numerous international players to the United States national side .

History [ edit ] 1970-1998 [ edit ] BRFC was formed in 1960 but was not considered a nationally competitive club until 1996 when Beacon Hill Rugby Football Club, a spawn of BRFC that separated from the parent club in 1968, rejoined BRFC to ensure depth and competitiveness.

[ 1 ] Prior to the merge, the club had been one of the top regional clubs in New England .  From 1970 through 1998, the club won twenty-two New England Rugby Football Union championships, but it was never able to attain consistent success at the national level.  During that same time period, it reached the national competition four times and earned fourth-place finishes in both 1983 and 1985.

[ 1 ] During the 1970s and 1980s, Boston RFC was the home club for many forwards , particularly locks , who played for the USA Eagles in international tests.

1998-present: The Super League Years [ edit ] The Super League was formed in 1996 by USA Rugby to create a national competition amongst the premier clubs in the United States.  During its first expansion in 1998, Boston RFC was one of two teams invited to join the competition (the other being Philadelphia Whitemarsh RFC ).

[ 2 ] Since joining the competition, Boston has been one of the weakest clubs in Super League play.  The club has amassed a 21-45-2 record through the 2007 season.  From 2004 through 2006, Boston recorded a 2-18-0 record, and was outscored by 598 points (an average of thirty points per game).  Other clubs that compete in the Premier Division have fared much better than Boston against Super League clubs during that period.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Beginning in the Fall of 2007 the club began and continues to experience a major resurgence.  The Fall of 2007 saw the club win the NERFU league title with a 7–0 record for both the 1st and 2nd sides.  This momentum carried into the 2008 RSL season where Boston finished atop the Blue Conference with a record of 5-0-2 and advanced to the quarter-finals of the league.  From the Fall of 2007 to the Fall of 2008, Boston was undefeated in 18 straight regular season games.  Despite initially struggling in the Super League competition, BRFC has remained one of the better clubs in regional competitions and tournaments since entering the Super League.  They have won six New England Rugby Football Union Division I Championships since becoming a member of the Super League.  The club fields three sides, which compete at various regional and national levels.  The third XV has been met with some success at the national level, having won the USA Rugby National Third Division Competition in 2000.

International Tours [ edit ] Since 1977, BRFC has embarked on several international tours, the most recent being to the Cayman Islands in 2000.  They have also toured Great Britain (twice), Ireland (three times), Wales , France (three times), New Zealand, and Australia.

[ 6 ] Honors [ edit ] Boston RFC has been recognized with many regional honors.  In the club's forty-nine year history, Boston has won twenty-six NERFU championships.  They have also attained moderate national success, reaching the USA Rugby Premier Division Competition five times, most recently in 2008.
