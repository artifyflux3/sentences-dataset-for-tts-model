[ 1 ] It is distinct from the concept of transferring a consciousness from one human body to another.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is sometimes applied to a single person and other times to an entire society.

[ 4 ] Recurring themes in these stories include whether the computerized mind is truly conscious , and if so, whether identity is preserved.

[ 5 ] It is a common feature of the cyberpunk subgenre, [ 6 ] sometimes taking the form of digital immortality .

Cyberpunk writers and their successors have also frequently imagined the uploading of human minds into computers, thus creating a special sort of artificial intelligence that can free individuals of the limitations of biological bodies, a notion that would be notably extended in the work of Greg Egan.
