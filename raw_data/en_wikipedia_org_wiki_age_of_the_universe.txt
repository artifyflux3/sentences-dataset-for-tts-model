This article is about scientific estimates of the age of the universe. For religious and other non-scientific estimates, see [Dating creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_creation "Dating creation").

In [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") models of [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"), the **age of the universe** is the [cosmological time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_time "Cosmological time") back to the point when the [scale factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor "Scale factor") of the universe extrapolates to zero.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-KolbTurner-1) Modern models calculate the age now as 13.79 billion years.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Planck_2018-2) Astronomers have two different approaches to determine the age of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"). One is based on a particle physics model of the early universe called [Lambda-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model"), matched to measurements of the distant, and thus old features, like the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background"). The other is based on the distance and relative velocity of a series or "ladder" of different kinds of stars, making it depend on local measurements late in the history of the universe.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-VerdeReview2024-3) These two methods give slightly different values for the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant "Hubble constant"), which is then used in a formula to calculate the age. The range of the estimate is also within the range of the estimate for the [oldest observed star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_stars "List of oldest stars") in the universe.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-4)

In the 18th century, the concept that the [age of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "Age of Earth") was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. Nonetheless, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [steady state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_model "Steady-state model") and eternal, possibly with stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-5)

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") published the theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-6) and in 1917 constructed the first [cosmological model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_model "Cosmological model") based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady-state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant") to his equations. Einstein's model of a static universe was proved unstable by [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington").

The first direct observational hint that the universe was not static but expanding came from the observations of '[recession velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_velocity "Recession velocity")', mostly by [Vesto M. Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher "Vesto M. Slipher"), combined with distances to the '[nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula")' ([galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy")) by [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") in a work published in 1929.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-7) Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, the [Milky Way Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_Galaxy "Milky Way Galaxy"). In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [Spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") taken of these distant galaxies showed a [red shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_shift "Red shift") in their [spectral lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_lines "Spectral lines") presumably caused by the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect "Doppler effect"), thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The [lookback time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookback_time "Lookback time") of extragalactic observations by their redshift up to z = 20[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Pilipenko-8)

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant "Hubble constant"), was made in 1958 by astronomer [Allan Sandage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Sandage "Allan Sandage").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-9) His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted since then.

Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Sandage proposed new theories of [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") to explain this discrepancy. This issue was more or less resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2024, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [oldest known star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldest_star "Oldest star") is 13.8±4 billion years.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Cowan-Sneden-Burles-etal-2002-06-ApJ-10)

The discovery of [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") announced in 1965[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-apj142:419-11) finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart. In 1964, [Arno Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Allan_Penzias "Arno Allan Penzias") and [Robert Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson") were trying to detect [radio wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave")[echoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo "Echo") with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics) "Noise (electronics)") in the [microwave region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_radiation "Microwave radiation") that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), or the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") galaxy, but from outside the Milky Way, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [Robert H. Dicke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Dicke "Robert H. Dicke"), [Jim Peebles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Peebles "Jim Peebles"), and [David Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Todd_Wilkinson "David Todd Wilkinson"), were attempting to detect low level noise that might be left over from the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft) "Planck (spacecraft)"), launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-wmap-12)

Relationship between redshift and age of the universe, from z = 5...20[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Pilipenko-8)

Experimental observations confirm expansion of universe according to [Hubble's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law "Hubble's law"). Since the universe is expanding, the equation for that expansion can be "run backwards" to its starting point. The [Lambda-CDM concordance model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model") describes the expansion of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its existing state over a span of about 13.77 billion years[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-13) of [cosmological time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_time "Cosmological time"). This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [astronomical observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_observation "Astronomical observation") such as [WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe"). The [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") uses the term "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-14) or equivalently, the time elapsed within the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe") since the Big Bang. The expansion rate at any time ![Image 3: {\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560) is called the [Hubble parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_parameter "Hubble parameter")![Image 4: {\displaystyle H(t)\equiv {\frac {\dot {a}}{a}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fc57248b2e64252c66d878311e009e61ff2e23c) which is modeled as ![Image 5: {\displaystyle H(a)\equiv {\frac {\dot {a}}{a}}=H_{0}{\sqrt {\Omega _{\rm {m}}a^{-3}+\Omega _{\mathrm {rad} }a^{-4}+\Omega _{\Lambda }+(1-\Omega _{\rm {m}}-\Omega _{\mathrm {rad} }-\Omega _{\Lambda })a^{-2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/308d1efc788d794d74e5e990210d0b307f646059) where ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \Omega _{x}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3607bd70dc8cabb88ff65539bf5a3f9fc1bfe0d7) are density parameters, with ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathrm {m} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d904f3d1ee309134263e4e6bc5802979973b90f7) for mass ([baryons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon") and [cold dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_dark_matter "Cold dark matter")), ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathrm {rad} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0be1a85dfe913bcf55fe184b7d5e06cbf043fcb5) for [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") ([photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") plus relativistic [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino")), and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \Lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ac0a4a98a414e3480335f9ba652d12571ec6733) for [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"). The value ![Image 10: {\displaystyle H_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43910602a221b7a4c373791f94793e3008622070), called the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant "Hubble constant"), is the Hubble parameter (![Image 11: {\displaystyle t=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43469ec032d858feae5aa87029e22eaaf0109e9c)) and it has units of inverse time. The age of the universe is then defined as[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Zee-2013-15): 512 ![Image 12: {\displaystyle t_{\textrm {age}}={\frac {1}{H_{0}}}\int _{0}^{1}{\frac {da}{\sqrt {\Omega _{\rm {m}}a^{-1}+\Omega _{\mathrm {rad} }a^{-2}+\Omega _{\Lambda }a^{2}+(1-\Omega _{\rm {m}}-\Omega _{\mathrm {rad} }-\Omega _{\Lambda })}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e4dfb795310f8ccaed953609aa41c3d1c337540) The integral is close to 1 so ![Image 13: {\displaystyle H_{0}^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eff4f8294dce803b85728eb8211504778834dcff) is close to the age of the universe.

Observational limits
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_the_universe&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Observational limits")]

Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations that put a lower limit on the age of the universe;[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-17) these include

*   the temperature of the coolest [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf"), which gradually cool as they age, and
*   the dimmest [turnoff point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnoff_point "Turnoff point") of [main sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence "Main sequence")[stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars "Stars") in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved away from the main sequence set a minimum age).

Before the incorporation of [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy") in the model of cosmic expansion, the age was awkwardly less than the oldest observed astronomical objects. This connection can be used in reverse: the oldest objects found constrain the values of the density parameter for dark energy.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Zee-2013-15): 513

Cosmological parameters
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_the_universe&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cosmological parameters")]

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Mplwp_universe_scale_evolution.svg/500px-Mplwp_universe_scale_evolution.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mplwp_universe_scale_evolution.svg)

The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant "Hubble constant") and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (![Image 15: {\displaystyle ~\Omega ~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb762636fa7ae2b980ec1051f3902b6be581a986)). Before the discovery of [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([Einstein–de Sitter universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93de_Sitter_universe "Einstein–de Sitter universe"), green curve). The [de Sitter universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_universe "De Sitter universe") has infinite age, while the [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch "Big Crunch") universe has the least age.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Age_Universe_Planck_2013.png/500px-Age_Universe_Planck_2013.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Age_Universe_Planck_2013.png)

The value of the age correction factor, ![Image 17: {\displaystyle ~F~,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c73832199f771dbf280942887ad52b43bd23d40) is shown as a function of two [cosmological parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"): the fractional matter density ![Image 18: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{m}}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/631bb0940d39302f6446d1bea10f356edb77597a) and cosmological constant density ![Image 19: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\Lambda }~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9f98dda6e0552a815794b8dc8943b0dcf8895ac) The [best-fit values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model") of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.

The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. This is largely carried out in the context of the [ΛCDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model") model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter"), radiation (including both [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") and [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino")), and a [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-18)

The fractional contribution of each to the energy density of the universe is given by the [density parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_parameter "Density parameter")![Image 20: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{m}}~,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40d944f18f4e16127a7dfc27a92806b6ed1ab196)![Image 21: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{r}}~,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ee1b2bf0905de7fe7b7eb7623c9832f12c7d0bc) and ![Image 22: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\Lambda }~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9f98dda6e0552a815794b8dc8943b0dcf8895ac) The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [Hubble parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law "Hubble's law")![Image 23: {\displaystyle ~H_{0}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31d93886efbbef551e5af65210503060b2f07d4a), are the most important.

With accurate measurements of these parameters, the age of the universe can be determined by using the [Friedmann equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations "Friedmann equations"). This equation relates the rate of change in the [scale factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor_(cosmology) "Scale factor (cosmology)")![Image 24: {\displaystyle ~a(t)~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/917907c10911193ff017951e6d6adfa2178c080f)to the matter content of the universe. Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [integrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") this formula. The age![Image 25: {\displaystyle ~t_{0}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f9fbd0358c9343f5f3ccf0b937f69dd06d1d0da)is then given by an expression of the form

![Image 26: {\displaystyle t_{0}={\frac {1}{H_{0}}}\,F(\,\Omega _{\text{r}},\,\Omega _{\text{m}},\,\Omega _{\Lambda },\,\dots \,)~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b0a2157726d19bb9a53645703fc541b49c2eba9)
where![Image 27: {\displaystyle ~H_{0}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31d93886efbbef551e5af65210503060b2f07d4a)is the Hubble parameter and the function![Image 28: {\displaystyle ~F~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/995a468ca9056c74c96316e7dd49543ad0d3bbe2)depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [Hubble time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_time "Hubble time"), the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for![Image 29: {\displaystyle ~H_{0}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31d93886efbbef551e5af65210503060b2f07d4a)around 69 km/s/Mpc, the Hubble time evaluates to ![Image 30: {\displaystyle ~1/H_{0}=~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff0758054299a3611cc6ebb2267159fee2d1fdde)14.5 billion years.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-19)

To get a more accurate number, the correction function![Image 31: {\displaystyle ~F~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/995a468ca9056c74c96316e7dd49543ad0d3bbe2)must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [Planck values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_CDM_model "Lambda CDM model")![Image 32: {\displaystyle ~(\Omega _{\text{m}},\Omega _{\Lambda })=~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/091ef209639dc0a8715ce51128473a68cf435238)(0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about![Image 33: {\displaystyle ~F=0.956~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80c48eeab68195345c8a8f150212a99d57c4c3cb) For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner,![Image 34: {\displaystyle ~F={2}/{3}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdcc3cd4f7604c0a473db2077bd370f9e7b32346)is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure,![Image 35: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{r}}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fce749b3404776cc02167179b2a2717b39c9027e)is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP "WMAP")) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number. [CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB "CMB") measurements are very good at constraining the matter content![Image 36: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{m}}~,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40d944f18f4e16127a7dfc27a92806b6ed1ab196)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-20) and curvature parameter ![Image 37: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\text{k}}~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a353d42f8a5dd8d555c2042c1465569de4d9053)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-anim3-21) It is not as sensitive to![Image 38: {\displaystyle ~\Omega _{\Lambda }~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56404a34f19d8ab7826af5ca2e3866ee821ebc61)directly,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-anim3-21) partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift. The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter![Image 39: {\displaystyle ~H_{0}~}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31d93886efbbef551e5af65210503060b2f07d4a)are believed to come from measured brightnesses and redshifts of distant [Type Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova "Type Ia supernova"). Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster") in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-23) Introducing the cosmological constant allows the universe to be older than these clusters, as well as explaining other features that the matter-only cosmological model could not.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-24)

Light observed from astronomical objects was emitted when the universe was younger. Astronomers use [lookback time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_time "Cosmic time"), ![Image 40: {\displaystyle t_{L}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18e7c65e125b1bf99382d350dbc87119390d686d), to describe the difference in the age of the universe here and now,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Hogg-1999-25)![Image 41: {\displaystyle t_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02d3006c4190b1939b04d9b9bb21006fb4e6fa4a), from the age at the time of emission, ![Image 42: {\displaystyle t_{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4004a41da2e68ea68ed4f605bb28db65c709c96): ![Image 43: {\displaystyle t_{L}(z)=t_{0}-t_{e}(z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17fb97992ab623cd893cf783118269485c6fb724) where t is an age. The lookback time depends on the objects redshift and, like the age of the universe, the cosmological parameters selected.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Hogg-1999-25)

[NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") (WMAP) project's [nine-year data release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe#Nine-year_data_release "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be (13.772±0.059)×10 9 years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-arxiv-20121220-26)

This age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-27)

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation") power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination). The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe. Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one per cent.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-wmap-12)

In 2015, the [Planck Collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft) "Planck (spacecraft)") estimated the age of the universe to be 13.813±0.038 billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-Planck_2015-28)

Assumption of strong priors
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_of_the_universe&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Assumption of strong priors")]

Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [strong priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_priors "Strong priors") and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result. The age given is thus accurate to the specified error, since this represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model.

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [Planck 2018 data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)#2018_data_release "Planck (spacecraft)") alone is 13.787±0.020 billion years. A component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft) "Planck (spacecraft)")) is to use a [Bayesian statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics "Bayesian statistics") analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-wmap-12) This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe#cite_note-30)
