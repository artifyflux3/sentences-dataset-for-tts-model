For the generalization of symmetric polynomials to infinitely many variables (in algebraic combinatorics), see ring of symmetric functions . For symmetric functions on elements of a vector space, see symmetric tensor .

In mathematics , a function of n {\displaystyle n} variables is symmetric if its value is the same no matter the order of its arguments . For example, a function f ( x 1 , x 2 ) {\displaystyle f\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)} of two arguments is a symmetric function if and only if f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = f ( x 2 , x 1 ) {\displaystyle f\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)=f\left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)} for all x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} and x 2 {\displaystyle x_{2}} such that ( x 1 , x 2 ) {\displaystyle \left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)} and ( x 2 , x 1 ) {\displaystyle \left(x_{2},x_{1}\right)} are in the domain of f .

{\displaystyle f.} The most commonly encountered symmetric functions are polynomial functions , which are given by the symmetric polynomials .

A related notion is alternating polynomials , which change sign under an interchange of variables. Aside from polynomial functions, tensors that act as functions of several vectors can be symmetric, and in fact the space of symmetric k {\displaystyle k} -tensors on a vector space V {\displaystyle V} is isomorphic to the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree k {\displaystyle k} on V .

{\displaystyle V.} Symmetric functions should not be confused with even and odd functions , which have a different sort of symmetry.

Symmetrization [ edit ] Main article: Symmetrization Given any function f {\displaystyle f} in n {\displaystyle n} variables with values in an abelian group , a symmetric function can be constructed by summing values of f {\displaystyle f} over all permutations of the arguments. Similarly, an anti-symmetric function can be constructed by summing over even permutations and subtracting the sum over odd permutations . These operations are of course not invertible, and could well result in a function that is identically zero for nontrivial functions f .

{\displaystyle f.} The only general case where f {\displaystyle f} can be recovered if both its symmetrization and antisymmetrization are known is when n = 2 {\displaystyle n=2} and the abelian group admits a division by 2 (inverse of doubling); then f {\displaystyle f} is equal to half the sum of its symmetrization and its antisymmetrization.

Examples [ edit ] Consider the real function f ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = ( x − − x 1 ) ( x − − x 2 ) ( x − − x 3 ) .

{\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})(x-x_{3}).} By definition, a symmetric function with n {\displaystyle n} variables has the property that f ( x 1 , x 2 , … … , x n ) = f ( x 2 , x 1 , … … , x n ) = f ( x 3 , x 1 , … … , x n , x n − − 1 ) , etc.

{\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n})=f(x_{2},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=f(x_{3},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n},x_{n-1}),\quad {\text{ etc.}}} In general, the function remains the same for every permutation of its variables. This means that, in this case, ( x − − x 1 ) ( x − − x 2 ) ( x − − x 3 ) = ( x − − x 2 ) ( x − − x 1 ) ( x − − x 3 ) = ( x − − x 3 ) ( x − − x 1 ) ( x − − x 2 ) {\displaystyle (x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})(x-x_{3})=(x-x_{2})(x-x_{1})(x-x_{3})=(x-x_{3})(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})} and so on, for all permutations of x 1 , x 2 , x 3 .

{\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}.} Consider the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 − − r 2 .

{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}-r^{2}.} If x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are interchanged the function becomes f ( y , x ) = y 2 + x 2 − − r 2 , {\displaystyle f(y,x)=y^{2}+x^{2}-r^{2},} which yields exactly the same results as the original f ( x , y ) .

{\displaystyle f(x,y).} Consider now the function f ( x , y ) = a x 2 + b y 2 − − r 2 .

{\displaystyle f(x,y)=ax^{2}+by^{2}-r^{2}.} If x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are interchanged, the function becomes f ( y , x ) = a y 2 + b x 2 − − r 2 .

{\displaystyle f(y,x)=ay^{2}+bx^{2}-r^{2}.} This function is not the same as the original if a ≠ ≠ b , {\displaystyle a\neq b,} which makes it non-symmetric.

Applications [ edit ] U-statistics [ edit ] Main article: U-statistic In statistics , an n {\displaystyle n} -sample statistic (a function in n {\displaystyle n} variables) that is obtained by bootstrapping symmetrization of a k {\displaystyle k} -sample statistic, yielding a symmetric function in n {\displaystyle n} variables, is called a U-statistic . Examples include the sample mean and sample variance .
