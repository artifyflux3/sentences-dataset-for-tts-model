( Japanese : 株式会社日本経済新聞社 , Hepburn : Kabushiki gaisha Nihon Keizai Shinbun-sha ) is a Japanese media company which owns The Nikkei and the Financial Times . Its first publication was in 1876 with the publication of The Chugai Bukka Shimpo (Domestic and Foreign Prices News) . In 1946, the company name was changed to Nihon Keizai Shimbunsha , while the newspaper changed its title to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun , both of which were later shortened to Nikkei .

Nikkei is an employee-owned company ; Japanese law does not allow newspaper companies to be publicly traded .

[ 2 ] In addition to the Japan-based The Nikkei newspaper (the world's largest business daily in terms of circulation), Nikkei, Inc. owns and publishes two international publications: the Nikkei Asia weekly news magazine and the London headquartered Financial Times daily newspaper.

[ 3 ] Furthermore, it is the owner of the TX Network , of which TV Tokyo is the flagship station.

Nikkei, Inc.'s current holdings include companies in books, magazines to digital media, database services, broadcasting, and other activities such as economic/cultural events.

[ 4 ] Criticism [ edit ] Nikkei Inc. through its main publication The Nikkei is said to have formed an "institutionalized" relationship with the national government through the so-called " press clubs ", [ 5 ] where large national newspapers such as The Nikkei are given "privileged access to officials, whose perspectives they end up sharing." This symbiotic relationship between the government and national newspapers and broadcasters leads publications to "avoiding any actual confrontation with the administration".

[ 5 ] According to reporters such as Shusuke Murai and Reiji Yoshida from The Japan Times , the Nikkei was "depending too much on leaks — apparently provided by corporate insiders" and that the paper was "often seen as reluctant to bluntly criticize Japanese firms." [ 6 ] The New York Times reporter Hiroko Tabuchi said the Nikkei ' s purchase of the FT was "worrying", further stating that: " [The] Nikkei is basically a PR machine for Japanese biz; it initially ignored the 2011 Olympus accounting scandal (which FT broke).

Nikkei has also hardly covered the Takata airbag defect; almost no investigative work on that issue whatsoever.

Nikkei is Japan Inc." [ 7 ] Holdings [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .
