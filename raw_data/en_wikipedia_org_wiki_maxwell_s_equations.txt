Maxwell's equations on a plaque on his statue in Edinburgh

**Maxwell's equations**, or **Maxwell–Heaviside equations**, are a set of coupled [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") that, together with the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") law, form the foundation of [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"), classical [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"), [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network "Electrical network") and [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_circuit "Magnetic circuit") circuits. The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless "Wireless") communication, lenses, radar, etc. They describe how [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") are generated by [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), [currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"), and changes of the fields.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-1) The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), who, in 1861 and 1862, published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law. Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. The modern form of the equations in their most common formulation is credited to [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Hampshire-2)

Maxwell's equations may be combined to demonstrate how fluctuations in electromagnetic fields (waves) propagate at a constant speed in vacuum, _[c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light")_ (299 792 458 m/s[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-physconst-c-3)). Known as [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"), these waves occur at various wavelengths to produce a [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") of radiation from [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") to [gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray").

In [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") form and a [coherent system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_system_of_units "Coherent system of units"), Maxwell's microscopic equations can be written as (top to bottom: Gauss's law, Gauss's law for magnetism, Faraday's law, Ampère-Maxwell law) ![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} \,\,\,&={\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}}\\\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} \,\,\,&=0\\\nabla \times \mathbf {E} &=-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}\\\nabla \times \mathbf {B} &=\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {J} +\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}\right)\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c1740d383a275f64105f457e209ff5c66eeeb21) With ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d7f22b39d51f780fc02859059c1757c606b9de2) the electric field, ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cafb0ef39b0f5ffa23c170aa7f7b4e718327c4d1) the magnetic field, ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64) the [electric charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge_density "Electric charge density") and ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7686846b1a6b756cb514954000004ab5e7b2a5ba) the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density"). ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acb0a8377db20e42274444cb181d51b5532b5844) is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity") and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe2fd9b8decb38a3cd158e7b6c0c6e2d987fefcc) the [vacuum permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability "Vacuum permeability").

The equations have two major variants:

*   The _microscopic_ equations have universal applicability but are unwieldy for common calculations. They relate the electric and magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the [atomic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_scale "Atomic scale").
*   The _macroscopic_ equations define two new auxiliary fields that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter without having to consider atomic-scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins. However, their use requires experimentally determined parameters for a phenomenological description of the electromagnetic response of materials.

The term "Maxwell's equations" is often also used for [equivalent alternative formulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#Alternative_formulations). Versions of Maxwell's equations based on the [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") and [magnetic scalar potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_scalar_potential "Magnetic scalar potential") are preferred for explicitly solving the equations as a [boundary value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem "Boundary value problem"), [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_force#Lorentz_force_and_analytical_mechanics "Lorenz force"), or for use in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). The [covariant formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism "Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism") (on [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") rather than space and time separately) makes the compatibility of Maxwell's equations with [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity")[manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_covariance "Manifest covariance"). [Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations_in_curved_spacetime "Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime"), commonly used in [high-energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") and [gravitational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_physics "Gravitational physics"), are compatible with [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-4) In fact, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") developed special and general relativity to accommodate the invariant speed of light, a consequence of Maxwell's equations, with the principle that only relative movement has physical consequences.

The publication of the equations marked the [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(physics) "Unification (physics)") of a theory for previously separately described phenomena: magnetism, electricity, light, and associated radiation. Since the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations do not give an exact description of electromagnetic phenomena, but are instead a [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory "Classical field theory") limit of the more precise theory of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics").

Electric field from positive to negative charges

[Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law "Gauss's law") describes the relationship between an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"): an electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net [outflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_flux "Electric flux") of the electric field through a [closed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_surface "Gaussian surface") is proportional to the enclosed charge, including bound charge due to polarization of material. The coefficient of the proportion is the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity").

### Gauss's law for magnetism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Gauss's law for magnetism")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/VFPt_dipole_magnetic1.svg/250px-VFPt_dipole_magnetic1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipole_magnetic1.svg)

[Gauss's law for magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_magnetism "Gauss's law for magnetism"): magnetic field lines never begin nor end but form loops or extend to infinity as shown here with the magnetic field due to a ring of current.

[Gauss's law for magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_magnetism "Gauss's law for magnetism") states that electric charges have no magnetic analogues, called [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole"); no north or south magnetic poles exist in isolation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-VideoGlossary-5) Instead, the magnetic field of a material is attributed to a [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole"), and the net outflow of the magnetic field through a closed surface is zero. Magnetic dipoles may be represented as loops of current or inseparable pairs of equal and opposite "magnetic charges". Precisely, the total [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux") through a Gaussian surface is zero, and the magnetic field is a [solenoidal vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoidal_vector_field "Solenoidal vector field").[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-6)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg/500px-Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg)

In a [geomagnetic storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm "Geomagnetic storm"), solar wind plasma impacts [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") causing a time-dependent change in the field, thus inducing electric fields in Earth's atmosphere and conductive [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere") which can destabilize [power grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid"). (Not to scale.)

The [Maxwell–Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#Maxwell%E2%80%93Faraday_equation "Faraday's law of induction") version of [Faraday's law of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction") describes how a time-varying [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") corresponds to the negative [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)") of an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-VideoGlossary-5) In integral form, it states that the work per unit charge required to move a charge around a closed loop equals the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the enclosed surface.

The [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") is the operating principle behind many [electric generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator "Electric generator"): for example, a rotating [bar magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_magnet "Bar magnet") creates a changing magnetic field and generates an electric field in a nearby wire.

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Magnetic_core.jpg/250px-Magnetic_core.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_core.jpg)

[Magnetic-core memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory "Magnetic-core memory") (1954) is an application of [Ampère's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law "Ampère's circuital law"). Each [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core "Magnetic core") stores one [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") of data.

The original law of Ampère states that magnetic fields relate to [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"). [Maxwell's addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%E2%80%93Maxwell_law "Ampère–Maxwell law") states that magnetic fields also relate to changing electric fields, which Maxwell called [displacement current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_current "Displacement current"). The integral form states that electric and displacement currents are associated with a proportional magnetic field along any enclosing curve.

Maxwell's modification of Ampère's circuital law is important because the laws of Ampère and Gauss must otherwise be adjusted for static fields.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-7)[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] As a consequence, it predicts that a rotating magnetic field occurs with a changing electric field.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-VideoGlossary-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-8) A further consequence is the existence of self-sustaining [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves") which [travel through empty space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave_equation "Electromagnetic wave equation").

The speed calculated for electromagnetic waves, which could be predicted from experiments on charges and currents,[[note 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-9) matches the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"); indeed, [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light")_is_ one form of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") (as are [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave"), and others). Maxwell understood the connection between electromagnetic waves and light in 1861, thereby unifying the theories of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics").

Formulation in terms of electric and magnetic fields (microscopic or in vacuum version)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Formulation in terms of electric and magnetic fields (microscopic or in vacuum version)")]

In the electric and magnetic field formulation there are four equations that determine the fields for given charge and current distribution. A separate [law of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law"), the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") law, describes how the electric and magnetic fields act on charged particles and currents. By convention, a version of this law in the original equations by Maxwell is no longer included. The [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus") formalism below, the work of [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-10)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-11) has become standard. It is rotationally invariant, and therefore mathematically more transparent than Maxwell's original 20 equations in _x_, _y_ and _z_ components. The [relativistic formulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#Relativistic_formulations) are more symmetric and Lorentz invariant. For the same equations expressed using tensor calculus or differential forms (see _[§Alternative formulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's\_equations#Alternative\_formulations)_).

The differential and integral formulations are mathematically equivalent; both are useful. The integral formulation relates fields within a region of space to fields on the boundary and can often be used to simplify and directly calculate fields from symmetric distributions of charges and currents. On the other hand, the differential equations are purely _local_ and are a more natural starting point for calculating the fields in more complicated (less symmetric) situations, for example using [finite element analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_analysis "Finite element analysis").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-12)

### Key to the notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Key to the notation")]

Symbols in **bold** represent [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") quantities, and symbols in _italics_ represent [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") quantities, unless otherwise indicated. The equations introduce the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"), **E**, a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), and the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), **B**, a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") field, each generally having a time and location dependence. The sources are

*   the total electric [charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density "Charge density") (total charge per unit volume), _ρ_, and
*   the total electric [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") (total current per unit area), **J**.

The [universal constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_constant "Universal constant") appearing in the equations (the first two ones explicitly only in the SI formulation) are:

*   the [permittivity of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity_of_free_space "Permittivity of free space"), _ε_ 0, and
*   the [permeability of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_of_free_space "Permeability of free space"), _μ_ 0, and
*   the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), ![Image 13: {\displaystyle c=({\varepsilon _{0}\mu _{0}})^{-1/2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c3d8b6ea59b3abfaad7b9d0d3085910085494b3)

#### Differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Differential equations")]

In the differential equations,

*   the [nabla symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabla_symbol "Nabla symbol"), ∇, denotes the three-dimensional [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") operator, [del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del"),
*   the ∇⋅ symbol (pronounced "del dot") denotes the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") operator,
*   the ∇× symbol (pronounced "del cross") denotes the [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)") operator.

In the integral equations,

*   Ω is any volume with closed [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)") surface ∂Ω, and
*   Σ is any surface with closed boundary curve ∂Σ,

The equations are a little easier to interpret with time-independent surfaces and volumes. Time-independent surfaces and volumes are "fixed" and do not change over a given time interval. For example, since the surface is time-independent, we can bring the [differentiation under the integral sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_under_the_integral_sign "Differentiation under the integral sign") in Faraday's law: ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\iint _{\Sigma }\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =\iint _{\Sigma }{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cf0521a42201d0580b966ac871a7de1b031ffc1) Maxwell's equations can be formulated with possibly time-dependent surfaces and volumes by using the differential version and using Gauss' and Stokes' theorems as appropriate.

### Formulation in the Gaussian system

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Formulation in the Gaussian system")]

The definitions of charge, electric field, and magnetic field can be altered to simplify theoretical calculation, by absorbing [dimensioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") factors of _ε_ 0 and _μ_ 0 into the units (and thus redefining these). With a corresponding change in the values of the quantities for the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") law this yields the same physics, i.e. trajectories of charged particles, or [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done by an electric motor. These definitions are often preferred in theoretical and high energy physics where it is natural to take the electric and magnetic field with the same units, to simplify the appearance of the [electromagnetic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_tensor "Electromagnetic tensor"): the Lorentz covariant object unifying electric and magnetic field would then contain components with uniform unit and dimension.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Jackson-13): vii  Such modified definitions are conventionally used with the Gaussian ([CGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre_gram_second_system_of_units#Alternate_derivations_of_CGS_units_in_electromagnetism "Centimetre gram second system of units")) units. Using these definitions, colloquially "in Gaussian units",[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Littlejohn-14) the Maxwell equations become:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Griffiths-15)

The equations simplify slightly when a system of quantities is chosen in the speed of light, _c_, is used for [nondimensionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization "Nondimensionalization"), so that, for example, seconds and lightseconds are interchangeable, and _c_ = 1.

Further changes are possible by absorbing factors of 4 _π_. This process, called rationalization, affects whether [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") or [Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law "Gauss's law") includes such a factor (see _[Heaviside–Lorentz units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside%E2%80%93Lorentz\_units "Heaviside–Lorentz units")_, used mainly in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics")).

Relationship between differential and integral formulations
-----------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Relationship between differential and integral formulations")]

The equivalence of the differential and integral formulations are a consequence of the [Gauss divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem") and the [Kelvin–Stokes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Stokes_theorem "Kelvin–Stokes theorem").

### Flux and divergence

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Flux and divergence")]

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Divergence_theorem_in_EM.svg/250px-Divergence_theorem_in_EM.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Divergence_theorem_in_EM.svg)

Volume Ω and its closed boundary ∂Ω, containing (respectively enclosing) a source (+) and sink (−) of a vector field **F**. Here, **F** could be the **E** field with source electric charges, but _not_ the **B** field, which has no magnetic charges as shown. The outward [unit normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_normal "Unit normal") is **n**.

According to the (purely mathematical) [Gauss divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem"), the [electric flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_flux "Electric flux") through the [boundary surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)")∂Ω can be rewritten as

![Image 36: \oiint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/OiintLaTeX.svg/40px-OiintLaTeX.svg.png)![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\vphantom {\oint }}_{\scriptstyle \partial \Omega }\mathbf {E} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =\iiint _{\Omega }\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} \,\mathrm {d} V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e12001916796515dc7167a4f2eb1edca8eaa01c1)
The integral version of Gauss's equation can thus be rewritten as ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \iiint _{\Omega }\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} -{\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} V=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ddb737066c23b5c1482d20f176c017e67a627957) Since Ω is arbitrary (e.g. an arbitrary small ball with arbitrary center), this is satisfied [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the integrand is zero everywhere. This is the differential equations formulation of Gauss equation up to a trivial rearrangement.

Similarly rewriting the [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux") in Gauss's law for magnetism in integral form gives

![Image 39: \oiint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/OiintLaTeX.svg/40px-OiintLaTeX.svg.png)![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\vphantom {\oint }}_{\scriptstyle \partial \Omega }\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =\iiint _{\Omega }\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} \,\mathrm {d} V=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4c7a9cc580a1f907922e93d99d35c439c36d6e7)
which is satisfied for all Ω if and only if ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16ee950683349dacdd9e9c262ff6133812747edd) everywhere.

### Circulation and curl

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Circulation and curl")]

[![Image 42](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Curl_theorem_in_EM.svg/250px-Curl_theorem_in_EM.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Curl_theorem_in_EM.svg)

Surface Σ with closed boundary ∂Σ. **F** could be the **E** or **B** fields. Again, **n** is the [unit normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_normal "Unit normal"). (The curl of a vector field does not literally look like the "circulations", this is a heuristic depiction.)

By the [Kelvin–Stokes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem") we can rewrite the [line integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") of the fields around the closed boundary curve ∂Σ to an integral of the "circulation of the fields" (i.e. their [curls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)")) over a surface it bounds, i.e. ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=\iint _{\Sigma }(\nabla \times \mathbf {B} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25e7794298af66dde751ad7b1726dd8d5d424a82) Hence the [Ampère–Maxwell law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%E2%80%93Maxwell_law "Ampère–Maxwell law"), the modified version of Ampère's circuital law, in integral form can be rewritten as ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \iint _{\Sigma }\left(\nabla \times \mathbf {B} -\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {J} +\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}\right)\right)\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63b43ba4fe02547c4c9c93d689e9509c3b70a96c) Since Σ can be chosen arbitrarily, e.g. as an arbitrary small, arbitrary oriented, and arbitrary centered disk, we conclude that the integrand is zero [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the Ampère–Maxwell law in differential equations form is satisfied. The equivalence of Faraday's law in differential and integral form follows likewise.

The line integrals and curls are analogous to quantities in classical [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"): the [circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_(fluid_dynamics) "Circulation (fluid dynamics)") of a fluid is the line integral of the fluid's [flow velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity "Flow velocity") field around a closed loop, and the [vorticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticity "Vorticity") of the fluid is the curl of the velocity field.

Charge conservation
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Charge conservation")]

The invariance of charge can be derived as a corollary of Maxwell's equations. The left-hand side of the Ampère–Maxwell law has zero divergence by the [div–curl identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Divergence_of_curl_is_zero "Vector calculus identities"). Expanding the divergence of the right-hand side, interchanging derivatives, and applying Gauss's law gives: ![Image 45: {\displaystyle 0=\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {B} )=\nabla \cdot \left(\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {J} +\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}\right)\right)=\mu _{0}\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} +\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} \right)=\mu _{0}\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} +{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6228a67c3ea23fa7133d7b0cbef4a404e16910f5) i.e., ![Image 46: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} =0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1dccdd48fa0c3dc9e58a225b25bd6d1ad0758c63) By the Gauss divergence theorem, this means the rate of change of charge in a fixed volume equals the net current flowing through the boundary:

![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}Q_{\Omega }={\frac {d}{dt}}\iiint _{\Omega }\rho \mathrm {d} V=-}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9f660d8754861bcb70c2ad4612d72ae82dc57b9)![Image 48: \oiint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/OiintLaTeX.svg/40px-OiintLaTeX.svg.png)![Image 49: {\displaystyle {\vphantom {\oint }}_{\scriptstyle \partial \Omega }\mathbf {J} \cdot {\rm {d}}\mathbf {S} =-I_{\partial \Omega }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c1f564bf270ec402536a946af9cf44fd60df269)
In particular, in an isolated system the total charge is conserved.

Vacuum equations, electromagnetic waves and speed of light
----------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Vacuum equations, electromagnetic waves and speed of light")]

[![Image 50](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Electromagneticwave3D.gif/250px-Electromagneticwave3D.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electromagneticwave3D.gif)

This 3D diagram shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from left to right, defined by **E** = **E**0 sin(−_ωt_ + **k** ⋅ **r**) and **B** = **B**0 sin(−_ωt_ + **k** ⋅ **r**) The oscillating fields are detected at the flashing point. The horizontal wavelength is _λ_. **E**0 ⋅ **B**0 = 0 = **E**0 ⋅ **k** = **B**0 ⋅ **k**

In a region with no charges (_ρ_ = 0) and no currents (**J** = **0**), such as in vacuum, Maxwell's equations reduce to: ![Image 51: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} &=0,&\nabla \times \mathbf {E} +{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}=0,\\\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} &=0,&\nabla \times \mathbf {B} -\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}=0.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4950b91bfda3705c1a93aecb63e96047dcdb2709)

Taking the curl (∇×) of the curl equations, and using the [curl of the curl identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Curl_of_curl "Vector calculus identities") we obtain ![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {E} }{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {E} =0,\\\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {B} }{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} =0.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f38f0d2be85651239c087888243873e33b2499d5)

The quantity ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b132f8e328c431dab8bd227d3145020af3ed64b) has the dimension (T/L)2. Defining ![Image 54: {\displaystyle c=(\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0})^{-1/2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a574069bbdcd24260c689b957d2b02d4d337dffd), the equations above have the form of the standard [wave equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation "Wave equation")![Image 55: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {E} }{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {E} =0,\\{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\mathbf {B} }{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} =0.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b735b96c1c3d8c4619782958b7a875cdc2c1e51)

Already during Maxwell's lifetime, it was found that the known values for ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acb0a8377db20e42274444cb181d51b5532b5844) and ![Image 57: {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe2fd9b8decb38a3cd158e7b6c0c6e2d987fefcc) give ![Image 58: {\displaystyle c\approx 2.998\times 10^{8}~{\text{m/s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b949fedc35af9b499833e9b4b6d68e047ef9e3aa), then already known to be the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in free space. This led him to propose that light and radio waves were propagating electromagnetic waves, since amply confirmed. In the [old SI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_system "SI system") of units, the values of ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \mu _{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47f438128235882f91251607bec58bcdd91facd4) and ![Image 60: {\displaystyle c=299\,792\,458~{\text{m/s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d783bea36ce622733a5d39fa27253fab683598b0) are defined constants, (which means that by definition ![Image 61: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}=8.854\,187\,8...\times 10^{-12}~{\text{F/m}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7437fd1b4420d10f4f9c6cf778f9a38c0c7af21)) that define the ampere and the metre. In the [new SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_SI "New SI") system, only _c_ keeps its defined value, and the electron charge gets a defined value.

In materials with [relative permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity "Relative permittivity"), _ε_ r, and [relative permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)#Relative_permeability_and_magnetic_susceptibility "Permeability (electromagnetism)"), _μ_ r, the [phase velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity "Phase velocity") of light becomes ![Image 62: {\displaystyle v_{\text{p}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\mu _{0}\mu _{\text{r}}\varepsilon _{0}\varepsilon _{\text{r}}}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6659319e79a19203af1561d4291027f6342e5eb2) which is usually[[note 5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-16) less than _c_.

In addition, **E** and **B** are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation, and are in [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves) "Phase (waves)") with each other. A [sinusoidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal "Sinusoidal") plane wave is one special solution of these equations. Maxwell's equations explain how these waves can physically propagate through space. The changing magnetic field creates a changing electric field through [Faraday's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction"). In turn, that electric field creates a changing magnetic field through [Maxwell's modification of Ampère's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%E2%80%93Maxwell_law "Ampère–Maxwell law"). This perpetual cycle allows these waves, now known as [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"), to move through space at velocity _c_.

Macroscopic formulation
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Macroscopic formulation")]

The above equations are the microscopic version of Maxwell's equations, expressing the electric and the magnetic fields in terms of the (possibly atomic-level) charges and currents present. This is sometimes called the "general" form, but the macroscopic version below is equally general, the difference being one of bookkeeping.

The microscopic version is sometimes called "Maxwell's equations in vacuum": this refers to the fact that the material medium is not built into the structure of the equations, but appears only in the charge and current terms. The microscopic version was introduced by Lorentz, who tried to use it to derive the macroscopic properties of bulk matter from its microscopic constituents.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-MiltonSchwinger2006-17): 5

"Maxwell's macroscopic equations", also known as **Maxwell's equations in matter**, are more similar to those that Maxwell introduced himself.

In the macroscopic equations, the influence of bound charge _Q_ b and bound current _I_ b is incorporated into the [displacement field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_displacement_field "Electric displacement field")**D** and the [magnetizing field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetizing_field "Magnetizing field")**H**, while the equations depend only on the free charges _Q_ f and free currents _I_ f. This reflects a splitting of the total electric charge _Q_ and current _I_ (and their densities ρ and **J**) into free and bound parts: ![Image 79: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q&=Q_{\text{f}}+Q_{\text{b}}=\iiint _{\Omega }\left(\rho _{\text{f}}+\rho _{\text{b}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} V=\iiint _{\Omega }\rho \,\mathrm {d} V,\\I&=I_{\text{f}}+I_{\text{b}}=\iint _{\Sigma }\left(\mathbf {J} _{\text{f}}+\mathbf {J} _{\text{b}}\right)\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} =\iint _{\Sigma }\mathbf {J} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {S} .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df83d8a0926264ef4438682dee0845566009c2de)

The cost of this splitting is that the additional fields **D** and **H** need to be determined through phenomenological constituent equations relating these fields to the electric field **E** and the magnetic field **B**, together with the bound charge and current.

See below for a detailed description of the differences between the microscopic equations, dealing with _total_ charge and current including material contributions, useful in air/vacuum;[[note 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Effective_charge-18) and the macroscopic equations, dealing with _free_ charge and current, practical to use within materials.

### Bound charge and current

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Bound charge and current")]

[![Image 80](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Polarization_and_magnetization.svg/330px-Polarization_and_magnetization.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Polarization_and_magnetization.svg)

_Left:_ A schematic view of how an assembly of microscopic dipoles produces opposite surface charges as shown at top and bottom. _Right:_ How an assembly of microscopic current loops add together to produce a macroscopically circulating current loop. Inside the boundaries, the individual contributions tend to cancel, but at the boundaries no cancelation occurs.

When an electric field is applied to a [dielectric material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric "Dielectric") its molecules respond by forming microscopic [electric dipoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole "Electric dipole") – their [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") move a tiny distance in the direction of the field, while their [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") move a tiny distance in the opposite direction. This produces a _macroscopic_ _bound charge_ in the material even though all of the charges involved are bound to individual molecules. For example, if every molecule responds the same, similar to that shown in the figure, these tiny movements of charge combine to produce a layer of positive [bound charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_charge#Bound_charge "Bound charge") on one side of the material and a layer of negative charge on the other side. The bound charge is most conveniently described in terms of the [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density "Polarization density")**P** of the material, its dipole moment per unit volume. If **P** is uniform, a macroscopic separation of charge is produced only at the surfaces where **P** enters and leaves the material. For non-uniform **P**, a charge is also produced in the bulk.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-19)

Somewhat similarly, in all materials the constituent atoms exhibit [magnetic moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") that are intrinsically linked to the [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio "Gyromagnetic ratio") of the components of the atoms, most notably their [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"). The [connection to angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Magnetic_dipoles "Magnetic field") suggests the picture of an assembly of microscopic current loops. Outside the material, an assembly of such microscopic current loops is not different from a macroscopic current circulating around the material's surface, despite the fact that no individual charge is traveling a large distance. These _[bound currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound\_current#Magnetization\_current "Bound current")_ can be described using the [magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization")**M**.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-20)

The very complicated and granular bound charges and bound currents, therefore, can be represented on the macroscopic scale in terms of **P** and **M**, which average these charges and currents on a sufficiently large scale so as not to see the granularity of individual atoms, but also sufficiently small that they vary with location in the material. As such, _Maxwell's macroscopic equations_ ignore many details on a fine scale that can be unimportant to understanding matters on a gross scale by calculating fields that are averaged over some suitable volume.

### Auxiliary fields, polarization and magnetization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Auxiliary fields, polarization and magnetization")]

The _[definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_electromagnetism\_equations#Definitions "List of electromagnetism equations")_ of the auxiliary fields are: ![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {D} (\mathbf {r} ,t)&=\varepsilon _{0}\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} ,t)+\mathbf {P} (\mathbf {r} ,t),\\\mathbf {H} (\mathbf {r} ,t)&={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}}}\mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,t)-\mathbf {M} (\mathbf {r} ,t),\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/892c0453ea65ef6faa9ad3eb3068f9c0b4d2cb1c) where **P** is the [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density "Polarization density") field and **M** is the [magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization") field, which are defined in terms of microscopic bound charges and bound currents respectively. The macroscopic bound charge density _ρ_ b and bound current density **J**b in terms of [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density "Polarization density")**P** and [magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization")**M** are then defined as ![Image 82: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho _{\text{b}}&=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf {P} ,\\\mathbf {J} _{\text{b}}&=\nabla \times \mathbf {M} +{\frac {\partial \mathbf {P} }{\partial t}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e711f80a1955bf670c88e7bc593891e8ffbad03d)

If we define the total, bound, and free charge and current density by ![Image 83: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho &=\rho _{\text{b}}+\rho _{\text{f}},\\\mathbf {J} &=\mathbf {J} _{\text{b}}+\mathbf {J} _{\text{f}},\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/37839cf61bc8818229f33b868ea37e5d93114095) and use the defining relations above to eliminate **D**, and **H**, the "macroscopic" Maxwell's equations reproduce the "microscopic" equations.

### Constitutive relations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Constitutive relations")]

In order to apply 'Maxwell's macroscopic equations', it is necessary to specify the relations between [displacement field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_displacement_field "Electric displacement field")**D** and the electric field **E**, as well as the [magnetizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#H-field_and_magnetic_materials "Magnetic field") field **H** and the magnetic field **B**. Equivalently, we have to specify the dependence of the polarization **P** (hence the bound charge) and the magnetization **M** (hence the bound current) on the applied electric and magnetic field. The equations specifying this response are called [constitutive relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_relation "Constitutive relation"). For real-world materials, the constitutive relations are rarely simple, except approximately, and usually determined by experiment. See the main article on constitutive relations for a fuller description.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Zangwill2013-21): 44–45

For materials without polarization and magnetization, the constitutive relations are (by definition)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Jackson-13): 2 ![Image 84: {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =\varepsilon _{0}\mathbf {E} ,\quad \mathbf {H} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}}}\mathbf {B} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7bbeda103c72c167a6318415d227d74c28fd44e3) where _ε_ 0 is the [permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity "Permittivity") of free space and _μ_ 0 the [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism) "Permeability (electromagnetism)") of free space. Since there is no bound charge, the total and the free charge and current are equal.

An alternative viewpoint on the microscopic equations is that they are the macroscopic equations _together_ with the statement that vacuum behaves like a perfect linear "material" without additional polarization and magnetization. More generally, for linear materials the constitutive relations are[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Zangwill2013-21): 44–45 ![Image 85: {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =\varepsilon \mathbf {E} ,\quad \mathbf {H} ={\frac {1}{\mu }}\mathbf {B} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c38632ab79185d8017f11144e4c61b9b6a76f18) where _ε_ is the [permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity "Permittivity") and _μ_ the [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism) "Permeability (electromagnetism)") of the material. For the displacement field **D** the linear approximation is usually excellent because for all but the most extreme electric fields or temperatures obtainable in the laboratory (high power pulsed lasers) the interatomic electric fields of materials of the order of 10 11 V/m are much higher than the external field. For the magnetizing field ![Image 86: {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f017b876ed763037d8818ec5dfbbdc6703e0f683), however, the linear approximation can break down in common materials like iron leading to phenomena like [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis "Hysteresis"). Even the linear case can have various complications, however.

*   For homogeneous materials, _ε_ and _μ_ are constant throughout the material, while for inhomogeneous materials they depend on [location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_vector "Position vector") within the material (and perhaps time).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Kittel2005-22): 463 
*   For isotropic materials, _ε_ and _μ_ are scalars, while for anisotropic materials (e.g. due to crystal structure) they are [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Zangwill2013-21): 421 [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Kittel2005-22): 463 
*   Materials are generally [dispersive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics) "Dispersion (optics)"), so _ε_ and _μ_ depend on the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of any incident EM waves.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Zangwill2013-21): 625 [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Kittel2005-22): 397 

Even more generally, in the case of non-linear materials (see for example [nonlinear optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics "Nonlinear optics")), **D** and **P** are not necessarily proportional to **E**, similarly **H** or **M** is not necessarily proportional to **B**. In general **D** and **H** depend on both **E** and **B**, on location and time, and possibly other physical quantities.

In applications one also has to describe how the free currents and charge density behave in terms of **E** and **B** possibly coupled to other physical quantities like pressure, and the mass, number density, and velocity of charge-carrying particles. E.g., the original equations given by Maxwell (see _[History of Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_Maxwell%27s\_equations "History of Maxwell's equations")_) included [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law") in the form ![Image 87: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\text{f}}=\sigma \mathbf {E} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f74f8a04e37c5c87420533a21c32d192a0c87cc7)

Alternative formulations
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Alternative formulations")]

Following are some of the several other mathematical formalisms of Maxwell's equations, with the columns separating the two homogeneous Maxwell equations from the two inhomogeneous ones. Each formulation has versions directly in terms of the electric and magnetic fields, and indirectly in terms of the [electrical potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_potential "Electrical potential")_φ_ and the [vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_potential "Vector potential")**A**. Potentials were introduced as a convenient way to solve the homogeneous equations, but it was thought that all observable physics was contained in the electric and magnetic fields (or relativistically, the Faraday tensor). The potentials play a central role in quantum mechanics, however, and act quantum mechanically with observable consequences even when the electric and magnetic fields vanish ([Aharonov–Bohm effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect "Aharonov–Bohm effect")).

Each table describes one formalism. See the [main article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_descriptions_of_the_electromagnetic_field "Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field") for details of each formulation.

The direct spacetime formulations make manifest that the Maxwell equations are [relativistically invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistically_invariant "Relativistically invariant"), where space and time are treated on equal footing. Because of this symmetry, the electric and magnetic fields are treated on equal footing and are recognized as components of the [Faraday tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_tensor "Faraday tensor"). This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which simplifies the equations, although we can no longer use the familiar vector formulation. Maxwell equations in formulation that do not treat space and time manifestly on the same footing have Lorentz invariance as a hidden symmetry. This was a major source of inspiration for the development of relativity theory. Indeed, even the formulation that treats space and time separately is not a non-relativistic approximation and describes the same physics by simply renaming variables. For this reason the relativistic invariant equations are usually called the Maxwell equations as well.

Each table below describes one formalism.

*   In the tensor calculus formulation, the [electromagnetic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_tensor "Electromagnetic tensor")_F_ _αβ_ is an antisymmetric covariant order 2 tensor; the [four-potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-potential "Four-potential"), _A_ _α_, is a covariant vector; the current, _J_ _α_, is a vector; the square brackets, [ ], denote [antisymmetrization of indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_calculus#Symmetric_and_antisymmetric_parts "Ricci calculus"); ∂_α_ is the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate, _x_ _α_. In Minkowski space coordinates are chosen with respect to an [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame "Inertial frame"); (_x_ _α_) = (_ct_,_x_,_y_,_z_), so that the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") used to raise and lower indices is _η_ _αβ_ = diag(1,−1,−1,−1). The [d'Alembert operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert_operator "D'Alembert operator") on Minkowski space is ◻ = ∂_α_∂_α_ as in the vector formulation. In general spacetimes, the coordinate system _x_ _α_ is arbitrary, the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative")∇_α_, the [Ricci tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_tensor "Ricci tensor"), _R_ _αβ_ and raising and lowering of indices are defined by the Lorentzian metric, _g_ _αβ_ and the d'Alembert operator is defined as ◻ = ∇_α_∇_α_. The topological restriction is that the second real [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology") group of the space vanishes (see the differential form formulation for an explanation). This is violated for Minkowski space with a line removed, which can model a (flat) spacetime with a point-like monopole on the complement of the line.
*   In the [differential form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") formulation on arbitrary space times, _F_ = ⁠1/2⁠_F_ _αβ_ d _x_ _α_ ∧ d _x_ _β_ is the electromagnetic tensor considered as a 2-form, _A_ = _A_ _α_ d _x_ _α_ is the potential 1-form, ![Image 109: {\displaystyle J=-J_{\alpha }{\star }\mathrm {d} x^{\alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6ddce03b5ab053e42b5928a48d8e49d00013c8d) is the current 3-form, d is the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative"), and ![Image 110: {\displaystyle {\star }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcda0fc423fda8f0a63f8a14aa707e813640b143) is the [Hodge star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star "Hodge star") on forms defined (up to its orientation, i.e. its sign) by the Lorentzian metric of spacetime. In the special case of 2-forms such as _F_, the Hodge star ![Image 111: {\displaystyle {\star }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcda0fc423fda8f0a63f8a14aa707e813640b143) depends on the metric tensor only for its local scale. This means that, as formulated, the differential form field equations are [conformally invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometry "Conformal geometry"), but the [Lorenz gauge condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge_condition "Lorenz gauge condition") breaks conformal invariance. The operator ![Image 112: {\displaystyle \Box =(-{\star }\mathrm {d} {\star }\mathrm {d} -\mathrm {d} {\star }\mathrm {d} {\star })}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8131a69cb810204193b6c9d1b93916bb5bd7d83d) is the [d'Alembert–Laplace–Beltrami operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami_operator "Laplace–Beltrami operator") on 1-forms on an arbitrary [Lorentzian spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold#Lorentzian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold"). The topological condition is again that the second real cohomology group is 'trivial' (meaning that its form follows from a definition). By the isomorphism with the second [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology") this condition means that every closed 2-form is exact.

Other formalisms include the [geometric algebra formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra#Spacetime_model "Geometric algebra") and a [matrix representation of Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_representation_of_Maxwell%27s_equations "Matrix representation of Maxwell's equations"). Historically, a [quaternionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") formulation[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-23)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-24) was used.

Maxwell's equations are [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations") that relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the electric charges and currents. Often, the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the [Lorentz force equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") and the [constitutive relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#Constitutive_relations). These all form a set of coupled partial differential equations which are often very difficult to solve: the solutions encompass all the diverse phenomena of [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"). Some general remarks follow.

As for any differential equation, [boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_condition "Boundary condition")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Monk-25)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Volakis-26)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Hagstrom-27) and [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition "Initial condition")[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Hussain-28) are necessary for a [unique solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism_uniqueness_theorem "Electromagnetism uniqueness theorem"). For example, even with no charges and no currents anywhere in spacetime, there are the obvious solutions for which **E** and **B** are zero or constant, but there are also non-trivial solutions corresponding to electromagnetic waves. In some cases, Maxwell's equations are solved over the whole of space, and boundary conditions are given as asymptotic limits at infinity.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Cook-29) In other cases, Maxwell's equations are solved in a finite region of space, with appropriate conditions on the boundary of that region, for example an [artificial absorbing boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer "Perfectly matched layer") representing the rest of the universe,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Lourtioz-30)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-31) or [periodic boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions "Periodic boundary conditions"), or walls that isolate a small region from the outside world (as with a [waveguide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide "Waveguide") or cavity [resonator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonator "Resonator")).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-32)

[Jefimenko's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefimenko%27s_equations "Jefimenko's equations") (or the closely related [Liénard–Wiechert potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard%E2%80%93Wiechert_potential "Liénard–Wiechert potential")) are the explicit solution to Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields created by any given distribution of charges and currents. It assumes specific initial conditions to obtain the so-called "retarded solution", where the only fields present are the ones created by the charges. However, Jefimenko's equations are unhelpful in situations when the charges and currents are themselves affected by the fields they create.

[Numerical methods for differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_partial_differential_equations "Numerical partial differential equations") can be used to compute approximate solutions of Maxwell's equations when exact solutions are impossible. These include the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method "Finite element method") and [finite-difference time-domain method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method "Finite-difference time-domain method").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Monk-25)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Hagstrom-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Kempel-33)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Friedman-34)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Taflove-35) For more details, see [Computational electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_electromagnetics "Computational electromagnetics").

Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations")]

Maxwell's equations _seem_[overdetermined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermined_system "Overdetermined system"), in that they involve six unknowns (the three components of **E** and **B**) but eight equations (one for each of the two Gauss's laws, three vector components each for Faraday's and Ampère's circuital laws). (The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to [charge conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conservation "Charge conservation").) This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampère's circuital law _automatically_ also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does, and assuming conservation of charge and the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-36)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-37) This explanation was first introduced by [Julius Adams Stratton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Adams_Stratton "Julius Adams Stratton") in 1941.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-38)

Although it is possible to simply ignore the two Gauss's laws in a numerical algorithm (apart from the initial conditions), the imperfect precision of the calculations can lead to ever-increasing violations of those laws. By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-39)

Both identities ![Image 113: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf {B} \equiv 0,\nabla \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf {E} \equiv 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1d782d8e80302a2c38ee83578c029cc76bf2137), which reduce eight equations to six independent ones, are the true reason of overdetermination.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-40)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-41)

Equivalently, the overdetermination can be viewed as implying conservation of electric and magnetic charge, as they are required in the derivation described above but implied by the two Gauss's laws.

For linear algebraic equations, one can make 'nice' rules to rewrite the equations and unknowns. The equations can be linearly dependent. But in differential equations, and especially partial differential equations (PDEs), one needs appropriate boundary conditions, which depend in not so obvious ways on the equations. Even more, if one rewrites them in terms of vector and scalar potential, then the equations are underdetermined because of [gauge fixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing "Gauge fixing").

Maxwell's equations as the classical limit of QED
-------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maxwell%27s_equations&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Maxwell's equations as the classical limit of QED")]

Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena. However, they do not account for quantum effects, and so their domain of applicability is limited. Maxwell's equations are thought of as the classical limit of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") (QED).

Some observed electromagnetic phenomena cannot be explained with Maxwell's equations if the source of the electromagnetic fields are the classical distributions of charge and current. These include [photon–photon scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon%E2%80%93photon_scattering "Photon–photon scattering") and many other phenomena related to [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") or [virtual photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle "Virtual particle"), "[nonclassical light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonclassical_light "Nonclassical light")" and [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement "Quantum entanglement") of electromagnetic fields (see _[Quantum optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_optics "Quantum optics")_). E.g. [quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography "Quantum cryptography") cannot be described by Maxwell theory, not even approximately. The approximate nature of Maxwell's equations becomes more and more apparent when going into the extremely strong field regime (see _[Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Heisenberg\_Lagrangian "Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian")_) or to extremely small distances.

Finally, Maxwell's equations cannot explain any phenomenon involving individual [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") interacting with quantum matter, such as the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect"), [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law"), the [Duane–Hunt law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane%E2%80%93Hunt_law "Duane–Hunt law"), and [single-photon light detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode "Single-photon avalanche diode"). However, many such phenomena may be explained using a halfway theory of quantum matter coupled to a classical electromagnetic field, either as external field or with the expected value of the charge current and density on the right hand side of Maxwell's equations. This is known as semiclassical theory or self-field QED and was initially discovered by de Broglie and Schrödinger and later fully developed by E.T. Jaynes and A.O. Barut.

Popular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well.

Maxwell's equations posit that there is [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), but no [magnetic charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_charge "Magnetic charge") (also called [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole")), in the universe. Indeed, magnetic charge has never been observed, despite extensive searches,[[note 7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-42) and may not exist. If they did exist, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would need to be modified, and the resulting four equations would be fully symmetric under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_note-Jackson-13): 273–275

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-1)**_Electric_ and _magnetic_ fields, according to the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), are the components of a single electromagnetic field.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-4)**In general relativity, however, they must enter, through its [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor"), into [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations") that include the spacetime curvature.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-6)**The absence of sinks/sources of the field does not imply that the field lines must be closed or escape to infinity. They can also wrap around indefinitely, without self-intersections. Moreover, around points where the field is zero (that cannot be intersected by field lines, because their direction would not be defined), there can be the simultaneous begin of some lines and end of other lines. This happens, for instance, in the middle between two identical cylindrical magnets, whose north poles face each other. In the middle between those magnets, the field is zero and the axial field lines coming from the magnets end. At the same time, an infinite number of divergent lines emanate radially from this point. The simultaneous presence of lines which end and begin around the point preserves the divergence-free character of the field. For a detailed discussion of non-closed field lines, see L.Zilberti ["The Misconception of Closed Magnetic Flux Lines"](https://zenodo.org/record/4518772#.YCJU_WhKjIU), IEEE Magnetics Letters, vol.8, art. 1306005, 2017.
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-9)**The quantity we would now call (_ε_ 0 _μ_ 0)−1/2, with units of velocity, was directly measured before Maxwell's equations, in an 1855 experiment by [Wilhelm Eduard Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber "Wilhelm Eduard Weber") and [Rudolf Kohlrausch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Kohlrausch "Rudolf Kohlrausch"). They charged a [leyden jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar "Leyden jar") (a kind of [capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor")), and measured the [electrostatic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") associated with the potential; then, they discharged it while measuring the [magnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law "Ampère's force law") from the current in the discharge wire. Their result was 3.107×10 8[m/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second "Metre per second"), remarkably close to the speed of light. See Joseph F. Keithley, [_The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s_, p.115](https://books.google.com/books?id=uwgNAtqSHuQC&pg=PA115).
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-16)**There are cases ([anomalous dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_dispersion "Anomalous dispersion")) where the phase velocity can exceed _c_, but the "signal velocity" will still be ≤ _c_
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-Effective_charge_18-0)**In some books—e.g., in U. Krey and A. Owen's Basic Theoretical Physics (Springer 2007)—the term _effective charge_ is used instead of _total charge_, while _free charge_ is simply called _charge_.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations#cite_ref-42)**See [magnetic monopole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole") for a discussion of monopole searches. Recently, scientists have discovered that some types of condensed matter, including [spin ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_ice "Spin ice") and [topological insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_insulator "Topological insulator"), display _emergent_ behavior resembling magnetic monopoles. (See [sciencemag.org](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1178868) and [nature.com](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7266/full/nature08500.html).) Although these were described in the popular press as the long-awaited discovery of magnetic monopoles, they are only superficially related. A "true" magnetic monopole is something where ∇ ⋅ **B** ≠ 0, whereas in these condensed-matter systems, ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0 while only ∇ ⋅ **H** ≠ 0.
