The ultraviolet catastrophe is the error at short wavelengths in the [Rayleigh–Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law") (depicted as "classical theory" in the graph) for the energy emitted by an ideal [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body"). The error, much more pronounced for short wavelengths, is the difference between the black curve (as classically predicted by the [Rayleigh–Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law")) and the blue curve (the measured curve, predicted by [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law")).

The **ultraviolet catastrophe**, also called the **Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe**, was the prediction of late 19th century and early 20th century [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") that an ideal [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body") at [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium") would emit an [unbounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") quantity of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") as wavelength decreased into the [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") range.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-V%C3%A1zquezHanslmeier2005-1): 6–7  The term "ultraviolet catastrophe" was first used in 1911 by the Austrian physicist [Paul Ehrenfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrenfest "Paul Ehrenfest"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-Ehrenfest_1911-2) but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the [Rayleigh–Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law").

The phrase refers to the fact that the empirically derived Rayleigh–Jeans law, which accurately predicted experimental results at large wavelengths, failed to do so for short wavelengths. (See the image for further elaboration.) As the theory diverged from empirical observations when these frequencies reached the ultraviolet region of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"), there was a problem.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-3) This problem was later found to be due to a property of quanta as proposed by [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck"): There could be no fraction of a discrete energy package already carrying minimal energy.

Since the first use of this term, it has also been used for other predictions of a similar nature, as in [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") and such cases as [ultraviolet divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_divergence "Ultraviolet divergence").

The Rayleigh-Jeans law is an approximation to the [spectral radiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radiance "Spectral radiance") of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") as a function of [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") from a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body") at a given temperature through classical arguments. For wavelength ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a), it is: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle B_{\lambda }(T)={\frac {2ck_{\mathrm {B} }T}{\lambda ^{4}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7dc993a3acca6ed47967eba5dda7f453c5da383) where ![Image 4: {\displaystyle B_{\lambda }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6d2c1f5a1b52c7c2796c6dc4386c7f96a3d53b4) is the [spectral radiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radiance "Spectral radiance"), the [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)#Radiant_power "Power (physics)") emitted per unit emitting area, per [steradian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian "Steradian"), per unit wavelength; ![Image 5: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455) is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"); ![Image 6: {\displaystyle k_{\mathrm {B} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9b90d21a1c8fb907fddab1caded3b7f1eeffe3d) is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"); and ![Image 7: {\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) is the [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") in [kelvins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"). For [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency")![Image 8: {\displaystyle \nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468), the expression is instead ![Image 9: {\displaystyle B_{\nu }(T)={\frac {2\nu ^{2}k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{c^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0116a85c7782cbc5c50d5d2a98a2b7e547be486f)

This formula is obtained from the [equipartition theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem "Equipartition theorem") of classical [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") which states that all [harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator") modes (degrees of freedom) of a system at equilibrium have an average energy of ![Image 10: {\displaystyle k_{\rm {B}}T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81730a1844016dda66a50d36d65a9ffe418d8ac5).

The "ultraviolet catastrophe" is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies; it predicts infinite energy emission because ![Image 11: {\displaystyle B_{\nu }(T)\to \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77abb92bd0d99c383d3c57f664fe0b9a43ecbb8d) as ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \nu \to \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d04eba19142240196ddff3ad6027b18925e86298).

An example, from Mason's _A History of the Sciences_,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-4) illustrates multi-mode vibration via a piece of string. As a [natural vibrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave "Standing wave"), the string will oscillate with [specific modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone#Explanation "Overtone") (the standing waves of a string in harmonic resonance), dependent on the length of the string. In classical physics, a radiator of energy will act as a natural vibrator. Since each mode will have the same energy, most of the energy in a natural vibrator will be in the smaller wavelengths and higher frequencies, where most of the modes are.

According to classical electromagnetism, the number of electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity, per unit frequency, is proportional to the square of the frequency. This implies that the radiated power per unit frequency should be proportional to frequency squared. Thus, both the power at a given frequency and the total radiated power is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered: this is unphysical, as the total radiated power of a cavity is not observed to be infinite, a point that was made independently by [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), [Lord Rayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Rayleigh "Lord Rayleigh"), and Sir [James Jeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jeans "James Jeans") in 1905.

In 1900, Max Planck derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some assumptions that were strange for the time. In particular, Planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can be emitted or absorbed only in discrete packets, called _[quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum")_, of energy: ![Image 13: {\displaystyle E_{\text{quanta}}=h\nu =h{\frac {c}{\lambda }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/497dcd1c34d321ae3c86ccfc9ca2968ba1dc9770) where:

*   h is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"),
*   ν is the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of light,
*   c is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"),
*   λ is the [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") of light.

By applying this new energy to the partition function in statistical [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law#Derivations "Planck's law"), Planck's assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral distribution functions: ![Image 14: {\displaystyle B_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={\frac {2hc^{2}}{\lambda ^{5}}}{\frac {1}{\exp \left({\frac {hc}{\lambda k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}\right)-1}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85c22705cfa969b29a244e7eec52c07429a18e21) where:

*   T is the [absolute temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_temperature "Absolute temperature") of the body,
*   _k_ B is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"),
*   exp denotes the [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function").

In 1905, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") solved the problem physically by postulating that Planck's quanta were real physical particles – what we now call [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), not just a mathematical fiction. They modified [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") in the style of [Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann "Boltzmann") to an ensemble of photons. Einstein's photon had an energy proportional to its frequency and also explained an unpublished law of Stokes and the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-5) This published postulate was specifically cited by the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") committee in their decision to award the [prize for 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics "List of Nobel laureates in Physics") to Einstein.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe#cite_note-Nobel-6)
