[ 1 ] However, the name is usually used to refer to the tetraoxidomanganate(2−) anion, MnO 2− 4 , also known as manganate(VI) because it contains manganese in the +6 oxidation state .

[ 1 ] Manganates are the only known manganese(VI) compounds.

[ 2 ] Other manganates include hypomanganate or manganate(V), MnO 3− 4 , permanganate or manganate(VII), MnO − 4 , and the dimanganate or dimanganate(III) Mn 2 O 6− 6 .

A manganate(IV) anion MnO 4− 4 has been prepared by radiolysis of dilute solutions of permanganate .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is mononuclear in dilute solution, and shows a strong absorption in the ultraviolet and a weaker absorption at 650 nm.

[ 3 ] Structure [ edit ] Solution containing the manganate(VI) ion The manganate(VI) ion is tetrahedral, similar to sulfate or chromate: indeed, manganates are often isostructural with sulfates and chromates, a fact first noted by Eilhard Mitscherlich in 1831.

[ 5 ] The manganese – oxygen distance is 165.9 pm, about 3 pm longer than in permanganate .

[ 5 ] As a d 1 ion, it is paramagnetic , but any Jahn–Teller distortion is too small to be detected by X-ray crystallography .

[ 5 ] Manganates are dark green in colour, with a visible absorption maximum of λ max = 606 nm ( ε = 1710 dm 3 mol −1 cm −1 ).

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The Raman spectrum has also been reported.

[ 8 ] Preparation [ edit ] Sodium and potassium manganates are usually prepared in the laboratory by stirring the equivalent permanganate in a concentrated solution (5–10 M) of the hydroxide for 24 hours [ 6 ] or with heating.

[ 9 ] 4 MnO − 4 + 4 OH − → 4 MnO 2− 4 + 2 H 2 O + O 2 Potassium manganate is prepared industrially, as an intermediate to potassium permanganate , by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten potassium hydroxide with potassium nitrate or air as the oxidizing agent .

[ 2 ] 2 MnO 2 + 4 OH − + O 2 → 2 MnO 2− 4 + 2 H 2 O Disproportionation [ edit ] Manganates are unstable towards disproportionation in all but the most alkaline of aqueous solutions .

[ 2 ] The ultimate products are permanganate and manganese dioxide , but the kinetics are complex and the mechanism may involve protonated and/or manganese(V) species.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Uses [ edit ] Manganates, particularly the insoluble barium manganate , BaMnO 4 , have been used as oxidizing agents in organic synthesis : they will oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids , and secondary alcohols to ketones .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Barium manganate has also been used to oxidize hydrazones to diazo compounds .

[ 14 ] Related compounds [ edit ] Manganate is formally the conjugate base of hypothetical manganic acid H 2 MnO 4 , which cannot be formed because of its rapid disproportionation. However, its second acid dissociation constant has been estimated by pulse radiolysis techniques: [ 3 ] HMnO − 4 ⇌ MnO 2− 4 + H + p K a = 7.4 ± 0.1 Manganites [ edit ] The name " manganite " is used for compounds formerly believed to contain the anion MnO 3− 3 , with manganese in the +3 oxidation state. However, most of these "manganites" do not contain discrete oxyanions , but are mixed oxides with perovskite (LaMn III O 3 , CaMn IV O 3 ), spinel (LiMn III,IV 2 O 4 ) or sodium chloride (LiMn III O 2 , NaMn III O 2 ) structures.

One exception is potassium dimanganate(III) , K 6 Mn 2 O 6 , which contains discrete Mn 2 O 6− 6 anions.
