**Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann** (;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-1)German:[[ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈbɛʁnhaʁt ˈʁiːman]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German")[](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/f/fb/Georgfriedrichbernhardriemann.ogg/Georgfriedrichbernhardriemann.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Georgfriedrichbernhardriemann.ogg "File:Georgfriedrichbernhardriemann.ogg");[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-3) 17 September 1826– 20 July 1866) was a German [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") who made profound contributions to [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). In the field of [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"), he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the [Riemann integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral "Riemann integral"), and his work on [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series"). His contributions to [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis") include most notably the introduction of [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. His [1859 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Number_of_Primes_Less_Than_a_Given_Magnitude "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude") on the [prime-counting function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function "Prime-counting function"), containing the original statement of the [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis"), is regarded as a foundational paper of [analytic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory "Analytic number theory"). Through his pioneering [contributions to differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_Geometry "Riemannian Geometry"), Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-4) He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-6)

Riemann was born on 17 September 1826 in [Breselenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breselenz "Breselenz"), a village near [Dannenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dannenberg_(Elbe) "Dannenberg (Elbe)") in the [Kingdom of Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover "Kingdom of Hanover"). His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, was a poor [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism") pastor in Breselenz who fought in the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"). His mother, Charlotte Ebell, died in 1846. Riemann was the second of six children. Riemann exhibited exceptional mathematical talent, such as calculation abilities, from an early age but suffered from timidity and a fear of speaking in public, and had frail health.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-7)

During 1840, Riemann went to [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") to live with his grandmother and attend [lyceum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum "Lyceum") (middle school years), because such a type of school was not accessible from his home village. After the death of his grandmother in 1842, he transferred to the [Johanneum Lüneburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanneum_L%C3%BCneburg "de:Johanneum Lüneburg"), a high school in [Lüneburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg "Lüneburg"). There, Riemann studied the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible") intensively, but he was often distracted by mathematics. His teachers were amazed by his ability to perform complicated mathematical operations, in which he often outstripped his instructor's knowledge. In 1846, at the age of 19, he started studying [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology") and [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology "Christian theology") in order to become a pastor and help with his family's finances.

During the spring of 1846, his father, after gathering enough money, sent Riemann to the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen"), where he planned to study towards a degree in [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"). However, once there, he began studying [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") under [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") (specifically his lectures on the [method of least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_least_squares "Method of least squares")). Gauss recommended that Riemann give up his theological work and enter the mathematical field; after getting his father's approval, Riemann transferred to the [University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Berlin "University of Berlin") in 1847.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-Hawking2005-8) During his time of study, [Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi "Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi"), [Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet "Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet"), [Jakob Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Steiner "Jakob Steiner"), and [Gotthold Eisenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Eisenstein "Gotthold Eisenstein") were teaching. He stayed in Berlin for two years and returned to Göttingen in 1849.

Riemann held his first lectures in 1854, which founded the field of [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") and thereby set the stage for [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-:0-9) In 1857, there was an attempt to promote Riemann to extraordinary professor status at the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen"). Although this attempt failed, it did result in Riemann finally being granted a regular salary. In 1859, following the death of Dirichlet (who held [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss "Gauss")'s chair at the University of Göttingen), he was promoted to head the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen. He was also the first to suggest using [dimensions higher than merely three or four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_dimensions "Higher dimensions") in order to describe physical reality.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-10)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-:0-9)

In 1862 he married Elise Koch; they had a daughter.

Riemann's tombstone in [Biganzolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biganzolo "Biganzolo") in [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont "Piedmont"), Italy

Riemann fled Göttingen when the armies of [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover "Hanover") and [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia") clashed there in 1866.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-duSautoy2003-11) He died of [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis "Tuberculosis") during his third journey to Italy in Selasca (now a hamlet of [Verbania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbania "Verbania") on [Lake Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maggiore "Lake Maggiore")), where he was buried in the cemetery in Biganzolo (Verbania).

Riemann was a dedicated Christian, the son of a Protestant minister, and saw his life as a mathematician as another way to serve God. During his life, he held closely to his Christian faith and considered it to be the most important aspect of his life. At the time of his death, he was reciting the [Lord's Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer "Lord's Prayer") with his wife and died before they finished saying the prayer.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-12) Meanwhile, in Göttingen his housekeeper discarded some of the papers in his office, including much unpublished work. Riemann refused to publish incomplete work, and some deep insights may have been lost.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-duSautoy2003-11)

Riemannian geometry
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernhard_Riemann&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Riemannian geometry")]

Riemann's published works opened up research areas combining analysis with geometry. These would subsequently become major parts of the theories of [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), and [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") theory. The theory of [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface") was elaborated by [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") and particularly [Adolf Hurwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hurwitz "Adolf Hurwitz"). This area of mathematics is part of the foundation of [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and is still being applied in novel ways to [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics").

In 1853, [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") asked Riemann, his student, to prepare a _[Habilitationsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitationsschrift "Habilitationsschrift")_ on the foundations of geometry. Over many months, Riemann developed his theory of [higher dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_dimensions "Higher dimensions") and delivered his lecture at Göttingen on 10 June 1854, entitled _Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-15) It was not published until twelve years later in 1868 by Dedekind, two years after his death. Its early reception appears to have been slow, but it is now recognized as one of the most important works in geometry.

The subject founded by this work is [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"). Riemann found the correct way to extend into _n_ dimensions the [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") of surfaces, which Gauss himself proved in his _[theorema egregium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema\_egregium "Theorema egregium")_. The fundamental objects are called the [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") and the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"). For the surface (two-dimensional) case, the curvature at each point can be reduced to a number (scalar), with the surfaces of constant positive or negative curvature being models of the [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry").

The Riemann metric is a collection of numbers at every point in space (i.e., a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor")) which allows measurements of speed in any trajectory, whose integral gives the distance between the trajectory's endpoints. For example, Riemann found that in four spatial dimensions, one needs ten numbers at each point to describe distances and curvatures on a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), no matter how distorted it is.

In his dissertation, he established a geometric foundation for [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis") through [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), through which multi-valued functions like the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") (with infinitely many sheets) or the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") (with two sheets) could become [one-to-one functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_function "One-to-one function"). Complex functions are [harmonic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_functions "Harmonic functions")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] (that is, they satisfy [Laplace's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation "Laplace's equation") and thus the [Cauchy–Riemann equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann_equations "Cauchy–Riemann equations")) on these surfaces and are described by the location of their singularities and the topology of the surfaces. The topological "genus" of the Riemann surfaces is given by ![Image 4: {\displaystyle g=w/2-n+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4428b3c9ec1f796a287308156be304db1bc2ec60), where the surface has ![Image 5: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) leaves coming together at ![Image 6: {\displaystyle w}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6) branch points. For ![Image 7: {\displaystyle g>1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff3aa256fb29a830d501693b50832d0e09f65557) the Riemann surface has ![Image 8: {\displaystyle (3g-3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17fbcba839c967e2e280e1ce29f4901ffca77764) parameters (the "[moduli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_of_algebraic_curves "Moduli of algebraic curves")").

His contributions to this area are numerous. The famous [Riemann mapping theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_mapping_theorem "Riemann mapping theorem") says that a simply connected domain in the complex plane is "biholomorphically equivalent" (i.e. there is a bijection between them that is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse) to either ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) or to the interior of the unit circle. The generalization of the theorem to Riemann surfaces is the famous [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem"), which was proved in the 19th century by [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein"). Here, too, rigorous proofs were first given after the development of richer mathematical tools (in this case, topology). For the proof of the existence of functions on Riemann surfaces, he used a minimality condition, which he called the [Dirichlet principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_principle "Dirichlet principle"). [Karl Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass "Karl Weierstrass") found a gap in the proof: Riemann had not noticed that his working assumption (that the minimum existed) might not work; the function space might not be complete, and therefore the existence of a minimum was not guaranteed. Through the work of [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") in the Calculus of Variations, the Dirichlet principle was finally established. Otherwise, Weierstrass was very impressed with Riemann, especially with his theory of [abelian functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_function "Abelian function"). When Riemann's work appeared, Weierstrass withdrew his paper from _[Crelle's Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crelle%27s\_Journal "Crelle's Journal")_ and did not publish it. They had a good understanding when Riemann visited him in Berlin in 1859. Weierstrass encouraged his student [Hermann Amandus Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Amandus_Schwarz "Hermann Amandus Schwarz") to find alternatives to the Dirichlet principle in complex analysis, in which he was successful. An anecdote from [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld")[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-16) shows the difficulties which contemporary mathematicians had with Riemann's new ideas. In 1870, Weierstrass had taken Riemann's dissertation with him on a holiday to Rigi and complained that it was hard to understand. The physicist [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz") assisted him in the work overnight and returned with the comment that it was "natural" and "very understandable".

Other highlights include his work on abelian functions and [theta functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_functions "Theta functions") on Riemann surfaces. Riemann had been in a competition with Weierstrass since 1857 to solve the Jacobian inverse problems for abelian integrals, a generalization of [elliptic integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integrals "Elliptic integrals"). Riemann used theta functions in several variables and reduced the problem to the determination of the zeros of these theta functions. Riemann also investigated period matrices and characterized them through the "Riemannian period relations" (symmetric, real part negative). By [Ferdinand Georg Frobenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Georg_Frobenius "Ferdinand Georg Frobenius") and [Solomon Lefschetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Lefschetz "Solomon Lefschetz") the validity of this relation is equivalent with the embedding of ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}/\Omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a9a930759fcb2a93fe8355db46ef3284ef704e9) (where ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \Omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f) is the lattice of the period matrix) in a projective space by means of theta functions. For certain values of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b), this is the [Jacobian variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_variety "Jacobian variety") of the Riemann surface, an example of an abelian manifold.

Many mathematicians such as [Alfred Clebsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Clebsch "Alfred Clebsch") furthered Riemann's work on algebraic curves. These theories depended on the properties of a function defined on Riemann surfaces. For example, the [Riemann–Roch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Roch_theorem "Riemann–Roch theorem") (Roch was a student of Riemann) says something about the number of linearly independent differentials (with known conditions on the zeros and poles) of a Riemann surface.

According to [Detlef Laugwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detlef_Laugwitz "Detlef Laugwitz"),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann#cite_note-17)[automorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphic_function "Automorphic function") appeared for the first time in an essay about the Laplace equation on electrically charged cylinders. Riemann however used such functions for conformal maps (such as mapping topological triangles to the circle) in his 1859 lecture on hypergeometric functions or in his treatise on [minimal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface "Minimal surface").

In the field of [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"), he discovered the [Riemann integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral "Riemann integral") in his [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation "Habilitation"). Among other things, he showed that every piecewise continuous function is integrable. Similarly, the [Stieltjes integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_integral "Stieltjes integral") goes back to the Göttinger mathematician, and so they are named together the [Riemann–Stieltjes integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integral "Riemann–Stieltjes integral").

In his habilitation work on [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series"), where he followed the work of his teacher Dirichlet, he showed that Riemann-integrable functions are "representable" by Fourier series. Dirichlet has shown this for continuous, piecewise-differentiable functions (thus with countably many non-differentiable points). Riemann gave an example of a Fourier series representing a continuous, almost nowhere-differentiable function, a case not covered by Dirichlet. He also proved the [Riemann–Lebesgue lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Lebesgue_lemma "Riemann–Lebesgue lemma"): if a function is representable by a Fourier series, then the Fourier coefficients go to zero for large _n_.

Riemann's essay was also the starting point for [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor")'s work with Fourier series, which was the impetus for [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory").

He also worked with [hypergeometric differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_differential_equations "Hypergeometric differential equations") in 1857 using complex analytical methods and presented the solutions through the behaviour of closed paths about singularities (described by the [monodromy matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monodromy_matrix "Monodromy matrix")). The proof of the existence of such differential equations by previously known monodromy matrices is one of the Hilbert problems.

Riemann made some famous contributions to modern [analytic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory "Analytic number theory"). In [a single short paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Number_of_Primes_Less_Than_a_Given_Magnitude "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude"), the only one he published on the subject of number theory, he investigated the [zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function "Riemann zeta function") that now bears his name, establishing its importance for understanding the distribution of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number"). The [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis") was one of a series of conjectures he made about the function's properties.

In Riemann's work, there are many more interesting developments. He proved the functional equation for the zeta function (already known to [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler")), behind which a theta function lies. Through the summation of this approximation function over the non-trivial zeros on the line with real portion 1/2, he gave an exact, "explicit formula" for ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \pi (x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a62d9bf7b2ba03b30a95e7059362cc4b3865123).

Riemann knew of [Pafnuty Chebyshev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pafnuty_Chebyshev "Pafnuty Chebyshev")'s work on the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem "Prime number theorem"). He had visited Dirichlet in 1852.
