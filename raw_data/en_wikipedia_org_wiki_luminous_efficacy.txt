It is the ratio of luminous flux to power , measured in lumens per watt in the International System of Units (SI). Depending on context, the power can be either the radiant flux of the source's output, or it can be the total power (electric power, chemical energy, or others) consumed by the source.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Which sense of the term is intended must usually be inferred from the context, and is sometimes unclear. The former sense is sometimes called luminous efficacy of radiation , [ 4 ] and the latter luminous efficacy of a light source [ 5 ] or overall luminous efficacy .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Not all wavelengths of light are equally visible, or equally effective at stimulating human vision, due to the spectral sensitivity of the human eye ; radiation in the infrared and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum is useless for illumination. The luminous efficacy of a source is the product of how well it converts energy to electromagnetic radiation, and how well the emitted radiation is detected by the human eye.

Efficacy and efficiency [ edit ] Luminous efficacy can be normalized by the maximum possible luminous efficacy to a dimensionless quantity called luminous efficiency . The distinction between efficacy and efficiency is not always carefully maintained in published sources, so it is not uncommon to see "efficiencies" expressed in lumens per watt, or "efficacies" expressed as a percentage.

Luminous efficacy of radiation [ edit ] By definition, light outside the visible spectrum cannot be seen by the standard human vision system , and therefore does not contribute to, and indeed can subtract from, luminous efficacy.

Explanation [ edit ] The typical response of human vision to light under daytime or bright conditions, as standardized by the CIE in 1924. The horizontal axis is wavelength in nanometers.

[ 8 ] Luminous efficacy of radiation measures the fraction of electromagnetic power which is useful for lighting. It is obtained by dividing the luminous flux by the radiant flux .

[ 4 ] Light wavelengths outside the visible spectrum reduce luminous efficacy, because they contribute to the radiant flux, while the luminous flux of such light is zero. Wavelengths near the peak of the eye's response contribute more strongly than those near the edges.

Wavelengths of light outside of the visible spectrum are not useful for general illumination [ note 1 ] . Furthermore, human vision responds more to some wavelengths of light than others. This response of the eye is represented by the luminous efficiency function . This is a standardized function representing photopic vision , which models the response of the eye's cone cells , that are active under typical daylight conditions. A separate curve can be defined for dark/night conditions, modeling the response of rod cells without cones, known as scotopic vision . ( Mesopic vision describes the transition zone in dim conditions, between photopic and scotopic, where both cones and rods are active.) Photopic luminous efficacy of radiation has a maximum possible value of 683.002 lm/W , for the case of monochromatic light at a wavelength of 555 nm .

[ note 2 ] Scotopic luminous efficacy of radiation reaches a maximum of 1700 lm/W for monochromatic light at a wavelength of 507 nm .

[ note 3 ] Mathematical definition [ edit ] Luminous efficacy (of radiation) , denoted K , is defined as [ 4 ] K = Φ Φ v Φ Φ e = ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ K ( λ λ ) Φ Φ e , λ λ d λ λ ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ Φ Φ e , λ λ d λ λ , {\displaystyle K={\frac {\Phi _{\mathrm {v} }}{\Phi _{\mathrm {e} }}}={\frac {\int _{0}^{\infty }K(\lambda )\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\lambda }\,\mathrm {d} \lambda }{\int _{0}^{\infty }\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\lambda }\,\mathrm {d} \lambda }},} where Φ v is the luminous flux ; Φ e is the radiant flux ; Φ e,λ is the spectral radiant flux ; K ( λ ) = K m V ( λ ) is the spectral luminous efficacy .

Energy outside the visible wavelength range (~380–750 nm, shown by grey dotted lines) reduces the luminous efficiency.

Lighting efficiency [ edit ] Main article: Wall-plug efficiency Artificial light sources are usually evaluated in terms of luminous efficacy of the source, also sometimes called wall-plug efficacy . This is the ratio between the total luminous flux emitted by a device and the total amount of input power (electrical, etc.) it consumes. The luminous efficacy of the source is a measure of the efficiency of the device with the output adjusted to account for the spectral response curve (the luminosity function). When expressed in dimensionless form (for example, as a fraction of the maximum possible luminous efficacy), this value may be called luminous efficiency of a source , overall luminous efficiency or lighting efficiency .

The main difference between the luminous efficacy of radiation and the luminous efficacy of a source is that the latter accounts for input energy that is lost as heat or otherwise exits the source as something other than electromagnetic radiation. Luminous efficacy of radiation is a property of the radiation emitted by a source. Luminous efficacy of a source is a property of the source as a whole.

Examples [ edit ] The following table lists luminous efficacy of a source and efficiency for various light sources. Note that all lamps requiring electrical/electronic ballast are unless noted (see also voltage) listed without losses for that, reducing total efficiency.

Klipstein, "An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6300 °C (6600 K or 11,500 °F). Even at this high temperature, a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet, and the theoretical luminous [efficacy] is 95 lumens per watt. No substance is solid and usable as a light bulb filament at temperatures anywhere close to this. The surface of the sun is not quite that hot." [ 22 ] At temperatures where the tungsten filament of an ordinary light bulb remains solid (below 3683 kelvin), most of its emission is in the infrared .

One example is Ultraviolet light which is not itself visible, but can excite some pigments to fluoresce, where the pigments re-emit the light into the visible range. Such special cases are not a contributing part of luminous efficacy calculations.

^ Under standard photopic vision 507 nm is perceived as a blue-green hue similar to viridian , however scotopic rod-only vision does not create a color sensation in the standard human vision system.

If the lamp emits all radiation at 555 nm (where V λ = 1), the luminous efficacy will be of about 680 lm W −1 , the theoretical maximum value. The lamp efficacy will be 26 and 73 lm W −1 , when the whole light is emitted at 450 and 650 nm respectively. The luminous coefficient is luminous efficiency expressed as a value between zero and one, with one corresponding to an efficacy of 683 lm W −1 .
