Kungkari Kuungkari of Barcoo River Native to Australia Extinct (date missing) Language family Pama–Nyungan (unclassified, possibly Karnic ) Kungkari Language codes ISO 639-3 lku Glottolog kuun1236 AIATSIS [ 1 ] L38 ELP Kungkari Kungkari (also Gunggari , Koonkerri , Kuungkari ) is an extinct and unclassified Australian Aboriginal language .

[ 1 ] The Kungkari language region included the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Longreach Shire Council and Blackall-Tambo Shire Council.

[ 2 ] Classification [ edit ] Geographically it lay near the Barcoo River between the Karnic and Maric languages, but had no obvious connection to either; the data is too poor to draw any conclusions on classification.

Bowern (2001) mentions Kungkari as a possible Karnic language.

[ 3 ] : 247 Wafer and Lissarrague (2008) [ 4 ] : 324 report that a description of Kungkari by Breen (1990) [ 5 ] : 22–64 is of Kungkari, not the similarly-named Gunggari , which was Maric.

[ 3 ] Phonology [ edit ] Consonants [ edit ] Peripheral Laminal Apical Labial Velar Dental Palatal Alveolar Retroflex Plosive p k t̪ c t ʈ Nasal m ŋ n̪ ɲ n ɳ Rhotic r Lateral (l̪) ʎ l ɭ Approximant w j ɻ The dental lateral [l̪] mainly occurs as an allophone of /l/ within the consonant cluster /lt̪/.

/t/ may be realized as a voiced stop [d] when after /n/, or as a voiced tap [ɾ] in intervocalic positions.

Vowels [ edit ] Front Central Back High i iː u (uː) Low a aː The long [uː] only rarely occurs.
