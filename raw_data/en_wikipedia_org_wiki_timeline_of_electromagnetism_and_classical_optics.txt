He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(lignite) "Jet (lignite)"), glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [beryl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl "Beryl"), diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [terrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrella "Terrella") (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-9) He considered that gravity was a magnetic force and noted that this mutual force increased with the size or amount of lodestone and attracted iron objects. He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation") due varying properties of the [magnetic compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_compass "Magnetic compass") with respect to their location on the earth, such as [magnetic declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination "Magnetic declination") and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [dipping of the needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_circle "Dip circle") by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [Shen Kuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo "Shen Kuo") in his _Meng Xi Bi Tan_ and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [compass maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compasssmith&action=edit&redlink=1 "Compasssmith (page does not exist)")[Robert Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Norman "Robert Norman"), as described in his pamphlet, _The Newe Attractive_. The gilbert, a unit of [magnetomotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetomotive_force "Magnetomotive force") or [magnetic scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_scalar_potential "Magnetic scalar potential"), was named in his honor.

*   1705 – [Francis Hauksbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hauksbee_(scientist) "Francis Hauksbee (scientist)") improves von Guericke's [electrostatic generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_generator "Electrostatic generator") by using a glass globe and generates the first sparks by approaching his finger to the rubbed globe.
*   1728 – [James Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley "James Bradley") discovers the [aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light "Aberration of light") of starlight and uses it to determine that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") is about 283,000 km/[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")
*   1729 – [Stephen Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gray_(scientist) "Stephen Gray (scientist)") and the Reverend [Granville Wheler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granville_Wheler "Granville Wheler") experiment to discover that electrical "virtue", produced by rubbing a glass tube, could be transmitted over an extended distance (nearly 900 ft (about 270 m)) through thin iron wire using silk threads as insulators, to deflect leaves of brass. This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-Clark-11)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [John Desaguliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Theophilus_Desaguliers "John Theophilus Desaguliers"), mathematician and [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age".)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-Clark-11)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Georges-Louis LeSage built a [static electricity telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph "Electrical telegraph") in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
*   1732 – [C. F. du Fay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._du_Fay "C. F. du Fay") Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
*   1734 – [Charles François de Cisternay DuFay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._du_Fay "C. F. du Fay") (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society_, describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous", produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [gum-lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_(resin) "Lac (resin)") with silk or paper, and "vitreous", by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena". The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [William Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Watson_(scientist) "William Watson (scientist)") and Benjamin Franklin.
*   1737 – [C. F. du Fay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._du_Fay "C. F. du Fay") and [Francis Hauksbee the younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hauksbee_the_younger "Francis Hauksbee the younger")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
*   1740 – [Jean le Rond d'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert "Jean le Rond d'Alembert"), in _Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides_, explains the process of [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction").
*   1745 – [Pieter van Musschenbroek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_van_Musschenbroek "Pieter van Musschenbroek") of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [Leyden (Leiden) jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar "Leyden jar"), a primitive [capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor") or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian _condensatore_), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
*   1745 – [Ewald Georg von Kleist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_Georg_von_Kleist "Ewald Georg von Kleist") of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [dielectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric "Dielectric")) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [Daniel Gralath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gralath "Daniel Gralath") improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
*   1746 – [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
*   1747 – [William Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Watson_(scientist) "William Watson (scientist)"), while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage")).
*   1752 – [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin") establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [luminiferous ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_ether#The_history_of_light_and_aether "Luminiferous ether"), which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [wave theory of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_theory_of_light "Wave theory of light")) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [electric spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_spark "Electric spark") and a lightning flash produced light and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
*   1753 – C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen) proposes in 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.
*   1767 – [Joseph Priestley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley "Joseph Priestley") proposes an electrical inverse-square law
*   1774 – [Georges-Louis LeSage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_LeSage "Georges-Louis LeSage") builds an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires conducting Leyden-jar charges to pith-ball electroscopes, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. Its range was only between rooms of his home.
*   1784 – [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish") defines the [inductive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") of [dielectrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrics "Dielectrics") (insulators) and measures the specific inductive capacity of various substances by comparison with an air condenser.
*   1785 – [Charles Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb "Charles-Augustin de Coulomb") introduces the [inverse-square law of electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law")
*   1786 – [Luigi Galvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani "Luigi Galvani") discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
*   1791 – [Luigi Galvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani "Luigi Galvani") discovers galvanic electricity and [bioelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectricity "Bioelectricity") through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [galvanic battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-12)
*   1799 – [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "Alessandro Volta"), following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [voltaic cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile "Voltaic pile") producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In **1800** he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [electric battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery "Electric battery"), by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries", regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars.

*   1818 – [François Jean Dominique Arago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Jean_Dominique_Arago "François Jean Dominique Arago") verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago bright spot
*   1820 – [Hans Christian Ørsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted"), Danish physicist and chemist, develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [magnetic north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination "Magnetic declination") when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-16) Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [oersted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oersted "Oersted") unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
*   1820 – [André-Marie Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère"), professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique, demonstrates that parallel current-carrying wires experience magnetic force in a meeting of the [French Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences "French Academy of Sciences"), exactly one week after Ørsted's announcement of his discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-17) He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [Ampère's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law "Ampère's force law") describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [galvanometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer "Galvanometer"). In **1821**, he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in **1824**, [Peter Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Barlow_(mathematician) "Peter Barlow (mathematician)") reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In **1826** he publishes the _Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience_ containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
*   1820 – [Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Salomo_Christoph_Schweigger "Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger"), German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
*   1821 – [André-Marie Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère") announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
*   1821 – [Thomas Johann Seebeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johann_Seebeck "Thomas Johann Seebeck") discovers the [thermoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect "Thermoelectric effect").
*   1821 – [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel") derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is _entirely_ transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
*   1825 – [Augustin Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Fresnel "Augustin Fresnel") phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
*   1825 – [William Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sturgeon "William Sturgeon"), founder of the first English Electric Journal, _Annals of Electricity_, found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet "Electromagnet") utilizing a [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [Dominique François Jean Arago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Arago "François Arago") finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
*   1826 – [Georg Simon Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simon_Ohm "Georg Simon Ohm") states his [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law") of [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet _Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet_ in **1827**. The unit [ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm_(unit) "Ohm (unit)") (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics#cite_note-18)
*   1829 & 1830 – [Francesco Zantedeschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Zantedeschi "Francesco Zantedeschi") publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
*   1831 – [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction"), though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [electric dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo "Dynamo"), the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, mathematically modeled by [Faraday's law of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction"), would subsequently become one of [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"). These consequently evolved into the generalization of [field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)").
*   1831 – [Macedonio Melloni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonio_Melloni "Macedonio Melloni") uses a [thermopile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopile "Thermopile") to detect infrared radiation
*   1832 – [Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Schilling "Pavel Schilling") (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") and [Wilhelm Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber "Wilhelm Eduard Weber") constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
*   1833 – [Heinrich Lenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Lenz "Heinrich Lenz") states [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law "Lenz's law"): if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [electromotive force (EMF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force"), the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy"). If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [Faraday's law of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction") by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [Joule's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%27s_first_law "Joule's first law") in **1842**; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule–Lenz law".
*   1833 – [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") announces his law of [electrochemical equivalents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_equivalent "Electrochemical equivalent")
*   1834 – [Heinrich Lenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Lenz "Heinrich Lenz") determines the direction of the induced [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force") (emf) and [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") resulting from [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction"). [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law "Lenz's law") provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [Faraday's law of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction") (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
*   1834 – [Jean-Charles Peltier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Charles_Peltier "Jean-Charles Peltier") discovers the [Peltier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltier_effect "Peltier effect"): heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
*   1835 – [Joseph Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry "Joseph Henry") invents the [electric relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay "Relay"), which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [self inductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_inductance "Self inductance") independently of Michael Faraday.

*   1837 – [Samuel Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse "Samuel Morse") develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [Alfred Vail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Vail "Alfred Vail") develop the [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code "Morse code") signaling alphabet. In **1838** Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [Morristown, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morristown,_New_Jersey "Morristown, New Jersey"), and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [Franklin Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Institute "Franklin Institute") in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, **1844** from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[What hath God wrought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers")?"

*   1840 – [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule") formulates [Joule's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%27s_first_law "Joule's first law") (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
*   1845 – [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") ([Faraday effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect "Faraday effect"))
*   1849 – [Hippolyte Fizeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Fizeau "Hippolyte Fizeau") and [Jean-Bernard Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bernard_Foucault "Jean-Bernard Foucault") measure the speed of light to be about 298,000 km/s

*   1855 – [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") submits _On Faraday's Lines of Force_ for publication containing a [mathematical statement](https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers01maxw#page/202/mode/2up) of [Ampère's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law "Ampère's circuital law") relating the curl of a magnetic field to the electrical current at a point.

*   1865 – [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") publishes his landmark paper [A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field"), in which [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") demonstrated that electric and [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism") forces are two complementary aspects of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0×10 8 m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310 740 000 m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [radiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."
*   1866 – the first successful **transatlantic telegraph system** was completed. Earlier submarine cable transatlantic cables installed in 1857 and 1858 failed after operating for a few days or weeks.

In **1879** he produces a high-resistance lamp in a very high vacuum; the lamp lasts hundreds of hours. While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.

*   1888 – [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz "Heinrich Rudolf Hertz") demonstrates the existence of electromagnetic waves by building an apparatus that produced and detected UHF radio waves (or microwaves in the UHF region). He also found that radio waves could be transmitted through different types of materials and were reflected by others, the key to [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"). His experiments explain [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)"), [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction"), [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves) "Polarization (waves)"), [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation) "Interference (wave propagation)"), and [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") of electromagnetic waves.
*   1893 – [Victor Schumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Schumann "Victor Schumann") discovers the [vacuum ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_ultraviolet "Vacuum ultraviolet") spectrum.
*   1895 – [Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen") discovers [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray")
*   1895 – [Jagadis Chandra Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagadis_Chandra_Bose "Jagadis Chandra Bose") gives his first public demonstration of electromagnetic waves
*   1896 – [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") solves the half-plane [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") problem
*   1897 – [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson") discovers the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron").
*   1899 – [Pyotr Lebedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Lebedev "Pyotr Lebedev") measures the [pressure of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pressure_of_light&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pressure of light (page does not exist)") on a solid body.
*   1900 – The [Liénard–Wiechert potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard%E2%80%93Wiechert_potential "Liénard–Wiechert potential") are introduced as time-dependent (retarded) electrodynamic potentials
*   1900 – [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") resolves the [ultraviolet catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe "Ultraviolet catastrophe") by suggesting that [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation") consists of discrete packets, or [quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum"), of energy. The amount of energy in each packet is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic waves. The constant of proportionality is now called the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") in his honor.

*   1904 – [John Ambrose Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ambrose_Fleming "John Ambrose Fleming") invents the [thermionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermionic "Thermionic")[diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"), the first electronic [vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"), which had practical use in early [radio receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receivers "Radio receivers").
*   1905 – [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") proposes the [Theory of Special Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relativity "Special Relativity"), in which he rejects the existence of the [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether") as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts _as a [postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate")_ that the speed of light is constant in all [inertial frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial "Inertial"), and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"), [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction "Length contraction"), the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"), the [dependence of mass on velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mass "Relativistic mass"), and the [equivalence of mass and energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence "Mass-energy equivalence").
*   1905 – Einstein explains the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons "Photons"), to the absorption and emission of [photoelectrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectrons "Photoelectrons"). Einstein would later receive the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") for this discovery, which launched the [quantum revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") in physics.
*   1911 – [Superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity "Superconductivity") is discovered by [Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes "Heike Kamerlingh Onnes"), who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant. At the temperature of 4.2 K, he observed that the resistivity abruptly disappeared. For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913.
*   1919 – [Albert A. Michelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_A._Michelson "Albert A. Michelson") makes the first interferometric measurements of stellar diameters at [Mount Wilson Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory "Mount Wilson Observatory") (see [history of astronomical interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomical_interferometry "History of astronomical interferometry"))
*   1924 – [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") postulates the wave nature of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons") and suggests that [all matter has wave properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave").
*   1946 – [Martin Ryle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ryle "Martin Ryle") and Vonberg build the first two-element astronomical radio interferometer (see [history of astronomical interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomical_interferometry "History of astronomical interferometry"))
*   1953 – [Charles H. Townes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes "Charles H. Townes"), [James P. Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Gordon "James P. Gordon"), and [Herbert J. Zeiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_J._Zeiger "Herbert J. Zeiger") produce the first [maser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser "Maser")
*   1956 – [R. Hanbury-Brown and R.Q. Twiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbury-Brown_and_Twiss_effect "Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect") complete the [correlation interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometer "Interferometer")
*   1959 – [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow"), [Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam "Abdus Salam"), and [John Clive Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clive_Ward "John Clive Ward") merge electromagnetism and the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction") in [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), into [electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction")
*   1960 – [Theodore Maiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Maiman "Theodore Maiman") produces the first working [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser")
*   1966 – [Jefimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_D._Jefimenko "Oleg D. Jefimenko") introduces [time-dependent (retarded) generalizations of Coulomb's law and the Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefimenko%27s_equations "Jefimenko's equations")
*   1999 – M. Henny and others demonstrate the fermionic Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment
