( September 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Walls of Hipponion Mosaic Vibo Valentia was originally the Greek colony of Hipponion ( Ancient Greek : Ἱππόνιον ).

[ 3 ] It was founded, probably around the late 7th century BC, by inhabitants of Locri , a principal city of the region on the Ionian Sea .

[ 4 ] The massive city wall of 7 km circumference, a length of which can still be seen today, enclosed an area over the hill and down to the port. It had cylindrical towers at intervals and its monumental size testifies to the wealth of the city and the wars the city was involved in throughout its long history.

Diodorus Siculus reports that the city was taken in 388 BC by Dionysius the Elder tyrant of Syracuse , who deported all the population. The population came back in 378 BC, with the help of the Carthaginians . In the following years Hipponion came under the dominion of the Bruttii , who controlled most of the present Calabria. After the town fell to Rome , the name was Latinised to Hipponium . The town became a Roman colony in 194 BC with the name of Vibo Valentia.

It enjoyed a period of prosperity during the late Republic and early Empire, and Cicero had a villa here.

[ citation needed ] The town was almost completely abandoned after the fall of the Western Roman Empire . In 1070, the Normans built a castle at the site of the old Acropolis, and in 1235 a new city was established by Frederick II , Holy Roman emperor and king of Sicily, with the name of Monteleone.

The city got back the old Roman name of Vibo Valentia only in 1928.
