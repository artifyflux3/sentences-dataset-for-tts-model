The diagonals of a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube") with side length 1. AC' (shown in blue) is a [space diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_diagonal "Space diagonal") with length ![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b19c09494138b5082459afac7f9a8d99c546fcd), while AC (shown in red) is a [face diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_diagonal "Face diagonal") and has length ![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff).

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **diagonal** is a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") joining two [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") of a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") or [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"), when those vertices are not on the same [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"). Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal. The word _diagonal_ derives from the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") διαγώνιος _diagonios_,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-1) "from corner to corner" (from διά- _dia-_, "through", "across" and γωνία _gonia_, "corner", related to _gony_ "knee"); it was used by both [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo "Strabo")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-2) and [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-3) to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a [rhombus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus "Rhombus") or [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid "Cuboid"),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-4) and later adopted into Latin as _diagonus_ ("slanting line").

As applied to a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), a diagonal is a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") joining any two non-consecutive vertices. Therefore, a [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") has two diagonals, joining opposite pairs of vertices. For any [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon"), all the diagonals are inside the polygon, but for [re-entrant polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-entrant_polygon "Re-entrant polygon"), some diagonals are outside of the polygon.

Any _n_-sided polygon (_n_ ≥ 3), [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon") or [concave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_polygon "Concave polygon"), has ![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {n(n-3)}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e631e8f3e69d09d8721ea3b4d4bf4cd5fa76bc1f)_total_ diagonals, as each vertex has diagonals to all other vertices except itself and the two adjacent vertices, or _n_ − 3 diagonals, and each diagonal is shared by two vertices.

In general, a regular _n_-sided polygon has ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \left\lfloor {\frac {n-2}{2}}\right\rfloor }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bea68d80e4c9a20cf1cea12bfeba0bc5a0e7a448)_distinct_ diagonals in length, which follows the pattern 1,1,2,2,3,3... starting from a square.

### Regions formed by diagonals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diagonal&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Regions formed by diagonals")]

In a [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon"), if no three diagonals are [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_lines "Concurrent lines") at a single point in the interior, the number of regions that the diagonals divide the interior into is given by[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-5)

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\binom {n}{4}}+{\binom {n-1}{2}}={\frac {(n-1)(n-2)(n^{2}-3n+12)}{24}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1be30ea536f67ce33c5b189bf3655448638ae1a7)
For _n_-gons with _n_=3, 4, ... the number of regions is

1, 4, 11, 25, 50, 91, 154, 246...
This is [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OEIS "OEIS") sequence A006522.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-6)

### Intersections of diagonals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diagonal&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Intersections of diagonals")]

If no three diagonals of a convex polygon are concurrent at a point in the interior, the number of interior intersections of diagonals is given by ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \textstyle {\binom {n}{4}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e099ea438a57aa4aaa043feb6604733e1fe87b).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-youtube-8) This holds, for example, for any [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") with an odd number of sides. The formula follows from the fact that each intersection is uniquely determined by the four endpoints of the two intersecting diagonals: the number of intersections is thus the number of combinations of the _n_ vertices four at a time.

Although the number of distinct diagonals in a polygon increases as its number of sides increases, the length of any diagonal can be calculated.

In a regular n-gon with side length _a_, the length of the _xth_ shortest distinct diagonal is:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \sin \left({\frac {\pi (x+1)}{n}}\right)\csc \left({\frac {\pi }{n}}\right)\cdot a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/191645838bf7de34623670553066d17dc5ec26c7)
This formula shows that as the number of sides approaches infinity, the _xth_ shortest diagonal approaches the length ⁠![Image 9: {\displaystyle (x+1)a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/732b8523812193ddafa26990cecd8d2daa34c42a)⁠. Additionally, the formula for the shortest diagonal simplifies in the case of x = 1:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle \sin \left({\frac {2\pi }{n}}\right)\csc \left({\frac {\pi }{n}}\right)\cdot a=2\cos \left({\frac {\pi }{n}}\right)\cdot a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0927eea1378e9fea4decf6c140392209a4a8ccbe)
If the number of sides is even, the longest diagonal will be equivalent to the diameter of the polygon's circumcircle because the long diagonals all intersect each other at the polygon's center.

Special cases include:

A [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") has two diagonals of equal length, which intersect at the center of the square. The ratio of a diagonal to a side is ![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\approx 1.414.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7785ce3771362d45d00313d4f94b3738ba193efe)

A [regular pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_pentagon "Regular pentagon") has five diagonals all of the same length. The ratio of a diagonal to a side is the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio "Golden ratio"), ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\frac {1+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}\approx 1.618.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4db100d7ae8b559acce5063f1d3cfe52a9be8ba5)

A regular [hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon") has nine diagonals: the six shorter ones are equal to each other in length; the three longer ones are equal to each other in length and intersect each other at the center of the hexagon. The ratio of a long diagonal to a side is 2, and the ratio of a short diagonal to a side is ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b19c09494138b5082459afac7f9a8d99c546fcd).

A regular [heptagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptagon "Heptagon") has 14 diagonals. The seven shorter ones equal each other, and the seven longer ones equal each other. The reciprocal of the side equals the sum of the reciprocals of a short and a long diagonal.

A [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") (a [solid object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_object "Solid object") in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), bounded by [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)")[faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)")) may have two different types of diagonals: face diagonals on the various faces, connecting non-adjacent vertices on the same face; and space diagonals, entirely in the interior of the polyhedron (except for the endpoints on the vertices).

The lengths of an n-dimensional [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube")'s diagonals can be calculated by [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"). The longest diagonal of an n-cube is ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a2994734eae382ce30100fb17b9447fd8e99f81). Additionally, there are ![Image 15: {\displaystyle 2^{n-1}{\binom {n}{x+1}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f39a305aa4fc62ccf58d14c564e7138ee90620de) of the _xth_ shortest diagonal. As an example, a 5-cube would have the diagonals:

| Diagonal length | Number of diagonals |
| --- | --- |
| √2 | 160 |
| √3 | 160 |
| 2 | 80 |
| √5 | 16 |

Its total number of diagonals is 416. In general, an n-cube has a total of ![Image 16: {\displaystyle 2^{n-1}(2^{n}-n-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed6002f09e0d34d97c27b29336b395d46c93025b) diagonals. This follows from the more general form of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\frac {v(v-1)}{2}}-e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91fbdbe774f9ed6807a97e24b9fefd4de44f59ee) which describes the total number of face and space diagonals in convex polytopes.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal#cite_note-9) Here, v represents the number of vertices and e represents the number of edges.

By analogy, the [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product")_X_×_X_ of any set _X_ with itself, consisting of all pairs ⁠![Image 18: {\displaystyle (x,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72f9e25892f6d000349b8bb6578a59567efbdd63)⁠, is called the diagonal, and is the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_relation "Graph of a relation") of the [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)")[relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics) "Relation (mathematics)") on _X_ or equivalently the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of the [identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") from _X_ to _X_. This plays an important part in geometry; for example, the [fixed points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics) "Fixed point (mathematics)") of a [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")_F_ from _X_ to itself may be obtained by intersecting the graph of _F_ with the diagonal.

In geometric studies, the idea of intersecting the diagonal _with itself_ is common, not directly, but by perturbing it within an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class"). This is related at a deep level with the [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic") and the zeros of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"). For example, the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle")_S_ 1 has [Betti numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betti_number "Betti number") 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, and therefore Euler characteristic 0. A geometric way of expressing this is to look at the diagonal on the two-[torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus")_S_ 1×S 1 and observe that it can move _off itself_ by the small motion (_θ_, _θ_) to (_θ_, _θ_ + _ε_). In general, the intersection number of the graph of a function with the diagonal may be computed using homology via the [Lefschetz fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem "Lefschetz fixed-point theorem"); the self-intersection of the diagonal is the special case of the identity function.
