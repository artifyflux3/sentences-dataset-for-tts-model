For other uses, see CF .

"Confer" redirects here. For the software application, see CONFER (software) . For academic degree conferral, see Graduation .

The acronym cf.

(for either Latin confer or conferatur , both meaning 'compare') [ 1 ] is generally used in writing to refer the reader to other material to make a comparison with the topic being discussed. However some sources offer differing or even contradictory usage guides , as covered below. In Italian , the abbreviation "cfr." ( confronta , 'confront') is more common than "cf." [ 2 ] Conflicting and differing usage guides [ edit ] Style guides such as The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill writing center and the Chicago Manual of Style recommend that "cf." be used only to suggest a comparison, and the words "see" or " vide " be used generally to point to a source of information.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] However a 2010 American Psychological Association (APA) style guide states cf. should be "used to provide contrasting or opposing information" and that "to compare like things, use 'see' or 'see also.'" [ 5 ] Meanwhile Wex , the online legal dictionary created by Cornell Law School , suggests that "a cf. source simply offers a different yet non-contradictory claim and actual support to the claim just made should not be assumed. If the source gives a contradictory claim, a negative signal should be used." [ 6 ] They offer, "in order from mutually exclusive to somewhat contradictory," Contra, But see, and But cf. as examples of proper negative signals for contradicting claims.

[ 7 ] The conflicts between these definitions may suggest a general confusion or disagreement as to proper usage or differing conventions between scholarly disciplines such as law and psychology.

Biological use [ edit ] Main article: Open nomenclature In biological naming conventions, cf. is commonly placed between the genus name and the species name to describe a specimen that is hard to identify because of practical difficulties, such as poor preservation. For example, " Barbus cf.

holotaenia " indicates that the specimen is in the genus Barbus and believed to be Barbus holotaenia , but the actual species-level identification cannot be certain.

[ 8 ] Cf. can also be used to express a possible identity, or at least a significant resemblance, such as between a newly observed specimen and a known species or taxon .

[ 8 ] Such a usage might suggest a specimen's membership of the same genus or possibly of a shared higher taxon. For example, in the note " Diptera: Tabanidae , cf.

Tabanus ", the author is confident of the order and family ( Diptera : Tabanidae ) but can only suggest the genus ( Tabanus ) and has no information favouring a particular species.

[ 9 ] Numismatic use [ edit ] Among numismatists (coin collector-research specialists), cf. may be used in references on the paper and/or online coin identification information meaning "compare to". It is common for abbreviations of listings in trusted coin catalogues or sales from certain online auctions to be cited when identifying a particular coin. If the specimen in question is not an exact match but comes close to a known source, cf. may be used.

There is a distinction between see and cf.; use cf. only to mean 'compare' or 'see, by way of comparison'.
