"Gravity potential" redirects here. For Earth's gravity potential, see [Geopotential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopotential "Geopotential"). For the field of gravity potentials, see [Gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field").

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the **gravitational potential** is a [scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential "Scalar potential") associating with each point in space the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") ([energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") transferred) per unit mass that would be needed to move an object to that point from a fixed reference point in the conservative [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"). It is [analogous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogous "Analogous") to the [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") with [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") playing the role of [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)"). The reference point, where the potential is zero, is by convention [infinitely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitely "Infinitely") far away from any mass, resulting in a negative potential at any [finite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/finite "wikt:finite") distance. Their similarity is correlated with both associated [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field") having [conservative forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force").

Mathematically, the gravitational potential is also known as the [Newtonian potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_potential "Newtonian potential") and is fundamental in the study of [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory"). It may also be used for solving the electrostatic and magnetostatic fields generated by uniformly charged or polarized ellipsoidal bodies.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-1)

The gravitational potential (_V_) at a location is the gravitational [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") (_U_) at that location per unit mass:

![Image 1: {\displaystyle V={\frac {U}{m}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ed99311573a49937b42886742d69992d4d3132f)

where _m_ is the mass of the object. Potential energy is equal (in magnitude, but negative) to the work done by the gravitational field moving a body to its given position in space from infinity. If the body has a mass of 1 kilogram, then the potential energy to be assigned to that body is equal to the gravitational potential. So the potential can be interpreted as the negative of the work done by the gravitational field moving a unit mass in from infinity.

In some situations, the equations can be simplified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position. For instance, in a region close to the surface of the Earth, the [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration"), _g_, can be considered constant. In that case, the difference in potential energy from one height to another is, to a good approximation, linearly related to the difference in height: ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \Delta U\approx mg\Delta h.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78ac3dd75fa05bcea602f3168db62dd649c1a075)

The gravitational [potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential "Scalar potential")_V_ at a distance _x_ from a [point mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle") of mass _M_ can be defined as the work _W_ that needs to be done by an external agent to bring a unit mass in from infinity to that point:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-5)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )={\frac {W}{m}}={\frac {1}{m}}\int _{\infty }^{x}\mathbf {F} \left(\mathbf {x} '\right)\cdot d\mathbf {x} '={\frac {1}{m}}\int _{\infty }^{x}{\frac {GmM}{x'^{2}}}dx'=-{\frac {GM}{x}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a758bc08f08b710f6e9287ed2bd5c28aaa5d8cd) where _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), and **F** is the gravitational force. The product _GM_ is the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter") and is often known to higher precision than _G_ or _M_ separately. The potential has [units of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_energy "Units of energy") per mass, e.g., J/kg in the [MKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units "MKS system of units") system. By convention, it is always negative where it is defined, and as _x_ tends to infinity, it approaches zero.

The [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), and thus the acceleration of a small body in the space around the massive object, is the negative [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of the gravitational potential. Thus the negative of a negative gradient yields positive acceleration toward a massive object. Because the potential has no angular components, its gradient is ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =-{\frac {GM}{x^{3}}}\mathbf {x} =-{\frac {GM}{x^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {x} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cde9a3090d79d5e57e0004a6e567013eabb2a16b) where **x** is a vector of length _x_ pointing from the point mass toward the small body and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {x} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8a5451354f837d5d89774e1de386b44a903d929d) is a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") pointing from the point mass toward the small body. The magnitude of the acceleration therefore follows an [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law "Inverse square law"): ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {a} \|={\frac {GM}{x^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77479c991d9c6cc79c2d4cd2cd9aec9bd4ab6dae)

The potential associated with a [mass distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_distribution "Mass distribution") is the superposition of the potentials of point masses. If the mass distribution is a finite collection of point masses, and if the point masses are located at the points **x**1, ..., **x**_n_ and have masses _m_ 1, ..., _m_ _n_, then the potential of the distribution at the point **x** is ![Image 7: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=\sum _{i=1}^{n}-{\frac {Gm_{i}}{\|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x} _{i}\|}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdcde8260873ae51941ee07d63d0862395ab25e1)

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Mass_distribution_line_segment.svg/250px-Mass_distribution_line_segment.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mass_distribution_line_segment.svg)

Points **x** and **r**, with **r** contained in the distributed mass (gray) and differential mass _dm_(**r**) located at the point **r**.

If the mass distribution is given as a mass [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_measure "Borel measure")_dm_ on three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**3, then the potential is the [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution "Convolution") of −_G_/|**r**| with _dm_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In good cases[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] this equals the integral ![Image 9: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=-\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{\|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {r} \|}}\,dm(\mathbf {r} ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/376c7f0b6a83fed45bd2745cdee87f604589cd01) where |**x** − **r**| is the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") between the points **x** and **r**. If there is a function _ρ_(**r**) representing the density of the distribution at **r**, so that _dm_(**r**) = _ρ_(**r**) _dv_(**r**), where _dv_(**r**) is the Euclidean [volume element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_element "Volume element"), then the gravitational potential is the [volume integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_integral "Volume integral")![Image 10: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=-\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{\|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {r} \|}}\,\rho (\mathbf {r} )dv(\mathbf {r} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e98b85e1555f9851d09888a274707dd11c4d191a)

If _V_ is a potential function coming from a continuous mass distribution _ρ_(**r**), then _ρ_ can be recovered using the [Laplace operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator "Laplace operator"), Δ: ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{4\pi G}}\Delta V(\mathbf {x} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2b831ce89d3e1aca2532dda621cc6ecfd13467f) This holds pointwise whenever _ρ_ is continuous and is zero outside of a bounded set. In general, the mass measure _dm_ can be recovered in the same way if the Laplace operator is taken in the sense of [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics) "Distribution (mathematics)"). As a consequence, the gravitational potential satisfies [Poisson's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation "Poisson's equation"). See also [Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function_for_the_three-variable_Laplace_equation "Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation") and [Newtonian potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_potential "Newtonian potential").

The integral may be expressed in terms of known transcendental functions for all ellipsoidal shapes, including the symmetrical and degenerate ones.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-6) These include the sphere, where the three semi axes are equal; the oblate (see [reference ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid "Reference ellipsoid")) and prolate spheroids, where two semi axes are equal; the degenerate ones where one semi axes is infinite (the elliptical and circular cylinder) and the unbounded sheet where two semi axes are infinite. All these shapes are widely used in the applications of the gravitational potential integral (apart from the constant _G_, with 𝜌 being a constant [charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density "Charge density")) to electromagnetism.

A spherically symmetric mass distribution behaves to an observer completely outside the distribution as though all of the mass was concentrated at the center, and thus effectively as a [point mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass "Point mass"), by the [shell theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem "Shell theorem"). On the surface of the earth, the acceleration is given by so-called [standard gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity")_g_, approximately 9.8 m/s 2, although this value varies slightly with latitude and altitude. The magnitude of the acceleration is a little larger at the poles than at the equator because Earth is an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid "Oblate spheroid").

Within a spherically symmetric mass distribution, it is possible to solve [Poisson's equation in spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity#Poisson's_equation_and_gravitational_potential "Gauss's law for gravity"). Within a uniform spherical body of radius _R_, density ρ, and mass _m_, the gravitational force _g_ inside the sphere varies linearly with distance _r_ from the center, giving the gravitational potential inside the sphere, which is[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-8)![Image 12: {\displaystyle V(r)={\frac {2}{3}}\pi G\rho \left[r^{2}-3R^{2}\right]={\frac {Gm}{2R^{3}}}\left[r^{2}-3R^{2}\right],\qquad r\leq R,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9edacd57f6ef05612224090a38b674c9e164ccab) which differentiably connects to the potential function for the outside of the sphere (see the figure at the top).

In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), the gravitational potential is replaced by the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)"). When the gravitational field is weak and the sources are moving very slowly compared to light-speed, general relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity, and the metric tensor can be expanded in terms of the gravitational potential.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-Newtonian_or_gravitoelectric_potential-9)

Multipole expansion
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_potential&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Multipole expansion")]

The potential at a point **x** is given by ![Image 13: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=-\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {r} |}}\ dm(\mathbf {r} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eac64c8fd465d6ddecb83441ac55e39dc2e8e545)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Massdistribution_xy.svg/250px-Massdistribution_xy.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Massdistribution_xy.svg)

Illustration of a mass distribution (grey) with center of mass as the origin of vectors **x** and **r** and the point at which the potential is being computed at the head of vector **x**.

The potential can be expanded in a series of [Legendre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials "Legendre polynomials"). Represent the points **x** and **r** as [position vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_vector "Position vector") relative to the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass"). The denominator in the integral is expressed as the square root of the square to give ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V(\mathbf {x} )&=-\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{\sqrt {|\mathbf {x} |^{2}-2\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {r} +|\mathbf {r} |^{2}}}}\,dm(\mathbf {r} )\\&=-{\frac {1}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\int _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{\sqrt {1-2{\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\cos \theta +\left({\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\right)^{2}}}}\,dm(\mathbf {r} )\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a8badff17a91e45a2d4856fc7d1b8fb5608d33d8) where, in the last integral, _r_ = |**r**| and θ is the angle between **x** and **r**.

(See _[§Mathematical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational\_potential#Mathematical\_form)_.) The integrand can be expanded as a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") in _Z_ = _r_/|**x**|, by explicit calculation of the coefficients. A less laborious way of achieving the same result is by using the generalized [binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem "Binomial theorem").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential#cite_note-AEM-10) The resulting series is the [generating function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function "Generating function") for the Legendre polynomials: ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \left(1-2XZ+Z^{2}\right)^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}\ =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }Z^{n}P_{n}(X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8057db9ec7ea5d2e82cab990cbb2aa6ec2786d6b) valid for |_X_| ≤ 1 and |_Z_| < 1. The coefficients _P_ _n_ are the Legendre polynomials of degree _n_. Therefore, the Taylor coefficients of the integrand are given by the Legendre polynomials in _X_ = cos _θ_. So the potential can be expanded in a series that is convergent for positions **x** such that _r_< |**x**| for all mass elements of the system (i.e., outside a sphere, centered at the center of mass, that encloses the system): ![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V(\mathbf {x} )&=-{\frac {G}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\int \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\left({\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\right)^{n}P_{n}(\cos \theta )\,dm(\mathbf {r} )\\&=-{\frac {G}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\int \left(1+\left({\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\right)\cos \theta +\left({\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\right)^{2}{\frac {3\cos ^{2}\theta -1}{2}}+\cdots \right)\,dm(\mathbf {r} )\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef3001b10093b1083b309ef1043d8fa000ac5743) The integral ![Image 18: {\textstyle \int r\cos(\theta )\,dm}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad85f0a6d1fd6f08483139c5163137bb1ddd5174) is the component of the center of mass in the **x** direction; this vanishes because the vector **x** emanates from the center of mass. So, bringing the integral under the sign of the summation gives ![Image 19: {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=-{\frac {GM}{|\mathbf {x} |}}-{\frac {G}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\int \left({\frac {r}{|\mathbf {x} |}}\right)^{2}{\frac {3\cos ^{2}\theta -1}{2}}dm(\mathbf {r} )+\cdots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f40eea97fb6b6b70569835a3dc5709434d5863d)

This shows that elongation of the body causes a lower potential in the direction of elongation, and a higher potential in perpendicular directions, compared to the potential due to a spherical mass, if we compare cases with the same distance to the center of mass. (If we compare cases with the same distance to the _surface_, the opposite is true.)

Unit and numerical values
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_potential&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Unit and numerical values")]

The [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") of gravitational potential is the [square metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre "Square metre") per square second (m 2/s 2) or, equivalently, the joule per kilogram (J/kg). The [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") of gravitational potential at a number of locations with regards to the mass of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), and the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") is given in the following table; i.e. an object at Earth's surface would need 60 MJ/kg to "leave" [Earth's gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth "Gravity of Earth") field, another 900 MJ/kg to also leave the Sun's gravity field and more than 130 GJ/kg to leave the gravity field of the Milky Way. The potential is half the square of the [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity").
