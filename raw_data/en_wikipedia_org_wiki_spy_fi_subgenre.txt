( May 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Spy-fi can be defined as media that centers around the adventures of a protagonist (or protagonists) working as a secret agent or a spy . Usually, these adventures will revolve around defeating a rival superpower or singular enemy from achieving a nefarious aim. Content may include themes such as world domination , world destruction, futuristic weapons , and gadgets . Settings vary from outright fantasy, such as outer space or under the sea, to real but exotic locations.

[ citation needed ] Spy-fi does not necessarily present espionage as it is practiced in reality but rather glamorizes spy-craft through its focus on high-tech equipment, agencies, and organizations with nearly limitless resources and incredibly high-stakes adventures.

[ citation needed ] The spy protagonist may discover in his or her investigation that a mad scientist or evil genius and his secret organization are using futuristic technology to further their schemes.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Examples of these include the James Bond film series, the use of advanced scientific technologies for global influence or domination in The Baroness spy novels, using space travel technology to destroy the world as in Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die , weather control in Our Man Flint , using a sonic weapon in Dick Barton Strikes Back , a death ray in Dick Barton at Bay , or replacing world leaders with evil twins in In Like Flint .
