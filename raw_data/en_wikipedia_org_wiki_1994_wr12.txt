S. Shoemaker Discovery site Palomar Obs.

Discovery date 28 November 1994 Designations MPC designation 1994 WR 12 Minor planet category NEO · Aten [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Orbital characteristics [ 3 ] Epoch 2022-Jan-21 ( JD 2459600.5) Uncertainty parameter 0 Observation arc 27.01 yr (9,864 d) Aphelion 1.0577 AU (158.23 million km ) Perihelion 0.4562 AU (68.25 million km) Semi-major axis 0.7570 AU (113.25 million km) Eccentricity 0.39735 Orbital period (sidereal) 240.6 days (0.659 yr) Mean anomaly 217.06 ° Mean motion 1° 29 m 45.96 s / day Inclination 6.8515° Longitude of ascending node 62.608° Argument of perihelion 206.03° Earth MOID 0.0018 AU (0.70 LD) Physical characteristics Mean diameter 130 m (est.) [ 4 ] 92 – 210 m (CNEOS) Mass 2.9 × 10 9 kg (est.) [ 4 ] Absolute magnitude (H) 22.3 [ 3 ] 1994 WR 12 is an asteroid and near-Earth object approximately 130 meters (430 feet) in diameter.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] As a member of the Aten group almost all of its orbit is closer to the Sun than Earth is. On 24 November 1994 it passed about 374 100 km from the Moon.

[ 3 ] First imaged at Kitami Observatory on 26 November 1994, [ 1 ] it was discovered two nights later by American astronomer Carolyn S. Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory on 28 November 1994.

[ 2 ] The asteroid then went unobserved from 1994 until it was recovered by Mauna Kea in March 2016.

[ 1 ] It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 2 April 2016.

[ 5 ] Close approaches [ 3 ] Date JPL SBDB nominal geocentric distance uncertainty region ( 3-sigma ) 2021-11-29 6 152 189 km ± 34 km [ 6 ] 2046-11-25 1 633 719 km ± 4133 km 2190-11-23 135 000 000 km ± 815 million km [ 7 ] Description [ edit ] 1994 WR 12 orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.5–1.1 AU once every 8 months (240 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.40 and an inclination of 7 ° with respect to the ecliptic .

[ 3 ] It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0018 AU (269,000 km), which translates into 0.7 lunar distances .

[ 3 ] On 25 November 2046, it will pass 1 633 719 km from Earth with an uncertainty of ±4133 km.

[ 3 ] While listed on the Sentry Risk Table the range for the 2046 close approach distance varied from 0.001 AU (150,000 km) to 0.039 AU (5,800,000 km) from Earth.

[ 8 ] While listed on the Sentry Risk Table , [ 9 ] virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty in the known trajectory showed 116 potential impacts between 2054 and 2109.

[ 4 ] It had about a cumulative 1 in 9090 chance of impacting the Earth.

[ 4 ] The formerly poorly known trajectory of this asteroid was further complicated by close approaches to Venus and Mercury.

[ 3 ] It was recovered by Mauna Kea in March 2016, [ 1 ] which extended the observation arc from 34 days to 21 years.

It is estimated that an impact would produce the equivalent of 77 megatons of TNT, [ 4 ] roughly 1.5 times that of most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated ( Tsar Bomba ).

It has too a unique characteristic: it's complanar with Mercury, it can to be a fragment thrown away by an asteroid impact on Mercury, it's very little MOID with the Earth can produce a meteor shower on Earth and if the meteoroids were large enough even Mercurian meteorites.
