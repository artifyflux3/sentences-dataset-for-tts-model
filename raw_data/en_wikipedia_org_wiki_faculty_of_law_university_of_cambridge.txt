[ 25 ] Facilities [ edit ] David Williams Building [ edit ] The Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge in the evening The faculty is housed in the David Williams Building on the university's Sidgwick Site in Cambridge . The building is named after the university's first full-time vice-chancellor and professor of public law, Professor Sir David Williams .

[ 26 ] It opened in 1996 and was designed by Lord Norman Foster of Thames Bank , who also designed the terminal building at Stansted Airport and 30 St Mary Axe (the "Gherkin" in London).

[ 27 ] The building suffered serious acoustic problems (primarily due to a lack of consideration of acoustics in Foster's design), with its form amplifying any noise from the lower levels and causing significant disturbance at higher levels, not least in the library.

[ 28 ] This was fixed in 1999 with the installation of a glazed acoustic screen, separating quiet areas from noisy ones. Other issues still remain: the toilets in the building are often out of order due to plumbing issues. Additionally, due to an excessive focus on the design of the study spaces, the toilets appear to have been an afterthought, being unbearably small and cramped.

[ 29 ] The David Williams Building contains the university's Squire Law Library, together with offices, lecture and seminar rooms and common room facilities.

The interior of the faculty building Squire Law Library [ edit ] The Squire Law Library, which occupies the majority of the first, second and third floors of the building, is a dependent library of Cambridge University Library .

[ 30 ] It contains one of the three largest legal collections in the UK with more than 180,000 volumes. The collection is very strong across UK law, the law of other major common law countries (the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand), international law and the law of the European Union, France and Germany. There are also smaller collections for the law of many other countries. The library provides its users with access to many major legal databases.

The library was founded in 1904, at first with only 8,000 volumes, [ 31 ] although this soon increased. In 1934, together with the Seeley Historical Library , it moved to the Cockerell Building on Senate House Passage , previously the home of the University Library built in 1837–42. The Squire took over the whole of the Cockerell Building on the construction of James Stirling 's building for the history library in 1968. With the Squire's own move in turn, its former site became the library of Gonville and Caius College .

Most individual colleges also have a smaller law library of their own, while the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law has its own library composed of international law books and other related materials.

Societies [ edit ] There are a number of groups and societies based around the Faculty of Law: Cambridge University Law Society Cambridge Societies at the Inns of Court (Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, and Middle Temple) Graduate Law Society The Cambridge University Society for Women Lawyers Cambridge University Students' Pro Bono Society Cambridge Pro Bono Project Exploring Law Conference (formerly the Cambridge Sixth Form Law Conference) Cambridge University Human Rights Law Society Cambridge University Medical Law Society Most colleges also have their own law societies.
