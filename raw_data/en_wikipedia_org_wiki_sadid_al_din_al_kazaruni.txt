He was a popular commentator on earlier medical writings, and composed a commentary titled al-Mughni fi sharh al-Mujiz on the epitome of The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna . Numerous copies of this popular commentary are preserved today, including at the National Library of Medicine .

He also composed a commentary on the materia medica that was part of the Canon of Medicine itself and a commentary on the first book of the Canon of Medicine, which he completed in 1344. In addition, al-Kazaruni wrote a biography of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad , which was translated from Arabic into Persian by his son 'Afif in 1383. From this latter translation, 18th century- Chinese Muslim scholar Liu Zhi also composed his own.

[ 1 ] He died in 1357.
