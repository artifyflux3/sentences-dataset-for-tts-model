He stayed on at Surrey to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy degree in nuclear reaction theory, which he obtained in 1989, rather than accepting a job offer from the National Physical Laboratory .

[ 11 ] Career and research [ edit ] Al-Khalili talking about determinism at QED 2011 In 1989, Al-Khalili was awarded a Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) postdoctoral fellowship at University College London , after which he returned to Surrey in 1991, first as a research assistant, then as a lecturer.

[ 12 ] In 1994, Al-Khalili was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Advanced Research Fellowship for five years, [ 13 ] during which time he established himself as a leading expert on mathematical models of exotic atomic nuclei . He has published widely in his field.

[ 2 ] [ 14 ] Al-Khalili is a professor of physics at the University of Surrey , where he also holds a chair in the Public Engagement in Science.

[ 15 ] He has been a trustee (2006–2012) and vice president (2008–2011) of the British Science Association .

He has been a Fellow of the Institute of Physics since 2000, when he also received the Institute's Public Awareness of Physics Award.

[ 18 ] He has lectured widely both in the UK and around the world, particularly for the British Council . He is a member of the British Council Science and Engineering Advisory Group, [ 19 ] a member of the Royal Society Equality and Diversity Panel, [ 20 ] an external examiner for the Open University Department of Physics and Astronomy, a member of the Editorial Board for the open access Journal PMC Physics A, and Associate Editor of Advanced Science Letters. He is also a member of the Advisory Committee for the Cheltenham Science Festival .

In 2007, he was a judge on the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize [ 21 ] for non-fiction and has been a celebrity judge at the National Science & Engineering Competition Finals at The Big Bang Fair. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours .

[ 22 ] In 2012, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on Alan Turing: Legacy of a Code Breaker at the University of Edinburgh .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 2004, he co-presented the Channel 4 documentary The Riddle of Einstein's Brain , produced by Icon Films .

[ 30 ] His big break as a presenter came in 2007 with Atom , a three-part series on BBC Four about the history of our understanding of the atom and atomic physics.

[ 31 ] This was followed by a special archive edition of Horizon , "The Big Bang".

[ 32 ] In early 2009, Al-Khalili presented the BBC Four three-part series Science and Islam about the leap in scientific knowledge that took place in the Islamic world between the 8th and 14th centuries.

[ 33 ] He has contributed to programmes ranging from Tomorrow's World , BBC Four's Mind Games , The South Bank Show to BBC One 's Bang Goes the Theory .

[ 34 ] In 2010 he presented the BBC documentary on the history of chemistry , Chemistry: A Volatile History .

[ 35 ] In October 2011, he began a programme on famous contemporary scientists on Radio Four , called The Life Scientific .

[ 36 ] The first of this series featured his interview with Paul Nurse .

[ 37 ] He has since interviewed a series of notable scientists, including Richard Dawkins , Alice Roberts , James Lovelock , Steven Pinker , Martin Rees , Jocelyn Bell Burnell , Mark Walport and Tim Hunt , and he has himself been interviewed on the show by Adam Rutherford .
