It is notable for being rapidly convergent, with only 25 iterations producing 45 million correct digits of π . However, it has some drawbacks (for example, it is computer memory -intensive) and therefore all record-breaking calculations for many years have used other methods, almost always the Chudnovsky algorithm . For details, see Chronology of computation of π .

The method is based on the individual work of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) combined with modern algorithms for multiplication and square roots . It repeatedly replaces two numbers by their arithmetic and geometric mean , in order to approximate their arithmetic-geometric mean .

The version presented below is also known as the Gauss–Euler , Brent–Salamin (or Salamin–Brent ) algorithm ; [ 1 ] it was independently discovered in 1975 by Richard Brent and Eugene Salamin . It was used to compute the first 206,158,430,000 decimal digits of π on September 18 to 20, 1999, and the results were checked with Borwein's algorithm .

Algorithm [ edit ] Initial value setting: a 0 = 1 b 0 = 1 2 p 0 = 1 t 0 = 1 4 .

{\displaystyle a_{0}=1\qquad b_{0}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\qquad p_{0}=1\qquad t_{0}={\frac {1}{4}}.} Repeat the following instructions until the difference between a n + 1 {\displaystyle a_{n+1}} and b n + 1 {\displaystyle b_{n+1}} is within the desired accuracy: a n + 1 = a n + b n 2 , b n + 1 = a n b n , p n + 1 = 2 p n , t n + 1 = t n − − p n ( a n + 1 − − a n ) 2 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n+1}&={\frac {a_{n}+b_{n}}{2}},\\\\b_{n+1}&={\sqrt {a_{n}b_{n}}},\\\\p_{n+1}&=2p_{n},\\\\t_{n+1}&=t_{n}-p_{n}(a_{n+1}-a_{n})^{2}.\\\end{aligned}}} π is then approximated as: π π ≈ ≈ ( a n + 1 + b n + 1 ) 2 4 t n + 1 .

{\displaystyle \pi \approx {\frac {(a_{n+1}+b_{n+1})^{2}}{4t_{n+1}}}.} The first three iterations give (approximations given up to and including the first incorrect digit): 3.140 … … {\displaystyle 3.140\dots } 3.14159264 … … {\displaystyle 3.14159264\dots } 3.1415926535897932382 … … {\displaystyle 3.1415926535897932382\dots } 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419711 … … {\displaystyle 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419711\dots } 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998625 … … {\displaystyle 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998625\dots } The algorithm has quadratic convergence , which essentially means that the number of correct digits doubles with each iteration of the algorithm.

Mathematical background [ edit ] Limits of the arithmetic–geometric mean [ edit ] The arithmetic–geometric mean of two numbers, a 0 and b 0 , is found by calculating the limit of the sequences a n + 1 = a n + b n 2 , b n + 1 = a n b n , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n+1}&={\frac {a_{n}+b_{n}}{2}},\\[6pt]b_{n+1}&={\sqrt {a_{n}b_{n}}},\end{aligned}}} which both converge to the same limit.

If a 0 = 1 {\displaystyle a_{0}=1} and b 0 = cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ {\displaystyle b_{0}=\cos \varphi } then the limit is π π 2 K ( sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) {\textstyle {\pi  \over 2K(\sin \varphi )}} where K ( k ) {\displaystyle K(k)} is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind K ( k ) = ∫ ∫ 0 π π / 2 d θ θ 1 − − k 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ .

{\displaystyle K(k)=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {d\theta }{\sqrt {1-k^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta }}}.} If c 0 = sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ {\displaystyle c_{0}=\sin \varphi } , c i + 1 = a i − − a i + 1 {\displaystyle c_{i+1}=a_{i}-a_{i+1}} , then ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ 2 i − − 1 c i 2 = 1 − − E ( sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) K ( sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ ) {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{\infty }2^{i-1}c_{i}^{2}=1-{E(\sin \varphi ) \over K(\sin \varphi )}} where E ( k ) {\displaystyle E(k)} is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind : E ( k ) = ∫ ∫ 0 π π / 2 1 − − k 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d θ θ {\displaystyle E(k)=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\sqrt {1-k^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta }}\;d\theta } Gauss knew of these two results.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Legendre’s identity [ edit ] Legendre proved the following identity: K ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) E ( sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) + K ( sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) E ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) − − K ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) K ( sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) = π π 2 , {\displaystyle K(\cos \theta )E(\sin \theta )+K(\sin \theta )E(\cos \theta )-K(\cos \theta )K(\sin \theta )={\pi  \over 2},} for all θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } .

[ 2 ] Elementary proof with integral calculus [ edit ] The Gauss-Legendre algorithm can be proven to give results converging to π π {\displaystyle \pi } using only integral calculus. This is done here [ 5 ] and here.
