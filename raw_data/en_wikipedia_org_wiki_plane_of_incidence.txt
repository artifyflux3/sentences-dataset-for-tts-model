In describing reflection and refraction in optics , the plane of incidence (also called the incidence plane or the meridional plane [ citation needed ] ) is the plane which contains the surface normal and the propagation vector of the incoming radiation .

[ 1 ] (In wave optics , the latter is the k-vector , or wavevector, of the incoming wave.) When reflection is specular , as it is for a mirror or other shiny surface, the reflected ray also lies in the plane of incidence; when refraction also occurs, the refracted ray lies in the same plane. The condition of co-planarity among incident ray, surface normal, and reflected ray (refracted ray) is known as the first law of reflection ( first law of refraction , respectively).

[ 2 ] Polarizations [ edit ] Main article: s and p polarizations The orientation of the incident light's polarization with respect to the plane of incidence has an important effect on the strength of the reflection.

P-polarized light is incident linearly polarized light with polarization direction lying in the plane of incidence.

S-polarized light has polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The s in s-polarized comes from the  German word senkrecht , meaning perpendicular. The strength of reflection from a surface is determined by the Fresnel equations , which are different for s- and p-polarized light.
