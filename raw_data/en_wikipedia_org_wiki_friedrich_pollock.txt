He was one of the founders of the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main , and a member of the Frankfurt School of Marxist theory.

Career [ edit ] Friedrich Pollock was born to a leather factory owner in Freiburg im Breisgau . Pollock's Jewish -born father turned away from Judaism , and raised his son accordingly.

[ 2 ] Pollock was educated in finance from 1911 to 1915. During this time, he met Max Horkheimer , with whom he became a lifelong friend. He then studied economy , sociology and philosophy in Frankfurt am Main , where he wrote his thesis on Marx's labor theory of value .

[ citation needed ] In 1923 Pollock received his doctorate in economics from the University of Frankfurt . The Institute for Social Research was founded in the same year by Pollock together with Leo Löwenthal , Walter Benjamin , Theodor W. Adorno , and Horkheimer. The Institute for Social Research was reestablished after World War II, when Pollock and Adorno returned to Frankfurt after exile in the United States.

[ 3 ] Between 1927 and 1928, Pollock traveled to the Soviet Union in honor of the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution . His research there led to his treatise Attempts at Planned Economy in the Soviet Union 1917–1927 .  Thereafter, he took a post as lecturer at the University of Frankfurt replacing Carl Grünberg as director of the Institute for Social Research from 1928 till 1930.

[ citation needed ] Prior to the Nazi seizure of power, Pollock had used his contacts in the International Labour Organization to establish a Geneva branch of the Institute for Social Research.

[ 4 ] In 1933, Pollock and Horkheimer moved into exile, first in Geneva, then to London , Paris , and finally New York City .

In 1950 Pollock had resettled in Frankfurt and was reappointed director of the Institute for Social Research. From 1951 to 1958, he was professor of economics and sociology at the University of Frankfurt .

[ citation needed ] In 1956 Pollock published Automation: Materials for the Evaluation of the Economic and Social Consequences as interdisciplinary analyses. This publication exemplified holistic economic research, which had been championed by the Frankfurt school in the 1950s.

[ 5 ] In Automation Pollock argued that post-industrial employees might be spared from "soul-destroying drudgery".

[ 6 ] In 1959, Pollock and Horkheimer moved to Montagnola , Ticino , Switzerland , although Pollock held a position as professor Emeritus at the University of Frankfurt until 1963. He died in Montagnola in 1970.
