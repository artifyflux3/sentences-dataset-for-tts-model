He studied at Trinity College, Dublin from 1821 to 1827.  His main work was on the theory of equations , where he was reluctant to accept the validity of the work of Niels Henrik Abel on the insolubility of the quintic equation by radicals .  He found a way of using Tschirnhaus transformations to eliminate three of the terms in an equation, which generalised work of Erland Bring (1736–1798), and is now called Bring–Jerrard normal form .
