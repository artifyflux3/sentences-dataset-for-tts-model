Moisture recycling is thus a component of the hydrologic cycle . The ratio of the locally derived precipitation ( P L ) to total precipitation ( P ) is known as the recycling ratio , ρ : [ 1 ] ρ ρ = P L P .

{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {P_{L}}{P}}.} The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Land use changes, such as deforestation or agricultural intensification, have the potential to change the amount of precipitation that falls in a region. The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the Amazon basin range from 24% to 56%, and for the Mississippi basin from 21% to 24%.

[ 6 ] The concept of moisture recycling has been integrated into the concept of the precipitationshed . A precipitationshed is the upwind ocean and land surface that contributes evaporation to a given, downwind location's precipitation. In much the same way that a watershed is defined by a topographically explicit area that provides surface runoff , the precipitationshed is a statistically defined area within which evaporation, traveling via moisture recycling, provides precipitation for a specific point.
