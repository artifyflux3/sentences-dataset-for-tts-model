[ 1 ] The idea is similar to that of concatenated impressions, as seen in the work of David Hume . It is also associated with the concepts of "construct" and "influent".

[ 2 ] In the book Mental Evolution of Man , Romanes introduced recept to support his argument that Charles Darwin's theory of the origin of language is valid by presenting more evidence from philology.

[ 3 ] In his conceptualization, recept denotes the process, which involves memory, that transpires when a human child as a "higher animal" is faced with a sensory situation it perceives as familiar.

[ 3 ] This familiarity elicits a response based on its meaning and significance.

[ 3 ] Romanes also stated that, recept or a receptual thought is a compound idea - one the differs from a general or abstract idea - of past similar perceptions.

[ 4 ] It has been interpreted as an idea that one is not aware he has.

[ 4 ] It is noted that recept is not widely embraced because Romanes book is so little read.

[ 3 ] The term is used in Richard Maurice Bucke 's book, Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind . Bucke was a 19th-century Canadian psychiatrist .
