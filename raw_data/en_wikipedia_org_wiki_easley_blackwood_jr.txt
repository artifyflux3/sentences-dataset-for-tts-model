Born April 21, 1933 Died January 22, 2023 Occupations professor pianist composer author Instrument piano Formerly of Chicago Pro Musica Musical artist Easley Rutland Blackwood Jr.

(April 21, 1933 – January 22, 2023) was an American professor of music, concert pianist, composer (sometimes using unusual tunings ), and the author of books on music theory , including his research into the properties of microtonal tunings and traditional harmony.

Biography [ edit ] Blackwood was born in Indianapolis, Indiana , on April 21, 1933. He studied piano there and was doing solo appearances at the age of 14 with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra .  After studies at many places (including Yale University , where he earned his Master of Arts degree) in the United States, he went to Paris to study from 1954 to 1956.  His teachers include Olivier Messiaen , Paul Hindemith , and Nadia Boulanger . For forty years, from 1958 to 1997, Blackwood taught at the University of Chicago , most of the time with the title of Professor. He then became Professor Emeritus at the university.

Blackwood's initial compositions were not particularly unconventional although in them he employed polyrhythm and wide melodic contours. This early music by Blackwood has been characterized as in an atonal yet a formally conservative style. In 1980–81 Blackwood shifted rather abruptly to a new style, releasing Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media . For these pieces, he used microtonality to create unusual equal tempered musical scales .  Blackwood has explored all equal temperaments from 13 through 24, including 15-ET and 19-ET .

[ 1 ] Although Blackwood recorded most of these pieces with a synthesizer, his "Suite in 15-Note Equal Tuning, Op. 33" was performed live on a specially constructed guitar .

[ 2 ] His compositional style moved toward a late-19th-century tonality; he has likened its harmonic syntax to Verdi, Ravel, and Franck. As a performer at the piano, Blackwood played diverse compositions and promoted the music of Charles Ives , Pierre Boulez , and the Second Viennese School . In addition to his solo piano performances, Blackwood was pianist in the chamber group Chicago Pro Musica, largely comprising members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

[ citation needed ] Blackwood was known for his book The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings (Princeton: Princeton University Press; ISBN 0691091293 ), published in 1985. A number of recordings of his music have been released by Cedille Records (the label of the Chicago Classical Recording Foundation) beginning in the 1990s such as Introducing Easley Blackwood .

[ 3 ] Personal life [ edit ] His father, Easley Blackwood Sr.

, was a noted contract bridge player and writer.

Blackwood died in Chicago on January 22, 2023, at the age of 89.
