The dual set is always linearly independent but does not necessarily span V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} . If it does span V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} , then B ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle B^{*}} is called the dual basis or reciprocal basis for the basis B {\displaystyle B} .

Denoting the indexed vector sets as B = { v i } i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle B=\{v_{i}\}_{i\in I}} and B ∗ ∗ = { v i } i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle B^{*}=\{v^{i}\}_{i\in I}} , being biorthogonal means that the elements pair to have an inner product equal to 1 if the indexes are equal, and equal to 0 otherwise. Symbolically, evaluating a dual vector in V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle V^{*}} on a vector in the original space V {\displaystyle V} : v i ⋅ ⋅ v j = δ δ j i = { 1 if i = j 0 if i ≠ ≠ j , {\displaystyle v^{i}\cdot v_{j}=\delta _{j}^{i}={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}i=j\\0&{\text{if }}i\neq j{\text{,}}\end{cases}}} where δ δ j i {\displaystyle \delta _{j}^{i}} is the Kronecker delta symbol.

Introduction [ edit ] To perform operations with a vector, we must have a straightforward method of calculating its components. In a Cartesian frame the necessary operation is the dot product of the vector and the base vector.

[ 1 ] For example, x = x 1 i 1 + x 2 i 2 + x 3 i 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =x^{1}\mathbf {i} _{1}+x^{2}\mathbf {i} _{2}+x^{3}\mathbf {i} _{3}} where { i 1 , i 2 , i 3 } {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {i} _{1},\mathbf {i} _{2},\mathbf {i} _{3}\}} is the basis in a Cartesian frame. The components of x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } can be found by x k = x ⋅ ⋅ i k .

{\displaystyle x^{k}=\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {i} _{k}.} However, in a non-Cartesian frame, we do not necessarily have e i ⋅ ⋅ e j = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{j}=0} for all i ≠ ≠ j {\displaystyle i\neq j} . However, it is always possible to find vectors e i {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} ^{i}} in the dual space such that x i = e i ( x ) ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) .

{\displaystyle x^{i}=\mathbf {e} ^{i}(\mathbf {x} )\qquad (i=1,2,3).} The equality holds when the e i {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} ^{i}} s are the dual basis of e i {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{i}} s. Notice the difference in position of the index i {\displaystyle i} .

Existence and uniqueness [ edit ] The dual set always exists and gives an injection from V into V ∗ , namely the mapping that sends v i to v i . This says, in particular, that the dual space has dimension greater or equal to that of V .

However, the dual set of an infinite-dimensional V does not span its dual space V ∗ . For example, consider the map w in V ∗ from V into the underlying scalars F given by w ( v i ) = 1 for all i . This map is clearly nonzero on all v i . If w were a finite linear combination of the dual basis vectors v i , say w = ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ K α α i v i {\textstyle w=\sum _{i\in K}\alpha _{i}v^{i}} for a finite subset K of I , then for any j not in K , w ( v j ) = ( ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ K α α i v i ) ( v j ) = 0 {\textstyle w(v_{j})=\left(\sum _{i\in K}\alpha _{i}v^{i}\right)\left(v_{j}\right)=0} , contradicting the definition of w . So, this w does not lie in the span of the dual set.

The dual of an infinite-dimensional space has greater dimension (this being a greater infinite cardinality) than the original space has, and thus these cannot have a basis with the same indexing set. However, a dual set of vectors exists, which defines a subspace of the dual isomorphic to the original space. Further, for topological vector spaces , a continuous dual space can be defined, in which case a dual basis may exist.

Finite-dimensional vector spaces [ edit ] In the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, the dual set is always a dual basis and it is unique. These bases are denoted by B = { e 1 , … … , e n } {\displaystyle B=\{e_{1},\dots ,e_{n}\}} and B ∗ ∗ = { e 1 , … … , e n } {\displaystyle B^{*}=\{e^{1},\dots ,e^{n}\}} . If one denotes the evaluation of a covector on a vector as a pairing, the biorthogonality condition becomes: ⟨ e i , e j ⟩ = δ δ j i .

{\displaystyle \left\langle e^{i},e_{j}\right\rangle =\delta _{j}^{i}.} The association of a dual basis with a basis gives a map from the space of bases of V to the space of bases of V ∗ , and this is also an isomorphism. For topological fields such as the real numbers, the space of duals is a topological space , and this gives a homeomorphism between the Stiefel manifolds of bases of these spaces.

A categorical and algebraic construction of the dual space [ edit ] Another way to introduce the dual space of a vector space ( module ) is by introducing it in a categorical sense. To do this, let A {\displaystyle A} be a module defined over the ring R {\displaystyle R} (that is, A {\displaystyle A} is an object in the category R - M o d {\displaystyle R{\text{-}}\mathbf {Mod} } ). Then we define the dual space of A {\displaystyle A} , denoted A ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle A^{\ast }} , to be Hom R ( A , R ) {\displaystyle {\text{Hom}}_{R}(A,R)} , the module formed of all R {\displaystyle R} -linear module homomorphisms from A {\displaystyle A} into R {\displaystyle R} . Note then that we may define a dual to the dual, referred to as the double dual of A {\displaystyle A} , written as A ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle A^{\ast \ast }} , and defined as Hom R ( A ∗ ∗ , R ) {\displaystyle {\text{Hom}}_{R}(A^{\ast },R)} .

To formally construct a basis for the dual space, we shall now restrict our view to the case where F {\displaystyle F} is a finite-dimensional free (left) R {\displaystyle R} -module, where R {\displaystyle R} is a ring with unity. Then, we assume that the set X {\displaystyle X} is a basis for F {\displaystyle F} . From here, we define the Kronecker Delta function δ δ x y {\displaystyle \delta _{xy}} over the basis X {\displaystyle X} by δ δ x y = 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{xy}=1} if x = y {\displaystyle x=y} and δ δ x y = 0 {\displaystyle \delta _{xy}=0} if x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} . Then the set S = { f x : F → → R | f x ( y ) = δ δ x y } {\displaystyle S=\lbrace f_{x}:F\to R\;|\;f_{x}(y)=\delta _{xy}\rbrace } describes a linearly independent set with each f x ∈ ∈ Hom R ( F , R ) {\displaystyle f_{x}\in {\text{Hom}}_{R}(F,R)} . Since F {\displaystyle F} is finite-dimensional, the basis X {\displaystyle X} is of finite cardinality. Then, the set S {\displaystyle S} is a basis to F ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle F^{\ast }} and F ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle F^{\ast }} is a free (right) R {\displaystyle R} -module.

Examples [ edit ] For example, the standard basis vectors of R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} (the Cartesian plane ) are { e 1 , e 2 } = { ( 1 0 ) , ( 0 1 ) } {\displaystyle \left\{\mathbf {e} _{1},\mathbf {e} _{2}\right\}=\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}}\right\}} and the standard basis vectors of its dual space ( R 2 ) ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ^{2})^{*}} are { e 1 , e 2 } = { ( 1 0 ) , ( 0 1 ) } .

{\displaystyle \left\{\mathbf {e} ^{1},\mathbf {e} ^{2}\right\}=\left\{{\begin{pmatrix}1&0\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}0&1\end{pmatrix}}\right\}{\text{.}}} In 3-dimensional Euclidean space , for a given basis { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {e} _{1},\mathbf {e} _{2},\mathbf {e} _{3}\}} , the biorthogonal (dual) basis { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {e} ^{1},\mathbf {e} ^{2},\mathbf {e} ^{3}\}} can be found by formulas below: e 1 = ( e 2 × × e 3 V ) T , e 2 = ( e 3 × × e 1 V ) T , e 3 = ( e 1 × × e 2 V ) T .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} ^{1}=\left({\frac {\mathbf {e} _{2}\times \mathbf {e} _{3}}{V}}\right)^{\mathsf {T}},\ \mathbf {e} ^{2}=\left({\frac {\mathbf {e} _{3}\times \mathbf {e} _{1}}{V}}\right)^{\mathsf {T}},\ \mathbf {e} ^{3}=\left({\frac {\mathbf {e} _{1}\times \mathbf {e} _{2}}{V}}\right)^{\mathsf {T}}.} where T denotes the transpose and V = ( e 1 ; e 2 ; e 3 ) = e 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( e 2 × × e 3 ) = e 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( e 3 × × e 1 ) = e 3 ⋅ ⋅ ( e 1 × × e 2 ) {\displaystyle V\,=\,\left(\mathbf {e} _{1};\mathbf {e} _{2};\mathbf {e} _{3}\right)\,=\,\mathbf {e} _{1}\cdot (\mathbf {e} _{2}\times \mathbf {e} _{3})\,=\,\mathbf {e} _{2}\cdot (\mathbf {e} _{3}\times \mathbf {e} _{1})\,=\,\mathbf {e} _{3}\cdot (\mathbf {e} _{1}\times \mathbf {e} _{2})} is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the basis vectors e 1 , e 2 {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1},\,\mathbf {e} _{2}} and e 3 .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{3}.} In general the dual basis of a basis in a finite-dimensional vector space can be readily computed as follows: given the basis f 1 , … … , f n {\displaystyle f_{1},\ldots ,f_{n}} and corresponding dual basis f 1 , … … , f n {\displaystyle f^{1},\ldots ,f^{n}} we can build matrices F = [ f 1 ⋯ ⋯ f n ] G = [ f 1 ⋯ ⋯ f n ] {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F&={\begin{bmatrix}f_{1}&\cdots &f_{n}\end{bmatrix}}\\G&={\begin{bmatrix}f^{1}&\cdots &f^{n}\end{bmatrix}}\end{aligned}}} Then the defining property of the dual basis states that G T F = I {\displaystyle G^{\mathsf {T}}F=I} Hence the matrix for the dual basis G {\displaystyle G} can be computed as G = ( F − − 1 ) T {\displaystyle G=\left(F^{-1}\right)^{\mathsf {T}}} See also [ edit ] Reciprocal lattice Miller index Zone axis Notes [ edit ] ^ Lebedev, Cloud & Eremeyev 2010 , p. 12.
