Biography [ edit ] Education [ edit ] He was educated at the University of California, Berkeley , earning B.S. in Engineering Physics, with honors, and at Harvard University , acquiring a Ph.D. in Physics in 1974.

Specialization [ edit ] Yung specializes in the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres . He has worked on a number of NASA projects including Galileo , Cassini-Huygens , and the Earth Observing System .

Awards [ edit ] He won the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 2004 and  became the first Taiwanese winner of the Kuiper Award in 2015.

[ 1 ] He is cited in the American Men and Women of Science .

Research [ edit ] In an article in journal Science , it was reported that planetary science professor Yuk Yung, along with physics research scientist Tracey Tromp, Assistant Professor of Geochemistry John Eiler,  planetary science research scientist Run-Lie Shia, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Mark Allen, were concerned that leaked hydrogen gas for use in hydrogen cars, in a hydrogen economy , could indirectly cause as much as a 10-percent decrease in atmospheric ozone.

[ 2 ] California Institute of Technology report that the leaked hydrogen gas that would inevitably result from a hydrogen economy, if it accumulates, could indirectly cause as much as a 10-percent decrease in atmospheric ozone.

Related scientists [ edit ] His climate and space research relates to the work of Professor Kenneth J. Hsu (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), Dr. Charles A Perry (United States Geological Survey) and Henrik Svensmark (Danish Meteorological Institute), in particular in the field of carbon-fluxing.

Publications [ edit ] As of 2015, he is the author of more than 300 scholarly papers and two books: Atmospheric Radiation: Theoretical Basis, R.M. Goody and Y.L. Yung, Oxford University Press , New York, 1989.

Photochemistry of Planetary Atmospheres, Y.L. Yung and W. D. DeMore, Oxford University Press, 1999.
