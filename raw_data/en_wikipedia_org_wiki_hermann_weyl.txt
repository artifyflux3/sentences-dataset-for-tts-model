**Hermann Klaus Hugo Weyl** (;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-4)German:[[vaɪl]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); 9 November 1885 – 8 December 1955) was a German [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physicist "Theoretical physicist"), [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician "Logician") and [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"). Although much of his working life was spent in [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), and then [Princeton, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey "Princeton, New Jersey"), he is associated with the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen") tradition of mathematics, represented by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") and [Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski").

His research has had major significance for [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") as well as purely mathematical disciplines such as [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"). He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, and an important member of the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study") during its early years.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-6)

Weyl contributed to an exceptionally[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-Dyson-7) wide range of fields, including works on [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"), [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") and the [history of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics "History of mathematics"). He was one of the first to conceive of combining [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") with the laws of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson") wrote that Weyl alone bore comparison with the "last great universal mathematicians of the nineteenth century", [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-Dyson-7)[Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah "Michael Atiyah"), in particular, has commented that whenever he examined a mathematical topic, he found that Weyl had preceded him.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-8)

Hermann Weyl was born in [Elmshorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmshorn "Elmshorn"), a small town near [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg "Hamburg"), in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), and attended the [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) "Gymnasium (school)")[Christianeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianeum "Christianeum") in [Altona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altona,_Hamburg "Altona, Hamburg").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-9) His father, Ludwig Weyl, was a banker; whereas his mother, Anna Weyl (née Dieck), came from a wealthy family.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-10)

From 1904 to 1908, he studied mathematics and physics in both [Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen "Göttingen") and [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich"). His doctorate was awarded at the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen") under the supervision of [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert"), whom he greatly admired.

In September 1913, in Göttingen, Weyl married [Friederike Bertha Helene Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helene_Weyl "Helene Weyl") (30 March 1893[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-11) – 5 September 1948[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-12)) who went by the name Helene (nickname "Hella"). Helene was a daughter of Dr. [Bruno Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bruno_Joseph&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bruno Joseph (page does not exist)") (13 December 1861 – 10 June 1934), a physician who held the position of Sanitätsrat in [Ribnitz-Damgarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribnitz-Damgarten "Ribnitz-Damgarten"), Germany. Helene was a philosopher (she was a disciple of phenomenologist [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl")) and a translator of Spanish literature into German and English (especially the works of Spanish philosopher [José Ortega y Gasset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset "José Ortega y Gasset")).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-13) It was through Helene's close connection with Husserl that Hermann became familiar with (and greatly influenced by) Husserl's thought. Hermann and Helene had two sons, [Fritz Joachim Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Joachim_Weyl "Fritz Joachim Weyl") (19 February 1915 – 20 July 1977) and [Michael Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Weyl&action=edit&redlink=1 "Michael Weyl (page does not exist)") (15 September 1917 – 19 March 2011),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-14) both of whom were born in Zürich, Switzerland. Helene died in Princeton, New Jersey, on 5 September 1948. A memorial service in her honor was held in Princeton on 9 September 1948. Speakers at her memorial service included her son Fritz Joachim Weyl and mathematicians [Oswald Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen") and [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant "Richard Courant").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-15) In 1950. Hermann married sculptor [Ellen Bär](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ellen_B%C3%A4r&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ellen Bär (page does not exist)") (née Lohnstein) (17 April 1902 – 14 July 1988),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-16) who was the widow of professor [Richard Josef Bär](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Josef_B%C3%A4r "Richard Josef Bär") (11 September 1892 – 15 December 1940)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-17) of Zürich.

After taking a teaching post for a few years, Weyl left Göttingen in 1913 for Zürich to take the chair of mathematics[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-18) at the [ETH Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Z%C3%BCrich "ETH Zürich"), where he was a colleague of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), who was working out the details of the theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Einstein had a lasting influence on Weyl, who became fascinated by mathematical physics. In 1921, Weyl met [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger"), a theoretical physicist who at the time was a professor at the [University of Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Z%C3%BCrich "University of Zürich"). They were to become close friends over time. Weyl had some sort of childless love affair with Schrödinger's wife Annemarie (Anny) Schrödinger (née Bertel), while at the same time Anny was helping raise an illegitimate daughter of Erwin's named Ruth Georgie Erica March, who was born in 1934 in [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford"), England.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-20)

Weyl was a Plenary Speaker of the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") (ICM) in 1928 at [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna "Bologna")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-21) and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1936 at [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo "Oslo"). He was elected a fellow of the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society") in 1928,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-22) a member of the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences "American Academy of Arts and Sciences") in 1929,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-23) a member of the [American Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society "American Philosophical Society") in 1935,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-24) and a member of the [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences "National Academy of Sciences") in 1940.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-25) For the academic year 1928–1929, he was a visiting professor at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-26) where he wrote a paper, "On a problem in the theory of groups arising in the foundations of infinitesimal geometry," with [Howard P. Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_P._Robertson "Howard P. Robertson").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-27)

Weyl left Zürich in 1930 to become Hilbert's successor at Göttingen, leaving when the [Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") assumed power in 1933, particularly as his wife was [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"). He had been offered one of the first faculty positions at the new [Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Institute for Advanced Study") in [Princeton, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey "Princeton, New Jersey"), but had declined because he did not desire to leave his homeland. As the political situation in Germany grew worse, he changed his mind and accepted when offered the position again. He remained there until his retirement in 1951. Together with his second wife Ellen, he spent his time in Princeton and Zürich, and died from a heart attack on 8 December 1955, while living in Zürich.

Weyl was cremated in Zürich on 12 December 1955.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-28) His ashes remained in private hands[_[unreliable source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable\_sources "Wikipedia:Reliable sources")_] until 1999, at which time they were interred in an outdoor columbarium vault in the [Princeton Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Cemetery "Princeton Cemetery").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-29) The remains of Hermann's son Michael Weyl (1917–2011) are interred right next to Hermann's ashes in the same columbarium vault.

Weyl was a [pantheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheist "Pantheist").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-30)

### Distribution of eigenvalues

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermann_Weyl&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Distribution of eigenvalues")]

In 1911 Weyl published _Über die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte_ (_On the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues_) in which he proved that the [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors") of the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian "Laplacian") in a compact domain are distributed according to the so-called [Weyl law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_law "Weyl law"). In 1912 he suggested a new proof, based on variational principles. Weyl returned to this topic several times, considered elasticity system and formulated the [Weyl conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_law#Weyl_conjecture "Weyl law"). These works started an important domain—[asymptotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote "Asymptote") distribution of eigenvalues—of modern analysis.

### Geometric foundations of manifolds and physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermann_Weyl&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Geometric foundations of manifolds and physics")]

In 1913, Weyl published _Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche_ (_The Concept of a Riemann Surface_), which gave a unified treatment of [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"). In it Weyl utilized [point set topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_set_topology "Point set topology"), in order to make Riemann surface theory more rigorous, a model followed in later work on [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). He absorbed [L. E. J. Brouwer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer") early work in topology for this purpose.

Weyl, as a major figure in the Göttingen school, was fully apprised of Einstein's work from its early days. He tracked the development of [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") physics in his _Raum, Zeit, Materie_ (_Space, Time, Matter_) from 1918, which reached its 4th edition in 1922. In 1918, he introduced the notion of [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_(mathematics) "Gauge (mathematics)"), and gave the first example of what is now known as a [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory"). Weyl's gauge theory was an unsuccessful attempt to model the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") and the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") as geometrical properties of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). The Weyl tensor in [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") is of major importance in understanding the nature of [conformal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometry "Conformal geometry").

His overall approach in physics was based on the [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)") philosophy of [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl"), specifically Husserl's 1913 _Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch: Allgemeine Einführung in die reine Phänomenologie_ (Ideas of a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy. First Book: General Introduction). Husserl had reacted strongly to [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege")'s criticism of his first work on the philosophy of arithmetic and was investigating the sense of mathematical and other structures, which Frege had distinguished from empirical reference.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Topological groups, Lie groups and representation theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermann_Weyl&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Topological groups, Lie groups and representation theory")]

From 1923 to 1938, Weyl developed the theory of [compact groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_group "Compact group"), in terms of [matrix representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory"). In the [compact Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Lie_group "Compact Lie group") case he proved a fundamental [character formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl%27s_character_formula "Weyl's character formula").

These results are foundational in understanding the symmetry structure of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), which he put on a group-theoretic basis. This included [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor"). Together with the [mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics "Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics"), in large measure due to [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"), this gave the treatment familiar since about 1930. Non-compact groups and their representations, particularly the [Heisenberg group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_group "Heisenberg group"), were also streamlined in that specific context, in his 1927 [Weyl quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_quantization "Weyl quantization"), the best extant bridge between classical and quantum physics to date. From this time, and certainly much helped by Weyl's expositions, [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") became a mainstream part both of [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics") and [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics").

His book _[The Classical Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Classical\_Groups "The Classical Groups")_ reconsidered [invariant theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_theory "Invariant theory"). It covered [symmetric groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group"), [general linear groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group"), [orthogonal groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group"), and [symplectic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group "Symplectic group") and results on their [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") and [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation").

### Harmonic analysis and analytic number theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermann_Weyl&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Harmonic analysis and analytic number theory")]

Weyl also showed how to use [exponential sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_sum "Exponential sum") in [diophantine approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation "Diophantine approximation"), with his criterion for [uniform distribution mod 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistributed_mod_1 "Equidistributed mod 1"), which was a fundamental step in [analytic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory "Analytic number theory"). This work applied to the [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function "Riemann zeta function"), as well as [additive number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_number_theory "Additive number theory"). It was developed by many others.

### Foundations of mathematics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermann_Weyl&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Foundations of mathematics")]

In _The Continuum_ Weyl developed the logic of [predicative analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impredicativity "Impredicativity") using the lower levels of [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell")'s [ramified theory of types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramified_theory_of_types "Ramified theory of types"). He was able to develop most of classical [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus"), while using neither the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice") nor [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction"), and avoiding [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor")'s [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set "Infinite set"). Weyl appealed[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] in this period to the radical [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics) "Constructivism (mathematics)") of the German romantic, subjective idealist [Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichte "Fichte").

Shortly after publishing _The Continuum_ Weyl briefly shifted his position wholly to the [intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism "Intuitionism") of Brouwer. In _The Continuum_, the constructible points exist as discrete entities. Weyl wanted a [continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(set_theory) "Continuum (set theory)") that was not an aggregate of points. He wrote a controversial article proclaiming, for himself and [L. E. J. Brouwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer "L. E. J. Brouwer"), a "revolution."[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-31) This article was far more influential in propagating intuitionistic views than the original works of Brouwer himself.

[George Pólya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya "George Pólya") and Weyl, during a mathematicians' gathering in Zürich (9 February 1918), made a bet concerning the future direction of mathematics. Weyl predicted that in the subsequent 20 years, mathematicians would come to realize the total vagueness of notions such as [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), and [countability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable "Countable"), and moreover, that asking about the [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth") or falsity of the [least upper bound property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers "Completeness of the real numbers") of the real numbers was as meaningful as asking about truth of the basic assertions of [Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") on the philosophy of nature.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-32) Any answer to such a question would be unverifiable, unrelated to experience, and therefore senseless.

However, within a few years Weyl decided that Brouwer's intuitionism did put too great restrictions on mathematics, as critics had always said. The "Crisis" article had disturbed Weyl's [formalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(mathematics) "Formalism (mathematics)") teacher Hilbert, but later in the 1920s Weyl partially reconciled his position with that of Hilbert.

After about 1928 Weyl had apparently decided that mathematical intuitionism was not compatible with his enthusiasm for the [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)") philosophy of [Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husserl "Husserl"), as he had apparently earlier thought. In the last decades of his life Weyl emphasized mathematics as "symbolic construction" and moved to a position closer not only to Hilbert but to that of [Ernst Cassirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Cassirer "Ernst Cassirer"). Weyl however rarely refers to Cassirer, and wrote only brief articles and passages articulating this position.

By 1949, Weyl was thoroughly disillusioned with the ultimate value of intuitionism, and wrote: "Mathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He succeeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner, all the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely than had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in advancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of the simple laws of [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic") eventually results in an almost unbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the greater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of concrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes." As John L Bell puts it: "It seems to me a great pity that Weyl did not live to see the emergence in the 1970s of smooth infinitesimal analysis, a mathematical framework within which his vision of a true continuum, not “synthesized” from discrete elements, is realized. Although the underlying logic of smooth infinitesimal analysis is intuitionistic — the [law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle "Law of excluded middle") not being generally affirmable — mathematics developed within avoids the “unbearable awkwardness” to which Weyl refers above."

In 1929, Weyl proposed an equation, known as the [Weyl equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation "Weyl equation"), for use in a replacement to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"). This equation describes massless [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"). A normal Dirac fermion could be split into two Weyl fermions or formed from two Weyl fermions. [Neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") were once thought to be Weyl fermions, but they are now known to have mass. Weyl fermions are sought after for electronics applications. [Quasiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiparticle "Quasiparticle") that behave as Weyl fermions were discovered in 2015, in a form of crystals known as [Weyl semimetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_semimetal "Weyl semimetal"), a type of topological material.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-I3Espectrum-2015-07-16-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-ScienceDaily-2015-07-16-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl#cite_note-10.1126/science.aaa9297-35)

*   The question for the ultimate foundations and the ultimate meaning of mathematics remains open; we do not know in which direction it will find its final solution nor even whether a final objective answer can be expected at all. "Mathematizing" may well be a creative activity of man, like language or music, of primary originality, whose historical decisions defy complete objective rationalization.

*   In these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract algebra fight for the soul of each individual mathematical domain.

*   Whenever you have to do with a structure-endowed entity S try to determine its group of automorphisms, the group of those element-wise transformations which leave all structural relations undisturbed. You can expect to gain a deep insight into the constitution of S in this way.

*   Beyond the knowledge gained from the individual sciences, there remains the task of **comprehending**. In spite of the fact that the views of philosophy sway from one system to another, we cannot dispense with it unless we are to convert knowledge into a meaningless chaos.

Ruth's actual, biological father was Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), and her mother was Hildegunde March (née Holzhammer) (born 1900), wife of Austrian physicist [Arthur March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_March "Arthur March") (23 February 1891 – 17 April 1957). Hildegunde's friends often called her "Hilde" or "Hilda" rather than Hildegunde. Arthur March was Erwin Schrödinger's assistant at the time of Ruth's birth. The reason Ruth's surname is March (instead of Schrödinger) is because Arthur had agreed to be named as Ruth's father on her birth certificate, even though he wasn't her biological father. Ruth married the engineer Arnulf Braunizer in May 1956, and they have lived in Alpbach, Austria for many years. Ruth has been very active as the sole administrator of the intellectual (and other) property of her father Erwin's estate, which she manages from Alpbach.

To use the apt phrase of his son Michael, 'The Open World' (1932) contains "Hermann's dialogues with God" because here the mathematician confronts his ultimate concerns. These do not fall into the traditional religious traditions but are much closer in spirit to Spinoza's rational analysis of what he called "God or nature," so important for Einstein as well. ...In the end, Weyl concludes that this God "cannot and will not be comprehended" by the human mind, even though "mind is freedom within the limitations of existence; it is open toward t///he infinite." Nevertheless, "neither can God penetrate into man by revelation, nor man penetrate to him by mystical perception."
