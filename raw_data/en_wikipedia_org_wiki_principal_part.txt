For the grammar term (a list of verb forms), see Principal parts .

In mathematics , the principal part has several independent meanings but usually refers to the negative-power portion of the Laurent series of a function.

Laurent series definition [ edit ] The principal part at z = a {\displaystyle z=a} of a function f ( z ) = ∑ ∑ k = − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ a k ( z − − a ) k {\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{k=-\infty }^{\infty }a_{k}(z-a)^{k}} is the portion of the Laurent series consisting of terms with negative degree.

[ 1 ] That is, ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ a − − k ( z − − a ) − − k {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }a_{-k}(z-a)^{-k}} is the principal part of f {\displaystyle f} at a {\displaystyle a} .
If the Laurent series has an inner radius of convergence of 0 {\displaystyle 0} , then f ( z ) {\displaystyle f(z)} has an essential singularity at a {\displaystyle a} if and only if the principal part is an infinite sum. If the inner radius of convergence is not 0 {\displaystyle 0} , then f ( z ) {\displaystyle f(z)} may be regular at a {\displaystyle a} despite the Laurent series having an infinite principal part.

Other definitions [ edit ] Calculus [ edit ] Consider the difference between the function differential and the actual increment: Δ Δ y Δ Δ x = f ′ ( x ) + ε ε {\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}=f'(x)+\varepsilon } Δ Δ y = f ′ ( x ) Δ Δ x + ε ε Δ Δ x = d y + ε ε Δ Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta y=f'(x)\Delta x+\varepsilon \Delta x=dy+\varepsilon \Delta x} The differential dy is sometimes called the principal (linear) part of the function increment Δy .

Distribution theory [ edit ] The term principal part is also used for certain kinds of distributions having a singular support at a single point.
