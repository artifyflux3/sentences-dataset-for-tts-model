[ 9 ] History [ edit ] 19th century [ edit ] The bill founding North Dakota Agricultural College ( NDAC ) was signed on March 8, 1890, one year after North Dakota became a state and seven years after initial plans to start an agricultural college in the northern portion of the Dakota Territory .

[ 10 ] NDAC was established as North Dakota's land-grant institution .

[ 11 ] On October 15, 1890, Horace E. Stockbridge became the first NDAC president and the board of trustees was formed.

[ 12 ] Classes were initially held in six classrooms rented from Fargo College. The first class of students were admitted on September 8, 1891. College Hall (Old Main) was completed in 1892 and was the first building on campus.

[ 12 ] 20th century [ edit ] In 1908, the school's alma mater " The Yellow and The Green " was written and a year later the school's official colors, Yellow and Green, were selected.

[ 10 ] In 2015 a change was made where only the first verse of the alma mater is recognized by the university, due to ethnic references in the third stanza.

[ 13 ] NDAC continued to grow and was renamed North Dakota State University on November 8, 1960, after a statewide referendum.

[ 14 ] The name change was to reflect the increasing field of study breadth of the institution.

[ 10 ] A 36-acre (15 ha) area including twelve historic buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as North Dakota State University District in 1986.

[ 15 ] 21st century [ edit ] Around the start of the 21st century, NDSU began a phase of growth.

NDSU surpassed 10,000 students in the fall of 2000 for the first time, and by the fall semester of 2009, it increased enrollment by another 10% to 14,189 students.

[ 16 ] Enrollment in 2018 stood at 13,650.

Several buildings have been built or expanded and remodeled over the past seven years, including the Wallman Wellness Center, Memorial Union, and the College of Business.

[ 18 ] In 2023, President David Cook outlined plans to merge two out of the seven colleges into five in an attempt to save $7.6 million. This also resulted in some majors with high program costs and lower enrollment being eliminated. There are plans to create new majors to meet workforce needs for the future.
