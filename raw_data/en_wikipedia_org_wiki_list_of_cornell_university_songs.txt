Most of the songs were popularized by, and were written by members or alumni of, the Cornell Glee Club , Cornell's tenor-bass chorus.  Most formal concerts of the Glee Club or Cornell Chorus conclude with selections of Cornell songs.  The songs are also sung at football games and played by the marching band.

The list is in chronological order and includes the first line of each song, as that is how many students identify the songs.
