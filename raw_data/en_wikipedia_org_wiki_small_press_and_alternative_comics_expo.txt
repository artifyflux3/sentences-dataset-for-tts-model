, is an annual convention in Columbus, Ohio , United States , for alternative comics , minicomics , and webcomics . Bob Corby founded the convention as a gathering place for "the comics and the creators with no distractions." [ 1 ] The show is sponsored by Corby's Back Porch Comics, a Columbus small press comics publisher.

Like most comic book conventions, in addition to exhibitor tables, each show features art exhibits, panel discussions, and workshops.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] Prior to SPACE, there had been a few small press-themed conventions in Columbus, including segments of the Mid-Ohio Con (dating from the 1980s) and a stop on Dave Sim 's 1995 "Spirits of Independents" tour. In 2000, inspired by Spirits of Independence, and with Sim's blessing, Columbus small press comics publisher Bob Corby staged the first SPACE show at the Rhodes Center in the Ohio Expo Center. 49 small press exhibitors — including Matt Feazell , Carla Speed McNeil , Alex Robinson , and William Messner-Loebs [ 4 ] — came from as far as Illinois, North Carolina, and Connecticut.

[ 5 ] In 2001, Sim collaborated directly with Corby, and SPACE became the home of the inaugural Day Prize , administered in person by Sim. 65 exhibitors came from as far west as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New York City. Columbus-based Jeff Smith made a surprise appearance.

[ 6 ] From 2001 to 2008, Sim was a special guest at every SPACE show, often with his long-time collaborator Gerhard . In 2004, Sim was awarded the SPACE Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2007, with SPACE growing in popularity and exhibitors, the show expanded to two days and moved to the Aladdin Shrine Center. The 2008 show, Sim's last appearance, featured 30 of his original drawings, and over 150 creators and publishers.

[ 3 ] The 2009 show featured an exhibit of original pages from Carol Tyler 's new graphic novel, You’ll Never Know, Book One: A Good and Decent Man .

In 2010, the show expanded once again, moving to the Ramada Plaza Hotel & Conference Center. The 2012 show featured creators like Nate Powell , Carol Tyler , John Porcellino , Tom Scioli , and Eric Adams.

The 2020 show, scheduled for July 11–12, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Day Prize for outstanding achievement in self-publishing, in tribute to Sim's mentor, Gene Day . Bestowed annually at SPACE from 2002 to 2008 [ 8 ] the prize consisted of a $500 cash award and a commemorative plaque. The recipient was chosen by Sim and Gerhard from a pool of submitted works.

In 2008, Sim announced he was withdrawing from convention appearances (including SPACE) to concentrate on new work.

[ 9 ] In addition, Sim announced that, beginning in 2009, the Day Prize was going to be folded into the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards .

[ 10 ] SPACE organizer Bob Corby announced the creation of the SPACE Prize beginning at the 2008 show.

[ 9 ] Entries for the SPACE Prize are submitted by that year's exhibitors, with a list of finalists selected by Corby. The winner is chosen by a group of judges and SPACE exhibitors.

[ 9 ] In 2009, the SPACE Prize expanded to include three categories, General, Minicomic/Short story, and Webcomic. In 2013 the SPACE Prize added the Graphic Novel category. In 2016 the SPACE Prize dropped the Webcomic category but added the Junior Category prize.
