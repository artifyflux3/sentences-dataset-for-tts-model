Brewer's specialty relates to visibility and color theory in cartography . In 2023, she was awarded the International Cartographic Society's highest honor, the Carl Mannerfelt Gold Medal , for her distinguished contribution to the field.

Her web, print, and colorblind -friendly sets of colors, known as the Brewer palettes, have been used by numerous projects.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] She is the creator of the online color palette tool ColorBrewer .

[ 3 ] Brewer has worked as a map and atlas design consultant for the U.S. Census Bureau , National Cancer Institute , National Center for Health Statistics , and National Park Service . She teaches courses in introductory cartography and map design.

[ 4 ] She also works on topographic map design, multi-scale mapping, generalization, and atlas mapping. She has been influential as a theorist for map representations and GIS professionals.

Education [ edit ] She graduated from McMaster University (Ontario, Canada) in 1979 and the University of Guelph (Ontario, Canada) in 1983.

[ 5 ] She did her master's degree in geography with emphasis in cartography at Michigan State University , 1983 to 1986, presenting a thesis titled The Development of Process-Printed Munsell Charts for Selecting Map Colors . After a year at University of California at Santa Barbara , she obtained her doctorate from Michigan State University in 1991. Her dissertation was Prediction of Surround-Induced Changes in Map Color Appearance .

[ 6 ] Academic career [ edit ] She was visiting lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara , Department of Geography during the year 1986/87.
On completing her doctorate she was assistant professor, for three years (1991 to 1994) at San Diego State University . She joined the Pennsylvania State University , Department of Geography in 1994 and has been professor since 2007 and was head of the department from 2014 to 2021.

She has been a faculty member of the Center of Excellence for Geospatial Information Science (CEGIS), U.S. Geological Survey, Department of Interior, since 2008.
