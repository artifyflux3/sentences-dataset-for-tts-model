It is limited to liberal and centrist parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

Liberalism was a major force in Finland since 1894. After independence the current gradually decreased. A major other force, agrarianism, choose in 1965 to develop itself into a more centrist current. The liberal character of the Finnish Center ( Suomen Keskusta ), member of LI and ELDR , is based on liberal ideas like decentralization , peasant-like freedom and progressivism .

[ 1 ] The Swedish minority party Swedish People's Party ( Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland ) is also a member of LI , ELDR . The original liberal current is now organized in the Liberals ( Liberaalit ), a very small extra-parliamentary party. At the autonomous island of Åland the Liberals for Åland ( Liberalerna på Åland ) are a dominant force.
