The concern of traditional geometry and topology is with the small-scale structure of the space: properties such as the continuity of a function depend on whether the inverse images of small open sets , or neighborhoods , are themselves open. Large-scale properties of a space—such as boundedness , or the degrees of freedom of the space—do not depend on such features.

Coarse geometry and coarse topology provide tools for measuring the large-scale properties of a space, and just as a metric or a topology contains information on the small-scale structure of a space, a coarse structure contains information on its large-scale properties.

Properly, a coarse structure is not the large-scale analog of a topological structure, but of a uniform structure .

Definition [ edit ] A coarse structure on a set X {\displaystyle X} is a collection E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } of subsets of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} (therefore falling under the more general categorization of binary relations on X {\displaystyle X} ) called controlled set s , and so that E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } possesses the identity relation , is closed under taking subsets, inverses, and finite unions, and is closed under composition of relations . Explicitly: Identity/diagonal : The diagonal Δ Δ = { ( x , x ) : x ∈ ∈ X } {\displaystyle \Delta =\{(x,x):x\in X\}} is a member of E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } —the identity relation.

Closed under taking subsets : If E ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle E\in \mathbf {E} } and F ⊆ ⊆ E , {\displaystyle F\subseteq E,} then F ∈ ∈ E .

{\displaystyle F\in \mathbf {E} .} Closed under taking inverses : If E ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle E\in \mathbf {E} } then the inverse (or transpose ) E − − 1 = { ( y , x ) : ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ E } {\displaystyle E^{-1}=\{(y,x):(x,y)\in E\}} is a member of E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } —the inverse relation.

Closed under taking unions : If E , F ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle E,F\in \mathbf {E} } then their union E ∪ ∪ F {\displaystyle E\cup F} is a member of E .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} .} Closed under composition : If E , F ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle E,F\in \mathbf {E} } then their product E ∘ ∘ F = { ( x , y ) : there exists z ∈ ∈ X such that ( x , z ) ∈ ∈ E and ( z , y ) ∈ ∈ F } {\displaystyle E\circ F=\{(x,y):{\text{ there exists }}z\in X{\text{ such that }}(x,z)\in E{\text{ and }}(z,y)\in F\}} is a member of E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } —the composition of relations .

A set X {\displaystyle X} endowed with a coarse structure E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } is a coarse space .

For a subset K {\displaystyle K} of X , {\displaystyle X,} the set E [ K ] {\displaystyle E[K]} is defined as { x ∈ ∈ X : ( x , k ) ∈ ∈ E for some k ∈ ∈ K } .

{\displaystyle \{x\in X:(x,k)\in E{\text{ for some }}k\in K\}.} We define the section of E {\displaystyle E} by x {\displaystyle x} to be the set E [ { x } ] , {\displaystyle E[\{x\}],} also denoted E x .

{\displaystyle E_{x}.} The symbol E y {\displaystyle E^{y}} denotes the set E − − 1 [ { y } ] .

{\displaystyle E^{-1}[\{y\}].} These are forms of projections .

A subset B {\displaystyle B} of X {\displaystyle X} is said to be a bounded set if B × × B {\displaystyle B\times B} is a controlled set.

Intuition [ edit ] The controlled sets are "small" sets, or " negligible sets ": a set A {\displaystyle A} such that A × × A {\displaystyle A\times A} is controlled is negligible, while a function f : X → → X {\displaystyle f:X\to X} such that its graph is controlled is "close" to the identity. In the bounded coarse structure, these sets are the bounded sets, and the functions are the ones that are a finite distance from the identity in the uniform metric .

Coarse maps [ edit ] Given a set S {\displaystyle S} and a coarse structure X , {\displaystyle X,} we say that the maps f : S → → X {\displaystyle f:S\to X} and g : S → → X {\displaystyle g:S\to X} are close if { ( f ( s ) , g ( s ) ) : s ∈ ∈ S } {\displaystyle \{(f(s),g(s)):s\in S\}} is a controlled set.

For coarse structures X {\displaystyle X} and Y , {\displaystyle Y,} we say that f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is a coarse map if for each bounded set B {\displaystyle B} of Y {\displaystyle Y} the set f − − 1 ( B ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(B)} is bounded in X {\displaystyle X} and for each controlled set E {\displaystyle E} of X {\displaystyle X} the set ( f × × f ) ( E ) {\displaystyle (f\times f)(E)} is controlled in Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} [ 1 ] X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are said to be coarsely equivalent if there exists coarse maps f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} and g : Y → → X {\displaystyle g:Y\to X} such that f ∘ ∘ g {\displaystyle f\circ g} is close to id Y {\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{Y}} and g ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle g\circ f} is close to id X .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {id} _{X}.} Examples [ edit ] The bounded coarse structure on a metric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is the collection E {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} } of all subsets E {\displaystyle E} of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} such that sup ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ E d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \sup _{(x,y)\in E}d(x,y)} is finite . With this structure, the integer lattice Z n {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{n}} is coarsely equivalent to n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space .

A space X {\displaystyle X} where X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} is controlled is called a bounded space . Such a space is coarsely equivalent to a point. A metric space with the bounded coarse structure is bounded (as a coarse space) if and only if it is bounded (as a metric space).

The trivial coarse structure only consists of the diagonal and its subsets. In this structure, a map is a coarse equivalence if and only if it is a bijection (of sets).

The C 0 {\displaystyle C_{0}} coarse structure on a metric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is the collection of all subsets E {\displaystyle E} of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} such that for all ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} there is a compact set K {\displaystyle K} of E {\displaystyle E} such that d ( x , y ) < ε ε {\displaystyle d(x,y)<\varepsilon } for all ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ E ∖ ∖ K × × K .

{\displaystyle (x,y)\in E\setminus K\times K.} Alternatively, the collection of all subsets E {\displaystyle E} of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} such that { ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ E : d ( x , y ) ≥ ≥ ε ε } {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\in E:d(x,y)\geq \varepsilon \}} is compact.

The discrete coarse structure on a set X {\displaystyle X} consists of the diagonal Δ Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } together with subsets E {\displaystyle E} of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} which contain only a finite number of points ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} off the diagonal.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological space then the indiscrete coarse structure on X {\displaystyle X} consists of all proper subsets of X × × X , {\displaystyle X\times X,} meaning all subsets E {\displaystyle E} such that E [ K ] {\displaystyle E[K]} and E − − 1 [ K ] {\displaystyle E^{-1}[K]} are relatively compact whenever K {\displaystyle K} is relatively compact.
