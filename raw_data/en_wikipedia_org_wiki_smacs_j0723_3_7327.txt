[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] It is a patch of sky visible from the Southern Hemisphere on Earth and often observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and other telescopes in search of the deep past.

[ 2 ] It was the target of the first full-color image to be unveiled by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), imaged using NIRCam , with spectra included, showing objects lensed by the cluster with redshifts implying they are 13.1 billion years old.

[ 10 ] The cluster has been previously observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of the Southern MAssive Cluster Survey (SMACS), [ 11 ] as well as Planck [ 12 ] and Chandra .
