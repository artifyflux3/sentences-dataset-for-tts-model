[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] This term was coined in 1981, describing cocci in seawater that were less than 0.3 μm in diameter.

[ 4 ] Ultramicrobacteria have also been recovered from soil and appear to be a mixture of gram-positive , gram-negative and cell-wall-lacking species.

[ 5 ] [ 2 ] Ultramicrobacteria possess a relatively high surface-area-to-volume ratio due to their small size, which aids in growth under oligotrophic (i.e. nutrient-poor) conditions.

[ 2 ] The relatively small size of ultramicrobacteria also enables parasitism of larger organisms; [ 2 ] some ultramicrobacteria have been observed to be obligate or facultative parasites of various eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] One factor allowing ultramicrobacteria to achieve their small size seems to be genome minimization [ 1 ] [ 2 ] such as in the case of the ultramicrobacterium P. ubique whose small 1.3 Mb genome is seemingly devoid of extraneous genetic elements like non-coding DNA , transposons , extrachromosomal elements etc.

[ 2 ] However, genomic data from ultramicrobacteria is lacking [ 2 ] since the study of ultramicrobacteria, like many other prokaryotes, is hindered by difficulties in cultivating them.

[ 3 ] Microbacterial studies from Berkeley Lab at UC Berkeley have produced detailed microscopy images of ultra-small microbial species.

[ 6 ] Cells imaged have an average volume of 0.009 μm 3 , meaning that about 150,000 of them could fit on the tip of a human hair.

[ 6 ] These bacteria were found in groundwater samples and analyzed with 2-D and 3-D cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. These ultra-small bacteria, about 1 million base pairs long, [ 6 ] display dense spirals of DNA, few ribosomes, hair-like fibrous appendages, and minimized metabolic systems.

[ 6 ] Such cells probably gain most essential nutrients and metabolites from other bacteria.

[ 6 ] Bacteria in the ultra-small size range are thought to be rather common but difficult to detect.

[ 6 ] Ultramicrobacteria are commonly confused with ultramicrocells, the latter of which are the dormant , stress-resistant forms of larger cells that form under starvation conditions [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 7 ] (i.e. these larger cells downregulate their metabolism, stop growing and stabilize their DNA to create ultramicrocells that remain viable for years [ 1 ] [ 8 ] ) whereas the small size of ultramicrobacteria is not a starvation response and is consistent even under nutrient-rich conditions.

[ 3 ] The term "nanobacteria" is sometimes used synonymously with ultramicrobacteria in the scientific literature, [ 2 ] but ultramicrobacteria are distinct from the purported nanobacteria or "calcifying nanoparticles", which were proposed to be living organisms that were 0.1 μm in diameter.

[ 9 ] These structures are now thought to be nonliving, [ 10 ] and likely precipitated particles of inorganic material.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] See also [ edit ] L-form bacteria Mycoplasma – smallest known bacteria (300 nm) Nanoarchaeum – smallest known archaeum (400 nm) Nanobacteria – possible lifeforms smaller than bacteria (<200 nm) Nanobe – possible smallest lifeforms (20 nm) Pithovirus – largest known virus (1,500 nm) Pandoravirus – one of the largest known viruses (1,000 nm) Parvovirus – smallest known viruses (18–28 nm) Prion – smallest known infectious agent (≈10 nm) ND5 and MY14 T – two aerobic, gram-negative , rod-shaped bacteria [ 13 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c d e Cavicchioli, Ricardo; Ostrowski, Martin (June 2003).
