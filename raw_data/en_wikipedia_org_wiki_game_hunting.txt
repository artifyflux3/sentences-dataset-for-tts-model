( October 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Common pheasant , widely introduced and hunted as game Game or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily meat ), for recreation (" sporting "), or for trophies .

[ 1 ] The species of animals hunted as game varies in different parts of the world and by different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and birds .

Fish caught non- commercially ( recreational fishing ) are also referred to as game fish .

( May 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The range of animal species hunted by humans varies in different parts of the world. This is influenced by climate , faunal diversity, popular taste and locally accepted views about what can or cannot be legitimately hunted. Sometimes a distinction is also made between varieties and breeds of a particular animal, such as wild turkey and domestic turkey . The flesh of the animal, when butchered for consumption, is often described as having a "gamey" flavour. This difference in taste can be attributed to the natural diet of the animal, which usually results in a lower fat content compared to domestic farm-raised animals.

In some countries, game is classified, including legal classifications with respect to licenses required, as either "small game" or "large game". A single small game licence may cover all small game species and be subject to yearly bag limits . Large game are often subject to individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each individual animal taken (tags).

Africa [ edit ] See also: Elephant meat A hunter and local guides with his kill, 1970 In some parts of Africa , wild animals hunted for their meat are called bushmeat ; see that article for more detailed information on how this operates within the economy (for personal consumption and for money) and the law (including overexploitation and illegal imports). Animals hunted for bushmeat include, but are not limited to: Various species of antelope , including duikers Various species of primates like mandrills or gorillas Rodents like porcupines or cane rats Some of these animals are endangered or otherwise protected, and thus it is illegal to hunt them.

In Africa, animals hunted for their pelts or ivory are sometimes referred to as big game .

Also see the legal definition of game in Eswatini .

[ 2 ] South Africa [ edit ] South Africa is a famous destination for game hunting, with its large biodiversity and therefore impressive variety of game species. Many creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken as a result of being killed for big-game hunting . Commonly hunted species include: Springbok Impala Steenbok Oribi Bushbuck Nyala Greater kudu Common eland Blue wildebeest Black wildebeest Blesbok Bontebok Sable antelope Roan antelope Gemsbok Giraffe Cape buffalo Southern white rhinoceros Plains zebra South Africa also has 62 species of gamebirds, including guineafowl , francolin , partridge , quail , sandgrouse , duck , geese , snipe , bustard and korhaan . Some of these species are no longer hunted, and of the 44 indigenous gamebirds that can potentially be utilised in South Africa, only three, namely the yellow-throated sandgrouse , Delegorgue's pigeon and the African pygmy goose warrant special protection. Of the remaining 41 species, 24 have shown an increase in numbers and distribution range in the last 25 years or so. The status of 14 species appears unchanged, with insufficient information being available for the remaining three species. The gamebirds of South Africa where the population status in 2005 was secure or growing are listed below: Helmeted guineafowl Greywing partridge Redwing partridge Orange River partridge Cape francolin Natal francolin Swainson's francolin Common quail Harlequin quail Namaqua sandgrouse Double-banded sandgrouse Burchell's sandgrouse White-faced duck Egyptian goose Yellow-billed duck Red-billed teal Cape shoveler Southern pochard Knob-billed duck Spur-winged goose Oceania [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] In Australia , game includes: Deer and sambar Duck Magpie geese European rabbit Feral cat Red fox Wild pig Wild goat Kangaroo Emu Crocodile (Saltwater and Freshwater) Feral buffalo Banteng ("Scrub bull") Feral camel Australian feral horse Quail Wild bull Blackbuck Feral donkey Feral dog New Zealand [ edit ] Main article: Hunting in New Zealand Game in New Zealand includes: Chamois Deer , multiple species Pig Tahr Duck , multiple species North America [ edit ] Canada and the United States [ edit ] Big-game hunting See also: Upland game bird and country food In the United States and Canada , white-tailed deer are the most commonly hunted big game.

It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other non-game birds that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 . UK law defines game as including: Black grouse (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers) Red grouse Brown hare Rock ptarmigan Grey and red-legged partridges Common pheasant Deer are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided to those in the Game Act apply to deer (from the Deer Act 1991 ). Deer hunted in the UK are: Red deer Roe deer Fallow deer Sika deer Muntjac deer Chinese water deer and hybrids of these deer Other animals which are hunted in the UK include: Duck , including mallard , tufted duck , teal , northern pintail and common pochard Goose , including greylag goose , Canada goose and pink-footed goose Wood pigeon Cuckoo Eurasian woodcock Common snipe Eurasian golden plover Corncrake Capercaillie are not currently hunted in the UK because of a recent decline in numbers and conservation projects towards their recovery. The ban is generally considered voluntary on private lands, and few birds live away from RSPB or Forestry Commission land allegedly.

Hunting in Germany is very restricted, and it is really hard to practice without living in Germany for a long time.

Meat Preparation [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

( July 2007 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A kitchen interior with a maid and a lady preparing game, c. 1600 Game meat is obtained through the process of hunting animals in their natural habitat, typically with a gun or bow . Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, game meat must be processed to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by game species and size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered . Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be partially butchered in the field because of the difficulty of removing them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer taken during deer seasons, sometimes even at supermarket meat counters. Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to minimize spoilage.

Traditionally, game meat was hung until "high" or "gamey", that is, approaching a state of decomposition .

[ 4 ] However, this adds to the risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact, after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial butchers.

Cooking [ edit ] Wikibooks Cookbook has a recipe/module on Game Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.

[ 5 ] Because some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] It is sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating as in the dish Hasenpfeffer , cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as burgoo .

Safety [ edit ] The Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers that children, pregnant women, fertile-aged women, and people with high blood pressure should not consume game shot with lead -based ammunition more than once a month. Children who often eat such game might develop a slightly lower IQ, as lead influences the development of the central nervous system .

[ 8 ] This can be avoided by hunting with arrows or copper bullets.
