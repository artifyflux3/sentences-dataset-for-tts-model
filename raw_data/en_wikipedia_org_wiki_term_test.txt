Many authors do not name this test or give it a shorter name.

[ 2 ] When testing if a series converges or diverges, this test is often checked first due to its ease of use.

In the case of p-adic analysis the term test is a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence due to the non-Archimedean ultrametric triangle inequality .

Usage [ edit ] Unlike stronger convergence tests , the term test cannot prove by itself that a series converges . In particular, the converse to the test is not true; instead all one can say is: If lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=0,} then ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ a n {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}} may or may not converge. In other words, if lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=0,} the test is inconclusive.

The harmonic series is a classic example of a divergent series whose terms approach zero in the limit as n → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle n\rightarrow \infty } .

[ 3 ] The more general class of p -series , ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 n p , {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{p}}},} exemplifies the possible results of the test: If p ≤ 0, then the n th-term test identifies the series as divergent.

If 0 < p ≤ 1, then the n th-term test is inconclusive, but the series is divergent by the integral test for convergence .

If 1 < p , then the n th-term test is inconclusive, but the series is convergent by the integral test for convergence.

Proofs [ edit ] The test is typically proven in contrapositive form: If ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ a n {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}} converges, then lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=0.} Limit manipulation [ edit ] If s n are the partial sums of the series, then the assumption that the series
converges means that lim n → → ∞ ∞ s n = L {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }s_{n}=L} for some number L . Then [ 4 ] lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = lim n → → ∞ ∞ ( s n − − s n − − 1 ) = lim n → → ∞ ∞ s n − − lim n → → ∞ ∞ s n − − 1 = L − − L = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=\lim _{n\to \infty }(s_{n}-s_{n-1})=\lim _{n\to \infty }s_{n}-\lim _{n\to \infty }s_{n-1}=L-L=0.} Cauchy's criterion [ edit ] Assuming that the series converges implies that it passes Cauchy's convergence test : for every ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} there is a number N such that | a n + 1 + a n + 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n + p | < ε ε {\displaystyle \left|a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\cdots +a_{n+p}\right|<\varepsilon } holds for all n > N and p ≥ 1. Setting p = 1 recovers the claim [ 5 ] lim n → → ∞ ∞ a n = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }a_{n}=0.} Scope [ edit ] The simplest version of the term test applies to infinite series of real numbers . The above two proofs, by invoking the Cauchy criterion or the linearity of the limit, also work in any other normed vector space [ 6 ] or any additively written abelian group .

Notes [ edit ] ^ Kaczor p.336 ^ For example, Rudin (p.60) states only the contrapositive form and does not name it. Brabenec (p.156) calls it just the n th term test . Stewart (p.709) calls it the Test for Divergence . Spivak (p.473) calls it the Vanishing Condition .

^ Rudin p.60 ^ Brabenec p.156; Stewart p.709 ^ Rudin (pp.59-60) uses this proof idea, starting with a different statement of Cauchy criterion.
