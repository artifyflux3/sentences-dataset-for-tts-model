History [ edit ] Endicott College was founded as Endicott Junior College in 1939 by Eleanor Tupper and her husband, George O. Bierkoe . Originally a two-year women's college , its mission was educating women for greater independence and an enhanced position in the workplace.

[ citation needed ] The school was named for John Endicott , the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony .

[ 9 ] It was issued its first charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that same year. It graduated its first class, 20 students, in 1941. In 1944, the school was approved by the state for the granting of associate degrees , and in 1952, Endicott was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges . In 1975, the college dropped the 'Junior' from its name, becoming just Endicott College. In 1994, Endicott became co-educational .

[ 10 ] George Bierkoe served as Endicott's first president from its opening until 1971.

[ 11 ] Eleanor Tupper then served as president until 1980. She subsequently wrote Endicott and I , published in 1985, which details the founding and history of the college.

[ 12 ] Carol Hawkes became the third president of Endicott College in 1980, and during her tenure the college transitioned from a two-year to a four-year institution.

[ 13 ] Francis Gamelin served as Endicott's fourth president as the college searched for Hawkes' successor.

[ 11 ] In 1988, Richard E. Wylie became Endicott's fifth president. Wylie's 30-year tenure was marked by major growth; the college built more than 20 new buildings and expanded its footprint to 235 acres of land alongside Beverly's scenic coast. In 2018, Kathleen Hildreth Barnes stepped in as interim president while Endicott's board engaged in a search for the college's next president. On March 27, 2019, Endicott announced that Steven R. DiSalvo would become its seventh president.
