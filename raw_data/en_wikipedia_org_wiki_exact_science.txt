For the company of the same name, see Exact Sciences (company) .

Ulugh Beg 's meridian arc for precise astronomical measurements (15th c.) The exact sciences or quantitative sciences , sometimes called the exact mathematical sciences , [ 1 ] are those sciences "which admit of absolute precision in their results"; especially the mathematical sciences .

[ 2 ] Examples of the exact sciences are mathematics, optics , astronomy , [ 3 ] and physics , which many philosophers from René Descartes , Gottfried Leibniz , and Immanuel Kant to the logical positivists took as paradigms of rational and objective knowledge .

[ 4 ] These sciences have been practiced in many cultures from antiquity [ 5 ] [ 6 ] to modern times.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Given their ties to mathematics, the exact sciences are characterized by accurate quantitative expression, precise predictions and/or rigorous methods of testing hypotheses involving quantifiable predictions and measurements .

[ 9 ] The distinction between the quantitative exact sciences and those sciences that deal with the causes of things is due to Aristotle , who distinguished mathematics from natural philosophy [ 10 ] and considered the exact sciences to be the "more natural of the branches of mathematics." [ 11 ] Thomas Aquinas employed this distinction when he said that astronomy explains the spherical shape of the Earth [ 12 ] by mathematical reasoning while physics explains it by material causes .

[ 13 ] This distinction was widely, but not universally, accepted until the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.

[ 14 ] Edward Grant has proposed that a fundamental change leading to the new sciences was the unification of the exact sciences and physics by Johannes Kepler , Isaac Newton , and others, which resulted in a quantitative investigation of the physical causes of natural phenomena.
