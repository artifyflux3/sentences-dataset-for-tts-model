The theorem is named for Joseph Bertrand , Victor Puiseux , and Charles François Diguet.

Let p be a point on a smooth surface M . The geodesic circle of radius r centered at p is the set of all points whose geodesic distance from p is equal to r . Let C ( r ) denote the circumference of this circle, and A ( r ) denote the area of the disc contained within the circle.  The Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem asserts that K ( p ) = lim r → → 0 + 3 2 π π r − − C ( r ) π π r 3 = lim r → → 0 + 12 π π r 2 − − A ( r ) π π r 4 .

{\displaystyle K(p)=\lim _{r\to 0^{+}}3{\frac {2\pi r-C(r)}{\pi r^{3}}}=\lim _{r\to 0^{+}}12{\frac {\pi r^{2}-A(r)}{\pi r^{4}}}.} The theorem is closely related to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem .
