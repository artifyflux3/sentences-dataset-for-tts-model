The Geographer (1668–69), by Johannes Vermeer A geographer is a physical scientist, social scientist or humanist whose area of study is geography , the study of Earth's natural environment and human society, including how society and nature interacts. The Greek prefix "geo" means "earth" and the Greek suffix, "graphy", meaning "description", so a geographer is someone who studies the earth.

[ 1 ] The word "geography" is a Middle French word that is believed to have been first used in 1540.

[ 2 ] Although geographers are historically known as people who make maps , map making is actually the field of study of cartography , a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to human society and how human society affects the natural environment.

[ 3 ] In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society and culture. Some geographers are practitioners of GIS ( geographic information system ) and are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms.

[ 4 ] The paintings by Johannes Vermeer titled The Geographer and The Astronomer are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668–69.

Areas of study in geography [ edit ] History of geography Graeco-Roman Chinese Islamic Age of Discovery History of cartography Historical geography Environmental determinism Regional geography Quantitative revolution Critical geography v t e Subdividing geography is challenging, as the discipline is broad, interdisciplinary, ancient, and has been approached differently by different cultures. Attempts have gone back centuries, and include the "Four traditions of geography" and applied "branches." [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Four traditions of geography [ edit ] Main article: Four traditions of geography The four traditions of geography were proposed in 1964 by William D. Pattison in a paper titled "The Four Traditions of Geography" appearing in the Journal of Geography .

[ 5 ] [ 8 ] These  traditions are: spatial or locational tradition [ 5 ] [ 8 ] area studies or regional tradition [ 5 ] [ 8 ] Human–Environment interaction tradition (originally referred to as the "man-land tradition") [ 5 ] [ 8 ] Earth science tradition [ 5 ] [ 8 ] Branches of geography [ edit ] Main page: Category:Branches of geography The UNESCO Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems subdivides geography into three major fields of study, which are then further subdivided.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] These are: Human geography : including urban geography , cultural geography , economic geography , political geography , historical geography , marketing geography , health geography , and social geography .

[ 9 ] Physical geography : including geomorphology , hydrology , glaciology , biogeography , climatology , meteorology , pedology , oceanography , geodesy , and environmental geography .

[ 10 ] Technical geography : including geoinformatics , geographic information science , geovisualization , and spatial analysis .

Five themes of geography [ edit ] Main article: Five themes of geography The National Geographic Society identifies five broad key themes for geographers: human-environment interaction Location Movement Place Regions [ 11 ] Notable geographers [ edit ] Main articles: List of geographers and List of Graeco-Roman geographers Gerardus Mercator Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) – published Cosmos and founder of the sub-field biogeography.
