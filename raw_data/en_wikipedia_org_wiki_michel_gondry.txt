Find sources: "Michel Gondry" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Gondry in 2008 Gondry's vision and career began with his emphasis on emotion. Much of his inspiration, he says, came from the film Le voyage en ballon . He stated: "When I watch this movie, I dream I'm flying and then I do stories where people are flying. I think it's directly influencing." [ 5 ] His career as a filmmaker began with creating music videos for the French rock band Oui Oui , in which he also served as a drummer. The style of his videos for Oui Oui caught the attention of music artist Björk , who asked him to direct the video for her song " Human Behaviour ". The collaboration proved long-lasting, with Gondry directing a total of eight music videos for Björk.

[ 6 ] Other artists who have collaborated with Gondry on more than one occasion include Daft Punk , the White Stripes , the Chemical Brothers , the Vines , Steriogram , Radiohead , and Beck . Gondry's video for Lucas Secon 's " Lucas with the Lid Off " was nominated in the Best Music Video (short form) category at the 37th Grammy Awards , [ 7 ] (one of two Gondry music videos nominated that year along with Sinéad O'Connor 's "Fire on Babylon").

Gondry has also created numerous television commercials. He pioneered the " bullet time " technique later adapted in The Matrix in the 1996 "Smarienberg" commercial for Smirnoff vodka , as well as directing a trio of inventive holiday-themed advertisements for clothing retailer Gap .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Gondry, along with directors Spike Jonze and David Fincher , is representative of the influx of music video directors into feature film. Gondry made his feature film debut in 2001 with Human Nature , garnering mixed reviews. His second film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (also his second collaboration with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman ), was released in 2004 and received very favorable reviews, becoming one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year.

[ citation needed ] Eternal Sunshine utilizes many of the image manipulation techniques that Gondry had experimented with in his music videos. Gondry won an Academy Award alongside Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth for the screenplay of Eternal Sunshine . The style of Gondry's music videos often relies on videography and camera tricks which play with frames of reference .

[ citation needed ] Gondry also directed the musical documentary Dave Chappelle's Block Party (2006) which followed comedian Dave Chappelle as he attempted to hold a large, free concert in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn . His following film, The Science of Sleep , hit theaters in September 2006. This film stars Mexican actor Gael García Bernal , and marked a return to the fantastical, surreal techniques he employed in Eternal Sunshine .

[ citation needed ] According to the Guinness World Records 2004 , Gondry's Levi's 501 Jeans "Drugstore" spot holds the record for "Most awards won by a TV commercial".

[ 10 ] The commercial was never aired in North America because of the suggestive content involving purchasing latex condoms.

He was asked by French comic duet Éric and Ramzy to direct Seuls Two , but declined; by his suggestion, Éric and Ramzy subsequently asked Mr Oizo to direct another movie, Steak .

[ 11 ] In September 2006, Gondry made his debut as an installation artist at Deitch Projects in New York City's SoHo gallery district. The show, called "The Science of Sleep: An Exhibition of Sculpture and Pathological Creepy Little Gifts" featured props from his film, The Science of Sleep , as well as film clips and a selection of gifts that the artist had given to women he was interested in, many of them former or current collaborators, Karen Baird, Kishu Chand, Dorothy Barrick and Lauri Faggioni.

[ 12 ] A leitmotif of the film is a 'Disastrology' calendar; Gondry commissioned the painter Baptiste Ibar to draw harrowing images of natural and human disasters.

[ 13 ] Gondry was an Artist in Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005 and 2006. Later directing the music video for the Paul McCartney song " Dance Tonight ", in which Gondry makes a cameo appearance .

[ 14 ] Gondry directed " Unnatural Love ", the fifth episode in season two of HBO's Flight of the Conchords .

[ 15 ] Interior Design, one third of the 2008 anthology film Tokyo!

, was next for Gondry. Interior Design was based on the comic book "Cecil and Jordan in New York" by Gabrielle Bell but was adapted from New York City to Tokyo for the film.
