It is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the strongest landfall in the Atlantic basin in terms of maximum sustained winds. It is regarded as the worst natural disaster in the Bahamas' recorded history.

[ 1 ] With winds peaking at 185 mph (295 km/h), it was also one of the most powerful hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic Ocean in terms of 1-minute sustained winds , and the strongest since Wilma in 2005 . Dorian was the fourth named storm , second hurricane, the first major hurricane , and the first Category 5 hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season . Dorian struck the Abaco Islands on September 1 with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h), tying with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the highest wind speeds of an Atlantic hurricane ever recorded at landfall. Dorian went on to strike Grand Bahama at similar intensity, stalling just north of the territory with unrelenting winds for at least 24 hours. The resultant damage to these islands was catastrophic; most structures were flattened or swept to sea, and at least 70,000 people were left homeless. After it ravaged through The Bahamas, Dorian proceeded along the coasts of the Southeastern United States and Atlantic Canada , leaving behind considerable damage and economic losses in those regions.

Dorian developed from a tropical wave on August 24 over the Central Atlantic. The storm moved through the Lesser Antilles and became a hurricane north of the Greater Antilles on August 28. Dorian proceeded to undergo rapid intensification over the following days, before reaching its peak as a Category 5 hurricane with one-minute sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars (26.87 inHg) by September 1. It made landfall in The Bahamas in Elbow Cay , just east of Abaco Island, and again on Grand Bahama several hours later, where it remained nearly stationary for the next day or so. After weakening considerably, Dorian began moving northwestward on September 3, parallel to the east coast of Florida . Dwindling in strength, the hurricane turned to the northeast the next day and made landfall on Cape Hatteras at Category 2 intensity on September 6. Dorian transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 7, before striking first Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland with hurricane-force winds on the next day. The storm finally dissipated near Greenland on September 10.

From August 26 to August 28, the storm affected several parts of the northernmost Lesser Antilles. Damaging winds primarily affected the Virgin Islands where gusts reached 111 mph (179 km/h). Extensive precautionary measures were taken to mitigate damage, especially in Puerto Rico , where one person died. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, impacts from the storm were relatively minor. In preparation for the storm, the states of Florida, Georgia , South Carolina , North Carolina and Virginia all declared a state of emergency and many coastal counties from Florida to North Carolina issued mandatory evacuation orders. Damage in The Bahamas was catastrophic due to the prolonged and intense storm conditions, including heavy rainfall, high winds and storm surge , with thousands of homes destroyed and at least 77 direct deaths recorded, 74 of which occurred in The Bahamas. The true death toll is unknown, with 245 people still missing as of August 2020.

[ 2 ] Dorian is the costliest disaster in Bahamian history, estimated to have left behind $3.4 billion (2020 USD) in damage in that country, while causing a total of $5.1 billion in damage overall. Due to the damage and loss of life, the name Dorian was later retired from the Atlantic rotating naming lists by the World Meteorological Organization .

Meteorological history Main article: Meteorological history of Hurricane Dorian Map plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir–Simpson scale Map key Saffir–Simpson scale Tropical depression (≤38 mph, ≤62 km/h) Tropical storm (39–73 mph, 63–118 km/h) Category 1 (74–95 mph, 119–153 km/h) Category 2 (96–110 mph, 154–177 km/h) Category 3 (111–129 mph, 178–208 km/h) Category 4 (130–156 mph, 209–251 km/h) Category 5 (≥157 mph, ≥252 km/h) Unknown Storm type Tropical cyclone Subtropical cyclone Extratropical cyclone , remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression On August 19, 2019, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified a tropical wave —an elongated trough of low air pressure —within a monsoon trough over Guinea and Senegal in western Africa.

Convective activity associated with the wave was limited by an abundance of Saharan dust in the region.

[ 3 ] Propagating west over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the system remained disorganized for several days.

[ 4 ] On August 23, a defined area of low pressure consolidated at the surface and thunderstorm activity increased.

[ 5 ] The system acquired sufficient organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Five at 15:00 UTC on August 24. At this time the system was situated 805 mi (1,300 km) east-southeast of Barbados . A deep ridge imparted continued westward movement of the depression, steering it toward the Lesser Antilles .

[ 6 ] A small cyclone, it soon developed a defined inner core with a 12 mi (18 km) wide eye-like feature. This marked the system's intensification into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Dorian by the NHC.

[ 7 ] Thereafter, moderate wind shear and surrounding dry air limited further organization.

[ 8 ] Rainbands gradually wrapped more around Dorian on August 25–26, though convection remained inconsistent.

Dorian continued moving west and made landfall at 01:00 UTC on August 27 in Barbados, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain.

[ 13 ] It then started moving northwestward toward Saint Lucia . At 11:00 UTC of the same day, Dorian made landfall on the island of Saint Lucia as a tropical storm, [ 14 ] briefly disrupting the core of the storm, before entering the Caribbean Sea .

[ 15 ] The storm underwent a center relocation further north, to the west of Martinique , causing the island to experience tropical storm-force winds as well.

[ 16 ] Dorian had been predicted to travel northwest and pass over or near the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico , [ 17 ] possibly allowing their mountainous terrain to weaken the tropical storm. At that time, dry air and wind shear were expected to prevent Dorian from attaining hurricane status—although just barely.

[ 18 ] However, Dorian took a more northerly track than expected, causing it to pass to the east of Puerto Rico and hit the US Virgin Islands . On August 28, Dorian intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as it approached the US Virgin Islands, where hurricane-force winds were recorded; at 15:30 UTC that day, Dorian became a hurricane and made landfall in Saint Croix and a few hours later, at 18:00 UTC, Dorian made landfall on Saint Thomas at a slightly higher intensity.

[ 14 ] [ 19 ] However, the hurricane's small size prevented mainland Puerto Rico from experiencing hurricane- or tropical storm-force winds, although this was not the case for the Spanish Virgin Islands .

[ 20 ] Once the system moved north past the Virgin Islands, the storm entered a more favorable environment. On the next day, the system started to rapidly intensify , reaching Category 2 status early on August 30.

[ 21 ] Rapid intensification continued, and the storm eventually reached major hurricane status several hours later, on the same day.

[ 22 ] This strengthening trend came to a halt for the remainder of the day, but soon resumed.

[ 23 ] The system continued strengthening, and on August 31, Dorian attained Category 4 major hurricane status.

[ 24 ] Dorian reached Category 5 intensity on the following day.

[ 25 ] On the morning of September 1, a dropsonde deployed by a NOAA aircraft measured a wind gust of 176 knots (326 km/h; 203 mph) at the surface. With one-minute sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 913 mbar (27.0 inHg), the NHC noted that Dorian was the strongest hurricane in modern records to affect the northwestern Bahamas.

[ 26 ] Hurricane Dorian as seen from the International Space Station on September 2, 2019 At 16:40 UTC on September 1, Dorian made landfall on Great Abaco Island in The Bahamas, with one-minute sustained winds of 185 mph (298 km/h), wind gusts over 220 mph (355 km/h), and a central barometric pressure of 910 millibars (27 inHg), [ 27 ] [ 28 ] as Dorian reached its peak intensity during landfall.

[ 29 ] Storm chaser Josh Morgerman observed a pressure of 913.4 mbar (26.97 inHg) in Marsh Harbour .

[ 30 ] Dorian's forward speed decreased around this time, slowing to a westward crawl of 5 mph (8.0 km/h).

[ 29 ] At 02:00 UTC on September 2, Dorian made landfall on Grand Bahama near the same intensity, with the same sustained wind speed.

[ 31 ] Afterward, Dorian's forward speed slowed to just 1 knot (1.2 mph; 1.9 km/h), as the Bermuda High that was steering the storm westward weakened. Later that day, the storm began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle to the north of Grand Bahama; the Bermuda High to the northeast of Dorian also collapsed, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Around the same time, the combination of the eyewall replacement cycle and upwelling of cold water caused Dorian to begin weakening, with Dorian dropping to Category 4 status at 15:00 UTC.

[ 34 ] Due to the absence of steering currents, Dorian stalled north of Grand Bahama for about a day.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Dorian subsequently weakened to a Category 2 storm on September 3, before beginning to move northwestward at 15:00 UTC, parallel to the east coast of Florida, with Dorian's wind field expanding during this time.

[ 36 ] While moving northwestward, Dorian gradually reorganized. At 06:00 UTC on September 5, Dorian moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and completed its eyewall replacement cycle, reintensifying into a Category 3 hurricane off the coast of South Carolina .

[ 37 ] However, several hours later, Dorian encountered high wind shear , causing the storm to weaken to a Category 2 hurricane [ 38 ] early on September 6.

[ 39 ] Then, at 12:35 UTC that day, Dorian made landfall in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 956 mb (28.2 inHg).

[ 14 ] [ 40 ] Afterward, Dorian began to transition into an extratropical cyclone as it quickly moved northeastward, completing its transition on September 7.

[ 41 ] The storm maintained its intensity, due to baroclinic processes, generating Category 2 hurricane-equivalent winds.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] Several hours later, at 7:05 p.m.

AST on September 7 (23:05 UTC on September 7), Dorian made landfall on Sambro Creek , Nova Scotia , as a Category 1-equivalent extratropical storm , [ 44 ] before making its fourth and final landfall on the northern part of Newfoundland several hours later.

[ 14 ] [ 45 ] By 11:00 p.m. AST on September 8 (03:00 UTC on September 9), Dorian had moved into the Labrador Sea , 375 miles off the coast, moving northeastward at 24 mph (39 km/h), with wind speeds of 60 mph (97 km/h), maintaining tropical storm -strength winds.

[ 46 ] As Dorian no longer posed a threat to Atlantic Canada at that time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the storm.

[ 47 ] On September 10, Dorian's extratropical remnant dissipated off the coast of southern Greenland .

[ 48 ] Preparations Caribbean Main article: Effects of Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean Prior to Dorian's arrival in the Lesser Antilles, local governments issued various tropical cyclone warnings and watches across the islands.

[ 14 ] LIAT cancelled multiple flights across the Lesser Antilles due to the storm and airports across the Virgin Islands temporarily suspended operations.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Many of the threatened islands suffered devastating impacts in 2017 from Hurricanes Irma and Maria , lending to greater vigilance.

[ 51 ] In Barbados, thirty-eight shelters opened island-wide, with 103 residents seeking refuge in them. All public services were suspended for the duration of the storm.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Homeless persons were transported to shelter by emergency personnel.

[ 54 ] On August 26, St. Lucia prime minister Allen Chastanet announced that the nation would "shut down" for the duration of Dorian.

[ 56 ] The Ministry of Public Works mobilized heavy machinery and the police were placed on high alert.

[ 51 ] Puerto Rico Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency for the territory on August 27.

[ 19 ] The following day, the Puerto Rico National Guard was activated to support any relief operations related to the storm.

[ 57 ] Fears centered around the still-unstable power grid which was largely destroyed by Maria; [ 58 ] hundreds of utility workers were deployed to quickly fix any outages.

[ 59 ] In some areas, power lines remained affixed to palm trees.

[ 58 ] An estimated 30,000 homes still had damaged roofs from the 2017 hurricane.

[ 60 ] Territory-wide, 360 shelters with a collective capacity of 48,500 persons opened; 24,000 cots were distributed to these shelters.

[ 19 ] A state of emergency was declared for the United States Virgin Islands on August 28.

[ 19 ] Curfews were enacted for the British and United States Virgin Islands for the duration of the hurricane.

[ 49 ] [ 61 ] Bahamas Main article: Effects of Hurricane Dorian in The Bahamas A warning to take immediate cover was issued by the NHC Twitter account, at 11 a.m.

EDT on September 1, 2019, as Dorian made landfall in Elbow Cay , Bahamas , at 16:40 UTC as a Category 5 hurricane.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Samuel Butler, the Royal Bahamas Police Force assistant commissioner with responsibility for Grand Bahama and the Northern Region (Abaco, Bimini and the Berry Islands), told residents "if you do not heed to the warning [...] we know that the end could be fatal" and Don Cornish, the administrator with the City of Freeport told others seeking shelter at Old Bahama Bay Hotel "that is not a good idea [...] reconsider that decision".

[ 64 ] Mainland United States President Trump at a FEMA briefing on the hurricane Florida On August 28, Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 26 counties in the hurricane's expected path.

[ 59 ] [ 65 ] This later expanded to the entire state on August 29. First responders distributed sandbags in many counties. Residents began stocking up on supplies throughout the state. In Brevard County , locals worked to trim large tree branches to protect power lines.

[ 66 ] The University of Central Florida , Stetson University , Rollins College , and Daytona State College cancelled classes between August 30 and September 3.

[ 68 ] When it became apparent that Dorian would near the Florida coastline, a tropical storm watch was issued for the Florida east coast from Deerfield Beach to Sebastian Inlet on August 31. It was upgraded to a tropical storm warning a few hours later. A hurricane watch was issued for the area north of Deerfield Beach on September 1, and it was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. On the night of September 1, a hurricane watch was issued for Volusia and Broward counties, which was later upgraded to a hurricane warning and extended down the coast.

As a result of this near-miss, a tropical storm watch was issued on September 5 from Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach , including Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard , in Massachusetts . It was upgraded to a warning later the same day. On September 6, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of Maine from Bar Harbor to Eastport .

[ 121 ] Alabama controversy Main article: Hurricane Dorian–Alabama controversy See also: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump § Hurricane Dorian On September 1, President Donald Trump tweeted that multiple states, including Alabama , "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." [ 122 ] By that date, no weather forecaster was predicting that Dorian would impact Alabama, and the eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the Atlantic coast.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] Trump was apparently relying on information that was several days old.

[ 125 ] Twenty minutes later, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tweet that appeared to contradict Trump, saying that Alabama "will NOT see any impacts from Dorian".

[ 126 ] Over the following days Trump insisted repeatedly that he had been right about the hurricane threatening Alabama.

[ 127 ] President Trump displays the altered map in a video published by the White House on September 4, 2019.

On September 4 in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of the National Hurricane Center's August 29 diagram of Dorian's projected track. The modification was done with a black Sharpie marker to extend the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified.

[ 130 ] The incident resulted in the hashtag "Sharpiegate" trending on Twitter.

[ 131 ] Later the same day, Trump tweeted a map dated August 28, showing numerous projected paths of Dorian. Trump falsely asserted "almost all models" showed Dorian hitting Alabama, even though the map showed most predicted paths would not enter Alabama.

[ 123 ] [ 132 ] On September 6, NOAA published an unsigned statement which supported Trump's initial claim that Alabama was a target of the storm and criticized the Birmingham NWS office for denying it.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] It was later revealed that NOAA had been ordered to issue such a statement by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , [ 135 ] and that he had been told by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to get NOAA to support Trump's original statement that Alabama was threatened.

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] This direct White House involvement raised questions about political influence over NOAA, and is under investigation by multiple agencies including NOAA's acting chief scientist, the inspector general of the Commerce Department, and the House of Representatives committee which oversees NOAA.

On September 1, 2019, hurricane conditions arrived in some of the Abaco Islands . A few hours later, destructive conditions arrived, with Hurricane Dorian making landfall as a Category 5 hurricane at 16:40 UTC, becoming the strongest hurricane in modern records to strike the northwestern Bahamas.

[ 26 ] Around 12:30 pm AST, Category 5 winds arrived at The Bahamas with the eyewall . Gusts of over 200 mph (320 km/h) also occurred. Devastating storm surge of up to 23 feet swept away many buildings and submerged a large part of the affected areas.

[ 164 ] At 7:00 (UTC) on September 2, 2019, Grand Bahama International Airport was underwater.

[ 165 ] Minister of Agriculture Michael Pintard reported an estimated storm tide of 20 to 25 ft (6.1 to 7.6 m) at his home on Grand Bahama.

[ 166 ] The Bahamas prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said "This is a deadly [...] monster storm".

[ 167 ] Marsh Harbour received "catastrophic damage", according to an ABC News team.

[ 168 ] Over 75% of the homes had been damaged, [ 169 ] Marsh Harbour International Airport's runway was underwater, [ 170 ] there was significant flooding on streets and beaches, damage to trees and with some home's roofs ripped off entirely.

[ 171 ] The scene was described by an ABC reporter as "pure hell".

[ 168 ] An eight-year-old boy drowned in the storm surge, while the boy's sister was also reported to be missing.

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] Four other people, along with the eight-year-old boy, were confirmed dead on the Abaco Islands, the prime minister told reporters on Monday.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] By Wednesday, the death toll had been raised to twenty, according to the prime minister.

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] This soon increased to forty-three by Saturday. However, a Bahamas newspaper suggested that the actual death toll could be over 3,000.

[ 178 ] The local animal shelters were hit hard by the storm with the Humane Society of Grand Bahama's experiencing stronger storm surges than expected. Workers had attempted to help the animals before retreating to the attic crawl space but almost half of the 190 dogs in their care died in the flooding and some of the 85 cats died as well.

[ 179 ] The numbers of animals has varied with earlier reports claiming that there were 135 dogs and 155 cats in the shelters care, with 80 cats and 90 dogs surviving.

[ 180 ] It is feared that the Bahama nuthatch may have been wiped out by Dorian, as it caused catastrophic damage to the Bahamian pineyards .

[ 181 ] A 2020 post-hurricane assessment by the IUCN Red List still entertains the probability of the species being extant, although likely having a maximum population size of only 50 individuals and likely well below that, and indicates that extensive surveys for the species will be needed to confirm its status.

[ 182 ] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reported that as many as 13,000 homes were damaged or destroyed on Abaco Island. Extensive flooding is also believed to have caused water wells to be contaminated with seawater, creating an urgent need for clean water.

[ 183 ] Total damage in the country reached $3.4 billion. Property damage accounted for $2.5 billion; the nation suffered $717 million in economic losses; and $221 million was required for debris removal and cleaning a large oil spill.

[ 186 ] On September 3, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis stated, "Our urgent task will be to provide food, water, shelter, safety and security. Additional food will be delivered by NEMA tomorrow." He went on to say that Dorian was "the greatest national crisis in our country's history." [ 187 ] The United Nations projected that as of Saturday, September 7, at least 70,000 people had been left homeless on Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands.

[ 188 ] On Thursday, September 12, over 1,300 people were missing or unaccounted for in The Bahamas, a number which plummeted from 2,500 over the previous two weeks.

[ 189 ] On September 26, the number of people missing in The Bahamas dropped to 600, while the official death toll rose to 56.

[ 190 ] By February 2020, the death toll rose to 74; including 63 in Abaco and 11 in Grand Bahama, with 282 people still reported as missing.

[ 146 ] Mainland United States The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated total damage in the United States to be in excess of $1.2 billion.

[ 192 ] One death occurred in the central coast barrier island town of Indiatlantic , when a man fell three stories while boarding up his home.

[ 193 ] During September 3 and 4, tropical storm force winds continued to move up the east coast of Florida, with the storm's eye staying about 100 miles away from landfall.

[ 194 ] Many areas along the Atlantic coast reporting gusts of over tropical storm force, especially at Cape Canaveral .

[ 195 ] At 8 am EDT on September 4 at St. Augustine Beach, a sustained wind of 46 miles per hour (74 km/h) and a gust of 59 miles per hour (95 km/h) was reported.

[ 196 ] In Jacksonville , the city experienced tropical storm force winds on September 4 which blew around debris and knocked out power. A lifeguard rescued a woman pulled out by a rip current in Jacksonville Beach while other swimmers were ordered out of the water.

Acadia National Park closed Sand Beach and Thunder Hole as a precaution and warned people to keep their distance from the waves.

[ 215 ] Atlantic Canada Crane toppled by Dorian's hurricane-force winds on September 7, in Halifax, Nova Scotia On September 7, 2019, at 5 p.m. EDT, Nova Scotia started to experience hurricane-force winds. By 7 p.m. EDT, the center of the storm passed over Halifax , while tropical storm conditions were being felt in Prince Edward Island .

[ 216 ] By September 8, approximately 412,000 customers in Nova Scotia lost power, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the province, as well as 80,000 customers in New Brunswick .

[ 217 ] Flooding was reported, roofs were torn off buildings, and a crane collapsed onto a building being constructed.

[ 218 ] The collapse led to local evacuations for some residents and businesses.

[ 219 ] First responders evacuated 31 persons from a campground in Prince Edward Island early Sunday morning, on September 7, as it was inundated by storm surge.

[ 220 ] Though Dorian was post-tropical on arrival, winds off the coast of Nova Scotia were estimated to reach 155 km/h (96 mph), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane.

[ 221 ] Rainfall totals were highest in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia , which received 161 mm (6.3 in) of rain. Various stations across Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island recorded rainfall amounts in excess of 130 mm (5.1 in).

[ 223 ] Seven thousand customers were without power there at one point, representing nearly all customers on the islands. On the night of September 7, a buoy off the coast of Newfoundland detected a 100 ft (30 m) rogue wave , which had been generated by Dorian's winds.

[ 224 ] Insurance damage across the region was estimated at C$ 105 million (US$78.9 million), [ 151 ] with power grid damage in Nova Scotia alone accounting for $39 million (Canadian) by Nova Scotia Power, making it the costliest storm in Nova Scotia Power 's history.

[ 225 ] Aftermath U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents deliver relief supplies to The Bahamas.

Grand Celebration helped transport evacuees from The Bahamas to Florida.

U.S. Customs agents examine documents for evacuees.

Bahamian prime minister Hubert Minnis praised the United States for "assisting us with all of our needs." President Donald Trump assured The Bahamian prime minister of help in relief efforts.

[ 226 ] In September 2019, President Donald Trump stated that his administration is planning to extend temporary protected status to immigrants from the hurricane-hit Bahamas.

[ 227 ] There was confusion with the statement however, with the acting Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan stating that the US would "...accept anyone on humanitarian reasons...".

[ 228 ] Shortly after his statement Trump stated that no one would be allowed in without proper documentation, claiming "...The Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to The Bahamas that weren't supposed to be there" and the need to protect the US against gang members and drug dealers.

[ 229 ] The Bahamas Paradise , Royal Caribbean , Norwegian , and Carnival cruise lines started sending water bottles and meals to The Bahamas. The Grand Celebration offered to give a chance for evacuees to evacuate to Florida free of charge, given they have the proper documentation.

[ 230 ] On September 7, the Grand Celebration helped bring more than 1,100 evacuees to Florida. The company stated in a press release that "the cruise line spent nearly a full day clearing potential evacuees, including vetting their visa and passport documentation." [ 231 ] The Royal Caribbean International also helped deliver more than 43,000 water bottles and 10,000 meals to The Bahamas.

[ 230 ] The United States branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses also participated in the relief efforts, delivering 100+ tons of relief supplies and 700 volunteer workers to the affected areas.

[ 232 ] The evacuation process was not without confusion as many evacuees who had boarded the Balearia Caribbean, were not told until the vessel had almost departed that anyone traveling to the United States without a visa must disembark. This caused many, including families with children to disembark. Blame for the confusion was placed on US Customs and Border Protection by the vessel who claimed to have been told that visa's were not necessary, and on the vessel by the US Customs and Border Protection who stated the vessel did not coordinate properly.

[ 233 ] As the hurricane had damaged or destroyed a majority of the Humane Society of Grand Bahama and killed many of the animals in its care, a GoFundMe was created in order to help renovate and aid the organization's locations. Surviving animals were airlifted to the United States in order to disperse them to other shelters while the organization was stabilized.

[ 234 ] About 300 military personnel from the Canadian Armed Forces were deployed to the Halifax area to assist with recovery.

[ 235 ] Parks Canada estimated that 80 per cent of the trees in the western, Cavendish segment of Prince Edward Island National Park were downed by the storm, as well as causing 2 m (6.6 ft) of coastal erosion .

[ 236 ] All public schools in Nova Scotia were closed on September 9 and 10. Public schools were closed across Prince Edward Island on the 9th, and most re-opened the next day.

News reports stated that the Bahama nuthatch has been wiped out by Dorian as it caused impact on the Bahamian pineyards .

[ 239 ] [ 26 ] Dorian is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the highest sustained winds at landfall in an Atlantic hurricane; [ 240 ] by the same metric, it is also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in 2005. By central pressure, it was the fifth lowest pressure of a hurricane at landfall. Dorian is one of only two Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall on the Abaco Islands , the other having occurred in 1932 , [ 241 ] and is the only such storm on record to have impacted Grand Bahama .

[ 242 ] With Dorian, 2019 became the fourth consecutive year to produce at least one Category 5 hurricane in the North Atlantic.

[ 243 ] [ nb 2 ] Additionally, Dorian featured the highest sustained winds in an Atlantic hurricane recorded at latitude (26.6°N), [ 244 ] and was the strongest Atlantic-basin hurricane ever detected outside of the tropics , surpassing Hurricane Irma .

[ 245 ] Dorian also tracked the least distance in a 24-hour period recorded for an Atlantic major hurricane since Hurricane Betsy in 1965 .

[ 245 ] The storm impacted a single land area as a Category 5 hurricane for the longest duration recorded in the Atlantic basin, with portions of Dorian's eyewall striking Great Abaco Island and Grand Bahama with Category 5 winds for about 22 hours.

[ 246 ] Retirement Due to the disastrous effects of the hurricane, particularly in The Bahamas, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) retired the name Dorian from its rotating name lists in April 2021, and it will never again be used to name an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Dexter for the 2025 season .

[ 247 ] It was initially expected that Dorian would be retired in the spring of 2020. However, the WMO's 2020 hurricane committee meeting was held online and shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic , which resulted in insufficient time for discussing potential retirements and replacements of tropical cyclone names.
