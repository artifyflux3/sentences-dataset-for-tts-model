M = m − − 5 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ D L 10 pc {\displaystyle M=m-5\log _{10}{\frac {D_{L}}{10\,{\text{pc}}}}\!\,} which gives: D L = 10 ( m − − M ) 5 + 1 {\displaystyle D_{L}=10^{{\frac {(m-M)}{5}}+1}} where D L is measured in parsecs . For nearby objects (say, in the Milky Way ) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in Euclidean space .

The relation is less clear for distant objects like quasars far beyond the Milky Way since the apparent magnitude is affected by spacetime curvature , redshift , and time dilation . Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.

Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship, F = L 4 π π D L 2 {\displaystyle F={\frac {L}{4\pi D_{L}^{2}}}} where F is flux (W·m −2 ), and L is luminosity (W). From this the luminosity distance (in meters) can be expressed as: D L = L 4 π π F {\displaystyle D_{L}={\sqrt {\frac {L}{4\pi F}}}} The luminosity distance is related to the "comoving transverse distance" D M {\displaystyle D_{M}} by D L = ( 1 + z ) D M {\displaystyle D_{L}=(1+z)D_{M}} and with the angular diameter distance D A {\displaystyle D_{A}} by the Etherington's reciprocity theorem : D L = ( 1 + z ) 2 D A {\displaystyle D_{L}=(1+z)^{2}D_{A}} where z is the redshift .

D M {\displaystyle D_{M}} is a factor that allows calculation of the comoving distance between two objects with the same redshift but at different positions of the sky; if the two objects are separated by an angle δ δ θ θ {\displaystyle \delta \theta } , the comoving distance between them would be D M δ δ θ θ {\displaystyle D_{M}\delta \theta } . In a spatially flat universe, the comoving transverse distance D M {\displaystyle D_{M}} is exactly equal to the radial comoving distance D C {\displaystyle D_{C}} , i.e. the comoving distance from ourselves to the object.
