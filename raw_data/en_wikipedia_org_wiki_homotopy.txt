This article is about topology. For the generalization in homological algebra, see [Chain homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_homotopy "Chain homotopy"). For chemistry, see [Homotopic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopic_groups "Homotopic groups").

The two dashed [paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(topology) "Path (topology)") shown above are homotopic relative to their endpoints. The animation represents one possible homotopy.

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), two [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)") from one [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") to another are called **homotopic** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): ὁμός _homós_'same, similar' and τόπος _tópos_'place') if one can be "continuously deformed" into the other, such a deformation being called a **homotopy** ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-1)[_hə-MOT-ə-pee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-2)[_HOH-moh-toh-pee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_groups "Homotopy groups") and [cohomotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomotopy_groups "Cohomotopy groups"), important [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-3)

In practice, there are technical difficulties in using homotopies with certain spaces. Algebraic topologists work with [compactly generated spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactly_generated_space "Compactly generated space"), [CW complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex "CW complex"), or [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(homotopy_theory) "Spectrum (homotopy theory)").

A homotopy and its inverse, between two [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of the [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") into ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5): as "the surface of a doughnut" and as "the surface of a coffee mug". This is also an example of an [isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Isotopy).

Formally, a homotopy between two [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)")_f_ and _g_ from a topological space _X_ to a topological space _Y_ is defined to be a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_several_real_variables#Continuity_and_limit "Function of several real variables")![Image 4: {\displaystyle H:X\times [0,1]\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ee6d774b94233094277cc49be5c2b3b8473fe8a) from the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology") of the space _X_ with the [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval") [0, 1] to _Y_ such that ![Image 5: {\displaystyle H(x,0)=f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/555928778a222ea2127bf985b8d9b06fba46c38b) and ![Image 6: {\displaystyle H(x,1)=g(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36ee15cbc3c622c4c355ac0d49a859aa4d321705) for all ![Image 7: {\displaystyle x\in X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e580967f68f36743e894aa7944f032dda6ea01d).

If we think of the second [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") of _H_ as time then _H_ describes a _continuous deformation_ of _f_ into _g_: at time 0 we have the function _f_ and at time 1 we have the function _g_. We can also think of the second parameter as a "slider control" that allows us to smoothly transition from _f_ to _g_ as the slider moves from 0 to 1, and vice versa.

An alternative notation is to say that a homotopy between two continuous functions ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f,g:X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2979ff5d39cd2f0db5eda37f7ec54baae4c9909) is a family of continuous functions ![Image 9: {\displaystyle h_{t}:X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/50339fe972a42c6a7452fab7681a3fe907c598cf) for ![Image 10: {\displaystyle t\in [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31a5c18739ff04858eecc8fec2f53912c348e0e5) such that ![Image 11: {\displaystyle h_{0}=f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8c32133ae2cf0d56cb289b92576e250a1a26c22) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle h_{1}=g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3bb282fec903caad7953a345528d44b052a24244), and the [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)")![Image 13: {\displaystyle (x,t)\mapsto h_{t}(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83ce8a31524bd6d29a07899d3a316d3866fd8ee2) is continuous from ![Image 14: {\displaystyle X\times [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd76f8aa27cdb748a869ec11fc6548bcab6d396b) to ![Image 15: {\displaystyle Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f). The two versions coincide by setting ![Image 16: {\displaystyle h_{t}(x)=H(x,t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f2d03f1bcc43fd377e38d0aa3b703e660bbe50b1). It is not sufficient to require each map ![Image 17: {\displaystyle h_{t}(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98e982dccbf3e2d612fd4896654b3ba3795c86c8) to be continuous.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-4)

The animation that is looped above right provides an example of a homotopy between two [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding"), _f_ and _g_, of the torus into _R_ 3. _X_ is the torus, _Y_ is _R_ 3, _f_ is some continuous function from the torus to _R_ 3 that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-doughnut shape with which the animation starts; _g_ is some continuous function that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-coffee-mug shape. The animation shows the image of _h_ _t_(X) as a function of the parameter _t_, where _t_ varies with time from 0 to 1 over each cycle of the animation loop. It pauses, then shows the image as _t_ varies back from 1 to 0, pauses, and repeats this cycle.

Continuous functions _f_ and _g_ are said to be homotopic if and only if there is a homotopy _H_ taking _f_ to _g_ as described above. Being homotopic is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on the set of all continuous functions from _X_ to _Y_. This homotopy relation is compatible with [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") in the following sense: if _f_ 1, _g_ 1: _X_ → _Y_ are homotopic, and _f_ 2, _g_ 2: _Y_ → _Z_ are homotopic, then their compositions _f_ 2 ∘ _f_ 1 and _g_ 2 ∘ _g_ 1: _X_ → _Z_ are also homotopic.

Homotopy equivalence
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homotopy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Homotopy equivalence")]

Given two topological spaces _X_ and _Y_, a **homotopy equivalence** between _X_ and _Y_ is a pair of continuous [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)")_f_: _X_ → _Y_ and _g_: _Y_ → _X_, such that _g_ ∘ _f_ is homotopic to the [identity map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") id _X_ and _f_ ∘ _g_ is homotopic to id _Y_. If such a pair exists, then _X_ and _Y_ are said to be **homotopy equivalent**, or of the same **homotopy type**. This relation of homotopy equivalence is often denoted ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \simeq }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65b9738551241417d16d9843525ed52410af4dc9).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-6) Intuitively, two spaces _X_ and _Y_ are homotopy equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by bending, shrinking and expanding operations. Spaces that are homotopy-equivalent to a point are called [contractible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible "Contractible").

### Homotopy equivalence vs. homeomorphism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homotopy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Homotopy equivalence vs. homeomorphism")]

A [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") is a special case of a homotopy equivalence, in which _g_ ∘ _f_ is equal to the identity map id _X_ (not only homotopic to it), and _f_ ∘ _g_ is equal to id _Y_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-7): 0:53:00  Therefore, if X and Y are homeomorphic then they are homotopy-equivalent, but the opposite is not true. Some examples:

*   A solid disk is homotopy-equivalent to a single point, since you can deform the disk along radial lines continuously to a single point. However, they are not homeomorphic, since there is no [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between them (since one is an infinite set, while the other is finite).
*   The [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") and an untwisted (closed) strip are homotopy equivalent, since you can deform both strips continuously to a circle. But they are not homeomorphic.

A function ![Image 19: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) is said to be **null-homotopic** if it is homotopic to a constant function. (The homotopy from ![Image 20: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) to a constant function is then sometimes called a **null-homotopy**.) For example, a map ![Image 21: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) from the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle")![Image 22: {\displaystyle S^{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60796c8d0c03cf575637d3202463b214d9635880) to any space ![Image 23: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is null-homotopic precisely when it can be continuously extended to a map from the [unit disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disk "Unit disk")![Image 24: {\displaystyle D^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7a1e7d554748b105413b259fdfb8c9587acb9f1d) to ![Image 25: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) that agrees with ![Image 26: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) on the boundary.

It follows from these definitions that a space ![Image 27: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is contractible if and only if the identity map from ![Image 28: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to itself—which is always a homotopy equivalence—is null-homotopic.

Homotopy equivalence is important because in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") many concepts are **homotopy invariant**, that is, they respect the relation of homotopy equivalence. For example, if _X_ and _Y_ are homotopy equivalent spaces, then:

*   _X_ is [path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") if and only if _Y_ is.
*   _X_ is [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected") if and only if _Y_ is.
*   The (singular) [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") and [cohomology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology_group "Cohomology group") of _X_ and _Y_ are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_isomorphism "Group isomorphism").
*   If _X_ and _Y_ are path-connected, then the [fundamental groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of _X_ and _Y_ are isomorphic, and so are the higher [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group"). (Without the path-connectedness assumption, one has π 1(_X_, _x_ 0) isomorphic to π 1(_Y_, _f_(_x_ 0)) where _f_: _X_ → _Y_ is a homotopy equivalence and _x_ 0 ∈ _X_.)

An example of an algebraic invariant of topological spaces which is not homotopy-invariant is [compactly supported homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactly_supported_homology "Compactly supported homology") (which is, roughly speaking, the homology of the [compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(mathematics) "Compactification (mathematics)"), and compactification is not homotopy-invariant).

In order to define the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group"), one needs the notion of **homotopy relative to a subspace**. These are homotopies which keep the elements of the subspace fixed. Formally: if _f_ and _g_ are continuous maps from _X_ to _Y_ and _K_ is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of _X_, then we say that _f_ and _g_ are homotopic relative to _K_ if there exists a homotopy _H_: _X_ × [0, 1] → _Y_ between _f_ and _g_ such that _H_(_k_, _t_) = _f_(_k_) = _g_(_k_) for all _k_ ∈ _K_ and _t_ ∈ [0, 1]. Also, if _g_ is a [retraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction_(topology) "Retraction (topology)") from _X_ to _K_ and _f_ is the identity map, this is known as a strong [deformation retract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_retract "Deformation retract") of _X_ to _K_. When _K_ is a point, the term **pointed homotopy** is used.

[![Image 29](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Blue_Unknot.png/250px-Blue_Unknot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_Unknot.png)

[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Blue_Trefoil_Knot.png/250px-Blue_Trefoil_Knot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_Trefoil_Knot.png)

The [unknot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknot "Unknot") is not equivalent to the [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot "Trefoil knot") since one cannot be deformed into the other through a continuous path of homeomorphisms of the ambient space. Thus they are not ambient-isotopic.

When two given continuous functions _f_ and _g_ from the topological space _X_ to the topological space _Y_ are [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding"), one can ask whether they can be connected 'through embeddings'. This gives rise to the concept of **isotopy**, which is a homotopy, _H_, in the notation used before, such that for each fixed _t_, _H_(_x_, _t_) gives an embedding.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-9)

A related, but different, concept is that of [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy").

Requiring that two embeddings be isotopic is a stronger requirement than that they be homotopic. For example, the map from the interval [−1, 1] into the real numbers defined by _f_(_x_) = −_x_ is _not_ isotopic to the identity _g_(_x_) = _x_. Any homotopy from _f_ to the identity would have to exchange the endpoints, which would mean that they would have to 'pass through' each other. Moreover, _f_ has changed the orientation of the interval and _g_ has not, which is impossible under an isotopy. However, the maps are homotopic; one homotopy from _f_ to the identity is _H_:[−1, 1]×[0, 1]→[−1, 1] given by _H_(_x_, _y_)=2 _yx_−_x_.

Two homeomorphisms (which are special cases of embeddings) of the unit ball which agree on the boundary can be shown to be isotopic using [Alexander's trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%27s_trick "Alexander's trick"). For this reason, the map of the [unit disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disc "Unit disc") in ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) defined by _f_(_x_, _y_) = (−_x_,−_y_) is isotopic to a 180-degree [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") around the origin, and so the identity map and _f_ are isotopic because they can be connected by rotations.

In [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology")—for example in [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory")—the idea of isotopy is used to construct equivalence relations. For example, when should two knots be considered the same? We take two knots, _K_ 1 and _K_ 2, in three-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") space. A knot is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of a one-dimensional space, the "loop of string" (or the circle), into this space, and this embedding gives a homeomorphism between the circle and its image in the embedding space. The intuitive idea behind the notion of knot equivalence is that one can _deform_ one embedding to another through a path of embeddings: a continuous function starting at _t_=0 giving the _K_ 1 embedding, ending at _t_= 1 giving the _K_ 2 embedding, with all intermediate values corresponding to embeddings. This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. An [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy"), studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots _K_ 1 and _K_ 2 are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves _K_ 1 to _K_ 2. This is the appropriate definition in the topological category.

Similar language is used for the equivalent concept in contexts where one has a stronger notion of equivalence. For example, a path between two smooth embeddings is a **smooth isotopy**.

On a [Lorentzian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold "Lorentzian manifold"), certain curves are distinguished as [timelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike "Timelike") (representing something that only goes forwards, not backwards, in time, in every local frame). A [timelike homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike_homotopy "Timelike homotopy") between two [timelike curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike_curve "Timelike curve") is a homotopy such that the curve remains timelike during the continuous transformation from one curve to another. No [closed timelike curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve "Closed timelike curve") (CTC) on a Lorentzian manifold is timelike homotopic to a point (that is, null timelike homotopic); such a manifold is therefore said to be [multiply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_connected "Multiply connected") by timelike curves. A manifold such as the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") can be [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected") (by any type of curve), and yet be [timelike multiply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike_multiply_connected "Timelike multiply connected").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-10)

### Lifting and extension properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homotopy&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Lifting and extension properties")]

If we have a homotopy ![Image 32: {\displaystyle H:X\times [0,1]\rightarrow Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/831ca2cdbab407ef356b8c3b1ea0a39d6f1965fd) and a cover ![Image 33: {\displaystyle p:{\overline {Y}}\rightarrow Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af1139321d52a14aba983a86b67f67bb2589a32a) and we are given a map ![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\overline {h}}_{0}:X\rightarrow {\overline {Y}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa5a83f2748548520dc1a177c7636583fb3171a6) such that ![Image 35: {\displaystyle H_{0}=P\circ {\overline {h}}_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05cb931507f3797731d2054cac78ef414356f344) (![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\overline {h}}_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/078b20569f96a1cd1524beda38b3d79b6b044fc4) is called a [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(mathematics) "Lift (mathematics)") of ![Image 37: {\displaystyle h_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08c1c908b03c3f63383c7199465c7fd0b105030f)), then we can lift all ![Image 38: {\displaystyle H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b) to a map ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}:X\times [0,1]\rightarrow {\overline {Y}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f7a708daabaaa43e432fca8b7e50dbe4e7246c4) such that ![Image 40: {\displaystyle p\circ {\overline {H}}=H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/962ee01eeed8cf2da8ca28da3b9582111096d809). The homotopy lifting property is used to characterize [fibrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibration "Fibration").

Another useful property involving homotopy is the [homotopy extension property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_extension_property "Homotopy extension property"), which characterizes the extension of a homotopy between two functions from a subset of some set to the set itself. It is useful when dealing with [cofibrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofibration "Cofibration").

Since the relation of two functions ![Image 41: {\displaystyle f,g\colon X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f99c3354a919e8e246796bdc329e13c6604e95a3) being homotopic relative to a subspace is an equivalence relation, we can look at the [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of maps between a fixed _X_ and _Y_. If we fix ![Image 42: {\displaystyle X=[0,1]^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535c121a50732b54a2d9fd9bdcd1b1e71169e7d3), the unit interval [0, 1] [crossed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") with itself _n_ times, and we take its [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)")![Image 43: {\displaystyle \partial ([0,1]^{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/830c26e07794526f3d280f401e8db0c5d41e622d) as a subspace, then the equivalence classes form a group, denoted ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(Y,y_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ec0e9376b17251a4c14bb1d573c2de441e781ae), where ![Image 45: {\displaystyle y_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d943dbbb0b56ca750c4d62c5b54b4ae29a773da) is in the image of the subspace ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \partial ([0,1]^{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/830c26e07794526f3d280f401e8db0c5d41e622d).

We can define the action of one equivalence class on another, and so we get a group. These groups are called the [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group"). In the case ![Image 47: {\displaystyle n=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d9ec7e1edc2e6d98f5aec2a39ae5f1c99d1e1425), it is also called the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group").

The idea of homotopy can be turned into a formal category of [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"). The **[homotopy category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_category "Homotopy category")** is the category whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps. Two topological spaces _X_ and _Y_ are isomorphic in this category if and only if they are homotopy-equivalent. Then a [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor") on the category of topological spaces is homotopy invariant if it can be expressed as a functor on the homotopy category.

For example, homology groups are a _functorial_ homotopy invariant: this means that if _f_ and _g_ from _X_ to _Y_ are homotopic, then the [group homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism") induced by _f_ and _g_ on the level of [homology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_group "Homology group") are the same: H _n_(_f_) = H _n_(_g_): H _n_(_X_) → H _n_(_Y_) for all _n_. Likewise, if _X_ and _Y_ are in addition [path connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness "Connectedness"), and the homotopy between _f_ and _g_ is pointed, then the group homomorphisms induced by _f_ and _g_ on the level of [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group") are also the same: π _n_(_f_) = π _n_(_g_): π _n_(_X_) → π _n_(_Y_).

Based on the concept of the homotopy, [computation methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods "Numerical methods") for [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equations "Algebraic equations") and [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") have been developed. The methods for algebraic equations include the [homotopy continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_continuation "Homotopy continuation") method[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-11) and the continuation method (see [numerical continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_continuation "Numerical continuation")). The methods for differential equations include the [homotopy analysis method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_analysis_method "Homotopy analysis method").

Homotopy theory can be used as a foundation for [homology theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)"): one can [represent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representable_functor "Representable functor") a cohomology functor on a space _X_ by mappings of _X_ into an appropriate fixed space, up to homotopy equivalence. For example, for any abelian group _G_, and any based CW-complex _X_, the set ![Image 48: {\displaystyle [X,K(G,n)]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95dfb4b3e3703e2265d43461d8796a25b102520e) of based homotopy classes of based maps from _X_ to the[Eilenberg–MacLane space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space "Eilenberg–MacLane space")![Image 49: {\displaystyle K(G,n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0249de19e19e64f6389477b2ca0b6fb8cc2d1bff) is in natural bijection with the _n_-th [singular cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_cohomology "Singular cohomology") group ![Image 50: {\displaystyle H^{n}(X,G)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f81e51273cdb322db2368a242bb9bc42d22d8193)of the space _X_. One says that the [omega-spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(topology) "Spectrum (topology)") of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are [representing spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representing_space "Representing space") for singular cohomology with coefficients in _G_. Using this fact, homotopy classes between a CW complex and a multiply connected space can be calculated using cohomology as described by the [Hopf–Whitney theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf%E2%80%93Whitney_theorem "Hopf–Whitney theorem").

Recently, homotopy theory is used to develop deep learning based generative models like [diffusion models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model "Diffusion model") and [flow-based generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_generative_model "Flow-based generative model"). Perturbing the complex non-Gaussian states is a tough task. Using deep learning and homotopy, such complex states can be transformed to Gaussian state and mildly perturbed to get transformed back to perturbed complex states.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#cite_note-12)
