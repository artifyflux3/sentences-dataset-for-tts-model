( February 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 1993 novel by William Gibson Virtual Light First US edition Author William Gibson Cover artist Don Braughtigam Language English Series Bridge trilogy Genre Science fiction , dystopian Publisher Bantam Spectra (US) Viking Press (UK) Seal Books (Canada) Publication date September 6, 1993 Publication place United States Media type Print (hardback & paperback), audiobook Pages 304 ISBN 978-0-14-015772-7 Preceded by " Skinner's Room " (short story) Followed by Idoru Virtual Light is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson , the first book in his Bridge trilogy .

Virtual Light is a science-fiction novel set in a postmodern , dystopian, cyberpunk future. The term 'Virtual Light' was coined by scientist Stephen Beck to describe a form of instrumentation that produces optical sensations directly in the eye without the use of photons .

[ 1 ] [ better source needed ] The novel was a finalist nominee for a Hugo Award , and shortlisted for the Locus Award in 1994.

[ 2 ] Plot summary [ edit ] The plot centers around Chevette Washington, a young bicycle messenger who lives in the ad hoc , off-the-grid community that has grown on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake.

Chevette, on a whim, steals a pair of dark-rimmed glasses from a man at a party because she finds him loathsome. Soon after, she realizes that the glasses have unlikely importance, as security company henchmen begin tracking and following her. Among the pursuers are Svobodov and Orlovsky, two Russian immigrants who reside in San Francisco and are employed as cops, [ 3 ] as well as Loveless, a ruthless corporate hitman with gold canine teeth. The glasses contain plans by a powerful corporation to rebuild San Francisco entirely using nanotechnology , and for that reason, they are highly coveted and present a danger to the person who possesses them.

Meanwhile, Berry Rydell, a former cop turned private security agent, is contracted to recover the  glasses for Lucius Warbaby, an intimidating and presumably successful "skip-tracer", a sort of bondsman/bounty hunter.  When Rydell is given the mission, he is not informed of the significance of the glasses and the information they contain.

Eventually, the plot climaxes when Rydell, Loveless, Warbaby, Orlovsky, and Svobodov all catch up with Chevette.  Rydell escapes the scene with Chevette, and they flee their enemies, who have all the advantages of wealth and technology on their side. A subplot also focuses on a romantic relationship between Chevette and Rydell.

Another subplot focuses on a Japanese sociologist named Shinya Yamazaki, who is currently studying the bridge dwellers and the history of their settlement. The subplot largely focuses on his interactions with Skinner, an old man who lives in a shack high atop one of the bridge's support pylons, and shares this home with Chevette.

Setting [ edit ] The setting is California in 2006, [ 4 ] part of a dystopian world where the middle class has essentially evaporated leaving only multinational corporations and their exorbitantly rich elite and the poor who are mostly security officers, couriers, or otherwise work in minor service positions. Many of the poor live illegally and entirely outside the normal economy in places like The Bridge engaged in dubious enterprises such as theft, drugs, weapons, gambling, prostitution, and operation of unlicensed restaurants and doctor's offices. Others pursue livelihood in innocuous yet unregulated commerce such as by running antique shops and barbershops.

Themes [ edit ] A major theme of Virtual Light is class conflict [ citation needed ] ; Warbaby and the elite are placed against Rydell and Chevette.  The elite see themselves as inherently superior, and view the underclass as amoral, ruthless, and dispensable.  Another important element, which is common to cyberpunk , is the idea of the power structure withholding information from the general population.  The information, in this case, are the plans to rebuild an entire city completely, regardless of what its inhabitants think, reminiscent of Haussmann's renovation of Paris .
