A sphere rotating (spinning) about an axis

**Rotation** or **rotational/rotary motion** is the circular movement of an object around a central line, known as an _**axis of rotation**_. A [plane figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_figure "Plane figure") can rotate in either a [clockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise "Clockwise") or counterclockwise sense around a perpendicular axis intersecting anywhere inside or outside the figure at a _[center of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center\_of\_rotation "Center of rotation")_. A [solid figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_figure "Solid figure") has an infinite number of possible axes and [angles of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles_of_rotation "Angles of rotation"), including [chaotic rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_rotation "Chaotic rotation") (between arbitrary [orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)")), in contrast to [rotation around a _fixed_ axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis "Rotation around a fixed axis").

The special case of a rotation with an internal axis passing through the body's own [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") is known as a **spin** (or _autorotation_).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-Wormeli2009-1) In that case, the surface intersection of the internal _spin axis_ can be called a _pole_; for example, [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") defines the [geographical poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole "Geographical pole"). A rotation around an axis completely external to the moving body is called a **revolution** (or _[orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit")_), e.g. [Earth's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). The ends of the external _axis of revolution_ can be called the _[orbital poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital\_pole "Orbital pole")_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-Wormeli2009-1)

Either type of rotation is involved in a corresponding type of [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") (spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity) and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") (spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum).

Relations between rotation axis, [plane of orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)") and [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") (for Earth)

[Mathematically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a rotation is a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") movement which, unlike a [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), keeps at least one point fixed. This definition applies to rotations in two dimensions (in a plane), in which exactly one point is kept fixed; and also in three dimensions (in space), in which additional points may be kept fixed (as in rotation around a fixed axis, as infinite line).

All rigid body movements are rotations, translations, or combinations of the two.

A rotation is simply a progressive radial orientation to a common point. That common point lies within the axis of that motion. The axis is perpendicular to the plane of the motion.

If a rotation around a point or axis is followed by a second rotation around the same point/axis, a third rotation results. The _reverse_ ([_inverse_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element "Inverse element")) of a rotation is also a rotation. Thus, the rotations around a point/axis form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"). However, a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point/axis may result in something other than a rotation, e.g. a translation.

Rotations around the _x_, _y_ and _z_ axes are called _principal rotations_. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the _x_ axis, followed by a rotation around the _y_ axis, and followed by a rotation around the _z_ axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.

### Fixed axis vs. fixed point

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Fixed axis vs. fixed point")]

The combination of any sequence of rotations of an object in three dimensions about a fixed point is always equivalent to a rotation about an axis (which may be considered to be a rotation in the plane that is perpendicular to that axis). Similarly, the rotation rate of an object in three dimensions at any instant is about some axis, although this axis may be changing over time.

In other than three dimensions, it does not make sense to describe a rotation as being around an axis, since more than one axis through the object may be kept fixed; instead, simple rotations are described as being in a plane. In four or more dimensions, a combination of two or more rotations about a plane is not in general a rotation in a single plane.

### Axis of 2-dimensional rotations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Axis of 2-dimensional rotations")]

2-dimensional rotations, unlike the 3-dimensional ones, possess no axis of rotation, only a point about which the rotation occurs. This is equivalent, for linear transformations, with saying that there is no direction in the plane which is kept unchanged by a 2-dimensional rotation, except, of course, the identity.

The question of the existence of such a direction is the question of existence of an [eigenvector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector "Eigenvector") for the matrix _A_ representing the rotation. Every 2D rotation around the origin through an angle ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) in counterclockwise direction can be quite simply represented by the following [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix"):

![Image 6: {\displaystyle A={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf516eaa0ba7b95be6fd955ad26e9f0393e16d5d)
A standard [eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") determination leads to the [characteristic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial "Characteristic polynomial")

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \lambda ^{2}-2\lambda \cos \theta +1=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59c4a5727d344a10bb3dcf95378124207e10e50e)
which has

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \cos \theta \pm i\sin \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f115a58c3b41db95de9a7e050e33a771ba9126e)
as its eigenvalues. Therefore, there is no real eigenvalue whenever ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \cos \theta \neq \pm 1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d80d320b455743cfb7d0252c60f98b4a1984375), meaning that no real vector in the plane is kept unchanged by _A_.

### Rotation angle and axis in 3 dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Rotation angle and axis in 3 dimensions")]

Knowing that the trace is an invariant, the rotation angle ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) for a proper orthogonal 3Ã—3 rotation matrix ![Image 11: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is found by

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \alpha =\cos ^{-1}\left({\frac {A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33}-1}{2}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7461eeb52e9c4263fbc66f7c5320a14d5c43d7dc)
Using the principal arc-cosine, this formula gives a rotation angle satisfying ![Image 13: {\displaystyle 0\leq \alpha \leq 180^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6889e5719e985a6e234ca0f35d460ccc20251cc8). The corresponding rotation axis must be defined to point in a direction that limits the rotation angle to not exceed 180 degrees. (This can always be done because any rotation of more than 180 degrees about an axis ![Image 14: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) can always be written as a rotation having ![Image 15: {\displaystyle 0\leq \alpha \leq 180^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6889e5719e985a6e234ca0f35d460ccc20251cc8) if the axis is replaced with ![Image 16: {\displaystyle n=-m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a8419a5738a9852f8aa044f64e59671fa32b1128).)

Every proper rotation ![Image 17: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) in 3D space has an axis of rotation, which is defined such that any vector ![Image 18: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) that is aligned with the rotation axis will not be affected by rotation. Accordingly, ![Image 19: {\displaystyle Av=v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3390aeacb886138e7b1fb4917e5bf685ca15426c), and the rotation axis therefore corresponds to an eigenvector of the rotation matrix associated with an eigenvalue of 1. As long as the rotation angle ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) is nonzero (i.e., the rotation is not the identity tensor), there is one and only one such direction. Because A has only real components, there is at least one real eigenvalue, and the remaining two eigenvalues must be complex conjugates of each other (see [Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Eigenvalues and the characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Eigenvalues_and_the_characteristic_polynomial "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors")). Knowing that 1 is an eigenvalue, it follows that the remaining two eigenvalues are complex conjugates of each other, but this does not imply that they are complexâ€”they could be real with double multiplicity. In the degenerate case of a rotation angle ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \alpha =180^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/233080869fc794077961364c9afa9b0546ee1d63), the remaining two eigenvalues are both equal to âˆ’1. In the degenerate case of a zero rotation angle, the rotation matrix is the identity, and all three eigenvalues are 1 (which is the only case for which the rotation axis is arbitrary).

A spectral analysis is not required to find the rotation axis. If ![Image 22: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) denotes the unit eigenvector aligned with the rotation axis, and if ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) denotes the rotation angle, then it can be shown that ![Image 24: {\displaystyle 2\sin(\alpha )n=\{A_{32}-A_{23},A_{13}-A_{31},A_{21}-A_{12}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/763cc411be7340b25b8997f68a07b0943fd381fa). Consequently, the expense of an eigenvalue analysis can be avoided by simply normalizing this vector _if it has a nonzero magnitude._ On the other hand, if this vector has a zero magnitude, it means that ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \sin(\alpha )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1ce0c3bf63b00ba0b2d63c16009b847678d31bb). In other words, this vector will be zero if and only if the rotation angle is 0 or 180 degrees, and the rotation axis may be assigned in this case by normalizing any column of ![Image 26: {\displaystyle A+I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95294a7646624ec8575bd30340ecd6fc4380604b) that has a nonzero magnitude.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-2)

This discussion applies to a proper rotation, and hence ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \det A=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20337d5dd614ed9547efbfe48d7e9db3d140e13b). Any improper orthogonal 3x3 matrix ![Image 28: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) may be written as ![Image 29: {\displaystyle B=-A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a75008ad610703981acae1e7a541f6c451043205), in which ![Image 30: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is proper orthogonal. That is, any improper orthogonal 3x3 matrix may be decomposed as a proper rotation (from which an axis of rotation can be found as described above) followed by an inversion (multiplication by âˆ’1). It follows that the rotation axis of ![Image 31: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) is also the eigenvector of ![Image 32: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) corresponding to an eigenvalue of âˆ’1.

As much as every tridimensional rotation has a rotation axis, also every tridimensional rotation has a plane, which is perpendicular to the rotation axis, and which is left invariant by the rotation. The rotation, restricted to this plane, is an ordinary 2D rotation.

The proof proceeds similarly to the above discussion. First, suppose that all eigenvalues of the 3D rotation matrix _A_ are real. This means that there is an orthogonal basis, made by the corresponding eigenvectors (which are necessarily orthogonal), over which the effect of the rotation matrix is just stretching it. If we write _A_ in this basis, it is diagonal; but a diagonal orthogonal matrix is made of just +1s and âˆ’1s in the diagonal entries. Therefore, we do not have a proper rotation, but either the identity or the result of a sequence of reflections.

It follows, then, that a proper rotation has some complex eigenvalue. Let _v_ be the corresponding eigenvector. Then, as we showed in the previous topic, ![Image 33: {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba1d09340f8f6c1979330c2f23e514e38f243a3b) is also an eigenvector, and ![Image 34: {\displaystyle v+{\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ca1609560a27db239ebf83efb1e72fa03553e7f) and ![Image 35: {\displaystyle i(v-{\bar {v}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f20819490f230351b4dbefe12b5d337746ef81cf) are such that their scalar product vanishes:

![Image 36: {\displaystyle i(v^{\text{T}}+{\bar {v}}^{\text{T}})(v-{\bar {v}})=i(v^{\text{T}}v-{\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}}+{\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}v-v^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c58bf3001991935858962a3c757749789bc59f4)
because, since ![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ebec5e2e750305f2b03ed78b682d5c35c046761) is real, it equals its complex conjugate ![Image 38: {\displaystyle v^{\text{T}}v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/702d706ae65862b2d1455ed98a1cf5a104160fed), and ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9ca11bd53ce5eeda003e9b3ed78cf314d864b38f) and ![Image 40: {\displaystyle v^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38c6ecc78db4bff84d6062b0ed5dce95fc4a0753) are both representations of the same scalar product between ![Image 41: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) and ![Image 42: {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba1d09340f8f6c1979330c2f23e514e38f243a3b).

This means ![Image 43: {\displaystyle v+{\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ca1609560a27db239ebf83efb1e72fa03553e7f) and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle i(v-{\bar {v}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f20819490f230351b4dbefe12b5d337746ef81cf) are orthogonal vectors. Also, they are both real vectors by construction. These vectors span the same subspace as ![Image 45: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) and ![Image 46: {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba1d09340f8f6c1979330c2f23e514e38f243a3b), which is an invariant subspace under the application of _A_. Therefore, they span an invariant plane.

This plane is orthogonal to the invariant axis, which corresponds to the remaining eigenvector of _A_, with eigenvalue 1, because of the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of _A_.

### Rotation of vectors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Rotation of vectors")]

A vector is said to be rotating if it changes its orientation. This effect is generally only accompanied when its rate of change vector has non-zero perpendicular component to the original vector. This can be shown to be the case by considering a vector ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\vec {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/391292ffadc65b0cde3e96f23afcdb811619dd95) which is parameterized by some variable ![Image 48: {\textstyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2bc926f90178739fccd01a96c6fa778ab3535d6) for which:

![Image 49: {\displaystyle {d|{\vec {A}}|^{2} \over dt}={d({\vec {A}}\cdot {\vec {A}}) \over dt}\Rightarrow {d|{\vec {A}}| \over dt}={d{\vec {A}} \over dt}\cdot {\hat {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb22a2ee9d1278fe0e10c3affe82cfba535900bb)

Which also gives a relation of rate of change of unit vector by taking ![Image 50: {\displaystyle {\vec {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/391292ffadc65b0cde3e96f23afcdb811619dd95), to be such a vector: ![Image 51: {\displaystyle {d{\hat {A}} \over dt}\cdot {\hat {A}}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13b66e9f8c6795364cdebb9427554fcdce3d395d)showing that ![Image 52: {\textstyle {d{\hat {A}} \over dt}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07a744ae258ae90af2ae7a80fcac5d490356050d) vector is perpendicular to the vector, ![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\vec {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/391292ffadc65b0cde3e96f23afcdb811619dd95).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-3)

From:

![Image 54: {\displaystyle {d{\vec {A}} \over dt}={d(|{\vec {A}}|{\hat {A}}) \over dt}={d|{\vec {A}}| \over dt}{\hat {A}}+|{\vec {A}}|\left({d{\hat {A}} \over dt}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00740141e70714cc88fc16b6c0f50e7b01a1ecc7),

since the first term is parallel to ![Image 55: {\displaystyle {\vec {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/391292ffadc65b0cde3e96f23afcdb811619dd95) and the second perpendicular to it, we can conclude in general that the parallel and perpendicular components of rate of change of a vector independently influence only the magnitude or orientation of the vector respectively. Hence, a rotating vector always has a non-zero perpendicular component of its rate of change vector against the vector itself.

### In higher dimensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: In higher dimensions")]

As dimensions increase the number of [rotation vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_vector "Rotation vector") increases. Along a [four dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_dimensional_space "Four dimensional space") (a [hypervolume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervolume "Hypervolume")), rotations occur along x, y, z, and w axis. An object rotated on a w axis intersects through various [volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumes "Volumes"), where each [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)") is equal to a self contained volume at an angle. This gives way to a new axis of rotation in a 4d hypervolume, where a 3D object can be rotated perpendicular to the z axis.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-5)

The [speed of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_rotation "Speed of rotation") is given by the [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency") (rad/s) or [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") ([turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)") per time), or [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration (rad/s 2), caused by [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque"). The ratio of torque Ï„ to the angular acceleration Î± is given by the [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia"): ![Image 56: {\displaystyle I={\frac {\tau }{\alpha }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3988cddb42905b5f803224e94cf508d13e94fc0)

The [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") vector (an _[axial vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial\_vector "Axial vector")_) also describes the direction of the axis of rotation. Similarly, the torque is an axial vector.

The physics of the [rotation around a fixed axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis "Rotation around a fixed axis") is mathematically described with the [axisâ€“angle representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis%E2%80%93angle_representation "Axisâ€“angle representation") of rotations. According to the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule"), the direction away from the observer is associated with clockwise rotation and the direction towards the observer with counterclockwise rotation, like a [screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw "Screw").

[![Image 57](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Circular_motion_vs_rotation.svg/330px-Circular_motion_vs_rotation.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circular_motion_vs_rotation.svg)

The motion on the left, an example of curvilinear translation, cannot be treated as rotation since there is no change in orientation, whereas the right can be treated as rotation. 

It is possible for [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") to have periodic [circular trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion") without changing their [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)"). These types of motion are treated under [circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion") instead of rotation, more specifically as a curvilinear translation. Since translation involves [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)") of [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") while preserving the [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of the body, in the case of curvilinear translation, all the points have the same instantaneous velocity whereas relative motion can only be observed in motions involving rotation.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-:0-6)

In rotation, the [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of the object changes and the change in [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") is independent of the observers whose [frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") have constant relative orientation over time. By [Euler's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem"), any change in orientation can be described by rotation about an axis through a chosen reference point.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-:0-6) Hence, the distinction between rotation and circular motion can be made by requiring an instantaneous axis for rotation, a line passing through [instantaneous center of circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_centre_of_rotation "Instant centre of rotation") and perpendicular to the [plane of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_rotation "Plane of rotation"). In the example depicting curvilinear translation, the center of circles for the motion lie on a straight line but it is parallel to the plane of motion and hence does not resolve to an axis of rotation. In contrast, a rotating body will always have its instantaneous axis of zero velocity, perpendicular to the plane of motion.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-7)

More generally, due to [Chasles' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasles%27_theorem_(kinematics) "Chasles' theorem (kinematics)"), any motion of [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") can be treated as a composition of **rotation** and [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), called general plane motion.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-:0-6) A simple example of pure rotation is considered in [rotation around a fixed axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis "Rotation around a fixed axis").

### Cosmological principle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Cosmological principle")]

The [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_physics "Laws of physics") are currently believed to be [invariant under any fixed rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_invariance#Application_to_quantum_mechanic "Rotational invariance"). (Although they do appear to change when viewed from a rotating viewpoint: see [rotating frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_frame_of_reference "Rotating frame of reference").)

In modern physical cosmology, the [cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle "Cosmological principle") is the notion that the distribution of matter in the universe is [homogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous "Homogeneous") and [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic") when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe and have no preferred direction, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.

In particular, for a system which behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") is [rotationally invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_invariance "Rotational invariance"). According to [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem"), if the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") (the [integral over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_over_time "Integral over time") of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then [angular momentum is conserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum "Conservation of angular momentum").

Euler rotations of the Earth: intrinsic (green), precession (blue) and nutation (red)

Euler rotations provide an alternative description of a rotation. It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles") while leaving the other two constant. Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the [line of nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_nodes "Line of nodes") around the external axis _z_, the second rotates around the [line of nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_nodes "Line of nodes") and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.

These rotations are called [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession"), [nutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation "Nutation"), and _intrinsic rotation_.

[![Image 59](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Star_trails_over_the_Paranal_Residencia%2C_Chile.jpg/250px-Star_trails_over_the_Paranal_Residencia%2C_Chile.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Star_trails_over_the_Paranal_Residencia,_Chile.jpg)

[Star trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trail "Star trail") caused by the [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") during the [camera's long exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-exposure_photography "Long-exposure photography") time[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#cite_note-8)

In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), rotation is a commonly observed phenomenon; it includes both spin (auto-rotation) and orbital revolution.

[Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") and similar bodies may spin around on their axes. The rotation rate of planets in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") was first measured by tracking visual features. [Stellar rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_rotation "Stellar rotation") is measured through [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_shift "Doppler shift") or by tracking active surface features. An example is [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspots "Sunspots"), which rotate around the Sun at the same velocity as the [outer gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere "Photosphere") that make up the Sun.

Under some circumstances orbiting bodies may lock their spin rotation to their orbital rotation around a larger body. This effect is called [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking "Tidal locking"); the Moon is tidal-locked to the Earth.

This rotation induces a [centrifugal acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force_(fictitious) "Centrifugal force (fictitious)") in the reference frame of the Earth which slightly counteracts the effect of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") the closer one is to the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"). [Earth's gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_gravity "Earth's gravity") combines both mass effects such that an object weighs slightly less at the equator than at the poles. Another is that over time the Earth is slightly deformed into an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid "Oblate spheroid"); a similar [equatorial bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge "Equatorial bulge") develops for other planets.

Another consequence of the rotation of a planet are the phenomena of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession") and [nutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation "Nutation"). Like a [gyroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope "Gyroscope"), the overall effect is a slight "wobble" in the movement of the axis of a planet. Currently the tilt of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s axis to its orbital plane ([obliquity of the ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic "Obliquity of the ecliptic")) is 23.44 degrees, but this angle changes slowly (over thousands of years). (See also [Precession of the equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes "Precession of the equinoxes") and [Pole Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star "Pole star").)

While _revolution_ is often used as a synonym for _rotation_, in many fields, particularly astronomy and related fields, _revolution_, often referred to as _orbital revolution_ for clarity, is used when one body moves around another while _rotation_ is used to mean the movement around an axis. Moons revolve around their planets, planets revolve about their stars (such as the Earth around the Sun); and stars slowly revolve about their [galaxial centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxial_center "Galaxial center"). The motion of the components of [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") is complex, but it usually includes a rotation component.

### Retrograde rotation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Retrograde rotation")]

Most [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), including [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), spin in the same direction as they orbit the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). The exceptions are [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") and [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"). Venus may be thought of as rotating slowly backward (or being "upside down"). Uranus rotates nearly on its side relative to its orbit. Current speculation is that Uranus started off with a typical prograde orientation and was knocked on its side by a large impact early in its history. The [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet "Dwarf planet")[Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") (formerly considered a planet) is anomalous in several ways, including that it also rotates on its side.

[![Image 60](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg/250px-Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg)

The principal axes of rotation in space

In [flight dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics"), the principal rotations described with [Euler angles above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation#Euler_rotations) are known as [_pitch_, _roll_ and _yaw_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw,_pitch,_and_roll "Yaw, pitch, and roll"). The term [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(aviation) "Rotation (aviation)") is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch (nose moves up) of an aircraft, particularly when starting the climb after takeoff.

Principal rotations have the advantage of modelling a number of physical systems such as [gimbals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal "Gimbal"), and [joysticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick "Joystick"), so are easily visualised, and are a very compact way of storing a rotation. But they are difficult to use in calculations as even simple operations like combining rotations are expensive to do, and suffer from a form of [gimbal lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock#Gimbal_lock_in_applied_mathematics "Gimbal lock") where the angles cannot be uniquely calculated for certain rotations.

Many [amusement rides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_ride "Amusement ride") provide rotation. A [Ferris wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_wheel "Ferris wheel") has a horizontal central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, at any time the orientation of the gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A [carousel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel "Carousel") provides rotation about a vertical axis. Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In [Chair-O-Planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair-O-Planes "Chair-O-Planes") the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force"). In [roller coaster inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_inversion "Roller coaster inversion") the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people in their seats.

Rotation of a ball or other object, usually called _spin_, plays a role in many sports, including [topspin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topspin#Tennis "Topspin") and [backspin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspin "Backspin") in [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis"), _English_, _follow_ and _draw_ in [billiards and pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sports_techniques "Cue sports techniques"), [curve balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_ball "Curve ball") in [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball "Baseball"), [spin bowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling "Spin bowling") in [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(sport) "Cricket (sport)"), [flying disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_disc "Flying disc") sports, etc. [Table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis "Table tennis") paddles are manufactured with different surface characteristics to allow the player to impart a greater or lesser amount of spin to the ball.

Rotation of a player one or more times around a vertical axis may be called _spin_ in [figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating "Figure skating"), _twirling_ (of the baton or the performer) in [baton twirling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_twirling "Baton twirling"), or _360_, _540_, _720_, etc. in [snowboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding "Snowboarding"), etc. Rotation of a player or performer one or more times around a horizontal axis may be called a [flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_(acrobatic) "Flip (acrobatic)"), [roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_(gymnastics) "Roll (gymnastics)"), [somersault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somersault "Somersault"), _heli_, etc. in [gymnastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics "Gymnastics"), [waterskiing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterskiing "Waterskiing"), or many other sports, or a _one-and-a-half_, _two-and-a-half_, _gainer_ (starting facing away from the water), etc. in [diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport) "Diving (sport)"), etc. A combination of vertical and horizontal rotation (back flip with 360Â°) is called a _mÃ¶bius_ in [waterskiing freestyle jumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterskiing#Freestyle_jumping "Waterskiing").

Rotation of a player around a vertical axis, generally between 180 and 360 degrees, may be called a _spin move_ and is used as a deceptive or avoidance manoeuvre, or in an attempt to play, pass, or receive a ball or puck, etc., or to afford a player a view of the goal or other players. It is often seen in [hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey "Hockey"), [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball "Basketball"), [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football "Football") of various codes, [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis"), etc.
