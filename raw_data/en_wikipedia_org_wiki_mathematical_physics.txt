An example of mathematical physics: solutions of the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") for [quantum harmonic oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator "Quantum harmonic oscillator")(left) with their [amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude "Probability amplitude") (right).

**Mathematical physics** is the development of [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") methods for application to problems in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). The _[Journal of Mathematical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal\_of\_Mathematical\_Physics "Journal of Mathematical Physics")_ defines the field as "the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-1) An alternative definition would also include those mathematics that are inspired by physics, known as [physical mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_mathematics "Physical mathematics").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-2)

There are several distinct branches of mathematical physics, and these roughly correspond to particular historical parts of our world.

### Classical mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classical mechanics")]

Applying the techniques of mathematical physics to classical mechanics typically involves the rigorous, abstract, and advanced reformulation of Newtonian mechanics in terms of [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") (including both approaches in the presence of constraints). Both formulations are embodied in [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics") and lead to an understanding of the deep interplay between the notions of [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics) "Symmetry (physics)") and [conserved quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law "Conservation law") during the dynamical evolution of mechanical systems, as embodied within the most elementary formulation of [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem"). These approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics, such as [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"), [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics"), [classical field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory "Classical field theory"), and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). Moreover, they have provided multiple examples and ideas in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") (e.g., several notions in [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") and [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle")).

### Partial differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Partial differential equations")]

Within mathematics proper, the theory of [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), [variational calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_calculus "Variational calculus"), [Fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis "Fourier analysis"), [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory"), and [vector analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_analysis "Vector analysis") are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics. These fields were developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century (by, for example, [D'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert "Jean le Rond d'Alembert"), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"), and [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange")) until the 1930s. Physical applications of these developments include [hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamics "Hydrodynamics"), [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics"), [elasticity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_theory "Elasticity theory"), [acoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics "Acoustics"), [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity"), [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"), and [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics").

The theory of [atomic spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectra "Atomic spectra") (and, later, [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics")) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), the [spectral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory "Spectral theory") of [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics) "Operator (mathematics)"), [operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra "Operator algebra") and, more broadly, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis"). Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes [Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger "Schrödinger") operators, and it has connections to [atomic and molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics "Atomic, molecular, and optical physics"). [Quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information "Quantum information") theory is another subspecialty.

### Relativity and quantum relativistic theories

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Relativity and quantum relativistic theories")]

The [special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics. This was [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"), which played an important role in both [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). This was, however, gradually supplemented by [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") in the mathematical description of [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") as well as [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") phenomena. In the mathematical description of these physical areas, some concepts in [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra "Homological algebra") and [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-3) are also important.

### Statistical mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Statistical mechanics")]

[Statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") forms a separate field, which includes the theory of [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition "Phase transition"). It relies upon the [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") (or its quantum version) and it is closely related with the more mathematical [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") and some parts of [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"). There are increasing interactions between [combinatorics and physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics_and_physics "Combinatorics and physics"), in particular statistical physics.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Mathematical_Physics_and_other_sciences_v1.png/250px-Mathematical_Physics_and_other_sciences_v1.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mathematical_Physics_and_other_sciences_v1.png)

Relationship between mathematics and physics

The usage of the term "mathematical physics" is sometimes [idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic "Idiosyncratic"). Certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") are not, in fact, considered parts of mathematical physics, while other closely related fields are. For example, [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") and [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines, whereas [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") and [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") belong to mathematical physics. [John Herapath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herapath "John Herapath") used the term for the title of his 1847 text on "mathematical principles of natural philosophy", the scope at that time being "the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-4)

### Mathematical vs. theoretical physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Mathematical vs. theoretical physics")]

The term "mathematical physics" is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") within a mathematically [rigorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_rigour "Mathematical rigour") framework. In this sense, mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and theoretical physics aspect. Although related to [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-5) mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics.

On the other hand, theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and [experimental physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics "Experimental physics"), which often requires theoretical physicists (and mathematical physicists in the more general sense) to use [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic"), [intuitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge) "Intuition (knowledge)"), or approximate arguments.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-6) Such arguments are not considered rigorous by mathematicians.

Such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories "Theories"). Because of the required level of mathematical rigour, these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved. However, they can sometimes show that the previous solution was incomplete, incorrect, or simply too naïve. Issues about attempts to infer the second law of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") from [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") are examples.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Other examples concern the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity ([Sagnac effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagnac_effect "Sagnac effect") and [Einstein synchronisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_synchronisation "Einstein synchronisation")).

The effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas. For example, the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") parallel each other in many ways. The mathematical study of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), and [quantum statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_statistical_mechanics "Quantum statistical mechanics") has motivated results in [operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra "Operator algebra"). The attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") has also brought about some progress in fields such as [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory").

Prominent mathematical physicists
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Prominent mathematical physicists")]

There is a tradition of mathematical analysis of nature that goes back to the ancient Greeks; examples include [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") (_Optics_), [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (_On the Equilibrium of Planes_, _On Floating Bodies_), and [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") (_Optics_, _Harmonics_).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-8) Later, [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Science in the medieval Islamic world") and [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_science "Byzantine science") scholars built on these works, and these ultimately were reintroduced or became available to the West in the [12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century") and during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance").

In the first decade of the 16th century, amateur astronomer [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") proposed [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism"), and published a treatise on it in 1543. He retained the [Ptolemaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") idea of [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle"), and merely sought to simplify astronomy by constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits. Epicycles consist of circles upon circles. According to [Aristotelian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics "Aristotelian physics"), the circle was the perfect form of motion, and was the intrinsic motion of Aristotle's [fifth element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_elements "Classical elements")—the quintessence or universal essence known in Greek as _[aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether\_(classical\_element) "Aether (classical element)")_ for the English _pure air_—that was the pure substance beyond the [sublunary sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary_sphere "Sublunary sphere"), and thus was celestial entities' pure composition. The German [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") [1571–1630], [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe")'s assistant, modified Copernican orbits to _[ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse")_, formalized in the equations of Kepler's [laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_planetary_motion "Laws of planetary motion").

An enthusiastic atomist, [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") in his 1623 book _The Assayer_ asserted that the "book of nature is written in mathematics".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-9) His 1632 book, about his telescopic observations, supported heliocentrism.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-Flew1984p129-10) Having made use of experimentation, Galileo then refuted geocentric [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") by refuting Aristotelian physics itself. Galileo's 1638 book _Discourse on Two New Sciences_ established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial motion, two central concepts of what today is known as [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-Flew1984p129-10) By the Galilean [law of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_inertia "Law of inertia") as well as the principle of [Galilean invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance "Galilean invariance"), also called Galilean relativity, for any object experiencing inertia, there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at _relative_ rest or _relative_ motion—rest or motion with respect to another object.

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology anchored on the principle of vortex motion, [Cartesian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_physics "Cartesian physics"), whose widespread acceptance helped bring the demise of Aristotelian physics. Descartes used mathematical reasoning as a model for science, and developed [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), which in time allowed the plotting of locations in 3D space ([Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system")) and marking their progressions along the flow of time.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-11)

[Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), a talented mathematician and physicist and older contemporary of Newton, was the first to successfully idealize a physical problem by a set of mathematical parameters in _[Horologium Oscillatorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horologium\_Oscillatorium "Horologium Oscillatorium")_ (1673), and the first to fully mathematize a mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon in _[Traité de la Lumière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise\_on\_Light "Treatise on Light")_ (1690). He is thus considered a forerunner of [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") and one of the founders of modern mathematical physics.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-13)

### Newtonian physics and post Newtonian

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_physics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Newtonian physics and post Newtonian")]

The prevailing framework for science in the 16th and early 17th centuries was one borrowed from [Ancient Greek mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics"), where geometrical shapes formed the building blocks to describe and think about space, and time was often thought as a separate entity. With the introduction of algebra into geometry, and with it the idea of a coordinate system, time and space could now be thought as axes belonging to the same plane. This essential mathematical framework is at the base of all modern physics and used in all further mathematical frameworks developed in next centuries.

By the middle of the 17th century, important concepts such as the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus") (proved in 1668 by Scottish mathematician [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(mathematician) "James Gregory (mathematician)")) and finding extrema and minima of functions via differentiation using Fermat's theorem (by French mathematician [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat")) were already known before Leibniz and Newton.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-geometriae-14)[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") (1642–1727) developed [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") (although [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") developed similar concepts outside the context of physics) and [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method "Newton's method") to solve problems in mathematics and physics. He was extremely successful in his application of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") and other methods to the study of motion. Newton's theory of motion, culminating in his _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ (_Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy_) in 1687, modeled three Galilean laws of motion along with Newton's [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation") on a framework of [absolute space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space "Absolute space")—hypothesized by Newton as a physically real entity of Euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directions—while presuming [absolute time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_time "Absolute time"), supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion, the object's motion with respect to absolute space.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-15) The principle of Galilean invariance/relativity was merely implicit in Newton's theory of motion. Having ostensibly reduced the Keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as Galilean terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force, Newton achieved great mathematical rigor, but with theoretical laxity.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-Lakatos1980-16)

In the 18th century, the Swiss [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli") (1700–1782) made contributions to [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), and [vibrating strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string "Vibrating string"). The Swiss [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") (1707–1783) did special work in [variational calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"), dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other areas. Also notable was the Italian-born Frenchman, [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange") (1736–1813), for work in [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics"): he formulated [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and variational methods. A major contribution to the formulation of Analytical Dynamics called [Hamiltonian dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_dynamics "Hamiltonian dynamics") was also made by the Irish physicist, astronomer and mathematician, [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") (1805–1865). Hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics, including field theory and quantum mechanics. The French mathematical physicist [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier") (1768 – 1830) introduced the notion of [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series "Fourier series") to solve the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation "Heat equation"), giving rise to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of [integral transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transforms "Integral transforms").

Into the early 19th century, following mathematicians in France, Germany and England had contributed to mathematical physics. The French [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace "Pierre-Simon Laplace") (1749–1827) made paramount contributions to mathematical [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory"). [Siméon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson "Siméon Denis Poisson") (1781–1840) worked in [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics") and [potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory"). In Germany, [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") (1777–1855) made key contributions to the theoretical foundations of [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity"), [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"), [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), and [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"). In England, [George Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green_(mathematician) "George Green (mathematician)") (1793–1841) published _[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\_Essay\_on\_the\_Application\_of\_Mathematical\_Analysis\_to\_the\_Theories\_of\_Electricity\_and\_Magnetism "An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism")_ in 1828, which in addition to its significant contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism.

A couple of decades ahead of Newton's publication of a particle theory of light, the Dutch [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") (1629–1695) developed the wave theory of light, published in 1690. By 1804, [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)")'s double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, as though light were a wave, and thus Huygens's wave theory of light, as well as Huygens's inference that light waves were vibrations of the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether"), was accepted. [Jean-Augustin Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Augustin_Fresnel "Jean-Augustin Fresnel") modeled hypothetical behavior of the aether. The English physicist [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") introduced the theoretical concept of a field—not action at a distance. Mid-19th century, the Scottish [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") (1831–1879) reduced electricity and magnetism to Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory, whittled down by others to the four [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"). Initially, optics was found consequent of[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] Maxwell's field. Later, radiation and then today's known [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") were found also consequent of[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] this electromagnetic field.

The English physicist [Lord Rayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Rayleigh "Lord Rayleigh") [1842–1919] worked on [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound"). The Irishmen [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") (1805–1865), [George Gabriel Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gabriel_Stokes "George Gabriel Stokes") (1819–1903) and [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") (1824–1907) produced several major works: Stokes was a leader in [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") and fluid dynamics; Kelvin made substantial discoveries in [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"); Hamilton did notable work on [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics"), discovering a new and powerful approach nowadays known as [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"). Very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his German colleague mathematician [Carl Gustav Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacobi "Carl Gustav Jacobi") (1804–1851) in particular referring to [canonical transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_transformations "Canonical transformations"). The German [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz") (1821–1894) made substantial contributions in the fields of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), waves, [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"), and sound. In the United States, the pioneering work of [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs") (1839–1903) became the basis for [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). Fundamental theoretical results in this area were achieved by the German [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") (1844–1906). Together, these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics.

By the 1880s, there was a prominent paradox that an observer within Maxwell's electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed, regardless of the observer's speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic field. Thus, although the observer's speed was continually lost[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] relative to the electromagnetic field, it was preserved relative to other objects _in_ the electromagnetic field. And yet no violation of [Galilean invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance "Galilean invariance") within physical interactions among objects was detected. As Maxwell's electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether"), physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in [aether drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aether_drift&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aether drift (page does not exist)"), shifting the electromagnetic field, explaining the observer's missing speed relative to it. The [Galilean transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation") had been the mathematical process used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of positions in another reference frame, all plotted on [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"), but this process was replaced by [Lorentz transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation"), modeled by the Dutch [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz") [1853–1928].

In 1887, experimentalists Michelson and Morley failed to detect aether drift, however. It was hypothesized that motion _into_ the aether prompted aether's shortening, too, as modeled in the [Lorentz contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_contraction "Lorentz contraction"). It was hypothesized that the aether thus kept Maxwell's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of Galilean invariance across all [inertial frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frames_of_reference "Inertial frames of reference"), while Newton's theory of motion was spared.

Austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach "Ernst Mach") criticized Newton's postulated absolute space. Mathematician [Jules-Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") (1854–1912) questioned even absolute time. In 1905, [Pierre Duhem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Duhem "Pierre Duhem") published a devastating criticism of the foundation of Newton's theory of motion.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-Lakatos1980-16) Also in 1905, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") (1879–1955) published his [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity"), newly explaining both the electromagnetic field's invariance and Galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether, including the existence of aether itself. Refuting the framework of Newton's theory—[absolute space and absolute time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time "Absolute space and time")—special relativity refers to _relative space_ and _relative time_, whereby _length_ contracts and _time_ dilates along the travel pathway of an object.

Cartesian coordinates arbitrarily used rectilinear coordinates. [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), inspired by Descartes' work, introduced curved geometry, replacing rectilinear axes by curved ones. Gauss also introduced another key tool of modern physics: curvature. However, Gauss's work was limited to two dimensions; extending it to three or more dimensions introduced a great deal of complexity, and the need for the (not yet invented) [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"). It was Riemman extended curved geometry to N dimensions. In 1908, Einstein's former mathematics professor [Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski"), applied the curved geometry construction to model 3D space together with the 1D axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth spatial dimension—altogether 4D spacetime—and declared the imminent demise of the separation of space and time. [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-17)

Einstein initially called this "superfluous learnedness", but later used [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime "Minkowski spacetime") with great elegance in his [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-18) extending invariance to all reference frames—whether perceived as inertial or as accelerated—and credited this to Minkowski, by then deceased. General relativity replaces Cartesian coordinates with [Gaussian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_coordinates "Gaussian coordinates"), and replaces Newton's claimed empty yet Euclidean space traversed instantly by Newton's [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") of hypothetical gravitational force—an instant [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance")—with a gravitational _field_. The gravitational field is [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime "Minkowski spacetime") itself, the 4D [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") of Einstein aether modeled on a [Lorentzian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold "Lorentzian manifold") that "curves" geometrically, according to the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"). The concept of Newton's gravity: "two masses attract each other" replaced by the geometrical argument: "mass transform curvatures of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") and free falling particles with mass move along a geodesic curve in the spacetime" ([Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") already existed before the 1850s, by mathematicians [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") and [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") in search for intrinsic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.), in the vicinity of either mass or energy. (Under special relativity—a special case of general relativity—even massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its [mass equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") locally "curving" the geometry of the four, unified dimensions of space and time.)

Another revolutionary development of the 20th century was [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), which emerged from the seminal contributions of [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") (1856–1947) (on [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law")) and Einstein's work on the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect"). In 1912, mathematician [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") published _Sur la théorie des quanta_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-McCormmach-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics#cite_note-Irons-20) He introduced the first non-naïve definition of quantization in this paper. The development of early quantum physics followed by a heuristic framework devised by [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") (1868–1951) and [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") (1885–1962), but this was soon replaced by the [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") developed by [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born") (1882–1970), [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") (1892–1987), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") (1901–1976), [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") (1902–1984), [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") (1887–1961), [Satyendra Nath Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose "Satyendra Nath Bose") (1894–1974), and [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli") (1900–1958).

This revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states, and evolution and measurements in terms of [self-adjoint operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator "Self-adjoint operator") on an infinite-dimensional vector space. That is called [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") (introduced by mathematicians [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") (1862–1943), [Erhard Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Schmidt "Erhard Schmidt") (1876–1959) and [Frigyes Riesz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigyes_Riesz "Frigyes Riesz") (1880–1956) in search of generalization of Euclidean space and study of integral equations), and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") in his celebrated book _[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_Foundations\_of\_Quantum\_Mechanics "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics")_, where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on Hilbert spaces, the [spectral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory "Spectral theory") (introduced by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") who investigated [quadratic forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_forms "Quadratic forms") with infinitely many variables. Many years later, it had been revealed that his spectral theory is associated with the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. He was surprised by this application.) in particular. Paul Dirac used algebraic constructions to produce a relativistic model for the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), predicting its [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") and the existence of its antiparticle, the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron").
