This is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold in which the requirement of positive-definiteness is relaxed.

Every tangent space of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a pseudo-Euclidean vector space .

A special case used in general relativity is a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold for modeling spacetime , where tangent vectors can be classified as timelike, null, and spacelike .

Introduction [ edit ] Manifolds [ edit ] Main articles: Manifold and Differentiable manifold In differential geometry , a differentiable manifold is a space that is locally similar to a Euclidean space . In an n -dimensional Euclidean space any point can be specified by n real numbers. These are called the coordinates of the point.

An n -dimensional differentiable manifold is a generalisation of n -dimensional Euclidean space. In a manifold it may only be possible to define coordinates locally . This is achieved by defining coordinate patches : subsets of the manifold that can be mapped into n -dimensional Euclidean space.

See Manifold , Differentiable manifold , Coordinate patch for more details.

Tangent spaces and metric tensors [ edit ] Main articles: Tangent space and Metric tensor Associated with each point p {\displaystyle p} in an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional differentiable manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a tangent space (denoted T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} ). This is an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional vector space whose elements can be thought of as equivalence classes of curves passing through the point p {\displaystyle p} .

A metric tensor is a non-degenerate , smooth, symmetric, bilinear map that assigns a real number to pairs of tangent vectors at each tangent space of the manifold. Denoting the metric tensor by g {\displaystyle g} we can express this as g : T p M × × T p M → → R .

{\displaystyle g:T_{p}M\times T_{p}M\to \mathbb {R} .} The map is symmetric and bilinear so if X , Y , Z ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle X,Y,Z\in T_{p}M} are tangent vectors at a point p {\displaystyle p} to the manifold M {\displaystyle M} then we have g ( X , Y ) = g ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \,g(X,Y)=g(Y,X)} g ( a X + Y , Z ) = a g ( X , Z ) + g ( Y , Z ) {\displaystyle \,g(aX+Y,Z)=ag(X,Z)+g(Y,Z)} for any real number a ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } .

That g {\displaystyle g} is non-degenerate means there is no non-zero X ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle X\in T_{p}M} such that g ( X , Y ) = 0 {\displaystyle g(X,Y)=0} for all Y ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle Y\in T_{p}M} .

Metric signatures [ edit ] Main article: Metric signature Given a metric tensor g on an n -dimensional real manifold, the quadratic form q ( x ) = g ( x , x ) associated with the metric tensor applied to each vector of any orthogonal basis produces n real values. By Sylvester's law of inertia , the number of each positive, negative and zero values produced in this manner are invariants of the metric tensor, independent of the choice of orthogonal basis. The signature ( p , q , r ) of the metric tensor gives these numbers, shown in the same order. A non-degenerate metric tensor has r = 0 and the signature may be denoted ( p , q ) , where p + q = n .

Definition [ edit ] A pseudo-Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) is a differentiable manifold M that is equipped with an everywhere non-degenerate, smooth, symmetric metric tensor g .

Such a metric is called a pseudo-Riemannian metric .  Applied to a vector field, the resulting scalar field value at any point of the manifold can be positive, negative or zero.

The signature of a pseudo-Riemannian metric is ( p , q ) , where both p and q are non-negative.  The non-degeneracy condition together with continuity implies that p and q remain unchanged throughout the manifold (assuming it is connected).

Lorentzian manifold [ edit ] A Lorentzian manifold is an important special case of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold in which the signature of the metric is (1, n −1) (equivalently, ( n −1, 1) ; see Sign convention ). Such metrics are called Lorentzian metrics . They are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz .

Applications in physics [ edit ] After Riemannian manifolds, Lorentzian manifolds form the most important subclass of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. They are important in applications of general relativity .

A principal premise of general relativity is that spacetime can be modeled as a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold of signature (3, 1) or, equivalently, (1, 3) .  Unlike Riemannian manifolds with positive-definite metrics, an indefinite signature allows tangent vectors to be classified into timelike , null or spacelike .  With a signature of ( p , 1) or (1, q ) , the manifold is also locally (and possibly globally) time-orientable (see Causal structure ).

Properties of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds [ edit ] Just as Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} can be thought of as the local model of a Riemannian manifold , Minkowski space R n − − 1 , 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n-1,1}} with the flat Minkowski metric is the local model of a Lorentzian manifold. Likewise, the model space for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature ( p , q ) is pseudo-Euclidean space R p , q {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{p,q}} , for which there exist coordinates x i such that g = d x 1 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + d x p 2 − − d x p + 1 2 − − ⋯ ⋯ − − d x p + q 2 {\displaystyle g=dx_{1}^{2}+\cdots +dx_{p}^{2}-dx_{p+1}^{2}-\cdots -dx_{p+q}^{2}} Some theorems of Riemannian geometry can be generalized to the pseudo-Riemannian case. In particular, the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is true of all pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. This allows one to speak of the Levi-Civita connection on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold along with the associated curvature tensor . On the other hand, there are many theorems in Riemannian geometry that do not hold in the generalized case. For example, it is not true that every smooth manifold admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric of a given signature; there are certain topological obstructions. Furthermore, a submanifold does not always inherit the structure of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold; for example, the metric tensor becomes zero on any light-like curve . The Clifton–Pohl torus provides an example of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that is compact but not complete, a combination of properties that the Hopf–Rinow theorem disallows for Riemannian manifolds.
