Monaco , [ a ] officially the Principality of Monaco , [ b ] is a sovereign city-state and microstate on the French Riviera a few kilometres west of the Italian region of Liguria , in Western Europe , on the Mediterranean Sea . It is a semi-enclave bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to nearly 39,000 residents as of the 2020s, [ 12 ] of whom about 9,883 are Monégasque nationals.

[ 13 ] It is recognised as one of the wealthiest and most expensive places in the world.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The official language of Monaco is French , and Italian and Monégasque are also spoken and understood by many residents.

[ c ] With an area of 2.03 km 2 (0.78 sq mi), Monaco is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City . Its population of 38,423 in 2024 makes it the most densely populated sovereign state. Monaco has the world's shortest national coastline (not counting landlocked nations): 3.83 km (2.38 mi).

[ 16 ] The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy [ 17 ] and consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo .

The principality is governed under a form of semi-constitutional monarchy , with Prince Albert II as head of state , who holds substantial political powers. The prime minister , who is the head of government , can be either a Monégasque or French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary are detached French magistrates.

[ 18 ] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.

[ 19 ] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 , with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units .

Monaco's economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino , and a rail connection to Paris.

[ 20 ] Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to its status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. Monaco has become a major banking centre and sought to diversify into the services sector and small, high-value-added , non-polluting industries. Monaco is a tax haven ; it has no personal income tax (except for French citizens) and low business taxes . Over 30% of residents are millionaires, [ 21 ] with real estate prices reaching €100,000 ($116,374) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is a global hub of money laundering, and in June 2024 the Financial Action Task Force placed Monaco under increased monitoring to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Monaco is not part of the European Union (EU), but participates in certain EU policies , including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). It hosts the annual motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix , one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One . The local motorsports association gives its name to the Monte Carlo Rally , hosted in January in the French Alps . The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco , which competes in French Ligue 1 and has been French champions on multiple occasions, as well as a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague . A centre of research into marine conservation , Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats, [ 24 ] an Oceanographic Museum , and the International Atomic Energy Agency Marine Environment Laboratories, the only marine laboratory in the UN structure.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] History Main article: History of Monaco Monaco was first mentioned by the Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus , who referred to it as " Monoikos , a Ligurian town".

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Strabo referred to it as Monoikon limen , explaining that Monoikos (Greek for "the solitary one") was another name for Heracles , who had a temple here; [ 29 ] it is likely, however, that it is in fact an alteration of an older Ligurian name.

[ 27 ] In 1191, the Holy Roman Empire granted Monaco to the Genoese in return for cracking down on pirates. By the early 1200s, the Genoese had built a castle on the rock and were utilizing the port. An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldis , captured it in 1297 by posing as monks, but then had to contest it for a century before gaining official control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, it allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco. Likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years due to agreements with either of them, especially for defense. France annexed it in the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia .

In the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence but France allowed it to remain independent and it escaped being incorporated into Italy. However, it shrank considerably when it traded two nearby towns in exchange for sovereignty from France. Monaco relied on tourism from the late 19th century to remain financially solvent, and it was at this time the famous casino and hotels were established. Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers in the 1940s during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then Nazi Germany , before being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several French Resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent. It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union .

Arrival of the Grimaldi family Rainier I , victor of the naval battle at Zierikzee and first sovereign Grimaldi ruler of Monaco Following a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi , known as " Malizia " (translated from Italian either as "The Malicious One" or "The Cunning One"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars – a monaco in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.

[ 32 ] Francesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over "the Rock" continued for another century.

[ 33 ] The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco after fighting the Crown of Aragon over Corsica .

[ 34 ] Aragon eventually became part of a united Spain, and other parts of the land grant came to be integrated piecemeal into other states. Between 1346 and 1355, Monaco annexed the towns of Menton and Roquebrune , increasing its territory by almost ten times.

[ 34 ] 1400–1800 Monaco (as part of the Republic of Genoa) in 1494 In 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of "the Rock of Monaco". In 1612, Honoré II began to style himself "Prince" of Monaco.

[ 35 ] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a "duc et pair étranger".

[ 36 ] The princes of Monaco became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris , and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is of Genoese origin.  The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution .

[ 37 ] 19th century A map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia annexed in 1860 to France (light brown). The area in red had already become part of France before 1860.

In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte).

[ 36 ] [ 38 ] The principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis. It was designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

[ 38 ] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin , the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy ) was ceded to France.

[ 39 ] Monaco became a French protectorate once again. Italian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.

[ 40 ] Before this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune , where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence as the Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune , hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.

[ 41 ] These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs.

[ 42 ] The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents — an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino.

[ 43 ] This made Monaco a playground for the rich and a favoured place for them to live.

[ 44 ] 20th century Photochrom of Monaco circa 1900 Until the Monégasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco , the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers .

[ 45 ] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I suspended it during the First World War.

In July 1918, a new Franco-Monégasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles , established that Monégasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military and economic interests. It also resolved the Monaco succession crisis .

The marriage of Hollywood actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier III brought media attention to the principality.

In 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco , forming a fascist administration.

[ 46 ] In September 1943, after Mussolini's fall from power, the German Wehrmacht occupied Italy and Monaco, and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began.

René Blum , the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opéra in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to Auschwitz , where he was later murdered.

[ 47 ] Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg , the director of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo , helped by the French Resistance , escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland .

[ 48 ] In August 1944, the Germans executed René Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.

Rainier III , succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II , in 1949, and ruled until 2005. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly , an event that was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.

[ 49 ] A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties. In 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French citizens.

[ 50 ] In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations , with full voting rights.

[ 39 ] [ 51 ] 21st century In 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Prince's Palace of Monaco On 31 March 2005, Rainier III , who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.

[ 54 ] He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II , Sovereign Prince of Monaco . Following a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, [ 55 ] in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral , where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Monégasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville .

[ 56 ] On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. "We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France," Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. "In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality." [ 57 ] In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily to accommodate desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.

[ 58 ] Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but had called it off.

[ 58 ] The plan is for about six hectares (15 acres) of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices to a land value of about 1 billion euros .

[ 59 ] The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses.

[ 61 ] The name for the new district is Anse du Portier .

[ 60 ] On 29 February 2020, Monaco announced its first case of COVID-19 , a man who was admitted to the Princess Grace Hospital Centre then transferred to Nice University Hospital in France.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] On 3 September 2020, the first Monégasque satellite, OSM-1 CICERO, was launched into space from French Guiana aboard a Vega rocket .

[ 64 ] The satellite was built in Monaco by Orbital Solutions Monaco.

Government Logo of the princely government of Monaco Politics Main article: Politics of Monaco Albert II, Prince of Monaco Monaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state .

[ 65 ] The executive branch consists of a Minister of State as the head of government , who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government .

[ 66 ] Until 2002, the Minister of State was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Minister of State can be French or Monégasque.

[ 30 ] Since July 2025 the office is held by Christophe Mirmand .

Under the 1962 Constitution of Monaco , the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council .

[ 67 ] The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation.

[ 68 ] All legislation requires the approval of the National Council. Following the 2023 Monegasque general election , all 24 seats are held by the pro-monarchist Monegasque National Union .

[ 69 ] The principality's city affairs are managed by the Municipality of Monaco . The municipality is directed by the Communal Council , [ 70 ] which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor .

[ 71 ] Georges Marsan has been mayor since 2003. Unlike the National Council, communal councillors are elected for four-year terms [ 72 ] and are strictly non-partisan ; oppositions inside the council frequently form.

[ 70 ] [ 73 ] Members of the judiciary of Monaco are appointed by the Sovereign Prince. Key positions within the judiciary are held by French magistrates, proposed by the Government of France. Monaco currently has three examining magistrates .

[ 74 ] Security See also: Law enforcement in Monaco Palace guards in Monaco The wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world.

[ 75 ] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military. Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer.

[ 76 ] There is also a small military force . This consists of a bodyguard unit for the prince and his palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers); [ 77 ] together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence corps ( Sapeurs-Pompiers ) it forms Monaco's total forces.

[ 78 ] The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honoré IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the non-commissioned officers and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army . In addition to their guard duties as described, the carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.

[ 79 ] Geography See also: Land reclamation in Monaco Satellite view of Monaco, with the France–Monaco border shown in yellow Monaco is a sovereign city-state , with five quarters and ten wards, [ 80 ] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe . It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea . Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice .

[ 51 ] It has an area of 2.1 km 2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 ha (510 acres), and a population of 38,400, [ 81 ] making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world .

[ 51 ] The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi), [ 81 ] a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 km (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Lamarck intersection, Les Moneghetti Jurassic limestone is a prominent bedrock which is locally karstified . It hosts the Grotte de l'Observatoire , which has been open to the public since 1946.

[ 84 ] The highest point in the country is at the access to the Patio Palace residential building on the Chemin des Révoires (ward Les Révoires ) from the D6007 ( Moyenne Corniche street) at 164.4 m (539 ft) above sea level .

[ 85 ] The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.

[ 86 ] Saint-Jean brook is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 m; 0.12 mi; 620 ft) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (1.2 acres) in area.

[ 87 ] Monaco's most populated quartier is Monte Carlo , and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins .

[ 88 ] After the expansion of Port Hercules , [ 89 ] Monaco's total area grew to 2.08 km 2 (0.80 sq mi) or 208 ha (510 acres); [ 88 ] subsequently, new plans were approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km 2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 ha (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 89 ] [ 93 ] There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille.

[ 94 ] There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.

[ 94 ] Monaco's only natural resource is fishing ; [ 95 ] with almost the entire country being an urban area , Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry .
A small residential expansion, Le Portier was opened in 2024, and additionally a new esplanade was added at Larvatto beach which also had some maintenance.

[ 96 ] Administrative divisions In the centre is La Condamine . At the right with the smaller harbour is Fontvieille , with The Rock (the old town, fortress, and Palace ) jutting out between the two harbours. At the left are the high-rise buildings of La Rousse/Saint Roman .

Enlargeable, detailed map of Monaco Monaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world ; only Vatican City is smaller.

[ 97 ] Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world.

[ 98 ] The state consists of only one municipality ( commune ), the Municipality of Monaco . There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.

[ 99 ] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities: [ 100 ] Monaco-Ville , the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco , or simply "The Rock"; Monte Carlo , the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast; La Condamine , the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules .

The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, [ 101 ] [ how?

] and they were accorded the status of Wards or Quartiers thereafter.

Fontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s; Moneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine; Larvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo; La Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le Ténao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.

Subsequently, three additional wards were created, but then again were dissolved in 2013: Saint Michel , created from part of Monte Carlo; La Colle , created from part of La Condamine; Les Révoires , also created from part of La Condamine.

Most of Saint Michel became part of Monte Carlo again in 2013. La Colle and Les Révoires were merged the same year as part of a redistricting process, where they became part of the larger Jardin Exotique ward . An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014 [ 102 ] but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time.

[ 106 ] The suburb of Moneghetti , the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.

[ 107 ] Wards Wards of Monaco For town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, "whose current character must be preserved", and wards . The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times. The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards. A new 6-hectare neighbourhood, Le Portier , has been built by land reclaimed from the sea and was opened in December 2024. It was attached to the ward of Larvotto .

It finds its most florid expression in the 1878–9 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids. These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself.

[ 111 ] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II , overturned this Sovereign Order.

[ 112 ] In recent years [ when?

] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage , including its single-family villas, has created dismay.

[ 113 ] The principality has no heritage protection legislation.

[ 114 ] Climate Monaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate ( Köppen climate classification : Csa ), with strong maritime influences, with some resemblances to the humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ). As a result, it has balmy warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The winters are very mild considering the city's latitude, being as mild as locations located much further south in the Mediterranean Basin .

[ 115 ] Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 °C or 86 °F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.

Monaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, [ 125 ] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day.

[ 88 ] According to the CIA World Factbook , Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate [ 126 ] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world.

[ 127 ] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property.

[ 131 ] By 2024, Monaco allows Visa-free travel from 86 countries around the world.

[ 132 ] The world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to Forbes in 2016.

[ 133 ] The state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network ( Monaco Telecom ) used to be fully owned by the state. Its monopoly now comprises only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (6%). Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

[ 134 ] Fontvieille and its harbour Monaco is not a member of the European Union , but is very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro . Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coinage, the Monégasque franc . Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.

Monaco has become a major banking centre, holding over €100 billion worth of funds.

[ 135 ] Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services.

[ 136 ] The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics.

[ failed verification ] [ 126 ] Tourism Tourist arrivals of 2024 in % [ 137 ] One of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casinos and pleasant climate.

[ 83 ] [ 138 ] In 2022 there were about 300,000 international tourist arrivals.

[ 139 ] Monaco is the only place in Europe where credit card points are not redeemable. Hotel points are not able to be accumulated nor are transactions recorded, allowing for an increase in privacy that is sought by many of the locals.

Gambling industry Monte Carlo Casino The plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.

[ 30 ] All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III . The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money.

The towns of Menton and Roquebrune , which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much-improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to the Sardinian intervention and clamoured for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.

The grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates François and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs.

The Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg , a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as "Les Spelugues (Den of Thieves)" to "Monte Carlo (Mount Charles)." [ 140 ] They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed "Monte Carlo" and cleared out the area's less-than-savoury elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.

Atrium in Monte Carlo Casino The Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.

[ 141 ] Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.

[ 142 ] In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House , 46 hotels were built and the number of jewellers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold. In an apparent effort not to overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Monégasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.

[ 143 ] By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques—a masterstroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.

Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort overlooks the Mediterranean Sea Today, Société des bains de mer de Monaco , which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Café de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent [ when?

] addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino , which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea; among other things, it offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with " ticket-in, ticket-out " (TITO). It is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.

[ 144 ] Low taxes Boulevard des Moulins meets Avenue Saint-Michel Pedestrian crossing on Avenue de la Costa Monaco has a 20% VAT plus high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).

[ 145 ] Monaco has never levied income tax on individuals , [ 90 ] and foreigners are thus able to use it as a " tax haven " from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obliged to pay taxes to other countries.

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] The absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy "tax refugee" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco.

Celebrities , such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.

[ 148 ] Per a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.

[ 149 ] The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco. Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.

[ 90 ] In 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration , part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens .

[ 150 ] Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra , Liechtenstein , Liberia , and the Marshall Islands . The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.

[ 151 ] [ 152 ] Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the "grey list" of uncooperative jurisdictions. In 2009, Monaco went a step further and secured a place on the "white list" after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.

[ 90 ] In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: "The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. Difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN." [ 153 ] Tall buildings in Monaco Also in 2000, a report by French politicians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering including within its casino and that the Government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated.

[ 154 ] In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven , [ 155 ] but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] The Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned to implement the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.

[ 158 ] In June 2024, the FATF added Monaco to its "grey list", which includes countries needing "increased monitoring" due to statewide issues of money laundering and terrorist financing.

[ 23 ] Numismatics Main articles: Monégasque franc , Monégasque euro coins , and Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco) Genovese coin from 1655 Monaco issued its own coins in various devaluations connected to the écu already in the seventeenth century, but its first decimal coins of the Monégasque franc were issued in 1837 continued until 2001.

Although Monaco is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union ; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins , which was introduced in 2002.

[ 159 ] In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.

[ 160 ] Three different designs were selected for the Monégasque coins.

[ 161 ] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.

French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Monégasque , its historic vernacular language. A variety of Ligurian , Monégasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Monégasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.

Italian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.

[ 40 ] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860) .

[ 40 ] The Grimaldi , princes of Monaco , are of Ligurian origin; thus, the traditional national language is Monégasque , a variety of Ligurian , now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville , street signs are printed in both French and Monégasque.

In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglican residents in the principality but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books.

[ 170 ] The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe .

There is one Reformed church, which meets in a building located in Rue Louis Notari. The building dates from 1958 to 1959. The church is affiliated with the United Protestant Church of France (Église Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a group that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Église Réformée de France).

[ 179 ] The circuit is narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track.

[ 180 ] One of the most famous, and slowest, turns in all of F1 Racing is the Loews hairpin , later renamed Fairmont hairpin when the hotel by this bend was renamed.

[ 181 ] Formula E Starting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix [ 182 ] and used a shorter configuration of the full Formula 1 circuit, keeping it around Port Hercules until 2021.
