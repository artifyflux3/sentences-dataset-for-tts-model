[ 210 ] Tietê River Brazil Deemed the most polluted river in Brazil, according to National Geographic in 2010.

[ 211 ] Pollution from São Paulo Multiple species threatened, or possibly extinct in the case of the catfish Heptapterus multiradiatus .

[ 212 ] Historically polluted rivers [ edit ] Name Location Description Ayase River Kantō , Japan The most polluted river in Japan from the 1960s to the 1990s, leading to cleanup efforts.

[ 213 ] River Churnet Staffordshire , England Became possibly the most polluted river in Europe in the 19th century. Improved after the decline of industry in Leek and the Churnet Valley .

[ 214 ] Charles River Massachusetts , United States Suffered from significant industrial pollution called "foul and noisome, polluted by offal and industrious wastes, scummy with oil, unlikely to be mistaken for water." [ 215 ] Fish kills and submerged vehicles were a common sight, along with toxic chemical plumes that colored parts of the river pink and orange.

[ 216 ] The Standells sang about the Charles in their 1965 song " Dirty Water ". A combination of public and private initiatives helped drastically lower levels of pollutants, leading to the first "public swims" since the 1950s occurring in 2013.

[ 217 ] Columbia Slough Oregon , United States Became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways due to being used as a waste repository during the first half of the 20th century.

[ 218 ] Cuyahoga River Ohio , United States Infamous for catching on fire at least 14 times due to heavy industrial pollution , helping to spur the American environmental movement and triggering extensive cleanup efforts.

[ 219 ] [ 220 ] Detroit River Metro Detroit , Michigan , United States Was used for industrial purposes for more than 100 years, leading to thousands of migrating birds dying each year from oil slick and chemicals. The river's oxygen levels were depleted to the point where fish could not inhabit its waters. Because this pollution often drained into and affected Lake Erie , the lake was considered "dead" and unable to support aquatic life.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Was designated an ecological refuge in 2001, with cleanup efforts leading to the return of many species of native animals.

[ 222 ] Don River Ontario , Canada By the 1960s the river had become a neglected, polluted mess due to industrial pollution. In 1969, Pollution Probe held a much celebrated "Funeral for the Don" to highlight the plight of the river.

[ 223 ] The river would have a few species of fish be restored following the closure of industrial sites and cleanup efforts.

East River New York City , New York , United States Historically the receptacle for the city's garbage and sewage since New Amsterdam , leading to the destruction of the river's ecosystem. Was regarded as dangerous for anyone to fall into it as late as 2007.

[ 224 ] Environmental controls and cleanups have allowed the ecosystem to gradually rebuild.

[ 173 ] Nervión Spain One of the most polluted rivers in the world due to a century of intense industrial activity causing the lower stretches of the river to become ecologically dead with oxygen levels 20 percent below the norm. Cleanup efforts starting in 1990 as well as the deindustrialization of the area brought about the reintroduction of natural life to the habitat.

[ 225 ] [ 226 ] Saint Louis River Minnesota and Wisconsin , United States One of the most heavily polluted waterways in Minnesota during the mid 20th century due to historical industrial use of the river, before the onset of modern environmental laws, resulting in the degradation of habitat and sediments contaminated with: mercury, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other toxins.

[ 227 ] Still suffers from high levels of mercury in fish tissue despite cleanup efforts.

[ 228 ] [ 229 ] Segura Spain One of the most polluted rivers in Europe in the 1990s, [ 230 ] due to the canning industry and urban and agricultural residues from urban areas. Demonstrations and the construction of hundreds of wastewater treatment and collection systems led to the river becoming the Spanish river with the lowest average pollution in the span of just one decade.

[ 231 ] [ 232 ] River Team Tyne and Wear , England Historically regarded as one of the most polluted rivers in the area due to the discharges from Sewage works near Lamesley and heavy industry in the Team Valley . It is called "The Gut" by the residents of Dunston . However considerable improvements have now been made and the river is relatively clean.

[ 233 ] River Trent England The rapid population increase of the towns that developed following the Industrial Revolution led to an "offensive stench" and thick industrial pollution that peaked in the 1950s.

[ 234 ] [ 235 ] [ 236 ] Vermilion River Louisiana , United States Gained a reputation as the most polluted river in the United States in the 1970s.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Improved sewage treatment , low flow streamflow augmentation, and regular in-stream trash collection have changed its public perception to that of a celebrated recreational resource.

[ 237 ] River Wandle Greater London , England Heavily industrialized in the 18th and 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution , and was declared one of the most polluted rivers in England. Subsequent cleanup efforts have led to a return of the river's brown trout , as well as chub , roach and dace .

[ 239 ] [ 240 ] Yauza Moscow and Mytishchi , Russia Referred to as "the biggest gutter for waste in Moscow " due to industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries. The ecology slightly improved in the 2000s, with the closing or conversion of old factories and cleanup efforts by the city government.
