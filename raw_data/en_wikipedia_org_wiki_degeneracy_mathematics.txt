In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **degenerate case** is a [limiting case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_case_(mathematics) "Limiting case (mathematics)") of a class of objects which appears to be qualitatively different from (and usually simpler than) the rest of the class;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1) "**degeneracy**" is the condition of being a degenerate case.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)

The definitions of many classes of composite or structured objects often implicitly include inequalities. For example, the [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") and the side lengths of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") are supposed to be positive. The limiting cases, where one or several of these inequalities become equalities, are degeneracies. In the case of triangles, one has a _degenerate triangle_ if at least one side length or angle is zero. Equivalently, it becomes a "line segment".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:2-3)

Often, the degenerate cases are the exceptional cases where changes to the usual [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") or the [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") of the object (or of some part of it) occur. For example, a triangle is an object of dimension two, and a degenerate triangle is contained in a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics) "Line (mathematics)"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:2-3) which makes its dimension one. This is similar to the case of a circle, whose dimension shrinks from two to zero as it degenerates into a point.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1) As another example, the [solution set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") of a [system of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_equations "System of equations") that depends on [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") generally has a fixed cardinality and dimension, but cardinality and/or dimension may be different for some exceptional values, called degenerate cases. In such a degenerate case, the [solution set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") is said to be degenerate.

For some classes of composite objects, the degenerate cases depend on the properties that are specifically studied. In particular, the class of objects may often be defined or characterized by systems of equations. In most scenarios, a given class of objects may be defined by several different systems of equations, and these different systems of equations may lead to different degenerate cases, while characterizing the same non-degenerate cases. This may be the reason for which there is no general definition of degeneracy, despite the fact that the concept is widely used and defined (if needed) in each specific situation.

A degenerate case thus has special features which makes it [non-generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_property "Generic property"), or a [special case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_case "Special case"). However, not all non-generic or special cases are degenerate. For example, [right triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle"), [isosceles triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle "Isosceles triangle") and [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") are non-generic and non-degenerate. In fact, degenerate cases often correspond to [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"), either in the object or in some [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(mathematics) "Configuration space (mathematics)"). For example, a [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") is degenerate if and only if it has singular points (e.g., point, line, intersecting lines).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-4)

A degenerate conic is a [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") (a second-degree [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve"), defined by a [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") of degree two) that fails to be an [irreducible curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_variety "Irreducible variety").

*   A [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") is a degenerate [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), namely one with radius 0.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1)
*   The [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics) "Line (mathematics)") is a degenerate case of a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") if the parabola resides on a [tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_plane "Tangent plane"). In [inversive geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversive_geometry "Inversive geometry"), a line is a degenerate case of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), with infinite radius.
*   Two [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") lines also form a degenerate parabola.
*   A [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") can be viewed as a degenerate case of an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") in which the [semiminor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiminor_axis "Semiminor axis") goes to zero, the [foci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") go to the endpoints, and the [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics) "Eccentricity (mathematics)") goes to one.
*   A circle can be thought of as a degenerate ellipse, as the [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics) "Eccentricity (mathematics)") approaches 0 and the foci merge.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1)
*   An ellipse can also degenerate into a single point.
*   A [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola") can degenerate into two lines crossing at a point, through a family of hyperbolae having those lines as common [asymptotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote "Asymptote").

The three types of degenerate triangles, all of which contain zero area.

A degenerate [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") is a "flat" triangle in the sense that it is contained in a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"). It has thus [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinear "Collinear") vertices[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:2-3) and zero area. If the three vertices are all distinct, it has two 0째 angles and one 180째 angle. If two vertices are equal, it has one 0째 angle and two undefined angles. If all three vertices are equal, all three angles are undefined.

A [rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") with one pair of opposite sides of length zero degenerates to a line segment, with zero area. If both of the rectangle's pairs of opposite sides have length zero, the rectangle degenerates to a point.

A [hyperrectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrectangle "Hyperrectangle") is the n-dimensional analog of a rectangle. If its sides along any of the n axes has length zero, it degenerates to a lower-dimensional hyperrectangle, all the way down to a point if the sides aligned with every axis have length zero.

A [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon") is degenerate if at least two consecutive sides coincide at least partially, or at least one side has zero length, or at least one angle is 180째. Thus a degenerate convex polygon of _n_ sides looks like a polygon with fewer sides. In the case of triangles, this definition coincides with the one that has been given above.

A [convex polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polyhedron "Convex polyhedron") is degenerate if either two adjacent facets are [coplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar "Coplanar") or two edges are aligned. In the case of a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron"), this is equivalent to saying that all of its [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") lie in the same [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), giving it a [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") of zero.

*   In contexts where self-intersection is allowed, a double-covered [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is a degenerate [standard torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_torus "Standard torus") where the axis of revolution passes through the center of the generating circle, rather than outside it.
*   A torus degenerates to a circle when its minor radius goes to 0.

When the radius of a sphere goes to zero, the resulting degenerate sphere of zero volume is a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)").

See [general position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_position "General position") for other examples.

*   A set containing a single point is a degenerate [continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_continuum "Linear continuum").
*   Objects such as the [digon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon "Digon") and [monogon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogon "Monogon") can be viewed as degenerate cases of [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"): valid in a general abstract mathematical sense, but not part of the original Euclidean conception of polygons.
*   A [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") which can only take one value has a [degenerate distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_distribution "Degenerate distribution"); if that value is the real number 0, then its [probability density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function "Probability density function") is the [Dirac delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function "Dirac delta function").
*   A [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") is sometimes said to be _degenerate_ if it is a [multiple root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_root "Multiple root"), since generically the _n_ roots of an _n_ th degree polynomial are all distinct.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#cite_note-:1-1) This usage carries over to eigenproblems: a degenerate [eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") is a multiple root of the [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial "Characteristic polynomial").
*   In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), any such [multiplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(mathematics) "Multiplicity (mathematics)") in the eigenvalues of the [Hamiltonian operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_operator "Hamiltonian operator") gives rise to [degenerate energy levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_energy_level "Degenerate energy level"). Usually any such degeneracy indicates some underlying [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") in the system.
