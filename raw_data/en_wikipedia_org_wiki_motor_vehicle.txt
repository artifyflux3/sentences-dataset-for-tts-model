British motorcycle manufacturer A motor vehicle , also known as a motorized vehicle , automotive vehicle , automobile , or road vehicle , is a self-propelled land vehicle , commonly wheeled , that does not operate on rails (such as trains or trams ), does not fly (such as airplanes or helicopters ), does not float on water (such as boats or ships ), and is used for the transportation of people or cargo .

The vehicle propulsion is provided by an engine or motor , usually a gasoline / diesel internal combustion engine or an electric traction motor , or some combination of the two as in hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles . For legal purpose, motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including cars , buses , motorcycles , off-road vehicles , light trucks and regular trucks . These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country.

ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicle types, terms and definitions.

[ 2 ] Typically, to avoid requiring people with disabilities from having to possess an operator's license to use one, or requiring tags and insurance, powered wheelchairs will be specifically excluded by law from being considered motor vehicles.

As of 2011 [update] , there were more than one billion motor vehicles in use in the world, excluding off-road vehicles and heavy construction equipment .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The US publisher Ward's estimates that as of 2019, there were 1.4 billion motor vehicles in use in the world.

[ 6 ] Global vehicle ownership per capita in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation (VIO) per 1000 people.

[ 5 ] China has the largest motor vehicle fleet in the world, with 322 million motor vehicles registered at the end of September 2018.

[ 7 ] The United States has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 832 vehicles in operation per 1000 people in 2016.

[ 8 ] Also, China became the world's largest new car market in 2009.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 9 ] In 2022, a total of 85 million cars and commercial vehicles were built, led by China which built a total of 27 million motor vehicles.

[ 10 ] Definitions and terminology [ edit ] In 1968 the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic gave one of the first international definitions of a motor vehicle: (o) “Power-driven vehicle” means any self-propelled road vehicle, other than a moped in the territories of Contracting Parties which do not treat mopeds as motorcycles, and other than a rail-borne vehicle; (p) “Motor vehicle” means any power-driven vehicle which is normally used for carrying persons or goods by road or for drawing, on the road, vehicles used for the carriage of persons or goods. This term embraces trolley-buses, that is to say, vehicles connected to an electric conductor and not rail-borne. It does not cover vehicles, such as agricultural tractors, which are only incidentally used for carrying persons or goods by road or for drawing, on the road, vehicles used for the carriage of persons or goods — Vienna convention on road traffic Other sources might provide other definitions, for instance in the year 1977, ISO 3833:1977 provide other definitions.

Ownership trends [ edit ] Further information: List of countries and territories by motor vehicles per capita Motor vehicle ownership per 1000 inhabitants in 2014 Trucks' share of U.S. vehicles produced, has tripled since 1975. Though vehicle fuel efficiency has increased within each category, the overall trend toward less efficient types of vehicles has offset some of the benefits of greater fuel economy and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

[ 11 ] Without the shift towards SUVs, energy use per unit distance could have fallen 30% more than it did from 2010 to 2022.

[ 12 ] The U.S. publisher Ward's estimates that as of 2010, there were 1.015 billion motor vehicles in use in the world. This figure represents the number of cars, trucks (light, medium and heavy duty), and buses, but does not include off-road vehicles or heavy construction equipment . The world vehicle population passed the 500 million-unit mark in 1986, from 250 million motor vehicles in 1970. Between 1950 and 1970, the vehicle population doubled roughly every 10 years.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Navigant Consulting forecasts that the global stock of light-duty motor vehicles will reach 2 billion units in 2035.

[ 13 ] Global vehicle ownership in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation per 1,000 people, a ratio of 1:6.75 vehicles to people, slightly down from 150 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2009, a rate of 1:6.63 vehicles to people.

[ 5 ] The global rate of motorization increased in 2013 to 174 vehicles per 1000 people.

[ 14 ] In developing countries vehicle ownership rates rarely exceed 200 cars per 1,000 population.

[ 15 ] The following table summarizes the evolution of motor vehicle registrations in the world from 1960 to 2019: Historical trend of worldwide vehicle registrations 1960-2017 (thousands) [ 8 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Type of vehicle 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Car registrations (1) 98,305 193,479 320,390 444,900 548,558 617,914 723,567 931,260 973,353 1,015,643 1,042,274 1,083,528 Truck and bus registrations 28,583 52,899 90,592 138,082 203,272 245,798 309,395 332,434 348,919 356,044 389,174 406,770 World total 126,888 246,378 410,982 582,982 751,830 863,712 1,032,962 1,263,694 1,322,272 1,371,687 1,431,448 1,490,298 Note (1) Car registrations do not include U.S. light trucks (SUVs, minivan and pickups) that are used for personal travel. The US accounts these vehicles among trucks.

Alternative fuels and vehicle technology adoption See also: Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles Annual sales of plug-in passenger cars in the world's top markets between 2011 and 2023 Since the early 2000s, the number of alternative fuel vehicles has been increasing driven by the interest of several governments to promote their widespread adoption through public subsidies and other non-financial incentives. Governments have adopted these policies due to a combination of factors, such as environmental concerns , high oil prices, and less dependence on imported oil .

[ 3 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Among the fuels other than traditional petroleum fuels ( gasoline or diesel fuel ), and alternative technologies for powering the engine of a motor vehicle, the most popular options promoted by different governments are: natural gas vehicles , LPG powered vehicles , flex-fuel vehicles , use of biofuels , hybrid electric vehicles , plug-in hybrids , electric cars , and hydrogen fuel cell cars .

[ 3 ] Since the late 2000s, China, European countries, the United States, Canada, Japan and other developed countries have been providing strong financial incentives to promote the adoption of plug-in electric vehicle . As of 2020 [update] , the stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles in use totaled over 10 million units.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] As of 2019 [update] , in addition, the medium and heavy commercial segments add another 700,000 units to the global stock of plug-in electric vehicles.

[ 25 ] In 2020 the global market share of plug-in passenger car sales was 4.2%, up from 2.5% in 2019.

[ 24 ] Nevertheless, despite government support and the rapid growth experienced, the plug-in electric car segment represented just about 1 out of every 250 vehicles (0.4%) on the world's roads by the end of 2018.

[ 26 ] China [ edit ] The People's Republic of China became the world's largest new car market in 2009.

The People's Republic of China had 322 million motor vehicles in use at the end of September 2018, of which, 235 million were passenger cars in 2018, making China the country with largest motor vehicle fleet in the world.

[ 7 ] In 2016, the motor vehicle fleet consisted of 165.6 million cars and 28.4 million trucks and buses.

[ 8 ] About  13.6 million vehicles were sold in 2009, and motor vehicle registrations in 2010 increased to more than 16.8 million units, representing nearly half the world's fleet increase in 2010.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Ownership per capita rose from 26.6 vehicles per 1000 people in 2006 to 141.2 in 2016.

[ 8 ] The stock of highway-legal plug-in electric or new energy vehicles in China totaled 2.21 million units by the end of September 2018, of which, 81% are all-electric vehicles . These figures include heavy-duty commercial vehicles such buses and sanitation trucks, which represent about 11% of the total stock.

[ 27 ] China is also the world's largest electric bus market, reaching about 385,000 units by the end of 2017.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] The number of cars and motorcycles in China increased 20 times between 2000 and 2010.

[ 30 ] This explosive growth has allowed China to become the world's largest new car market, overtaking the US in 2009.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] Nevertheless, ownership per capita is 58 vehicles per 1000 people, or a ratio of 1:17.2 vehicles to people, still well below the rate of motorization of developed countries .
