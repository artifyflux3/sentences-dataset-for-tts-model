[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Inc. 500 [ edit ] In April 1979, the inaugural issue of Inc. featured the 'Inc. 100,' a list of the fastest-growing, publicly held small companies. By 1982, this list had expanded to the 'Inc. 500,' ranking companies based on their overall revenue growth over a three-year period. The top 500 companies are featured in the September issue of Inc. magazine each year, highlighting their significant growth and achievements in the private sector of the United States.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Inc. 5000 [ edit ] Inc. 5000 was first presented in 2007, expanding the Inc. 500. It lists the 5,000 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. This list ranks these companies based on their revenue growth rate. It categorizes the fastest-growing companies by industry, metro area, revenue, and number of employees.

[ 19 ] To be eligible, privately owned companies must demonstrate three years of revenue growth among other criteria. Once included in the Inc. 5000, these companies are invited to a three-day Inc. conference. While all 5,000 companies are profiled on Inc.com, only the top 500 gain the spotlight in the September issue of Inc. magazine.

[ 19 ] Notable articles and writers [ edit ] David Birch: Birch was director at MIT when his research revealed that small businesses were responsible for creating the majority of new jobs in the U.S. This finding challenged the conventional wisdom at the time and influenced economic policy and entrepreneurship research. Birch came to Inc. to write more about small business owners.  His work has been widely cited in academic papers and government reports, shaping the understanding of small business dynamics.

[ 14 ] [ 13 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] This Man Has Changed Business Forever (October 1981) : The article featured Steve Jobs and Apple, marking the first time Jobs appeared on the cover of a major magazine. It highlighted Apple's innovative approach to technology and Jobs' visionary leadership. It has been referenced in books and articles about Apple and the tech industry.
