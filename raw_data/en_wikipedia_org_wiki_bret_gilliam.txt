He was most famous as co-founder of the certification agency Technical Diving International along with Mitch Skaggs , and as the one time holder of the world record for deep diving on air .

[ 1 ] He is also one of diving's most popular writers. Gilliam is the author or coauthor of 72 books, over 1500 feature magazine articles, and over 100 magazine cover photos. In his diving career he has logged over 19,000 dives [ citation needed ] since 1959.

Gilliam was a multimillionaire from the sale of several businesses that included Technical Diving International (TDI), V. I. Divers Ltd., AMF Yacht Charters, Ocean Quest Cruise Lines, G2 Publishing (Fathoms Magazine), Sea Ventures Ltd., and Uwatec . Several of his companies grew into multi-national conglomerates and two were taken public in major sales while others were sold to private investment groups. The aggregate value of his companies when he sold them was over $80 million.

[ citation needed ] Gilliam formed the consulting service Ocean Tech in 1971 and provided expert witness testimony for diving and maritime related legal cases. Since 1973, he has appeared in over 400 [ citation needed ] legal cases nearly exactly evenly divided between defense and plaintiff litigation. (A case in which he appeared as the maritime and diving expert witness for the plaintiffs resulted in a $12 million settlement in May 2015.

[ 2 ] ) Gilliam has also testified in criminal trials and been Congressionally appointed to military court martial proceedings for the U.S. Marine Corps. Special Consultant in various capacities for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He was the first of three children. His younger brother Chris was murdered in 1972 at the age of 16 while attending an outdoor concert in Puerto Rico .

Education [ edit ] In 1959, the YMCA developed the first nationally organized course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors , [ 3 ] and Gilliam began his diving training with Lt. Chuck Brestle while his family was stationed at the Naval Air Station Key West that same year.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] From 1965 to 1967 he attended Virginia Beach High School until the school system split students to attend the newly created First Colonial High School . He remained at First Colonial High School until 1967 when his father was transferred to Brunswick Naval Air Station as Senior Executive Officer. He graduated from Brunswick High School in Brunswick, Maine , in 1969. While in high school, he was a stand-out athlete playing football, ice hockey, and baseball while also swimming and running track. He also was sponsored as a surfing competitor for Hobie and Hansen surfboards [ citation needed ] and participated in contest events on the east and west coasts (and Caribbean) as well as promotional sales activities for those manufacturers from 1965 to 1970.

Gilliam then went on to attend the University of Maine and Bowdoin College where he studied history and political science .

[ 5 ] He won a National ROTC Scholarship in 1968 and was scheduled to be commissioned as an Army officer when he was recruited to do alternate service on a Navy deep diving project filming nuclear fast attack submarines.

[ citation needed ] Gilliam left his undergraduate studies early to join the Navy project and then went on to pursue a business career by starting Ocean Tech.

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Gilliam held several diving jobs and competed as a semi-professional surfer while in high school and college.

[ 5 ] In 1971, Gilliam was a diving Supervisor for Vocaline Air Sea Technology (VAST Inc.). The VAST Inc. contract took him to the Caribbean where he worked to develop nitrox and decompression procedures for their dive teams.

[ 6 ] It was here that Gilliam's interest in underwater photography began. Their work was to record the "visible wake vortex that came off the propeller " of submarines .

[ 4 ] In 1972 off the island of St. Croix, Gilliam's dive buddy Rod Temple was attacked by oceanic whitetip sharks during a project and was killed. Gilliam was cited for heroism by the Virgin Islands' Governor for his attempt to save Temple when he broke off his decompression and swam back into the attack. Both divers were dragged to depths in excess of 350 feet during the struggle before Temple was torn from Gilliam's grasp.

[ 7 ] Gilliam survived an out-of-air free ascent from extreme depth and had to be evacuated to Puerto Rico to be treated for decompression sickness .

[ 4 ] [ 7 ] That same year, he also created his consulting company Ocean Tech in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

V.I. Divers Ltd. was founded by Gilliam in 1973 in St. Croix as a dive resort that not only catered to recreational divers but also scientific divers .

[ 6 ] The company (and others that followed) also had a filming and studio support division that provided location services for boats, diving, equipment, helicopter & aircraft, stunt persons, and local logistics for Hollywood movies, television series, documentaries, and tourism promotions. Film work included movies such as "Pleasure Island", "The Deep", "The Island of Dr. Moreau", "The Man Without A Face", "Dreams of Gold",  "Going Overboard", "The Island", "Having A Ball", "Abyss", "The Dive", "Message In A Bottle", "Head Above Water", as well as television productions such as "Miami Vice", "Greatest American Hero", "ABC Sports", "Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau", "HBO", "Showtime", "Discovery Channel", "National Geographic Explorer", "Travel Channel", "Cinemax", "Today", "NBC's live broadcasts of the 1983 America's Cup Races", "Encore Productions", "BBC", and "The Playboy Channel". In 1977, Gilliam served as the founder and president of AMF Yacht Charters Ltd. providing luxury motor yacht charters on vessels up to 380 feet in length.

Gilliam also began conducting research on dive computer safety during this time [ 9 ] and remained with Ocean Quest until the company was sold to Sea Escape Cruise Lines in the fall of 1990.

Gilliam performed a deep air dive on February 14, 1990, at a site named "Mary's Place" in Roatán to 452 feet (138 m).

International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers [ edit ] In 1991, Gilliam joined Dick Rutkowski , Tom Mount and Billy Deans on the board of directors for International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). During this time, Gilliam also served as the vice-president of the company.

[ 6 ] Gilliam co-authored two books over this time period in addition to his work on the training materials used in IANTD courses.

[ 8 ] [ 12 ] He remained in this position with IANTD until 1994 when he joined Mitch Skaggs and Tanya Burnett and formed the training agency Technical Diving International (TDI) as part of the corporation International Training Inc. TDI quickly grew to be the largest technical training agency in the world with offices in 26 countries.

International Training Inc [ edit ] International Training Inc. is the parent company for Technical Diving International (TDI), Scuba Diving International (SDI), and Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI), diving certification agencies originally headquartered in Topsham, Maine .

TDI was founded in 1992 by Bret Gilliam, Mitch Skaggs and Tanya Burnett along with several other minority shareholders after a disagreement between IANTD directors caused Gilliam to sell his stock and split away to form the agency.
