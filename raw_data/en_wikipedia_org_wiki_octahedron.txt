In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), an **octahedron** (pl.: **octahedra** or **octahedrons**) is any [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") with eight faces. One special case is the [regular octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron "Regular octahedron"), a [Platonic solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid") composed of eight [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle"), four of which meet at each vertex. Many types of irregular octahedra also exist, including both [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") and non-convex shapes.

A [regular octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron "Regular octahedron")

The [regular octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron "Regular octahedron") has eight [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") sides, six [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") at which four sides meet, and twelve edges. Its [dual polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron "Dual polyhedron") is a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-1) It can be formed as the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull "Convex hull") of the six axis-parallel [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). It is one of the five [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-2) and the three-dimensional case of an infinite family of [regular polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope "Regular polytope"), the [cross polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_polytope "Cross polytope").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-3) Although it does not tile space by itself, it can tile space together with the [regular tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_tetrahedron "Regular tetrahedron") to form the [tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral-octahedral_honeycomb "Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-4)

It occurs in nature in certain [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"), in architecture as part of certain types of [space frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_frame "Space frame"), and in popular culture as the shape of certain eight-sided [dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice "Dice").

Combinatorially equivalent to the regular octahedron

[Bricard octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricard_octahedron "Bricard octahedron") with an [antiparallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparallelogram "Antiparallelogram") as its equator. The axis of symmetry passes through the plane of the antiparallelogram.

The following polyhedra are combinatorially equivalent to the regular octahedron. They all have six vertices, eight triangular faces, and twelve edges that correspond one-for-one with the features of it:

*   Triangular [antiprisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprism "Antiprism"): Two faces are equilateral, lie on parallel planes, and have a common axis of symmetry. The other six triangles are isosceles. The regular octahedron is a special case in which the six lateral triangles are also equilateral.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-5)
*   Tetragonal [bipyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipyramid "Bipyramid"), in which at least one of the equatorial quadrilaterals lies on a plane. The regular octahedron is a special case in which all three quadrilaterals are planar squares.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-6)
*   [Schönhardt polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhardt_polyhedron "Schönhardt polyhedron"), a non-convex polyhedron that cannot be partitioned into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-7)
*   [Bricard octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricard_octahedron "Bricard octahedron"), a non-convex self-crossing [flexible polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_polyhedron "Flexible polyhedron").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-ft-9)

Other convex polyhedra
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Octahedron&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Other convex polyhedra")]

The regular octahedron has 6 vertices and 12 edges, the minimum for an octahedron; irregular octahedra may have as many as 12 vertices and 18 edges.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-10) There are 257 topologically distinct _convex_ octahedra, excluding mirror images. More specifically there are 2, 11, 42, 74, 76, 38, 14 for octahedra with 6 to 12 vertices respectively.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron#cite_note-12) (Two polyhedra are "topologically distinct" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)

Notable eight-sided convex polyhedra include:
