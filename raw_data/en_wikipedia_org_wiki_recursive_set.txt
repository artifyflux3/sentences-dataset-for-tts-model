A set is noncomputable (or undecidable) if it is not computable.

Definition [ edit ] A subset S {\displaystyle S} of the natural numbers is computable if there exists a total computable function f {\displaystyle f} such that: f ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=1} if x ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle x\in S} f ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x)=0} if x ∉ ∉ S {\displaystyle x\notin S} .

In other words, the set S {\displaystyle S} is computable if and only if the indicator function 1 S {\displaystyle \mathbb {1} _{S}} is computable .

Examples [ edit ] Every recursive language is computable.

Every finite or cofinite subset of the natural numbers is computable.

Properties [ edit ] Both A , B are sets in this section.

If A is computable then the complement of A is computable.

If A and B are computable then: A ∩ B is computable.

A ∪ B is computable.

The image of A × B under the Cantor pairing function is computable.

In general, the image of a computable set under a computable function is computably enumerable, but possibly not computable.

A is computable if and only if A and the complement of A are both computably enumerable(c.e.) .

The image of a computable set under a total computable bijection is computable.

A is computable if and only if it is at level Δ Δ 1 0 {\displaystyle \Delta _{1}^{0}} of the arithmetical hierarchy .

A is computable if and only if it is either the image (or range) of a nondecreasing total computable function, or the empty set.
