In classical differential geometry , Clairaut's relation , named after Alexis Claude de Clairaut , is a formula that characterizes the great circle paths on the unit sphere .  The formula states that if γ is a parametrization of a great circle then ρ ρ ( γ γ ( t ) ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ψ ψ ( γ γ ( t ) ) = constant , {\displaystyle \rho (\gamma (t))\sin \psi (\gamma (t))={\text{constant}},\,} where ρ ( P ) is the distance from a point P on the great circle to the z -axis, and ψ ( P ) is the angle between the great circle and the meridian through the point P .

The relation remains valid for a geodesic on an arbitrary surface of revolution .

A statement of the general version of Clairaut's relation is: [ 1 ] Let γ be a geodesic on a surface of revolution S , let ρ be the distance of a point of S from the axis of rotation , and let ψ be the angle between γ and the meridian of S . Then ρ sin ψ is constant along γ. Conversely, if  ρ sin ψ  is constant along some curve γ in the surface, and if no part of γ is part of some parallel of S , then γ is a geodesic.

— Andrew Pressley: Elementary Differential Geometry , p. 183 Pressley (p. 185) explains this theorem as an expression of conservation of angular momentum about the axis of revolution when a particle moves along a geodesic under no forces other than those that keep it on the surface.
