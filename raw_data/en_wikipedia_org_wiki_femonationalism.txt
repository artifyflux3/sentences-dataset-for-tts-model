association between a nationalist ideology and some feminist ideas, especially when driven by xenophobic motivations.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The term was originally proposed by the researcher Sara R. Farris to refer  to the processes by which some powers line up with the claims of the feminist movement in order to justify aporophobic , racist , and xenophobic positions, arguing that immigrants are sexist and that Western society is entirely egalitarian .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The main critiques of this phenomenon focus on the partial and sectarian use of the feminist movement to further ends based on social intolerance , ignoring the sexism and lack of real social equality in Western society as a whole.
