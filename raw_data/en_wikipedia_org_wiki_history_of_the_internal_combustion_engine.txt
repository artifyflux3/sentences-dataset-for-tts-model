Following the first commercial steam engine (a type of external combustion engine) by Thomas Savery in 1698, various efforts were made during the 18th century to develop equivalent internal combustion engines. In 1791, the English inventor John Barber patented a gas turbine . In 1794, Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794, Robert Street patented an internal-combustion engine, which was also the first to use liquid fuel (petroleum) and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, French engineers Nicéphore and Claude Niépce ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyréolophore . This engine powered a boat on the river in France. The same year, the Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built and patented a hydrogen and oxygen-powered internal-combustion engine. Fitted to a crude four-wheeled wagon, François Isaac de Rivaz first drove it 100 metres in 1813, thus making history as the first car-like vehicle known to have been powered by an internal-combustion engine.

Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially in the United States in 1823. Brown also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine-driven carriage in 1828. Father Eugenio Barsanti , an Italian engineer, together with Felice Matteucci of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses". In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, Nicolaus Otto patented the first commercially successful gas engine.

George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine in 1872. In 1876, Nicolaus Otto , working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach , patented the compressed charge, four-stroke cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gas engine. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1954 German engineer Felix Wankel patented a "pistonless" engine using an eccentric rotary design.

The first liquid-fuelled rocket was launched in 1926 by Robert Goddard . The Heinkel He 178 became the world's first jet aircraft by 1939, followed by the first ramjet engine in 1949 and the first scramjet engine in 2004.

Prior to 1850 [ edit ] Types of farm equipment typically powered by early engines (scale models) Before 100 AD: The fire piston is invented in Southeast Asia , and its use is concentrated in Austronesia . This device and the aforementioned Diesel's experiences with pneumatic pumps, inspired the Diesel engine , which also uses compression ignition (as opposed to spark ignition ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Sometime between the 10th and 13th centuries (dating uncertain): The fire arrow , a gunpowder -fuelled form of rocket engine , is invented in China.

[ 3 ] 1678–1679: The Huygens' engine , a prototype single-cylinder gunpowder engine is built by Dutch inventor Christiaan Huygens .

1745 : Abbot Agostino Ruffo of Verona testing a pump for leaks noticed that, after pressurization the wood plug had been scorched. Later he made an apparatus to further study timber ignition by pumps.

[ 4 ] 1780s: An "electric pistol", which used an electric spark to ignite hydrogen gas in an enclosed vessel, is invented by Italian chemist Alessandro Volta .

[ 5 ] This is possibly the first example of a spark-ignition heat engine.

1791: The principle for a gas turbine engine is described in the patent A Method for Rising Inflammable Air for the Purposes of Producing Motion and Facilitating Metallurgical Operations by British inventor John Barber .

1794: A reciprocating piston engine is built by Robert Street. This engine was fuelled by gas vapours, used the piston's intake stroke to draw in outside air, and the air/fuel mixture was ignited by an external flame.

The design was intended to provide power by the vacuum in the combustion chamber pulling the piston downwards, following the explosion of a gas fuel within the combustion chamber.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] 1860: Belgian-French [ 15 ] engineer Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir invented an atmospheric (non-compression) gas engine, using a layout similar to a horizontal double acting steam engine .

[ 17 ] : p31 Fuel consumption of this engine was less than half that of the Lenoir and Hugon engines.

[ 17 ] : p34-35 1865: The Hugon engine – an improved version of the Lenoir engine with flame ignition, better fuel economy [ 22 ] and water injection into the cylinders for cooling – is introduced by French engineer Pierre Hugon. This engine was produced commercially for applications such as printing presses and patent offices.

1872: The first commercial liquid-fuelled engine, the Brayton's Ready Motor was patented by American engineer George Brayton. This engine used constant pressure combustion and began commercial production in 1876.

[ 17 ] : p413-414 1876: The first functional Otto cycle engine – called the Otto Silent Engine – is built by Nicholas Otto, Franz Rings and Herman Schumm at the German company Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik . The engine compressed the air/fuel mixture before combustion, unlike the other atmospheric engines of the time. The engine was a single-cylinder unit that displaced 6.1 dm 3 , and was rated 3 PS (2,206 W) at 180/min, with a fuel consumption of 0.95 m 3 /PSh (1.29 m 3 /kWh).

[ 17 ] : p43-44 Wilhelm Maybach later improved the engine by changing the connecting rod and piston design from trunk to crosshead , so it could be put into series production.

[ 17 ] : p45 1876: Otto applied for a patent on a stratified charge engine that would use the four-stroke principle. The patent was granted in 1876 in Elsass–Lothringen , and transformed into a German Realm Patent in 1877 (DRP 532, 4 August 1877).

in 1794, Thomas Mead and Robert Street both obtained patents in England for gas or vapor engines, Mead proposing to raise the piston in his engine cylinder by the ignition of a gaseous, explosive mixture and to utilize for the down-stroke both the weight of the piston and the partial vacuum formed underneath it.
