Inscription on the wooden church in Mănăilești-Moșteni, Vâlcea county.

The measures of the old Romanian system varied greatly not only between the three Romanian states ( Wallachia , Moldavia , Transylvania ), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as iugăr unit), Slavic (such as vadră unit), Greek (such as dram unit) and Turkish (such as palmac unit) systems.

This system is no longer in wide use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864, however some rural communities still use a small subset of these units.
