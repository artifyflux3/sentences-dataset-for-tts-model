[ 2 ] He also created and launched the first successful commercial anti-spam service.

[ 3 ] He authored the standard UNIX system programs SENDS , proxynet , rtty and Vixie cron . At one point he ran his own consulting business, Vixie Enterprises. In 2002, Vixie held the record for "most CERT advisories due to a single author".

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early life [ edit ] Paul A Vixie was born on 23 May 1963 and grew up in San Francisco, and his mother's maiden name is Killian.

[ 6 ] "There were no computers at my school . I used to cut school and go to City College of San Francisco , where they had a Honeywell system " — Paul Vixie [ 7 ] In 1980, when George Washington High School in San Francisco told him he'd have to repeat 11th grade, he quit school and got a job as a programmer at a consulting firm.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Career [ edit ] Vixie worked on BIND [ 10 ] as a software engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1988 to 1993.

[ 1 ] After he left DEC in 1994, [ 11 ] he founded Internet Software Consortium (ISC) in 1996 [ 1 ] together with Rick Adams and Carl Malamud to support BIND and other software for the Internet . The activities of ISC were assumed by a new company, Internet Systems Consortium in 2004. Although ISC operates the F root name server , Vixie at one point joined the Open Root Server Network (ORSN) project and operated their L root server.

In 1995 he cofounded the Palo Alto Internet Exchange ( PAIX ) and, after Metromedia Fiber Network (MFN) bought it in 1999, served as the chief technology officer to MFN / AboveNet and later as the president of PAIX.

[ 12 ] In 1998 he cofounded Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS), a California non-profit company with the goal of stopping email abuse .

Vixie is the author of several Request for Comments (RFC)s, including a Best Current Practice document on "Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA Delegation" (BCP 20), [ 12 ] and some Unix software. He stated in 2002 that he "now hold[s] the record for 'most CERT advisories due to a single author.'" [ 13 ] [ 4 ] In 2008, Vixie served as a judge for the Mozilla Foundation 's "Download Day", an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for most downloads in a single day for a new piece of software.

[ 14 ] Vixie served on the board of trustees of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) from 2005 to 2013, and served as chairman in 2009 and 2010.

[ 15 ] Vixie also serves on the Security and Stability Advisory Committee of ICANN .

[ 16 ] He received a Ph.D. in computer science from Keio University in 2011.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In 2013, after nearly 20 years at ISC, he founded a new company,  Farsight Security, Inc. spinning off the Security Business Unit from ISC.

[ 19 ] In 2014, Vixie was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame as an Innovator.

[ 20 ] In 2021, Vixie's company FarSight Security was acquired by DomainTools.

[ 21 ] Since 2022, he has been working at AWS.

If this book had existed when I was learning C in the early 1980s, then I might not now hold the record for 'most CERT advisories due to a single author.' Anyone who wants a coding job at ISC in the future should be prepared to demonstrate that they have read and understand Secure Coding .
