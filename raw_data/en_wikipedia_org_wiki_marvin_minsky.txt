Horn Carl Hewitt David Levitt [ 4 ] Website web .media .mit .edu /~minsky Marvin Lee Minsky (August 9, 1927 – January 24, 2016) was an American cognitive and computer scientist concerned largely with research in artificial intelligence (AI). He co-founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's AI laboratory and wrote extensively about AI and philosophy.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Minsky received many accolades and honors, including the 1969 Turing Award .

Early life and education [ edit ] Marvin Lee Minsky was born in New York City, to Henry, an eye surgeon , and Fannie (Reiser), a Zionist activist.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] His family was Jewish. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and the Bronx High School of Science . He later attended Phillips Academy in Andover , Massachusetts . He then served in the US Navy from 1944 to 1945. He received a B.A. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1950 and a Ph.D.

in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954. His doctoral dissertation was titled "Theory of neural-analog reinforcement systems and its application to the brain-model problem." [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] He was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1954 to 1957.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Minsky was on the MIT faculty from 1958 to his death. He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1958; a year later, he and John McCarthy initiated what was, as of 2003 [update] , named the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences as well as professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT.

Contributions in computer science [ edit ] 3D profile of a coin (partial) measured with a modern confocal white light microscope Minsky's inventions include the first head-mounted graphical display (1963) [ 25 ] and the confocal microscope [ 6 ] [ note 1 ] (1957, a predecessor to today's widely used confocal laser scanning microscope ). With Seymour Papert , he developed the first Logo " turtle ". In 1951, Minsky built the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, SNARC . In 1962, he worked on small universal Turing machines and published his well-known 7-state, 4-symbol machine.

[ 26 ] Minsky's book Perceptrons (written with Papert) attacked the work of Frank Rosenblatt , and became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks . The book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it greatly discouraged research on neural networks in the 1970s and contributed to the so-called " AI winter ".

[ 27 ] Minsky also founded several other AI models. His paper "A framework for representing knowledge" [ 28 ] created a new paradigm in knowledge representation.

Perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book, but the theory of frames is in wide use.

[ 29 ] Minsky also wrote of the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans, thus permitting communication.

[ 30 ] In the early 1970s, at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, Minsky and Papert started developing what came to be known as the Society of Mind theory. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas for the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a videocamera, and a computer to build with children's blocks. In 1986, he published The Society of Mind , a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for the general public.

The MA-3 Robotic Manipulator Arm, on display at MIT Museum General view The Belgrade Hand In 2006, Minsky published The Emotion Machine , a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories, often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones. Drafts of the book are available on his website.

[ 31 ] Minsky also invented a "gravity machine" that will ring a bell if the gravitational constant changes, a theoretical possibility that is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.

[ 7 ] Role in popular culture [ edit ] Minsky was an adviser [ 32 ] on Stanley Kubrick 's movie 2001: A Space Odyssey ; one of the movie's characters, Victor Kaminski, was named in Minsky's honor.

[ 33 ] Minsky is mentioned explicitly in Arthur C. Clarke 's novel of the same name, where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the then-future 1980s, paving the way for HAL 9000 in the early 21st century: In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had shown how artificial neural networks could be generated automatically—self replicated—in accordance with any arbitrary learning program. Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, and even if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding.

[ 34 ] In " The Law of Non-Contradiction ", episode 3 of the television anthology series Fargo (Season 3) , at least two allusions to Minsky are made. The first is through the depiction of a " useless machine ": a device Minsky invented as a philosophical joke. The second is through the depiction of an animation of a robot called "minsky"—a character in a sci-fi novel called The Planet Wyh .

Personal life [ edit ] The Minskytron or "Three Position Display" running on the Computer History Museum 's PDP-1 , 2007 In 1952, Minsky married pediatrician Gloria Rudisch; together they had three children.

[ 35 ] Minsky was a talented improvisational pianist [ 36 ] who published musings on the relations between music and psychology .

Opinions [ edit ] Minsky was an atheist.

[ 37 ] He was a signatory to the Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics .

[ 38 ] He was a critic of the Loebner Prize for conversational robots, [ 39 ] and argued that a fundamental difference between humans and machines is that while humans are machines, they are machines in which intelligence emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi-autonomous agents the brain comprises.

[ 40 ] He argued that "somewhere down the line, some computers will become more intelligent than most people", but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be.

[ 41 ] He cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal, [ 42 ] but believed that such scenarios are "hard to take seriously" because he felt confident that AI would be well tested before being deployed.

[ 43 ] Association with Jeffrey Epstein [ edit ] Minsky received a $100,000 research grant from Jeffrey Epstein in 2002, four years before Epstein's first arrest for sex offenses; it was the first from Epstein to MIT. Minsky received no further research grants from him.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] Minsky organized two academic symposia on Epstein's private island Little Saint James , one in 2002 and another in 2011, after Epstein was a registered sex offender.

[ 46 ] Virginia Giuffre testified in a 2015 deposition in her defamation lawsuit against Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell that Maxwell "directed" her to have sex with Minsky, among others. There has been no allegation that sex between them took place nor a lawsuit against Minsky's estate.

[ 47 ] Minsky's widow, Gloria Rudisch, says that he could not have had sex with any of the women at Epstein's residences, as they were always together during all the visits to Epstein's residences.

[ 48 ] Death [ edit ] Minsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage in January 2016, at age 88.

[ 49 ] Minsky was a member of Alcor Life Extension Foundation 's Scientific Advisory Board .

[ 50 ] Alcor will neither confirm nor deny whether Minsky was cryonically preserved.
