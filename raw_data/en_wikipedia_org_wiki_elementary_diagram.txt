In the mathematical field of model theory , the elementary diagram of a structure is the set of all sentences with parameters from the structure that are true in the structure. It is also called the complete diagram .

Definition [ edit ] Let M be a structure in a first-order language L . An extended language L ( M ) is obtained by adding to L a constant symbol c a for every element a of M . The structure M can be viewed as an L ( M ) structure in which the symbols in L are interpreted as before, and each new constant c a is interpreted as the element a . The elementary diagram of M is the set of all L ( M ) sentences that are true in M (Marker 2002:44).
