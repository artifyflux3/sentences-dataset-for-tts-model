Members of the America East Conference [ 2 ] for all sports (except the men's ice hockey team, which competes in Hockey East ). UMass Lowell sponsors teams in seven men's and seven women's NCAA sanctioned sports.

[ 3 ] Prior to transitioning to Division I in 2013, the River Hawks competed in the Northeast-10 Conference in Division II .

History of the nickname [ edit ] In 1948, Lowell Textile Institute began using "Terry Tex" as the mascot for the college.

[ 4 ] The bull terrier was chosen as it represented all things textile and the school's athletic programs adopted the 'Terriers' moniker. In 1971, the college, which had become Lowell Technological Institute some years earlier decided that a new nickname was needed. The athletic department changed the moniker from 'Terriers' to 'Chiefs' to represent strength, honor and leadership. They chose the name in part because they believed that it avoided the derogatory connotations that were associated with other nicknames like 'Indians' or 'Redskins'.

When Lowell Tech merged with Lowell State College to form the 'University of Lowell' in 1975, the new athletic teams continued with the 'Chiefs' nickname. Once Lowell joined the University of Massachusetts system in 1991, the school began to receive pressure to move away from the Chiefs name which, invariably, had become associated with derogatory native imagery. In 1993, the school formed a committee of students, faculty and staff to decide the fate of both the name and logo. By a vote of 14-1, the committee recommended retiring the 'Chiefs' name and Chancellor William Hogan accepted the decision in January 1994.

[ 4 ] Over 150 submissions were made for the new name. The most popular came from Chad Dooley in a letter to Bruce Crowder , the coach of the ice hockey team. Dooley suggested the hawk as a moniker for the programs. In an effort to tie the Merrimack River to the school the committee altered the name slightly to 'River Hawks'. The three finalists for the new name were 'River Hawks', 'Raging Rapids' and 'Lightning' with River Hawks being selected by popular vote. The first logo for the new nickname was produced in May 1994 and, while both the name and mascot have gone stylistic changes in the years since, the school has continued with the River Hawks name.

The University of Massachusetts Lowell participates in 16 sports at the Division I level. On July 1, 2013, 14 of UMass Lowell's Division II teams moved up to Division I, joining the America East Conference . The River Hawks formerly competed in the Northeast-10 Conference at the Division II level. Past champions include the 1988 men's basketball team, the 1991 men's cross country team, the ice hockey team (three times) and the field hockey team twice (2005, 2010).

In 2013, the men's hockey team won the Hockey East regular-season and tournament championships and advanced to the NCAA Division I Championship "Frozen Four," all for the first time in the university's history.

[ 6 ] The men's hockey team repeated as Hockey East champions in 2014 while advancing to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship for the third straight year and sixth time overall. Goalie Connor Hellebuyck is the only Hockey East player to receive the league tournament's Most Valuable Player Award in two consecutive years, earning the honor in 2013 and 2014.

[ 6 ] The nickname "River Hawks" came about during the school's transition from the University of Lowell to UMass Lowell and was inspired by the campus's location along the Merrimack River . The University of Lowell's nickname was the Chiefs, which was abandoned in favor of the current name. A campus-wide poll was conducted for student input and final candidates included the Ospreys and the Raging Rapids, according to the Connector student newspaper.
