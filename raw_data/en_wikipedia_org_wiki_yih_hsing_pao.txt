[ 2 ] Pao followed them to Taiwan via ship on 30 April 1949, and subsequently graduated in 1952 from National Taiwan University with a degree in civil engineering.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] He received a scholarship from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to pursue graduate study in mechanics, and his father borrowed money to pay for Pao's airfare of US$600.

[ 2 ] Pao completed his master's degree and continued on to doctoral study in applied mechanics, specializing in wave propagation in solids, at Columbia University .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Before formally obtaining his doctorate in 1959, [ 6 ] Pao joined the Cornell University faculty in 1958.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1985, he was appointed to the J. C. Ford Professorship, [ 4 ] a title he retained until retirement and emeritus status in 2000.

[ 2 ] [ 5 ] Between 1992 and 1995, he served as president of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, based in Taipei.

[ 5 ] In 2009, Pao was formally appointed a Distinguished Research Chair Professor within NTU's Institute of Applied Mechanics.

[ 4 ] From 2003, he had held a professorship at the College of Civil Engineering and Architecture within Zhejiang University in China.

[ 4 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] Pao's honors and awards included election as member of the United States National Academy of Engineering in 1985, [ 8 ] and an equivalent honor from Taiwan's Academia Sinica in 1986.

[ 4 ] He participated in the Humboldt Research Award Programme and is a recipient of the Humboldt Foundation 's Senior Scientist Award.

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] In 2001, Pao won Taiwan's Presidential Science Prize [ zh ] for Applied Sciences.

[ 3 ] A conference was held in Taipei to mark Pao's 80th birthday in 2010, and the presented papers, alongside some of Pao's own works, were compiled into a Festschrift titled From Waves in Complex Systems to Dynamics of Generalized Continua , published in 2011.

[ 1 ] [ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] Pao was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa in 1980.

[ 1 ] The condition caused him to become blind.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Pao was married to Amelia, with whom he raised three children, Winston, May, and Sophie.
