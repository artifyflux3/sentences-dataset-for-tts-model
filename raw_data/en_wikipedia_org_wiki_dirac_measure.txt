The Dirac measure δ x assigns a size of 1 to all sets in the upper-left half of the diagram and 0 to all sets in the lower-right half.

In mathematics , a Dirac measure assigns a size to a set based solely on whether it contains a fixed element x or not. It is one way of formalizing the idea of the Dirac delta function , an important tool in physics and other technical fields.

Definition [ edit ] A Dirac measure is a measure δ x on a set X (with any σ -algebra of subsets of X ) defined for a given x ∈ X and any (measurable) set A ⊆ X by δ δ x ( A ) = 1 A ( x ) = { 0 , x ∉ A ; 1 , x ∈ ∈ A .

{\displaystyle \delta _{x}(A)=1_{A}(x)={\begin{cases}0,&x\not \in A;\\1,&x\in A.\end{cases}}} where 1 A is the indicator function of A .

The Dirac measure is a probability measure , and in terms of probability it represents the almost sure outcome x in the sample space X . We can also say that the measure is a single atom at x . The Dirac measures are the extreme points of the convex set of probability measures on X .

The name is a back-formation from the Dirac delta function ; considered as a Schwartz distribution , for example on the real line , measures can be taken to be a special kind of distribution. The identity ∫ ∫ X f ( y ) d δ δ x ( y ) = f ( x ) , {\displaystyle \int _{X}f(y)\,\mathrm {d} \delta _{x}(y)=f(x),} which, in the form ∫ ∫ X f ( y ) δ δ x ( y ) d y = f ( x ) , {\displaystyle \int _{X}f(y)\delta _{x}(y)\,\mathrm {d} y=f(x),} is often taken to be part of the definition of the "delta function", holds as a theorem of Lebesgue integration .

Properties of the Dirac measure [ edit ] Let δ x denote the Dirac measure centred on some fixed point x in some measurable space ( X , Σ) .

δ x is a probability measure, and hence a finite measure .

Suppose that ( X , T ) is a topological space and that Σ is at least as fine as the Borel σ -algebra σ ( T ) on X .

δ x is a strictly positive measure if and only if the topology T is such that x lies within every non-empty open set, e.g. in the case of the trivial topology {∅, X } .

Since δ x is probability measure, it is also a locally finite measure .

If X is a Hausdorff topological space with its Borel σ -algebra, then δ x satisfies the condition to be an inner regular measure , since singleton sets such as { x } are always compact . Hence, δ x is also a Radon measure .

Assuming that the topology T is fine enough that { x } is closed, which is the case in most applications, the support of δ x is { x } . (Otherwise, supp( δ x ) is the closure of { x } in ( X , T ) .) Furthermore, δ x is the only probability measure whose support is { x } .

If X is n -dimensional Euclidean space R n with its usual σ -algebra and n -dimensional Lebesgue measure λ n , then δ x is a singular measure with respect to λ n : simply decompose R n as A = R n \ { x } and B = { x } and observe that δ x ( A ) = λ n ( B ) = 0 .

The Dirac measure is a sigma-finite measure .

Generalizations [ edit ] A discrete measure is similar to the Dirac measure, except that it is concentrated at countably many points instead of a single point. More formally, a measure on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure ) if its support is at most a countable set .
