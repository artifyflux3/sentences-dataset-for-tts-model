Clothing in ancient Greece refers to clothing starting from the Aegean bronze age (3000 BCE) to the Hellenistic period (31 BCE).

[ 1 ] Clothing in ancient Greece included a wide variety of styles but primarily consisted of the chiton , peplos , himation , and chlamys .

[ 2 ] Ancient Greek civilians typically wore two pieces of clothing draped about the body: an undergarment ( χιτών : chitōn or πέπλος : péplos) and a cloak ( ἱμάτιον : himátion or χλαμύς : chlamýs).

[ 3 ] The people of ancient Greece had many factors (political, economic, social, and cultural) that determined what they wore and when they wore it.

[ 2 ] Clothes were quite simple, draped, loose-fitting and free-flowing.

[ 4 ] Customarily, clothing was homemade and cut to various lengths of rectangular linen or wool fabric with minimal cutting or sewing, and secured with ornamental clasps or pins, and a belt, or girdle ( ζώνη : zōnē).

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] Pieces were generally interchangeable between men and women.

[ 5 ] However, women usually wore their robes to their ankles while men generally wore theirs to their knees depending on the occasion and circumstance.

[ 4 ] Additionally, clothing often served many purposes than just being used as clothes such as bedding or a shroud .

[ 6 ] In ancient Greece the terms ἀκεστής (male) and ἀκέστρια (female) were used for people who patched and restored clothing.

[ 7 ] The shoemakers had two kind of knives for cutting leather, the σμίλη or σμιλίον, which has a straight blade and the τομεὺς or περιτομεύς, which had a crescent shaped blade.

[ 8 ] Textiles [ edit ] Small fragments of textiles have been found from this period at archaeological sites across Greece.

[ 9 ] These found textiles, along with literary descriptions, artistic depictions, modern ethnography, and experimental archaeology, have led to a greater understanding of ancient Greek textiles .

[ 10 ] Clothes in ancient Greece were mainly homemade or locally made.

[ [ 11 ] All ancient Greek clothing was made out of natural fibers. Linen was the most common fabric worn by both sexes until it was rejected by the men for more 'moderate clothes', as those worn by the Spartans.

[ 12 ] Wool was worn because of its warmth and ability to be dyed, unlike linen.

[ 13 ] Silk was also used for the production of clothing, though for ceremonial purposes by the wealthy.

[ 14 ] In Aristotle's The History of Animals, Aristotle talks about the collection of caterpillar cocoons to be used to create silk.

[ 15 ] There is a lot of writing from ancient Greece discussing the use of silk because it was nearly transparent, revealing the body of the person wearing it, and, therefore, perfect for women to wear.

[ 16 ] Amorgina (τὰ ἀμόργινα), were fine, muslin-like fabrics made from amorgis (ἀμοργίς), a particular type of flax. This flax, named after the island of Amorgos , but was also grown in other regions. The fabrics produced from it were highly prized for their fine texture, being even finer than byssos (βύσσος; usually applied to linen, but sometimes to very fine cotton) and karpasos (κάρπασος; cotton (Strabo even applies it to silk)). These fabrics were almost transparent and very costly, as noted in various ancient texts. The use of the adjective ἀμοργινὸς (amorginos) in reference to these fabrics can sometimes cause confusion, as it is not always clear whether the term refers to the island of Amorgos or the flax itself.

[ 17 ] In ancient Greece, textile manufacture was largely the responsibility of women.  On this lekythos attributed to the Amasis painter , women are shown folding cloth, spinning wool into yarn, and weaving cloth on an upright loom.

Production process [ edit ] In the production of textiles, upright warp-weighted loom were used to weave clothing in Ancient Greece.

[ 18 ] [ page needed ] These looms had vertical threads or warps that were held down by loom weights.

[ 18 ] [ page needed ] The use of looms can be seen in Homer's Odyssey when Hermes comes across Calypso weaving on a loom.

[ 19 ] Another example of the loom in Homer's Odyssey can be seen when Odysseus comes across Circe for the first time.

[ 20 ] The use of looms can also be seen being depicted on ancient Greek pottery.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] Color and decoration [ edit ] Clothing in ancient Greece has been found to be quite colorful with a wide variety of hues.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] [ 21 ] Colors found to be used include black, red, yellow, blue, green, and purple.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] Yellow dyed clothing has been found to be associated with a woman's life cycle.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] The elite typically wore purple as a sign of wealth and money as it was the most expensive dye due to the difficulty in acquiring it.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] The ancient Greeks also embroidered designs into their clothes as a form of decoration.

[ 22 ] [ page needed ] The designs embroidered included representations of florals patterns and geometric patterns as well intricate scenes from Greek stories.

[ 22 ] [ page needed ] An example of this embroidery can be seen in Homer's Iliad where Helen is described as wearing a purple textile where she embroidered a scene of Trojans in battle.

[ 23 ] There was the proverbial phrase Θετταλικαὶ πτέρυγες , meaning Thessalian wings, because the Thessalian cloaks had a small flap in each side which resemble wings.

[ 24 ] Styles of clothing [ edit ] The epiblema (ἐπίβλημα), periblema (περίβλημα), amfelone (ἀμφελόνη) were general terms for the outer clothing [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] while the endyma (ἔνδυμα) was most often applied to the underclothing.

[ 29 ] The lope (λώπη) and lopos (λῶπος) were also general terms referring to the mantle.

[ 30 ] Hemipharion (Ἡμιφάριον) was the half of an outer-garment, but the spelling of this rare and late noun varies across lexicons, with some offering hemipharion, while others suggest hemiphorion (ἡμιφόριον) or hemiphoreion (ἡμιφόρειον), yet none can settle on a definitive form.

[ 31 ] Paryfi (παρυφή), was the border of a tunic or a scarf, primarily in women's clothing.

[ 32 ] Doriazein (Δωριάζειν), literally meaning "to dress like a Dorian girl," was a phrase used to describe the practice of being half-naked. This stemmed from the Dorian custom where girls would reveal their bodies at the side, as they typically wore chitons without girdles. In Sparta, however, it was not uncommon even for maidens to appear completely naked. This is how the Suda describes it.

[ 33 ] In addition to tunics that had sleeves sewn onto them and were known as chiridota, sleeves were also worn as separate garments, not attached to the tunic.

[ 34 ] The poderes or poderis (ποδήρης) is described as a long garment reaching down to the ankles.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Staple garments [ edit ] Chiton [ edit ] Greek travelling costume, incorporating a chiton , a chlamys , sandals, and a petasos hat hanging in the back The chiton (plural: chitones) was a garment of light linen consisting of sleeves and long hemline.

[ 37 ] [ page needed ] The chiton was commonly worn by both men and women but the time period in which each did so depended.

[ 1 ] Chitons typically fell to the ankles of the wearer, but shorter chitons were sometimes worn during vigorous activities by athletes, warriors, or slaves.

[ 22 ] [ page needed ] Often excess fabric would be pulled over a girdle, or belt, which was fastened around the waist (see kolpos ).

[ 3 ] To deal with the bulk sometimes a strap, or anamaschalister was worn around the neck, brought under the armpits, crossed in the back, and tied in the front.

[ 3 ] A himation , or cloak, could be worn over top of the chiton .

[ 2 ] Chlamys [ edit ] Statue of a youth wearing a chlamys. Pentelic marble, late 1st centruy BC - early 1st centura AD. Found in Athens, probably a funerary statue. NAMA 4476.

The chlamys was a seamless rectangle of woolen material worn by men for military or hunting purposes.

[ 3 ] It was worn as a cloak and fastened at the right shoulder with a brooch or button.

[ 4 ] The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC.

[ 38 ] It is thought that the chlamys could ward against light attacks in war.

[ 2 ] The chlamys went on to become popular in the Byzantine Empire by the high class and wealthy.

[ 1 ] Statues at the "House of Cleopatra" in Delos , Greece. Man and woman wearing the himation Himation [ edit ] See also: Pallium (Roman cloak) The himation was a simple wool outer garment worn over the peplos or chiton by both men and women .

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] It consisted of heavy rectangular material, passing under the left arm and secured at the right shoulder.

[ 22 ] The himation could also be worn over both shoulders.

[ 4 ] Women can be seen wearing the himation over their head in depictions of marriages and funerals in art.

[ 4 ] Men and boys can also be seen depicted in art as wearing solely the himation with no other clothing.

[ 1 ] A more voluminous himation was worn in cold weather.

[ 3 ] The himation is referenced as being worn by Socrates in Plato's Republic .

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] The top third of the cloth was folded over to create an over-fold. A girdle or belt was used to fasten the folds at the waist and could be worn over or under the over-fold.

[ 40 ] The overfold was called apoptygma (ἀπόπτυγμα).

[ 41 ] Variations of the peplos were worn by women in many periods such as the archaic, early classical, and classical periods of ancient Greece.

The name amphimaschalos was misunderstood by later grammarians (e.g.

Suda ), who mistakenly believed it referred to a two-sleeved chiton. This misunderstanding led them to create the term heteromaschalos (ἑτερομάσχαλος) for a one-sleeved chiton, while the actual distinction for the ancient Greeks should have been between the amphimaschalos and exomis (one-sleeve garment, see the exomis section below).

[ 46 ] Aphabroma [ edit ] Aphabroma (ἀφἀβρωμα), was a garment worn by Megarian women.

Commonly worn by slaves, soldiers, and workers, it served a practical purpose in various contexts. It was used as a protective layer in the trenches by soldiers, as a simple coverlet for beds, or as a curtain in place of a door. The cento was also employed in more utilitarian ways, such as being placed under the saddles of mules or used as a cap under a soldier’s helmet to prevent chafing. Additionally, during times of war, centones were hung on fortifications to shield them from fire and absorb the impact of weapons. Workers called centonarii were employed to craft these patchwork items.

[ 4 ] The Greeks wore jewelry such as rings, wreaths, diadems, bracelets, armbands, pins, pendants, necklaces, and earrings.

[ 128 ] Small gold ornaments would be sewn onto their clothing and would glitter as they moved.

[ 3 ] Common designs on jewelry in ancient Greece included plants, animals and figures from Greek mythology.

[ 4 ] Gold and silver were the most common mediums for jewelry.

[ 129 ] However, jewelry from this time could also have pearls, gems, and semiprecious stones used as decoration.

[ 4 ] Jewelry was commonly passed down in families from generation to generation.

[ 128 ] Greeks used many different words to describe the earrings including the Elikteres (ἑλικτῆρες), Enotia (ἑνώτια, sometimes called Enodia (ἑνώδια) in some inscriptions), Plastra (πλάστρα), Ellobia (ἑλλόβια) [ 130 ] and ermata (ἕρματα).

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] Sphingter (σφιγκτήρ) was a coil bracelet, made of gold, worn by women on the left arm.

[ 133 ] Pselion (ψέλιον) was a kind of bracelet or armlet worn by Persians, but also adopted by Greeks.

[ 134 ] Arm ornaments were distinguished by their placement on the arm. The περιβραχιόνιον (plural περιβραχιόνια; from βραχίων, the upper arm from elbow to shoulder) and ὄκκαβος were worn on the upper arm, while the περικάρπιον (plural περικάρπια) was worn on the wrist, functioning as a bracelet. In later Greek, additional terms such as βραχιόλιον, βραχίολος and βραχιόνιον emerged to describe similar ornaments. The Suda defines χλιδόνες as decorative items worn around the arms, synonymous with βραχιόλια. These items came in various shapes and were sometimes named accordingly, for example ὄφεις ("snakes") and δράκοντες ("dragons") referred to coiled bracelets that wrapped multiple times around the arm, while ἐχῖνοι ("sea urchins") likely described spiked or rounded designs.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] Periscelis ( περισκελίς ), was an anklet worn by women. The plebeian women wore anklets of silver, whereas the patricians of gold.

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] These ornaments are also called περισφύρια, while sometimes they are referred to by more general names such as πέδαι (singular πέδη) or ἀμφιδέαι (singular ἀμφιδέα).

[ 138 ] The word πέδη was also used to describe a fetter or shackle for the ankles constructed as to deprive the prisoner almost wholly of the power of walking.

[ 139 ] [ 137 ] Pyxis (πυξίς) was a small container made from boxwood (πύξος), typically used as a jewelry box or for storing small valuable items.

[ 140 ] Dactylios (Δακτύλιος), was a term used for a ring of any kind, especially a finger-ring.

[ 141 ] Dactyliotheca (Δακτυλιοθήκη), derived from the words daktylios (ring) and theke (casket/case), was a case or box where rings were kept, the same term was used to describe a collection of rings.

[ 142 ] Gloves [ edit ] Cheirides (χειρίδες) were fingerless gloves , primarily for protection against briars and thorns. These gloves were distinct from full gloves, which had fingers and called χειρίδες δακτυλωταί or δακτυλῆθραι. Additionally, the term χειρὶς πλέα ἀργυρίου likely referred to a leather glove used as a purse.

[ 143 ] Stick, baculum and staff [ edit ] In ancient Greece, the stick (known variously as βάκλον, βακτηρία, ῥάβδος, σκῆπτρον or σκυτάλη) was a common and versatile object, serving both practical and symbolic purposes. It appeared in several distinct forms across regions and social contexts. Athenian dandies during the time of Aristophanes favored a straight cane with an ornamented head, popularly called the Persian stick (Περσικὴ βακτηρία). In contrast, elderly men and rural folk typically carried a crooked staff (καμπύλη). 
In more austere Greek areas such as Sparta and Sicyon, people often wielded heavier, club-like sticks (called σκυτάλη or βακτηρία ἀκροπαχὴς). These were later adopted in Athens by admirers of Spartan culture (Λακωνισταί) and also became emblematic of Cynic philosophers. Additionally, there was also a crutch-style stick used for physical support.
Beyond their practical function, sticks carried symbolic weight. In Athens, dicasts (jurors) received a staff upon appointment as a mark of their civic role. Similarly, Spartan kings carried staffs as emblems of authority.

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Purse [ edit ] The ballantion (βαλλάντιον) or balantion (βαλάντιον) was a leather purse, known in Latin as a crumena (plural crumenae), typically worn slung around the neck and hanging behind the back, making it vulnerable to thieves known as ballantiotomoi (βαλλαντιοτόμοι, “cut-purses”). To guard against theft, masters often walked behind the slaves who carried their purses. These purses came in various shapes, including flat, flap-closed bags similar to a postman’s satchel and round drawstring pouches known as συσπαστὰ βαλλάντια.

[ 148 ] The term χειρὶς πλέα ἀργυρίου likely referred to a leather glove used as a purse.
