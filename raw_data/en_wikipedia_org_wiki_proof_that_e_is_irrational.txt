More than half a century later, Euler , who had been a student of Jacob's younger brother Johann , proved that e is irrational ; that is, that it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers.

Euler's proof [ edit ] Euler wrote the first proof of the fact that e is irrational in 1737 (but the text was only published seven years later).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He computed the representation of e as a simple continued fraction , which is e = [ 2 ; 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 1 , 6 , 1 , 1 , 8 , 1 , 1 , … … , 2 n , 1 , 1 , … … ] .

{\displaystyle e=[2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,1,1,\ldots ,2n,1,1,\ldots ].} Since this continued fraction is infinite and every rational number has a terminating continued fraction, e is irrational. A short proof of the previous equality is known.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since the simple continued fraction of e is not periodic , this also proves that e is not a root of a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients; in particular, e 2 is irrational.

Fourier's proof [ edit ] The most well-known proof is Joseph Fourier 's proof by contradiction , [ 6 ] which is based upon the equality e = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ 1 n !

.

{\displaystyle e=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n!}}.} Initially e is assumed to be a rational number of the form ⁠ a / b ⁠ . The idea is to then analyze the scaled-up difference (here denoted x ) between the series representation of e and its strictly smaller b -th partial sum, which approximates the limiting value e . By choosing the scale factor to be the factorial of b , the fraction ⁠ a / b ⁠ and the b -th partial sum are turned into integers , hence x must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that x is still strictly smaller than 1. From this contradiction we deduce that e is irrational.

Now for the details. If e is a rational number , there exist positive integers a and b such that e = ⁠ a / b ⁠ . Define the number x = b !

( e − − ∑ ∑ n = 0 b 1 n !

) .

{\displaystyle x=b!\left(e-\sum _{n=0}^{b}{\frac {1}{n!}}\right).} Use the assumption that e = ⁠ a / b ⁠ to obtain x = b !

( a b − − ∑ ∑ n = 0 b 1 n !

) = a ( b − − 1 ) !

− − ∑ ∑ n = 0 b b !

n !

.

{\displaystyle x=b!\left({\frac {a}{b}}-\sum _{n=0}^{b}{\frac {1}{n!}}\right)=a(b-1)!-\sum _{n=0}^{b}{\frac {b!}{n!}}.} The first term is an integer, and every fraction in the sum is actually an integer because n ≤ b for each term. Therefore, under the assumption that e is rational, x is an integer.

We now prove that 0 < x < 1 . First, to prove that x is strictly positive, we insert the above series representation of e into the definition of x and obtain x = b !

( ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ 1 n !

− − ∑ ∑ n = 0 b 1 n !

) = ∑ ∑ n = b + 1 ∞ ∞ b !

n !

> 0 , {\displaystyle x=b!\left(\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n!}}-\sum _{n=0}^{b}{\frac {1}{n!}}\right)=\sum _{n=b+1}^{\infty }{\frac {b!}{n!}}>0,} because all the terms are strictly positive.

We now prove that x < 1 . For all terms with n ≥ b + 1 we have the upper estimate b !

n !

= 1 ( b + 1 ) ( b + 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( b + ( n − − b ) ) ≤ ≤ 1 ( b + 1 ) n − − b .

{\displaystyle {\frac {b!}{n!}}={\frac {1}{(b+1)(b+2)\cdots {\big (}b+(n-b){\big )}}}\leq {\frac {1}{(b+1)^{n-b}}}.} This inequality is strict for every n ≥ b + 2 . Changing the index of summation to k = n – b and using the formula for the infinite geometric series , we obtain x = ∑ ∑ n = b + 1 ∞ ∞ b !

n !

< ∑ ∑ n = b + 1 ∞ ∞ 1 ( b + 1 ) n − − b = ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 ( b + 1 ) k = 1 b + 1 ( 1 1 − − 1 b + 1 ) = 1 b ≤ ≤ 1.

{\displaystyle x=\sum _{n=b+1}^{\infty }{\frac {b!}{n!}}<\sum _{n=b+1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(b+1)^{n-b}}}=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(b+1)^{k}}}={\frac {1}{b+1}}\left({\frac {1}{1-{\frac {1}{b+1}}}}\right)={\frac {1}{b}}\leq 1.} And therefore x < 1.

{\displaystyle x<1.} Since there is no integer strictly between 0 and 1, we have reached a contradiction, and so e is irrational, Q.E.D.

Alternative proofs [ edit ] Another proof [ 7 ] can be obtained from the previous one by noting that ( b + 1 ) x = 1 + 1 b + 2 + 1 ( b + 2 ) ( b + 3 ) + ⋯ ⋯ < 1 + 1 b + 1 + 1 ( b + 1 ) ( b + 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ = 1 + x , {\displaystyle (b+1)x=1+{\frac {1}{b+2}}+{\frac {1}{(b+2)(b+3)}}+\cdots <1+{\frac {1}{b+1}}+{\frac {1}{(b+1)(b+2)}}+\cdots =1+x,} and this inequality is equivalent to the assertion that bx < 1 . This is impossible, of course, since b and x are positive integers.

Still another proof [ 8 ] [ 9 ] can be obtained from the fact that 1 e = e − − 1 = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) n n !

.

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{e}}=e^{-1}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n}}{n!}}.} Define s n {\displaystyle s_{n}} as follows: s n = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( − − 1 ) k k !

.

{\displaystyle s_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{k!}}.} Then e − − 1 − − s 2 n − − 1 = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ ( − − 1 ) k k !

− − ∑ ∑ k = 0 2 n − − 1 ( − − 1 ) k k !

< 1 ( 2 n ) !

, {\displaystyle e^{-1}-s_{2n-1}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{k!}}-\sum _{k=0}^{2n-1}{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{k!}}<{\frac {1}{(2n)!}},} which implies 0 < ( 2 n − − 1 ) !

( e − − 1 − − s 2 n − − 1 ) < 1 2 n ≤ ≤ 1 2 {\displaystyle 0<(2n-1)!\left(e^{-1}-s_{2n-1}\right)<{\frac {1}{2n}}\leq {\frac {1}{2}}} for any positive integer n {\displaystyle n} .

Note that ( 2 n − − 1 ) !

s 2 n − − 1 {\displaystyle (2n-1)!s_{2n-1}} is always an integer. Assume that e − − 1 {\displaystyle e^{-1}} is rational, so e − − 1 = p / q , {\displaystyle e^{-1}=p/q,} where p , q {\displaystyle p,q} are co-prime, and q ≠ ≠ 0.

{\displaystyle q\neq 0.} It is possible to appropriately choose n {\displaystyle n} so that ( 2 n − − 1 ) !

e − − 1 {\displaystyle (2n-1)!e^{-1}} is an integer, i.e.

n ≥ ≥ ( q + 1 ) / 2.

{\displaystyle n\geq (q+1)/2.} Hence, for this choice, the difference between ( 2 n − − 1 ) !

e − − 1 {\displaystyle (2n-1)!e^{-1}} and ( 2 n − − 1 ) !

s 2 n − − 1 {\displaystyle (2n-1)!s_{2n-1}} would be an integer. But from the above inequality, that is not possible. So, e − − 1 {\displaystyle e^{-1}} is irrational. This means that e {\displaystyle e} is irrational.

Generalizations [ edit ] In 1840, Liouville published a proof of the fact that e 2 is irrational [ 10 ] followed by a proof that e 2 is not a root of a second-degree polynomial with rational coefficients.

[ 11 ] This last fact implies that e 4 is irrational. His proofs are similar to Fourier's proof of the irrationality of e . In 1891, Hurwitz explained how it is possible to prove along the same line of ideas that e is not a root of a third-degree polynomial with rational coefficients, which implies that e 3 is irrational.

[ 12 ] More generally, e q is irrational for any non-zero rational q .

[ 13 ] Charles Hermite further proved that e is a transcendental number , in 1873, which means that is not a root of any polynomial with rational coefficients, as is e α for any non-zero algebraic α .
