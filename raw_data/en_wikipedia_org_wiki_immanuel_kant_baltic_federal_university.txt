Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University Балти́йский федера́льный университе́т и́мени Иммануи́ла Ка́нта Former name Kaliningrad State Pedagogical Institute (1948 - 1967) Kaliningrad State University (1967 - 2005) Immanuel Kant Russian State University (2005 - 2010) Type Public Established 1947 President Andrey Klemeshev Rector Aleksandr Fedorov Total staff 1,400 Students 12,000 Location Kaliningrad , Russia Website www .kantiana .ru Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University ( IKBFU ; Russian : Балтийский федеральный университет имени Иммануила Канта ) is a public university located in the exclave of Kaliningrad , Russia .

Following World War II , the city of Königsberg was transferred to Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Agreement , and the city was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. The University of Konigsberg , commonly known as Albertina, was closed and the remaining German population were expelled, by the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. Today, the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University claims to maintain the traditions of the Albertina.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] It was known as the University of Koenigsberg (Albertina), which was founded in 1544. Also, this higher educational institution is also known for the fact that one of its graduates is one of the most outstanding European philosophers — Immanuel Kant .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] It was East Prussia 's sole university and was specially regarded for its mathematics and astronomy. The campus was severely damaged by British aerial bombing in August 1944 during World War II . The Albertina was closed after Königsberg was captured by the Red Army in 1945.

[ 5 ] In 1947, the university, already under new leadership, resumed work, but now as the Kaliningrad State Pedagogical Institute (KSPI).

[ 6 ] Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University remembers its continuity from the Königsberg University ("Albertina") and considers it its predecessor.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Monument to Immanuel Kant next to the building of building No. 3 of the I. Kant BFU (Universitetskaya Street, house 2, Kaliningrad, Russia). Harald Haake (opened June 27, 1992) is an exact replica of the original sculpture by Christian Daniel Rauch (1867), which disappeared during World War II.

After the war, Königsberg was renamed Kaliningrad and the Russophone Kaliningrad State Pedagogical Institute used the old campus from 1948 to 1967, including the main Albertina building inaugurated in 1862. In 1967, the institute received the status of a university and became known as Kaliningrad State University . In 2005, during the celebrations of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Königsberg, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany announced that the university would be renamed Immanuel Kant Russian State University in honour of Immanuel Kant .

[ 5 ] As of 2005, the university consisted of twelve faculties with courses ranging from Natural Sciences to the Humanities . It had approximately 12,800 students enrolled, both undergraduate and post-graduate , and 580 faculty staff. IKSUR's Kant Society was created to study Kantianism , or Kantian philosophy. The university is also interested in the historical connections between Königsberg and Russia as far back as the 16th century.

[ 5 ] In 2010–2011, the university underwent an enlargement and rebranding process which will lead to changing its name from Immanuel Kant Russian State University to Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.

[ 5 ] Education and training [ edit ] The Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University of today is an educational, scientific, cultural and enlightenment centre of the westernmost region of Russia.

The university implements more than 300 educational programmes in the fields of secondary, vocational and higher education as well as continuing and post-university education.
