She is a Fellow of the Meteoritical Society and of the Royal Astronomical Society .

Early life and education [ edit ] Russell was captivated by the Moon landing as a child.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] She studied at the University of Cambridge , where she was introduced to microanalysis by Jim Long.

[ 3 ] She had started studying natural sciences , but heard that geologists host the best parties, so switched courses.

[ 3 ] She was inspired to complete a PhD degree in geology after attending a lecture by Colin Pillinger , and moved to the Open University .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] She won the Royal Astronomical Society Keith Runcorn Prize for the best British doctoral thesis in geophysics in 1993.

Career [ edit ] Russell completed postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology and Smithsonian Institution .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] She joined the Natural History Museum in 1998, where she studied protostars and planets.

[ 8 ] In 2000 she edited the collection Protostars and Planets IV.

[ 9 ] Russell is leader of the micrometeorite and meteorite collection at the Natural History Museum, London .

[ 10 ] She has been on three expeditions to Antarctica searching for meteorites.

[ 1 ] [ 11 ] She has been awarded the Antarctica Service Medal .

[ 12 ] She was awarded a Leverhulme Trust grant in 2005.

[ 13 ] In 2006 she studied the meteorites in the early solar system and the protoplanetary disc .

[ 14 ] On behalf of the Natural History Museum, Russell was part of the team which arranged the acquisition of the Ivuna meteorite in 2008.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 2009 she published the book Meteorite with Caroline Smith and Gretchen Benedix.

[ 17 ] She won the Geological Society of London Bigsby Medal in 2010.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 2011 Russell took part in an exhibition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich .

[ 20 ] She is a science team member of OSIRIS-REx .

[ 11 ] She was the initial point of contact in the process by which the Tissint meteorite came to be acquired by the Natural History Museum in 2012.

[ 21 ] In 2014 she studied Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo Astronauts , finding that the lunar crust did not form from a common source.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Russell has studied the origin of water in the inner Solar System with Monica Grady .

[ 24 ] She published Chondrules in 2018, a book which considers the silicate grains that form in the protoplanetary disk .

[ 25 ] The eponymous asteroid 5497 Sararussell was named after her. Russell is an advocate for diversity in science.
