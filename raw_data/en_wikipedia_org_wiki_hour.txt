[Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight "Midnight") to 1 a.m. on a 24-hour clock with a digital face

An **hour** ([symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_symbol "Metric symbol"): **h**;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-1) also abbreviated **hr**) is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement") of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") historically reckoned as 1⁄24 of a [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") and defined contemporarily as exactly 3,600 [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") ([SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI")). There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day.

The hour was initially established in the [ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East "Ancient Near East") as a variable measure of 1⁄12 of the [night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night") or [daytime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime "Daytime"). Such **seasonal hours**, also known as **temporal hours** or [unequal hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_hours "Unequal hours"), varied by [season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude").

**Equal hours** or **equinoctial hours** were taken as 1⁄24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it 1⁄24 of the [mean solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_solar_day "Mean solar day"). Since this unit was not constant due to [long term variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T_(timekeeping) "ΔT (timekeeping)") in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the [atomic or physical second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#%22Atomic%22_second "Second").

It is a [non-SI unit that is accepted for use with SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI "Non-SI units mentioned in the SI").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-2) In the modern [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system"), one hour is defined as 3,600 atomic seconds. However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second "Leap second"),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-3) effectively making it appear to last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC "UTC") within 0.9 seconds of [UT1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UT1 "UT1"), the latter of which is based on measurements of the [mean solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_solar_day "Mean solar day").

_Hour_ is a development of the [Anglo-Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language "Anglo-Norman language")_\_houre\__ and [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English")_\_ure\__, first attested in the 13th century.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-hoed-4)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-6) It was a [borrowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowing_(linguistics) "Borrowing (linguistics)") of [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French")_ure_, a variant of _ore_, which derived from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_hōra_ and [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")_hṓrā_ ([ὥρα](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%A5%CF%81%CE%B1 "wikt:ὥρα")) originating in [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European "Proto-Indo-European")[root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics) "Root (linguistics)")_[yeh₁-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh%E2%82%81-#Proto-Indo-European "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh₁-")_ ("year, [summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer "Summer")"), making _hour_ distantly [cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate "Cognate") with _[year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year")_; the Greek word _hṓrā_ was originally a vaguer word for any span of time, including [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") and [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year"). The Anglo-Norman word _hour_ displaced [older](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") native words like **tide** (_[tīd](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tid#Old\_English "wikt:tid")_)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''tide,_''n''-7) and **stound** (_[stund](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stund#Old\_English "wikt:stund")_}, 'span of time').[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''stound,_''n.%C2%B9''-8)

The **time of day** is typically expressed in English in terms of hours. Whole hours on a [12-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock") are expressed using the contracted phrase _o'clock_, from the older _of the clock_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''clock,_''n.%C2%B9'',_&_o'clock,_''adv.''_(and_''n.'')-9) (10 am and 10 pm are both read as "ten o'clock".)

Hours on a [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock "24-hour clock") ("military time") are expressed as "hundred" or "hundred hours".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''hundred,_''n.''_and_''adj.''-10) (1000 is read "ten hundred" or "ten hundred hours"; 10 pm would be "twenty-two hundred".)

Fifteen and thirty minutes past the hour is expressed as "a quarter past" or "after"[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''quarter,_''n''-11) and "half past", respectively, from their fraction of the hour. Fifteen minutes before the hour may be expressed as "a quarter to", "of", "till", or "before" the hour.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTE''OED''quarter,_''n''-11) (9:45 may be read "nine forty-five" or "a quarter till ten".)

In ancient Egypt the [flooding of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile "Flooding of the Nile") was, and still is, an important annual event, crucial for agriculture. It was accompanied by the rise of [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius "Sirius") before the sunrise, and the appearance of 12 constellations across the night sky, to which the Egyptians assigned some significance. Influenced by this, the Egyptians divided the night into 12 equal intervals.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-12) These were [seasonal hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_hours "Unequal hours"), shorter in the summer than in the winter. Subsequently, the day was divided into intervals as well, which eventually became more important than the nightly intervals. These subdivisions of a day spread to Greece, and later to Rome.

Further information: [Horae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horae "Horae")

The ancient Greeks kept time differently than is done today. Instead of dividing the time between one midnight and the next into 24 equal hours, they divided the time from sunrise to sunset into 12 "seasonal hours" (their actual duration depending on season), and the time from sunset to the next sunrise again in 12 "seasonal hours".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-13) Initially, only the day was divided into 12 seasonal hours and the night into three or four night watches.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-14)

By the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period") the night was also divided into 12 hours.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-15) The day-and-night (νυχθήμερον) was probably first divided into 24 hours by [Hipparchus of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus_of_Nicaea "Hipparchus of Nicaea").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-16) The Greek astronomer [Andronicus of Cyrrhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronicus_of_Cyrrhus "Andronicus of Cyrrhus") oversaw the construction of a [horologion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horologion "Horologion") called the [Tower of the Winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_the_Winds "Tower of the Winds") in Athens during the first century BCE. This structure tracked a 24-hour day using both sundials and mechanical hour indicators.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-nist-17)

The [canonical hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_hours "Canonical hours") were inherited into [early Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christianity "Early Christianity") from [Second Temple Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_Judaism "Second Temple Judaism"). By AD 60, the _[Didache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didache "Didache")_ recommends disciples to pray the [Lord's Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer "Lord's Prayer") three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. By the second and third centuries, such [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers "Church Fathers") as [Clement of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_of_Alexandria "Clement of Alexandria"), [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen "Origen"), and [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian "Tertullian") wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours. In the early church, during the night before every feast, a [vigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil "Vigil") was kept. The word "Vigils", at first applied to the Night Office, comes from a Latin source, namely the _Vigiliae_ or nocturnal watches or guards of the soldiers. The night from six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning was divided into four watches or vigils of three hours each, the first, the second, the third, and the fourth vigil.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-18)

The _[Horae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horae "Horae")_ were originally personifications of seasonal aspects of nature, not of the time of day. The list of 12 _Horae_ representing the 12 hours of the day is recorded only in [Late Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity "Late Antiquity"), by [Nonnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonnus "Nonnus").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-19) The first and twelfth of the _Horae_ were added to the original set of ten:

1.   _Auge_ (first light)
2.   _Anatole_ (sunrise)
3.   _Mousike_ (morning hour of music and study)
4.   _Gymnastike_ (morning hour of exercise)
5.   _Nymphe_ (morning hour of ablutions)
6.   _Mesembria_ (noon)
7.   _Sponde_ (libations poured after lunch)
8.   _Elete_ (prayer)
9.   _Akte_ (eating and pleasure)
10.   _Hesperis_ (start of evening)
11.   _Dysis_ (sunset)
12.   _Arktos_ (night sky)

Medieval astronomers such as [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-21) and [Sacrobosco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrobosco "Sacrobosco"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-22) divided the hour into 60 [minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute "Minute"), each of 60 [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"); this derives from [Babylonian astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy"), where the corresponding terms[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] denoted the time required for the Sun's apparent motion through the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") to describe one minute or second of arc, respectively. In present terms, the Babylonian degree of time was thus four minutes long, the "minute" of time was thus four seconds long and the "second" 1/15 of a second.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-23)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-24)

In medieval Europe, the Roman hours continued to be marked on [sundials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial") but the more important units of time were the [canonical hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_hours "Canonical hours") of the [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church "Greek Orthodox Church") and [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). During daylight, these followed the pattern set by the three-hour bells of the [Roman markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_(market) "Forum (market)"), which were succeeded by the [bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_bell "Church bell") of local churches. They rang [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(liturgy) "Prime (liturgy)") at about 6 am, [terce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terce "Terce") at about 9 am, [sext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sext "Sext") at noon, [nones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nones_(liturgy) "Nones (liturgy)") at about 3 pm, and [vespers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespers "Vespers") at either 6 pm or [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset"). [Matins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matins "Matins") and [lauds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauds "Lauds") precede these irregularly in the morning hours; [compline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compline "Compline") follows them irregularly before sleep; and the [midnight office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_office "Midnight office") follows that. [Vatican II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_II "Vatican II") ordered their reformation for the Catholic Church in 1963,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-25) though they continue to be observed in the Orthodox churches.

When mechanical [clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock "Clock") began to be used to show hours of daylight or nighttime, their period needed to be changed every morning and evening (for example, by changing the length of their [pendula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendula "Pendula")). The use of 24 hours for the entire day meant hours varied much less and the clocks needed to be adjusted only a few times a month.

The minor irregularities of the apparent solar day were smoothed by measuring time using the [mean solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_solar_day "Mean solar day"), using the Sun's movement along the [celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator "Celestial equator") rather than along the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"). The irregularities of this time system were so minor that most clocks reckoning such hours did not need adjustment. However, scientific measurements eventually became precise enough to note the effect of [tidal deceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_deceleration "Tidal deceleration") of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") by the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), which gradually lengthens the Earth's days.

During the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), a [general decimalisation of measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_units "French Revolutionary units") was enacted, including [decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time "Decimal time") between 1794 and 1800. Under its provisions, the French hour ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _[heure](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heure "wikt:heure")_) was 1⁄10 of the day and divided formally into 100 decimal minutes (_\_minute décimale\__) and informally into 10 tenths (_\_[décime](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%A9cime "wikt:décime")\__). Mandatory use for all public records began in 1794, but was suspended six months later by the same 1795 legislation that first established the metric system. In spite of this, a few localities continued to use decimal time for six years for civil status records, until 1800, after Napoleon's Coup of 18 Brumaire.

The [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system") bases its measurements of time upon the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), defined since 1952 in terms of the Earth's rotation in AD 1900. Its hours are a secondary unit computed as precisely 3,600 seconds.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-sportsillustrated-26) However, an hour of [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time") (UTC), used as the basis of most civil time, has lasted 3,601 seconds 27 times since 1972 in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of [universal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UT1 "UT1"), which is based on measurements of the [mean solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_solar_day "Mean solar day") at [0° longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0%C2%B0_longitude "0° longitude"). The addition of these seconds accommodates the very gradual slowing of the [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").

In modern life, the ubiquity of clocks and other timekeeping devices means that segmentation of days according to their hours is commonplace. Most forms of [employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment "Employment"), whether [wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labor "Wage labor") or [salaried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaried "Salaried") labour, involve compensation based upon measured or expected hours worked. The fight for an [eight-hour day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day "Eight-hour day") was a part of [labour movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement "Labour movement") around the world. Informal [rush hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour "Rush hour") and [happy hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_hour "Happy hour") cover the times of day when commuting slows down due to congestion or alcoholic drinks being available at discounted prices. The [hour record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_record "Hour record") for the greatest distance travelled by a cyclist within the span of an hour is one of [cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport "Cycle sport")'s greatest honours.

The height of the gnomon is 5⁄12 the outer radius of the dial. This animation depicts the motion of the shadow from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. on mid-summer's day, when the Sun is at its highest declination (roughly 23.5°). Sunrise and sunset occur at 3 a.m. and 9 p.m. respectively on that day at geographical latitudes near 57.5°, roughly the latitude of Aberdeen or Sitka, Alaska.

Many different ways of counting the hours have been used. Because sunrise, sunset, and, to a lesser extent, noon, are the conspicuous points in the day, starting to count at these times was, for most people in most early societies, much easier than starting at midnight. However, with accurate clocks and modern astronomical equipment (and the telegraph or similar means to transfer a time signal in a split-second), this issue is much less relevant.

[Astrolabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe"), [sundials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial"), and [astronomical clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_clock "Astronomical clock") sometimes show the hour length and count using some of these older definitions and counting methods.

In ancient and medieval cultures, the counting of hours generally started with sunrise. Before the widespread use of artificial light, societies were more concerned with the division between night and day, and daily routines often began when light was sufficient.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTELandes198376-27)

"Babylonian hours" divide the day and night into 24 equal hours, reckoned from the time of sunrise.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-28) They are so named from the false belief of ancient authors that the Babylonians divided the day into 24 parts, beginning at sunrise. In fact, they divided the day into 12 parts (called _kaspu_ or "double hours") or into 60 equal parts.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolford-Strevens2005-29)

Sunrise marked the beginning of the first hour, the middle of the day was at the end of the sixth hour and sunset at the end of the twelfth hour. This meant that the duration of hours varied with the season. In the Northern hemisphere, particularly in the more northerly latitudes, summer daytime hours were longer than winter daytime hours, each being one twelfth of the time between sunrise and sunset. These variable-length hours were variously known as temporal, unequal, or seasonal hours and were in use until the appearance of the mechanical clock, which furthered the adoption of equal length hours.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTELandes198376-27)

This is also the system used in [Jewish law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_law "Jewish law") and frequently called "[Talmudic hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_hour "Relative hour")" (_Sha'a Zemanit_) in a variety of texts. The Talmudic hour is one twelfth of time elapsed from sunrise to sunset, day hours therefore being longer than night hours in the summer; in winter they reverse.

The Indic day began at sunrise. The term _hora_ was used to indicate an hour. The time was measured based on the length of the shadow at day time. A _hora_ translated to 2.5 _pe_. There are 60 _pe_ per day, 60 minutes per _pe_ and 60 _kshana_ (snap of a finger or instant) per minute. _Pe_ was measured with a bowl with a hole placed in still water. Time taken for this graduated bowl was one _pe_. Kings usually had an officer in charge of this clock.

### Counting from sunset

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hour&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Counting from sunset")]

Sundial with Italian hours in [Asti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asti "Asti")

In so-called "[Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") time", "Italian hours", or "old Czech time", the first hour started with the sunset [Angelus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus "Angelus") bell (or at the end of dusk, i.e., half an hour after sunset, depending on local custom and geographical latitude). The hours were numbered from 1 to 24. For example, in Lugano, the sun rose in December during the 14th hour and noon was during the 19th hour; in June the sun rose during the 7th hour and noon was in the 15th hour. Sunset was always at the end of the 24th hour. The clocks in church towers struck only from 1 to 12, thus only during night or early morning hours.

This manner of counting hours had the advantage that everyone could easily know how much time they had to finish their day's work [without artificial light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight "Daylight"). It was already widely used in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") by the 14th century and lasted until the mid-18th century; it was officially abolished in 1755, or in some regions customary until the mid-19th century.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-30)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-31)

The system of Italian hours can be seen on a number of clocks in Europe, where the dial is numbered from 1 to 24 in either Roman or Arabic numerals. The [St Mark's Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Clock "St Mark's Clock") in Venice, and the [Orloj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orloj "Orloj") in Prague are famous examples. It was also used in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), [Silesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia "Silesia"), and [Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia "Bohemia") until the 17th century.

Its replacement by the more practical division into [twice twelve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock") ([equinoctial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinoctial_hours "Equinoctial hours")) hours (also called small clock or civic hours) began as early as the 16th century.

The [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic "Islamic") day begins at sunset. The first prayer of the day ([maghrib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrib "Maghrib")) is to be performed between just after sunset and the end of twilight. Until 1968 Saudi Arabia used the system of counting 24 equal hours with the first hour starting at sunset.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-32)

For many centuries, up to 1925, astronomers counted the hours and days from noon, because it was the easiest solar event to measure accurately. An advantage of this method (used in the [Julian Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Date "Julian Date") system, in which a new Julian Day begins at noon) is that the date doesn't change during a single night's observing.

### Counting from midnight

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hour&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Counting from midnight")]

In the modern [12-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock"), counting the hours starts at midnight and restarts at noon. Hours are numbered 12, 1, 2, ..., 11. [Solar noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time "Solar time") is always close to 12 noon (ignoring artificial adjustments due to [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone") and [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time "Daylight saving time")), differing according to the [equation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time "Equation of time") by as much as fifteen minutes either way. At the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox") sunrise is around 6 a.m. ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _ante meridiem_, before noon), and sunset around 6 p.m. ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _post meridiem_, after noon).

In the modern [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock "24-hour clock"), counting the hours starts at midnight, and hours are numbered from 0 to 23. Solar noon is always close to 12:00, again differing according to the equation of time. At the equinoxes sunrise is around 06:00, and sunset around 18:00.

The [ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") began dividing the night into _\_wnwt\__ at some time before the compilation of the [Dynasty V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_V "Dynasty V")[Pyramid Texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts "Pyramid Texts")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-comeandlisten-33) in the 24th century BC.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-toastory-34) By 2150 BC ([Dynasty IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_IX "Dynasty IX")), diagrams of stars inside Egyptian [coffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin "Coffin") lids—variously known as "diagonal calendars" or "star clocks"—attest that there were exactly 12 of these.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-toastory-34)[Clagett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Clagett "Marshall Clagett") writes that it is "certain" this duodecimal division of the night followed the adoption of the [Egyptian civil calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_civil_calendar "Egyptian civil calendar"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-comeandlisten-33) usually placed c. 2800 BC on the basis of analyses of the [Sothic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sothic_cycle "Sothic cycle"), but a [lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_lunar_calendar "Egyptian lunar calendar") presumably long predated this[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEParker195030%E2%80%932-35) and also would have had 12 [months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") in each of its years. The coffin diagrams show that the Egyptians took note of the [heliacal risings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliacal_rising "Heliacal rising") of 36 stars or [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy) "Asterism (astronomy)") (now known as "[decans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decans "Decans")"), one for each of the ten-day "weeks" of their civil calendar.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-amannamedjed-36) (12 sets of alternate "triangle decans" were used for the 5 [epagomenal days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_intercalary_month "Egyptian intercalary month") between years.)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-poormountaineer-37) Each night, the rising of eleven of these decans were noted, separating the night into 12 divisions whose middle terms would have lasted about 40[minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute "Minute") each. (Another seven stars were noted by the Egyptians during the twilight and predawn periods,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] although they were not important for the hour divisions.) The original decans used by the Egyptians would have fallen noticeably out of their proper places over a span of several centuries. By the time of [Amenhotep III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III "Amenhotep III") (c. 1350 BC), the priests at [Karnak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak "Karnak") were using [water clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock") to determine the hours. These were filled to the brim at sunset and the hour determined by comparing the water level against one of its 12 gauges, one for each month of the year.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEParker195040-38) During the [New Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom "New Kingdom"), another system of decans was used, made up of 24 stars over the course of the year and 12 within any one night.

The later division of the day into 12 hours was accomplished by [sundials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial") marked with ten equal divisions. The morning and evening periods when the sundials failed to note time were observed as the first and last hours.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-39)

The Egyptian hours were closely connected both with the priesthood of the gods and with their divine services. By the [New Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom "New Kingdom"), each hour was conceived as a specific region of the sky or [underworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_underworld "Egyptian underworld") through which [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra "Ra")'s [solar barge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barge "Solar barge") travelled.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson200383-40) Protective deities were assigned to each and were used as the names of the hours.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson200383-40) As the protectors and resurrectors of the sun, the goddesses of the night hours were considered to hold power over all lifespans[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson200383-40) and thus became part of Egyptian funerary rituals. Two fire-spitting cobras were said to guard the gates of each hour of the underworld, and [Wadjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadjet "Wadjet") and the rearing [cobra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra "Cobra") ([uraeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraeus "Uraeus")) were also sometimes referenced as _\_wnwt\__ from their role protecting the dead through these gates. The Egyptian word for [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"), used as a synonym for priest, was _\_wnwty\__, "one of the _wnwt_", as it were "one of the hours".[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-49) The earliest forms of _\_wnwt\__ include one or three stars, with the later solar hours including the [determinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative#Egyptian "Determinative")[hieroglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph "Hieroglyph") for "sun".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-comeandlisten-33)

[Ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China "Ancient China") divided its day into 100 "marks"[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStephenson1997-50)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTESteele2000-51)([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): [刻](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%88%BB "wikt:刻"),[oc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese "Old Chinese")[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction")_kʰək_,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaxter_&_al.2014-52)[p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin")_kè_) running from midnight to midnight.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004887-53) The system is said to have been used since [remote antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_China "Prehistoric China"),[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004887-53) credited to the legendary [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor "Yellow Emperor"),[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPetersen1992129-54) but is first attested in [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Han "Western Han")-era [water clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock")[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPetersen1992125-55) and in the [2nd-century history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Han "Book of Han") of that [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_dynasties "List of Chinese dynasties").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004889-56) It was measured with sundials[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStephenson_&_al.200215%E2%80%9316-57) and [water clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock "Water clock").[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-58) Into the [Eastern Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Han "Eastern Han"), the Chinese measured their day schematically, adding the 20-_ke_ difference between the solstices evenly throughout the year, one every nine days.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPetersen1992125-55) During the night, time was more commonly reckoned during the night by the "watches" ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): [更](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9B%B4 "wikt:更"),[oc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese "Old Chinese")[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction")_kæŋ_,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaxter_&_al.2014-52)[p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin")_gēng_) of the guard, which were reckoned as a fifth of the time from [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset") to [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStephenson1997-50)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004888-59)

[Imperial China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_China "Imperial China") continued to use _ke_ and _geng_ but also began to divide the day into 12 "double hours" ([t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_characters "Traditional characters")[時](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%99%82 "wikt:時"),[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_characters "Simplified characters")[时](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%B6 "wikt:时"),[oc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese "Old Chinese")[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction")_də_,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaxter_&_al.2014-52)[p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin")_shí_,lit. "time[s]") named after the [earthly branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_branches "Earthly branches") and sometimes also known by the name of the corresponding animal of the [Chinese zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac "Chinese zodiac").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004904-60) The first _shi_ originally ran from 11 pm to 1 am but was reckoned as starting at midnight by the time of the [History of Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Song_(Yuan_dynasty) "History of Song (Yuan dynasty)"), compiled during the early [Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty "Yuan Dynasty").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004896-61) These apparently began to be used during the [Eastern Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Han "Eastern Han") that preceded the [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms "Three Kingdoms") era, but the sections that would have covered them are missing from their official histories; they first appear in official use in the [Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty")-era [Book of Sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Sui "Book of Sui").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004889-56) Variations of all these units were subsequently adopted by [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Japan "Ancient Japan")[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004888-59) and the other countries of the [Sinosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosphere "Sinosphere").

The 12 _shi_ supposedly began to be divided into 24 hours under the [Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"),[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004888-59) although they are first attested in the [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming "Ming")-era [Book of Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Yuan "Book of Yuan").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004887-53) In that work, the hours were known by the same [earthly branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_branches "Earthly branches") as the _shi_, with the first half noted as its "starting" and the second as "completed" or "proper" _shi_.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTES%C5%8Dma_&_al.2004887-53) In modern China, these are instead simply numbered and described as "little _shi_". The modern _ke_ is now used to count quarter-hours, rather than a separate unit.

As with the Egyptian night and daytime hours, the division of the day into 12 _shi_ has been credited to the example set by the rough number of lunar cycles in a solar year,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-62) although the 12-year [Jovian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") orbital cycle was more important to [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac "Chinese zodiac")[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-63) and Babylonian reckoning of the zodiac.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTERogers19989%E2%80%9328-64)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-66)

In [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand"), [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos "Laos"), and [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia "Cambodia"), the traditional system of noting hours is the [six-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_six-hour_clock "Thai six-hour clock"). This reckons each of a day's 24 hours apart from [noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon "Noon") as part of a fourth of the day. The first hour of the first half of daytime was 7 am; 1 pm the first hour of the latter half of daytime; 7 pm the first hour of the first half of nighttime; and 1 am the first hour of the latter half of nighttime. This system existed in the [Ayutthaya Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom "Ayutthaya Kingdom"), deriving its current phrasing from the practice of publicly announcing the daytime hours with a [gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong "Gong") and the nighttime hours with a [drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum "Drum").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThongprasert1985229%E2%80%93237-67) It was abolished in Laos and Cambodia during their [French occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina "French Indochina") and is uncommon there now. The Thai system remains in informal use in the form codified in 1901 by [King Chulalongkorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Chulalongkorn "King Chulalongkorn").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-68)

This was variously divided into 30 _muhūrta-s_ of 48 minutes each[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-69) or 60 _dandas_[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] or _nadī-s_ of 24 minutes each.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-dersh-70) The [solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_day "Solar day") was later similarly divided into 60 _ghaṭikás_ of about the same duration, each divided in turn into 60 _vinadis_.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour#cite_note-dersh-70) The [Sinhalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people "Sinhalese people") followed a similar system but called their sixtieth of a day a _peya_.
