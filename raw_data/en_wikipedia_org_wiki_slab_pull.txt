In 1975 Forsyth and Uyeda used the inverse theory method to show that, of the many forces likely to be driving plate motion, slab pull was the strongest.

[ 1 ] Plate motion is partly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at oceanic trenches .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] This force and slab suction account for almost all of the force driving plate tectonics . The ridge push at rifts contributes only 5 to 10%.

[ 4 ] Carlson et al. (1983) [ 5 ] in Lallemand et al. (2005) [ 6 ] defined the slab pull force as: F s p = K × × Δ Δ ρ ρ × × L × × A {\displaystyle F_{sp}=K\times \Delta \rho \times L\times {\sqrt {A}}} Where: K is 4.2 g (gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s 2 ) according to McNutt (1984); [ 7 ] Δρ = 80 kg/m 3 is the mean density difference between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere; L is the slab length calculated only for the part above 670 km (the upper/lower mantle boundary); A is the slab age in Ma at the trench.

The slab pull force manifests itself between two extreme forms: The aseismic back-arc extension as in the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc .

And as the Aleutian and Chile tectonics with strong earthquakes and back-arc thrusting .

Between these two examples there is the evolution of the Farallon Plate : from the huge slab width with the Nevada , the Sevier and Laramide orogenies ; the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up and later left as Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates, the Basin and Range Province under extension, with slab break off , smaller slab width, more edges and mantle return flow.

Some early models of plate tectonics envisioned the plates riding on top of convection cells like conveyor belts . However, most scientists working today believe that the asthenosphere does not directly cause motion by the friction of such basal forces.

[ citation needed ] The North American Plate is nowhere being subducted , yet it is in motion, and likewise for the African , Eurasian and Antarctic Plates . Ridge push is thought responsible for the motion of these plates.

The subducting slabs around the Pacific Ring of Fire cool down the Earth and its core-mantle boundary . Around the African Plate upwelling mantle plumes from the core-mantle boundary produce rifting including the African and Ethiopian rift valleys.
