[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 2007 he was named Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor of Philosophy in the Berkeley Philosophy Department, a position he held until he retired as professor emeritus .

[ 8 ] Though officially retiring at the end of the 2015-2016 academic year , he continued his research, teaching and advising as a professor of the Graduate School.

[ 7 ] During his tenure he had served as departmental chair from 1978 to 1981, 1984 to 1985, and in 1998.

[ 9 ] [ 2 ] Stroud was a visiting professor of philosophy at the University of Oslo (1974), at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1979), and at the University of California, Los Angeles (1983-1984, and 1997).

[ 9 ] It would be followed, in 1984, by The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism [ 28 ] and, in 1999, by The Quest for Reality: Subjectivism and the Metaphysics of Colour.

[ 37 ] [ 6 ] Death [ edit ] Having been diagnosed with advanced stage brain cancer just two months prior, Barry Stroud died on 9 August 2019.

[ 38 ] Announcing his death, Berkeley Philosophy Department recorded that: His body of work, his influence on generations of students, his imprint on the character of our department, the example that he set of the purest philosophical inquiry — all of it is beyond reckoning. As hard as it is to imagine what philosophy at Berkeley will be like without him, it is even harder to imagine what it would have been .

[ 38 ] A memorial by former student, and fellow philosopher, John Schwenkler was published by 3 Quarks Daily on 19 August 2019.

[ 39 ] Obituaries in the UC Berkeley News and The Daily Californian followed shortly after.
