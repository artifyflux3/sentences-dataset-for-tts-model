Gelfand and Billy James Pettis , extends the definition of the Lebesgue integral to vector-valued functions on a measure space , by exploiting duality . The integral was introduced by Gelfand for the case when the measure space is an interval with Lebesgue measure . The integral is also called the weak integral in contrast to the Bochner integral , which is the strong integral.

Definition [ edit ] Let f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} where ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a measure space and V {\displaystyle V} is a topological vector space (TVS) with a continuous dual space V ′ {\displaystyle V'} that separates points (that is, if x ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} is nonzero then there is some l ∈ ∈ V ′ {\displaystyle l\in V'} such that l ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle l(x)\neq 0} ), for example, V {\displaystyle V} is a normed space or (more generally) is a Hausdorff locally convex TVS.  
Evaluation of a functional may be written as a duality pairing : ⟨ ⟨ φ φ , x ⟩ ⟩ = φ φ [ x ] .

{\displaystyle \langle \varphi ,x\rangle =\varphi [x].} The map f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} is called weakly measurable if for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ , {\displaystyle \varphi \in V',} the scalar-valued map φ φ ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle \varphi \circ f} is a measurable map . 
A weakly measurable map f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} is said to be weakly integrable on X {\displaystyle X} if there exists some e ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle e\in V} such that for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ , {\displaystyle \varphi \in V',} the scalar-valued map φ φ ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle \varphi \circ f} is Lebesgue integrable (that is, φ φ ∘ ∘ f ∈ ∈ L 1 ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle \varphi \circ f\in L^{1}\left(X,\Sigma ,\mu \right)} ) and φ φ ( e ) = ∫ ∫ X φ φ ( f ( x ) ) d μ μ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi (e)=\int _{X}\varphi (f(x))\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x).} The map f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} is said to be Pettis integrable if φ φ ∘ ∘ f ∈ ∈ L 1 ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle \varphi \circ f\in L^{1}\left(X,\Sigma ,\mu \right)} for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ ′ {\displaystyle \varphi \in V^{\prime }} and also for every A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma } there exists a vector e A ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle e_{A}\in V} such that ⟨ ⟨ φ φ , e A ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ A ⟨ ⟨ φ φ , f ( x ) ⟩ ⟩ d μ μ ( x ) for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ .

{\displaystyle \langle \varphi ,e_{A}\rangle =\int _{A}\langle \varphi ,f(x)\rangle \,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\quad {\text{ for all }}\varphi \in V'.} In this case, e A {\displaystyle e_{A}} is called the Pettis integral of f {\displaystyle f} on A .

{\displaystyle A.} Common notations for the Pettis integral e A {\displaystyle e_{A}} include ∫ ∫ A f d μ μ , ∫ ∫ A f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) , and, in case that A = X is understood, μ μ [ f ] .

{\displaystyle \int _{A}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu ,\qquad \int _{A}f(x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x),\quad {\text{and, in case that}}~A=X~{\text{is understood,}}\quad \mu [f].} To understand the motivation behind the definition of "weakly integrable", consider the special case where V {\displaystyle V} is the underlying scalar field; that is, where V = R {\displaystyle V=\mathbb {R} } or V = C .

{\displaystyle V=\mathbb {C} .} In this case, every linear functional φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } on V {\displaystyle V} is of the form φ φ ( y ) = s y {\displaystyle \varphi (y)=sy} for some scalar s ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle s\in V} (that is, φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is just scalar multiplication by a constant), the condition φ φ ( e ) = ∫ ∫ A φ φ ( f ( x ) ) d μ μ ( x ) for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ , {\displaystyle \varphi (e)=\int _{A}\varphi (f(x))\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\quad {\text{for all}}~\varphi \in V',} simplifies to s e = ∫ ∫ A s f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) for all scalars s .

{\displaystyle se=\int _{A}sf(x)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\quad {\text{for all scalars}}~s.} In particular, in this special case, f {\displaystyle f} is weakly integrable on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if f {\displaystyle f} is Lebesgue integrable.

Relation to Dunford integral [ edit ] The map f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} is said to be Dunford integrable if φ φ ∘ ∘ f ∈ ∈ L 1 ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle \varphi \circ f\in L^{1}\left(X,\Sigma ,\mu \right)} for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ ′ {\displaystyle \varphi \in V^{\prime }} and also for every A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma } there exists a vector d A ∈ ∈ V ″ , {\displaystyle d_{A}\in V'',} called the Dunford integral of f {\displaystyle f} on A , {\displaystyle A,} such that ⟨ ⟨ d A , φ φ ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ A ⟨ ⟨ φ φ , f ( x ) ⟩ ⟩ d μ μ ( x ) for all φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ {\displaystyle \langle d_{A},\varphi \rangle =\int _{A}\langle \varphi ,f(x)\rangle \,\mathrm {d} \mu (x)\quad {\text{ for all }}\varphi \in V'} where ⟨ ⟨ d A , φ φ ⟩ ⟩ = d A ( φ φ ) .

{\displaystyle \langle d_{A},\varphi \rangle =d_{A}(\varphi ).} Identify every vector x ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} with the map scalar-valued functional on V ′ {\displaystyle V'} defined by φ φ ∈ ∈ V ′ ↦ ↦ φ φ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi \in V'\mapsto \varphi (x).} This assignment induces a map called the canonical evaluation map and through it, V {\displaystyle V} is identified as a vector subspace of the double dual V ″ .

{\displaystyle V''.} The space V {\displaystyle V} is a semi-reflexive space if and only if this map is surjective . 
The f : X → → V {\displaystyle f:X\to V} is Pettis integrable if and only if d A ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle d_{A}\in V} for every A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ .

{\displaystyle A\in \Sigma .} Properties [ edit ] An immediate consequence of the definition is that Pettis integrals are compatible with continuous linear operators: If Φ Φ : : V 1 → → V 2 {\displaystyle \Phi \colon V_{1}\to V_{2}} is linear and continuous and f : : X → → V 1 {\displaystyle f\colon X\to V_{1}} is Pettis integrable, then Φ Φ ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle \Phi \circ f} is Pettis integrable as well and ∫ ∫ X Φ Φ ( f ( x ) ) d μ μ ( x ) = Φ Φ ( ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{X}\Phi (f(x))\,d\mu (x)=\Phi \left(\int _{X}f(x)\,d\mu (x)\right).} The standard estimate | ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) | ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ X | f ( x ) | d μ μ ( x ) {\displaystyle \left|\int _{X}f(x)\,d\mu (x)\right|\leq \int _{X}|f(x)|\,d\mu (x)} for real- and complex-valued functions generalises to Pettis integrals in the following sense: For all continuous seminorms p : : V → → R {\displaystyle p\colon V\to \mathbb {R} } and all Pettis integrable f : : X → → V {\displaystyle f\colon X\to V} , p ( ∫ ∫ X f ( x ) d μ μ ( x ) ) ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ X _ _ p ( f ( x ) ) d μ μ ( x ) {\displaystyle p\left(\int _{X}f(x)\,d\mu (x)\right)\leq {\underline {\int _{X}}}p(f(x))\,d\mu (x)} holds. The right-hand side is the lower Lebesgue integral of a [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle [0,\infty ]} -valued function, that is, ∫ ∫ X _ _ g d μ μ := sup { ∫ ∫ X h d μ μ | h : : X → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] is measurable and 0 ≤ ≤ h ≤ ≤ g } .

{\displaystyle {\underline {\int _{X}}}g\,d\mu :=\sup \left\{\left.\int _{X}h\,d\mu \;\right|\;h\colon X\to [0,\infty ]{\text{ is measurable and }}0\leq h\leq g\right\}.} Taking a lower Lebesgue integral is necessary because the integrand p ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle p\circ f} may not be measurable. This follows from the Hahn-Banach theorem because for every vector v ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle v\in V} there must be a continuous functional φ φ ∈ ∈ V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \varphi \in V^{*}} such that φ φ ( v ) = p ( v ) {\displaystyle \varphi (v)=p(v)} and for all w ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle w\in V} , | φ φ ( w ) | ≤ ≤ p ( w ) {\displaystyle |\varphi (w)|\leq p(w)} . Applying this to v := ∫ ∫ X f d μ μ {\displaystyle v:=\int _{X}f\,d\mu } gives the result.

Mean value theorem [ edit ] An important property is that the Pettis integral with respect to a finite measure is contained in the closure of the convex hull of the values scaled by the measure of the integration domain: μ μ ( A ) < ∞ ∞ implies ∫ ∫ A f d μ μ ∈ ∈ μ μ ( A ) ⋅ ⋅ co ⁡ ⁡ ( f ( A ) ) ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle \mu (A)<\infty {\text{ implies }}\int _{A}f\,d\mu \in \mu (A)\cdot {\overline {\operatorname {co} (f(A))}}} This is a consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem and generalizes the mean value theorem for integrals of real-valued functions : If V = R {\displaystyle V=\mathbb {R} } , then closed convex sets are simply intervals and for f : : X → → [ a , b ] {\displaystyle f\colon X\to [a,b]} , the following inequalities hold: μ μ ( A ) a ≤ ≤ ∫ ∫ A f d μ μ ≤ ≤ μ μ ( A ) b .

{\displaystyle \mu (A)a~\leq ~\int _{A}f\,d\mu ~\leq ~\mu (A)b.} Existence [ edit ] If V = R n {\displaystyle V=\mathbb {R} ^{n}} is finite-dimensional then f {\displaystyle f} is Pettis integrable if and only if each of f {\displaystyle f} ’s coordinates is Lebesgue integrable.

If f {\displaystyle f} is Pettis integrable and A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma } is a measurable subset of X {\displaystyle X} , then by definition f | A : : A → → V {\displaystyle f_{|A}\colon A\to V} and f ⋅ ⋅ 1 A : : X → → V {\displaystyle f\cdot 1_{A}\colon X\to V} are also Pettis integrable and ∫ ∫ A f | A d μ μ = ∫ ∫ X f ⋅ ⋅ 1 A d μ μ .

{\displaystyle \int _{A}f_{|A}\,d\mu =\int _{X}f\cdot 1_{A}\,d\mu .} If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological space, Σ Σ = B X {\displaystyle \Sigma ={\mathfrak {B}}_{X}} its Borel- σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra , μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } a Borel measure that assigns finite values to compact subsets, V {\displaystyle V} is quasi-complete (that is, every bounded Cauchy net converges) and if f {\displaystyle f} is continuous with compact support, then f {\displaystyle f} is Pettis integrable. 
More generally: If f {\displaystyle f} is weakly measurable and there exists a compact, convex C ⊆ ⊆ V {\displaystyle C\subseteq V} and a null set N ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle N\subseteq X} such that f ( X ∖ ∖ N ) ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle f(X\setminus N)\subseteq C} , then f {\displaystyle f} is Pettis-integrable.

Law of large numbers for Pettis-integrable random variables [ edit ] Let ( Ω Ω , F , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},\operatorname {P} )} be a probability space, and let V {\displaystyle V} be a topological vector space with a dual space that separates points. Let v n : Ω Ω → → V {\displaystyle v_{n}:\Omega \to V} be a sequence of Pettis-integrable random variables, and write E ⁡ ⁡ [ v n ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [v_{n}]} for the Pettis integral of v n {\displaystyle v_{n}} (over X {\displaystyle X} ). Note that E ⁡ ⁡ [ v n ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [v_{n}]} is a (non-random) vector in V , {\displaystyle V,} and is not a scalar value.

Let v ¯ ¯ N := 1 N ∑ ∑ n = 1 N v n {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}_{N}:={\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n=1}^{N}v_{n}} denote the sample average. By linearity, v ¯ ¯ N {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}_{N}} is Pettis integrable, and E ⁡ ⁡ [ v ¯ ¯ N ] = 1 N ∑ ∑ n = 1 N E ⁡ ⁡ [ v n ] ∈ ∈ V .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [{\bar {v}}_{N}]={\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n=1}^{N}\operatorname {E} [v_{n}]\in V.} Suppose that the partial sums 1 N ∑ ∑ n = 1 N E ⁡ ⁡ [ v ¯ ¯ n ] {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n=1}^{N}\operatorname {E} [{\bar {v}}_{n}]} converge absolutely in the topology of V , {\displaystyle V,} in the sense that all rearrangements of the sum converge to a single vector λ λ ∈ ∈ V .

{\displaystyle \lambda \in V.} The weak law of large numbers implies that ⟨ ⟨ φ φ , E ⁡ ⁡ [ v ¯ ¯ N ] − − λ λ ⟩ ⟩ → → 0 {\displaystyle \langle \varphi ,\operatorname {E} [{\bar {v}}_{N}]-\lambda \rangle \to 0} for every functional φ φ ∈ ∈ V ∗ ∗ .

{\displaystyle \varphi \in V^{*}.} Consequently, E ⁡ ⁡ [ v ¯ ¯ N ] → → λ λ {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [{\bar {v}}_{N}]\to \lambda } in the weak topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Without further assumptions, it is possible that E ⁡ ⁡ [ v ¯ ¯ N ] {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [{\bar {v}}_{N}]} does not converge to λ λ .

{\displaystyle \lambda .} [ citation needed ] To get strong convergence, more assumptions are necessary.
