[ 1 ] [ page needed ] Staminodes are frequently inconspicuous and stamen-like, usually occurring at the inner whorl of the flower, but are also sometimes long enough to protrude from the corolla.

[ citation needed ] The arrow points to the hairy staminode of a Grinnell's penstemon ( Penstemon grinnellii ) flower Sometimes, the staminodes are modified to produce nectar , as in the witch-hazel ( Hamamelis ) .

[ 2 ] Staminodes can be a critical characteristic for differentiating between species, for  instance in the orchid genus Paphiopedilum , and among the penstemons .

In the case of cannas , the petals are inconsequential and the staminodes are refined into eye-catching petal-like replacements.

A spectacular example of staminode is given by Couroupita guianensis , a tropical tree growing in South America also known as the cannonball tree.
