In set theory , the union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.

[ 1 ] It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other. 
A nullary union refers to a union of zero ( ⁠ 0 {\displaystyle 0} ⁠ ) sets and it is by definition equal to the empty set .

For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the table of mathematical symbols .

Binary union [ edit ] The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A , in B , or in both A and B .

[ 2 ] In set-builder notation , A ∪ ∪ B = { x : x ∈ ∈ A or x ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle A\cup B=\{x:x\in A{\text{  or  }}x\in B\}} .

[ 3 ] For example, if A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is: A = { x is an even integer larger than 1} B = { x is an odd integer larger than 1} A ∪ ∪ B = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , … … } {\displaystyle A\cup B=\{2,3,4,5,6,\dots \}} As another example, the number 9 is not contained in the union of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.

Sets cannot have duplicate elements, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the cardinality of a set or its contents.

Finite unions [ edit ] One can take the union of several sets simultaneously.  For example, the union of three sets A , B , and C contains all elements of A , all elements of B , and all elements of C , and nothing else. Thus, x is an element of A ∪ B ∪ C if and only if x is in at least one of A , B , and C .

A finite union is the union of a finite number of sets; the phrase does not imply that the union set is a finite set .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Notation [ edit ] The notation for the general concept can vary considerably.  For a finite union of sets S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , … … , S n {\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},\dots ,S_{n}} one often writes S 1 ∪ ∪ S 2 ∪ ∪ S 3 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ ∪ ∪ S n {\displaystyle S_{1}\cup S_{2}\cup S_{3}\cup \dots \cup S_{n}} or ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n S i {\textstyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{n}S_{i}} .  Various common notations for arbitrary unions include ⋃ ⋃ M {\textstyle \bigcup \mathbf {M} } , ⋃ ⋃ A ∈ ∈ M A {\textstyle \bigcup _{A\in \mathbf {M} }A} , and ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I A i {\textstyle \bigcup _{i\in I}A_{i}} . The last of these notations refers to the union of the collection { A i : i ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle \left\{A_{i}:i\in I\right\}} , where I is an index set and A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} is a set for every ⁠ i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} ⁠ . In the case that the index set I is the set of natural numbers , one uses the notation ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ A i {\textstyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}} , which is analogous to that of the infinite sums in series.

[ 7 ] When the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols (instead of between them), it is usually rendered as a larger size.

Notation encoding [ edit ] In Unicode , union is represented by the character U+222A ∪ UNION .

[ 8 ] In TeX , ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } is rendered from \cup and ⋃ ⋃ {\textstyle \bigcup } is rendered from \bigcup .

Arbitrary union [ edit ] The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union . If M is a set or class whose elements are sets, then x is an element of the union of M if and only if there is at least one element A of M such that x is an element of A .

[ 7 ] In symbols: x ∈ ∈ ⋃ ⋃ M ⟺ ⟺ ∃ ∃ A ∈ ∈ M , x ∈ ∈ A .

{\displaystyle x\in \bigcup \mathbf {M} \iff \exists A\in \mathbf {M} ,\ x\in A.} This idea subsumes the preceding sections—for example, A ∪ B ∪ C is the union of the collection { A , B , C }. Also, if M is the empty collection, then the union of M is the empty set.

Formal derivation [ edit ] In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) and other set theories, the ability to take the arbitrary union of any sets is granted by the axiom of union , which states that, given any set of sets A {\displaystyle A} , there exists a set B {\displaystyle B} , whose elements are exactly those of the elements of A {\displaystyle A} . Sometimes this axiom is less specific, where there exists a B {\displaystyle B} which contains the elements of the elements of A {\displaystyle A} , but may be larger. For example if A = { { 1 } , { 2 } } , {\displaystyle A=\{\{1\},\{2\}\},} then it may be that B = { 1 , 2 , 3 } {\displaystyle B=\{1,2,3\}} since B {\displaystyle B} contains 1 and 2. This can be fixed by using the axiom of specification to get the subset of B {\displaystyle B} whose elements are exactly those of the elements of A {\displaystyle A} . Then one can use the axiom of extensionality to show that this set is unique. For readability, define the binary predicate Union ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Union} (X,Y)} meaning " X {\displaystyle X} is the union of Y {\displaystyle Y} " or " X = ⋃ ⋃ Y {\displaystyle X=\bigcup Y} " as: Union ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) ⟺ ⟺ ∀ ∀ x ( x ∈ ∈ X ⟺ ⟺ ∃ ∃ y ∈ ∈ Y ( x ∈ ∈ y ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Union} (X,Y)\iff \forall x(x\in X\iff \exists y\in Y(x\in y))} Then, one can prove the statement "for all Y {\displaystyle Y} , there is a unique X {\displaystyle X} , such that X {\displaystyle X} is the union of Y {\displaystyle Y} ": ∀ ∀ Y ∃ ∃ !

X ( Union ⁡ ⁡ ( X , Y ) ) {\displaystyle \forall Y\,\exists !X(\operatorname {Union} (X,Y))} Then, one can use an extension by definition to add the union operator ⋃ ⋃ A {\displaystyle \bigcup A} to the language of ZFC as: B = ⋃ ⋃ A ⟺ ⟺ Union ⁡ ⁡ ( B , A ) ⟺ ⟺ ∀ ∀ x ( x ∈ ∈ B ⟺ ⟺ ∃ ∃ y ∈ ∈ Y ( x ∈ ∈ y ) ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}B=\bigcup A&\iff \operatorname {Union} (B,A)\\&\iff \forall x(x\in B\iff \exists y\in Y(x\in y))\end{aligned}}} or equivalently: x ∈ ∈ ⋃ ⋃ A ⟺ ⟺ ∃ ∃ y ∈ ∈ A ( x ∈ ∈ y ) {\displaystyle x\in \bigcup A\iff \exists y\in A\,(x\in y)} After the union operator has been defined, the binary union A ∪ ∪ B {\displaystyle A\cup B} can be defined by showing there exists a unique set C = { A , B } {\displaystyle C=\{A,B\}} using the axiom of pairing , and defining A ∪ ∪ B = ⋃ ⋃ { A , B } {\displaystyle A\cup B=\bigcup \{A,B\}} . Then, finite unions can be defined inductively as: ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 0 A i = ∅ ∅ , and ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n A i = ( ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 n − − 1 A i ) ∪ ∪ A n {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{0}A_{i}=\varnothing {\text{, and }}\bigcup _{i=1}^{n}A_{i}=\left(\bigcup _{i=1}^{n-1}A_{i}\right)\cup A_{n}} Algebraic properties [ edit ] See also: List of set identities and relations and Algebra of sets Binary union is an associative operation; that is, for any sets ⁠ A , B , and C {\displaystyle A,B,{\text{ and }}C} ⁠ , A ∪ ∪ ( B ∪ ∪ C ) = ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ∪ ∪ C .

{\displaystyle A\cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C.} Thus, the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity: either of the above can be written as ⁠ A ∪ ∪ B ∪ ∪ C {\displaystyle A\cup B\cup C} ⁠ . Also, union is commutative , so the sets can be written in any order.

[ 9 ] The empty set is an identity element for the operation of union. That is, ⁠ A ∪ ∪ ∅ ∅ = A {\displaystyle A\cup \varnothing =A} ⁠ , for any set ⁠ A {\displaystyle A} ⁠ . Also, the union operation is idempotent: ⁠ A ∪ ∪ A = A {\displaystyle A\cup A=A} ⁠ .  All these properties follow from analogous facts about logical disjunction .

Intersection distributes over union A ∩ ∩ ( B ∪ ∪ C ) = ( A ∩ ∩ B ) ∪ ∪ ( A ∩ ∩ C ) {\displaystyle A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)} and union distributes over intersection [ 2 ] A ∪ ∪ ( B ∩ ∩ C ) = ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ∩ ∩ ( A ∪ ∪ C ) .

{\displaystyle A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C).} The power set of a set ⁠ U {\displaystyle U} ⁠ , together with the operations given by union, intersection , and complementation , is a Boolean algebra .  In this Boolean algebra, union can be expressed in terms of intersection and complementation by the formula A ∪ ∪ B = ( A ∁ ∁ ∩ ∩ B ∁ ∁ ) ∁ ∁ , {\displaystyle A\cup B=(A^{\complement }\cap B^{\complement })^{\complement },} where the superscript ∁ ∁ {\displaystyle {}^{\complement }} denotes the complement in the universal set ⁠ U {\displaystyle U} ⁠ . Alternatively, intersection can be expressed in terms of union and complementation in a similar way: A ∩ ∩ B = ( A ∁ ∁ ∪ ∪ B ∁ ∁ ) ∁ ∁ {\displaystyle A\cap B=(A^{\complement }\cup B^{\complement })^{\complement }} . These two expressions together are called De Morgan's laws .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] History and etymology [ edit ] Further information: History of set theory The english word union comes from the term in middle French meaning "coming together", which comes from the post-classical Latin unionem , "oneness".

[ 13 ] The original term for union in set theory was Vereinigung (in german), which was introduced in 1895 by Georg Cantor .

[ 14 ] The english use of union of two sets in mathematics began to be used by at least 1912, used by James Pierpont .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The symbol ∪ ∪ {\displaystyle \cup } used for union in mathematics was introduced by Giuseppe Peano in his Arithmetices principia in 1889, along with the notations for intersection ∩ ∩ {\displaystyle \cap } , set membership ∈ ∈ {\displaystyle \in } , and subsets ⊂ ⊂ {\displaystyle \subset } .
