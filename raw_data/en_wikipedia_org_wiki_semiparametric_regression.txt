They are often used in situations where the fully nonparametric model may not perform well or when the researcher wants to use a parametric model but the functional form with respect to a subset of the regressors or the density of the errors is not known. Semiparametric regression models are a particular type of semiparametric modelling and, since semiparametric models contain a parametric component, they rely on parametric assumptions and may be misspecified and inconsistent , just like a fully parametric model.

Methods [ edit ] Many different semiparametric regression methods have been proposed and developed. The most popular methods are the partially linear, index and varying coefficient models.

Partially linear models [ edit ] A partially linear model is given by Y i = X i ′ β β + g ( Z i ) + u i , i = 1 , … … , n , {\displaystyle Y_{i}=X'_{i}\beta +g\left(Z_{i}\right)+u_{i},\,\quad i=1,\ldots ,n,\,} where Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} is the dependent variable, X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} is a p × × 1 {\displaystyle p\times 1} vector of explanatory variables, β β {\displaystyle \beta } is a p × × 1 {\displaystyle p\times 1} vector of unknown parameters and Z i ∈ ∈ R q {\displaystyle Z_{i}\in \operatorname {R} ^{q}} . The parametric part of the partially linear model is given by the parameter vector β β {\displaystyle \beta } while the nonparametric part is the unknown function g ( Z i ) {\displaystyle g\left(Z_{i}\right)} . The data is assumed to be i.i.d. with E ( u i | X i , Z i ) = 0 {\displaystyle E\left(u_{i}|X_{i},Z_{i}\right)=0} and the model allows for a conditionally heteroskedastic error process E ( u i 2 | x , z ) = σ σ 2 ( x , z ) {\displaystyle E\left(u_{i}^{2}|x,z\right)=\sigma ^{2}\left(x,z\right)} of unknown form. This type of model was proposed by Robinson (1988) and extended to handle categorical covariates by Racine and Li (2007).

This method is implemented by obtaining a n {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}} consistent estimator of β β {\displaystyle \beta } and then deriving an estimator of g ( Z i ) {\displaystyle g\left(Z_{i}\right)} from the nonparametric regression of Y i − − X i ′ β β ^ ^ {\displaystyle Y_{i}-X'_{i}{\hat {\beta }}} on z {\displaystyle z} using an appropriate nonparametric regression method.

[ 1 ] Index models [ edit ] A single index model takes the form Y = g ( X ′ β β 0 ) + u , {\displaystyle Y=g\left(X'\beta _{0}\right)+u,\,} where Y {\displaystyle Y} , X {\displaystyle X} and β β 0 {\displaystyle \beta _{0}} are defined as earlier and the error term u {\displaystyle u} satisfies E ( u | X ) = 0 {\displaystyle E\left(u|X\right)=0} . The single index model takes its name from the parametric part of the model x ′ β β {\displaystyle x'\beta } which is a scalar single index. The nonparametric part is the unknown function g ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle g\left(\cdot \right)} .

Ichimura's method [ edit ] The single index model method developed by Ichimura (1993) is as follows. Consider the situation in which y {\displaystyle y} is continuous. Given a known form for the function g ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle g\left(\cdot \right)} , β β 0 {\displaystyle \beta _{0}} could be estimated using the nonlinear least squares method to minimize the function ∑ ∑ i = 1 ( Y i − − g ( X i ′ β β ) ) 2 .

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}\left(Y_{i}-g\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)\right)^{2}.} Since the functional form of g ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle g\left(\cdot \right)} is not known, we need to estimate it. For a given value for β β {\displaystyle \beta } an estimate of the function G ( X i ′ β β ) = E ( Y i | X i ′ β β ) = E [ g ( X i ′ β β o ) | X i ′ β β ] {\displaystyle G\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)=E\left(Y_{i}|X'_{i}\beta \right)=E\left[g\left(X'_{i}\beta _{o}\right)|X'_{i}\beta \right]} using kernel method. Ichimura (1993) proposes estimating g ( X i ′ β β ) {\displaystyle g\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)} with G ^ ^ − − i ( X i ′ β β ) , {\displaystyle {\hat {G}}_{-i}\left(X'_{i}\beta \right),\,} the leave-one-out nonparametric kernel estimator of G ( X i ′ β β ) {\displaystyle G\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)} .

Klein and Spady's estimator [ edit ] If the dependent variable y {\displaystyle y} is binary and X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} and u i {\displaystyle u_{i}} are assumed to be independent , Klein and Spady (1993) propose a technique for estimating β β {\displaystyle \beta } using maximum likelihood methods. The log-likelihood function is given by L ( β β ) = ∑ ∑ i ( 1 − − Y i ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − g ^ ^ − − i ( X i ′ β β ) ) + ∑ ∑ i Y i ln ⁡ ⁡ ( g ^ ^ − − i ( X i ′ β β ) ) , {\displaystyle L\left(\beta \right)=\sum _{i}\left(1-Y_{i}\right)\ln \left(1-{\hat {g}}_{-i}\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)\right)+\sum _{i}Y_{i}\ln \left({\hat {g}}_{-i}\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)\right),} where g ^ ^ − − i ( X i ′ β β ) {\displaystyle {\hat {g}}_{-i}\left(X'_{i}\beta \right)} is the leave-one-out estimator.

Smooth coefficient/varying coefficient models [ edit ] Hastie and Tibshirani (1993) propose a smooth coefficient model given by Y i = α α ( Z i ) + X i ′ β β ( Z i ) + u i = ( 1 + X i ′ ) ( α α ( Z i ) β β ( Z i ) ) + u i = W i ′ γ γ ( Z i ) + u i , {\displaystyle Y_{i}=\alpha \left(Z_{i}\right)+X'_{i}\beta \left(Z_{i}\right)+u_{i}=\left(1+X'_{i}\right)\left({\begin{array}{c}\alpha \left(Z_{i}\right)\\\beta \left(Z_{i}\right)\end{array}}\right)+u_{i}=W'_{i}\gamma \left(Z_{i}\right)+u_{i},} where X i {\displaystyle X_{i}} is a k × × 1 {\displaystyle k\times 1} vector and β β ( z ) {\displaystyle \beta \left(z\right)} is a vector of unspecified smooth functions of z {\displaystyle z} .

γ γ ( ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle \gamma \left(\cdot \right)} may be expressed as γ γ ( Z i ) = ( E [ W i W i ′ | Z i ] ) − − 1 E [ W i Y i | Z i ] .

{\displaystyle \gamma \left(Z_{i}\right)=\left(E\left[W_{i}W'_{i}|Z_{i}\right]\right)^{-1}E\left[W_{i}Y_{i}|Z_{i}\right].} See also [ edit ] Nonparametric regression Effective degree of freedom Notes [ edit ] ^ See Li and Racine (2007) for an in-depth look at nonparametric regression methods.
