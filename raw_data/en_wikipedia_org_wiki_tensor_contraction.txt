From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra"), a **tensor contraction** is an operation on a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") that arises from the [canonical pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_system "Dual system") of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and its [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_vector_space "Dual vector space"). In components, it is expressed as a sum of products of scalar components of the tensor(s) caused by applying the [summation convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_convention "Summation convention") to a pair of dummy indices that are bound to each other in an expression. The contraction of a single [mixed tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_tensor "Mixed tensor") occurs when a pair of literal indices (one a subscript, the other a superscript) of the tensor are set equal to each other and summed over. In [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation "Einstein notation") this summation is built into the notation. The result is another [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") with order reduced by 2.

Tensor contraction can be seen as a [generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization "Generalization") of the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra) "Trace (linear algebra)").

Abstract formulation
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_contraction&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Abstract formulation")]

Let _V_ be a vector space over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")_k_. The core of the contraction operation, and the simplest case, is the canonical pairing of _V_ with its [dual vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space")_V_∗. The pairing is the [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map") from the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product") of these two spaces to the field _k_:

![Image 1: {\displaystyle C:V\otimes V^{*}\rightarrow k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8dc5752b54179dd59d8624569348c16548f06179)
corresponding to the [bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form "Bilinear form")

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \langle v,f\rangle =f(v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9adf1139ffa8640df4d322eab12f7e58b43b0c22)
where _f_ is in _V_∗ and _v_ is in _V_. The map _C_ defines the contraction operation on a tensor of type (1, 1), which is an element of ![Image 3: {\displaystyle V\otimes V^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7357cc6d99957d5b1c38160284567b2410a9b45a). Note that the result is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") (an element of _k_). In [finite dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_a_vector_space "Dimension of a vector space"), using the [natural isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_isomorphism "Natural isomorphism") between ![Image 4: {\displaystyle V\otimes V^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7357cc6d99957d5b1c38160284567b2410a9b45a) and the space of linear maps from _V_ to _V_,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-natural_iso-1) one obtains a basis-free definition of the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra) "Trace (linear algebra)").

In general, a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") of type (_m_, _n_) (with _m_ ≥ 1 and _n_ ≥ 1) is an element of the vector space

![Image 5: {\displaystyle V\otimes \cdots \otimes V\otimes V^{*}\otimes \cdots \otimes V^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b51cd6d35926dedc4a0bf248185a6dfed38aaacd)
(where there are _m_ factors _V_ and _n_ factors _V_∗).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-fulton_harris-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-warner-3) Applying the canonical pairing to the _k_ th _V_ factor and the _l_ th _V_∗ factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the (_k_, _l_) contraction operation, which is a linear map that yields a tensor of type (_m_ − 1, _n_ − 1).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-fulton_harris-2) By analogy with the (1, 1) case, the general contraction operation is sometimes called the trace.

Contraction in index notation
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_contraction&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Contraction in index notation")]

In [tensor index notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_index_notation "Tensor index notation"), the basic contraction of a vector and a dual vector is denoted by

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\tilde {f}}({\vec {v}})=f_{\gamma }v^{\gamma },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76a830d910f70406013e2b65303da1f9beb1e273)
which is shorthand for the explicit coordinate summation[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-physics-4)

![Image 7: {\displaystyle f_{\gamma }v^{\gamma }=f_{1}v^{1}+f_{2}v^{2}+\cdots +f_{n}v^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79c5a7a19bcead51d6042d68806e2a9708bcaf17)
(where _v_ _i_ are the components of _v_ in a particular basis and _f_ _i_ are the components of _f_ in the corresponding dual basis).

Since a general mixed [dyadic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_tensor "Dyadic tensor") is a linear combination of decomposable tensors of the form ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f\otimes v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86aab15ee753e30f7f013364b608a1eee44508d3), the explicit formula for the dyadic case follows: let

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =T_{j}^{i}\mathbf {e} _{i}\otimes \mathbf {e} ^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c61c17300c12555d82c0e58af4a185def9f6a970)
be a mixed dyadic tensor. Then its contraction is

![Image 10: {\displaystyle T_{j}^{i}\mathbf {e} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {e} ^{j}=T_{j}^{i}\delta _{i}{}^{j}=T_{j}^{j}=T_{1}^{1}+\cdots +T_{n}^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1402dd9211ed8109d27929b9fe4159d53bfc7a9).
A general contraction is denoted by labeling one [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") index and one [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") index with the same letter, summation over that index being implied by the [summation convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_convention "Summation convention"). The resulting contracted tensor inherits the remaining indices of the original tensor. For example, contracting a tensor _T_ of type (2,2) on the second and third indices to create a new tensor _U_ of type (1,1) is written as

![Image 11: {\displaystyle T^{ab}{}_{bc}=\sum _{b}{T^{ab}{}_{bc}}=T^{a1}{}_{1c}+T^{a2}{}_{2c}+\cdots +T^{an}{}_{nc}=U^{a}{}_{c}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/448ab192e10053167e95bddadfcbacaeb11c61dc)
By contrast, let

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\mathbf {e} ^{i}\otimes \mathbf {e} ^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b945562b1a4492f487d60f42499825b1bcf10577)
be an unmixed dyadic tensor. This tensor does not contract; if its base vectors are dotted,[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] the result is the contravariant [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"),

![Image 13: {\displaystyle g^{ij}=\mathbf {e} ^{i}\cdot \mathbf {e} ^{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f8ea8c133c166230a75fc026d950652f059558b),
whose rank is 2.

As in the previous example, contraction on a pair of indices that are either both contravariant or both covariant is not possible in general. However, in the presence of an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") (also known as a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")) _g_, such contractions are possible. One uses the metric to raise or lower one of the indices, as needed, and then one uses the usual operation of contraction. The combined operation is known as _[metric contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metric\_contraction&action=edit&redlink=1 "Metric contraction (page does not exist)")_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-o'neill-5)

Application to tensor fields
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_contraction&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Application to tensor fields")]

Contraction is often applied to [tensor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fields "Tensor fields") over spaces (e.g. [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), or [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]). Since contraction is a purely algebraic operation, it can be applied pointwise to a tensor field, e.g. if _T_ is a (1,1) tensor field on Euclidean space, then in any coordinates, its contraction (a scalar field) _U_ at a point _x_ is given by

![Image 14: {\displaystyle U(x)=\sum _{i}T_{i}^{i}(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7263abdcd7e99591f7c7b1dcb23bf93292125758)
Since the role of _x_ is not complicated here, it is often suppressed, and the notation for tensor fields becomes identical to that for purely algebraic tensors.

Over a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), a metric (field of inner products) is available, and both metric and non-metric contractions are crucial to the theory. For example, the [Ricci tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_tensor "Ricci tensor") is a non-metric contraction of the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"), and the [scalar curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_curvature "Scalar curvature") is the unique metric contraction of the Ricci tensor.

One can also view contraction of a tensor field in the context of modules over an appropriate ring of functions on the manifold[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-o'neill-5) or the context of sheaves of modules over the structure sheaf;[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-hartshorne-6) see the discussion at the end of this article.

As an application of the contraction of a tensor field, let _V_ be a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") on a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") (for example, [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")). Let ![Image 15: {\displaystyle V^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3701b92a9ba3f4dc04f32534d06d24ae50051ca6) be the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") of _V_ (in some choice of coordinates). In the case of [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") in Euclidean space, one can write

![Image 16: {\displaystyle V^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }={\partial V^{\alpha } \over \partial x^{\beta }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93dd4a7ad4871dea95195cfae65c3b29fa358fd1)
Then changing index _β_ to _α_ causes the pair of indices to become bound to each other, so that the derivative contracts with itself to obtain the following sum:

![Image 17: {\displaystyle V^{\alpha }{}_{\alpha }=V^{0}{}_{0}+\cdots +V^{n}{}_{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7a0df9a48a6c2bd1f167c4851f58c0ebda6cacc2)
which is the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") div _V_. Then

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \operatorname {div} V=V^{\alpha }{}_{\alpha }=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac8ea344231ad900bc8409a9242687a193718a5d)
is a [continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation "Continuity equation") for _V_.

In general, one can define various divergence operations on higher-rank [tensor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fields "Tensor fields"), as follows. If _T_ is a tensor field with at least one contravariant index, taking the [covariant differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_differential "Covariant differential") and contracting the chosen contravariant index with the new covariant index corresponding to the differential results in a new tensor of rank one lower than that of _T_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-o'neill-5)

Contraction of a pair of tensors
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_contraction&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Contraction of a pair of tensors")]

One can generalize the core contraction operation (vector with dual vector) in a slightly different way, by considering a pair of tensors _T_ and _U_. The [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product")![Image 19: {\displaystyle T\otimes U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/931f383f685b85c88da56c4fadf2cca1b6ef50c6) is a new tensor, which, if it has at least one covariant and one contravariant index, can be contracted. The case where _T_ is a vector and _U_ is a dual vector is exactly the core operation introduced first in this article.

In tensor index notation, to contract two tensors with each other, one places them side by side (juxtaposed) as factors of the same term. This implements the tensor product, yielding a composite tensor. Contracting two indices in this composite tensor implements the desired contraction of the two tensors.

For example, matrices can be represented as tensors of type (1,1) with the first index being contravariant and the second index being covariant. Let ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4bf5adb1a2cb690ac9c60ebd082313dcb67d7ed) be the components of one matrix and let ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathrm {M} ^{\beta }{}_{\gamma }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/facf112fc21b1cd88bdb0de30226a6274324ad2c) be the components of a second matrix. Then their multiplication is given by the following contraction, an example of the contraction of a pair of tensors:

![Image 22: {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }\mathrm {M} ^{\beta }{}_{\gamma }=\mathrm {N} ^{\alpha }{}_{\gamma }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c5e97b13b98db27a0486d9887a9fd93a6fdfcac).
Also, the [interior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_product "Interior product") of a vector with a [differential form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") is a special case of the contraction of two tensors with each other.

More general algebraic contexts
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_contraction&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: More general algebraic contexts")]

Let _R_ be a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") and let _M_ be a finite free [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") over _R_. Then contraction operates on the full (mixed) tensor algebra of _M_ in exactly the same way as it does in the case of vector spaces over a field. (The key fact is that the canonical pairing is still perfect in this case.)

More generally, let _O_ X be a [sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)") of commutative rings over a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")_X_, e.g. _O_ X could be the [structure sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_sheaf "Structure sheaf") of a [complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), [analytic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_space "Analytic space"), or [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"). Let _M_ be a [locally free sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_free_sheaf "Locally free sheaf") of modules over _O_ X of finite rank. Then the dual of _M_ is still well-behaved[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction#cite_note-hartshorne-6) and contraction operations make sense in this context.
