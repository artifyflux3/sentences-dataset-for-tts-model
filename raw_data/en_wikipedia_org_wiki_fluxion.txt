[ 1 ] Fluxions were introduced by Isaac Newton to describe his form of a time derivative (a derivative with respect to time). Newton introduced the concept in 1665 and detailed them in his mathematical treatise, Method of Fluxions .

[ 2 ] Fluxions and fluents made up Newton's early calculus .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Fluxions were central to the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy , when Newton sent a letter to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz explaining them, but concealing his words in code due to his suspicion. He wrote: [ 4 ] I cannot proceed with the explanations of the fluxions now, I have preferred to conceal it thus: 6accdæ13eff7i3l9n4o4qrr4s8t12vx.

The gibberish string was in fact a hash code (by denoting the frequency of each letter) of the Latin phrase Data æqvatione qvotcvnqve flventes qvantitates involvente, flvxiones invenire: et vice versa , meaning: "Given an equation that consists of any number of flowing quantities, to find the fluxions: and vice versa".

[ 5 ] Example [ edit ] If the fluent ⁠ y {\displaystyle y} ⁠ is defined as y = t 2 {\displaystyle y=t^{2}} (where ⁠ t {\displaystyle t} ⁠ is time) the fluxion (derivative) at t = 2 {\displaystyle t=2} is: y ˙ ˙ = Δ Δ y Δ Δ t = ( 2 + o ) 2 − − 2 2 ( 2 + o ) − − 2 = 4 + 4 o + o 2 − − 4 2 + o − − 2 = 4 o + o 2 o {\displaystyle {\dot {y}}={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta t}}={\frac {(2+o)^{2}-2^{2}}{(2+o)-2}}={\frac {4+4o+o^{2}-4}{2+o-2}}={\frac {4o+o^{2}}{o}}} Here ⁠ o {\displaystyle o} ⁠ is an infinitely small amount of time.

[ 6 ] So, the term ⁠ o 2 {\displaystyle o^{2}} ⁠ is second order infinite small term and according to Newton, we can now ignore ⁠ o 2 {\displaystyle o^{2}} ⁠ because of its second order infinite smallness comparing to first order infinite smallness of ⁠ o {\displaystyle o} ⁠ .

[ 7 ] So, the final equation gets the form: y ˙ ˙ = Δ Δ y Δ Δ t = 4 o o = 4 {\displaystyle {\dot {y}}={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta t}}={\frac {4o}{o}}=4} He justified the use of ⁠ o {\displaystyle o} ⁠ as a non-zero quantity by stating that fluxions were a consequence of movement by an object.

Criticism [ edit ] Bishop George Berkeley , a prominent philosopher of the time, denounced Newton's fluxions in his essay The Analyst , published in 1734.

[ 8 ] Berkeley refused to believe that they were accurate because of the use of the infinitesimal ⁠ o {\displaystyle o} ⁠ . He did not believe it could be ignored and pointed out that if it was zero, the consequence would be division by zero . Berkeley referred to them as "ghosts of departed quantities", a statement which unnerved mathematicians of the time and led to the eventual disuse of infinitesimals in calculus.

Towards the end of his life Newton revised his interpretation of ⁠ o {\displaystyle o} ⁠ as infinitely small , preferring to define it as approaching zero , using a similar definition to the concept of limit .

[ 9 ] He believed this put fluxions back on safe ground. By this time, Leibniz's derivative (and his notation ) had largely replaced Newton's fluxions and fluents, and remains in use today.
