Throughout the history of the Earth life has evolved to survive changing conditions, such as changes in the climate and habitat . However, one constant factor in evolution since life first began on Earth is the force of gravity. As a consequence, all biological processes are accustomed to the ever-present force of gravity and even small variations in this force can have significant impact on the health and function and the system of organisms.

( December 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The force of gravity on the surface of the Earth, normally denoted g , has remained constant in both direction and magnitude since the formation of the planet.

[ citation needed ] As a result, both plant and animal life have evolved to rely upon and cope with it in various ways. For example, humans employ internal models in motor planning that account for the effects of gravity on gross and fine motor skills.

[ 2 ] Plant use of gravity [ edit ] Main article: Gravitropism Plant tropisms are directional movements of a plant with respect to a directional stimulus. One such tropism is gravitropism , or the growth or movement of a plant with respect to gravity. Plant roots grow towards the pull of gravity and away from sunlight, and shoots and stems grow against the pull of gravity and towards sunlight.

Animal struggles with gravity [ edit ] Gravity has had an effect on the development of animal life since the first single-celled organism .
The size of single biological cells is inversely proportional to the strength of the gravitational field exerted on the cell. That is, in stronger gravitational fields the size of cells decreases, and in weaker gravitational fields the size of cells increases. Gravity is thus a limiting factor in the growth of individual cells.

Cells which were naturally larger than the size that gravity alone would allow for had to develop means to protect against internal sedimentation. Several of these methods are based upon protoplasmic motion, thin and elongated shape of the cell body, increased cytoplasmic viscosity , and a reduced range of specific gravity of cell components relative to the ground-plasma.

[ 3 ] The effects of gravity on multicellular organisms is considerably more drastic. During the period when animals first evolved to survive on land some method of directed locomotion and thus a form of inner skeleton or outer skeleton would have been required to cope with the increase in the apparent force of gravity due to the weakened upward force of buoyancy . Prior to this point, most lifeforms were small and had a worm- or jellyfish-like appearance, and without this evolutionary step would not have been able to maintain their form or move on land.

In larger terrestrial vertebrates gravitational forces influence musculoskeletal systems , fluid distribution, and hydrodynamics of the circulation .
