[ 1 ] Description [ edit ] Logo in 2007 Douglas R. Harper is an American Civil War historian and copy editor for LNP Media Group .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He compiled the etymology dictionary to record the history and evolution of more than 50,000 words, including slang and technical terms.

[ 4 ] The core of its etymology information stems from The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology by Robert Barnhart , Ernest Klein 's Comprehensive Etymology Dictionary of the English Language , The Middle English Compendium , The Oxford English Dictionary , and the 1889–1902 Century Dictionary .

[ 5 ] Harper also researches on digital archives . On the Etymonline homepage, Harper says that he considers himself "essentially and for the most part" a compiler and evaluator of etymology research made by others.

Reviews and reputation [ edit ] The Online Etymology Dictionary has been cited by Oxford University 's "Arts and Humanities Community Resource" catalog as "an excellent tool for those seeking the origins of words".

[ 6 ] It was also cited in the Chicago Tribune as one of the "best resources for finding just the right word".

[ 7 ] It is cited in academic work as a useful reference for etymology.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In addition, it has been used as a data source for quantitative scholarly research.
