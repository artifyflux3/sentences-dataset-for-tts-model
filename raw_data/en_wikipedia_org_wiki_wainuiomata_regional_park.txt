[ 1 ] Geography [ edit ] The Wainuiomata Regional Park is adjacent to one the largest areas of lowland native forests in the lower North Island.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It adjoins the Wainuiomata Water Collection Area and Remutaka Forest Park .

History [ edit ] Māori used the hills and valleys of the area to travel between Wairarapa and Wellington Harbour .

[ 3 ] In the mid-19th century, the Sinclair family and other European settlers logged the lower valley for timber, including the site of the current regional park.

[ 3 ] Wellington Regional Council consulted on the future of the park in 2020.

[ 5 ] Water collection area [ edit ] Main article: Wainuiomata Water Collection Area Historic Lower Dam on Waninuiomata River In the 1880s, an earth dam and pipeline was established to collect fresh water from the Wainuiomata and Ōrongorongo Rivers. There are still remnants of the old logging tramways and old dam construction camp sites in the park. The rivers now provide about 15% of the region's drinking water.

[ 3 ] A geological survey route was built in the 1970s, to investigate rock structures and the possibility of damning the Wainuiomata River. It is now open to the public as the Tana Umaga Track.

At the eastern edge of the reserve is a water museum and the Lower Dam.  This area was flooded in 2007 to create a wetland.

Native plant nursery [ edit ] A native plant nursery was opened in the park in August 2021. The nursery was built and is operated by volunteers from Forest & Bird New Zealand, as project partners with Greater Wellington Regional Council. It can hold up to 12,000 seedlings of native species, including rimu , kahikatea , miro , mataī , rewarewa , coprosma, and carex.
