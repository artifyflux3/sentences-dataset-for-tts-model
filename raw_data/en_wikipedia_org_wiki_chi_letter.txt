Greek [ edit ] The Greek alphabet on a black figure vessel, with a cross-shaped chi Pronunciation [ edit ] Ancient Greek [ edit ] Its value in Ancient Greek was an aspirated velar stop /kʰ/ (in the Western Greek alphabet : /ks/).

Koine Greek [ edit ] In Koine Greek and later dialects it became a fricative ( [x] / [ç] ) along with Θ and Φ .

Modern Greek [ edit ] In Modern Greek , it has two distinct pronunciations: In front of high or front vowels ( /e/ or /i/ ) it is pronounced as a voiceless palatal fricative [ç] , as in German ich or like some pronunciations of "h" in English words like hew and human . In front of low or back vowels ( /a/ , /o/ or /u/ ) and consonants , it is pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative ( [x] ), as in German ach or Spanish j . This distinction corresponds to the ich-Laut and ach-Laut of German.

Transliteration [ edit ] Chi is romanized as ⟨ch⟩ in most systematic transliteration conventions, but sometimes ⟨kh⟩ is used.

[ 3 ] In addition, in Modern Greek, it is often also romanized as ⟨h⟩ or ⟨x⟩ in informal practice.

Greek numeral [ edit ] In the system of Greek numerals , it has a value of 600.

Xi [ edit ] In ancient times, some local forms of the Greek alphabet used the chi instead of xi to represent the /ks/ sound. This was borrowed into the early Latin language, which led to the use of the letter X for the same sound in Latin, and many modern languages that use the Latin alphabet .

Cyrillic [ edit ] Chi was also included in the Cyrillic script as the letter Х , with the phonetic value /x/ or /h/.

International Phonetic Alphabet [ edit ] In the International Phonetic Alphabet , ⟨ χ ⟩ represents a voiceless uvular fricative .

Chiasmus [ edit ] Chi is the basis for the name literary chiastic structure and the name of chiasmus .

Symbolism [ edit ] In Plato 's Timaeus , it is explained that the two bands that form the soul of the world cross each other like the letter Χ. Plato's analogy, along with several other examples of chi as a symbol occur in Thomas Browne 's discourse The Garden of Cyrus (1658).

Chi or X is often used to abbreviate the name Christ , as in the holiday Christmas ( Xmas ). When fused within a single typeface with the Greek letter rho , it is called the Chi Rho and used to represent the person of Jesus Christ.

Mathematics and science [ edit ] In statistics , the term chi-squared or χ χ 2 {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}} has various uses , including the chi-squared distribution , the chi-squared test , and chi-squared target model In algebraic topology , Chi is used to represent the Euler characteristic of a surface.

[ 4 ] The chromatic number of a graph in graph theory [ 5 ] In neuroanatomy , crossings of peripheral nerves (such as the optic chiasm ) are named for the letter Chi because of its Χ-shape.

[ 6 ] In chemistry , the mole fraction [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and electronegativity [ 9 ] may be denoted by the lowercase χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } .

In physics , χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } denotes electric or magnetic susceptibility .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In rhetoric , both chiastic structure (a literary device ) and the figure of speech Chiasmus derive from their names from the shape of the letter Chi.

In mechanical engineering , chi is used as a symbol for the reduction factor of relevant buckling loads in the EN 1993 , a European Standard for the design of steel structures.

In analytic number theory , chi is used for the Dirichlet character .

Some differences in transliteration result from changes in pronunciation of the Greek language; others reflect convention, as for example the χ (chi or khi), which was transliterated by the Romans as ch (because they lacked the letter k in their usual alphabet). In Modern Greek, however, the standard transliteration for χ is kh.
