In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **Pythagorean theorem** or **Pythagoras' theorem** is a fundamental relation in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") between the three sides of a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle"). It states that the area of the [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square "Square") whose side is the [hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse "Hypotenuse") (the side opposite the [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle")) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.

The [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") can be written as an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") relating the lengths of the sides a, b and the hypotenuse c, sometimes called the **Pythagorean equation**:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Sally0-1)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90b56b985c78deb115014efe90ce634d73dd51fa)
The theorem is named for the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") philosopher [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras "Pythagoras"), born around 570 BC. The theorem has been [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof") numerous times by many different methods – possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") proofs and [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") proofs, with some dating back thousands of years.

When [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is represented by a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") in [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") satisfies the Pythagorean relation: the squared distance between two points equals the sum of squares of the difference in each coordinate between the points.

The theorem can be [generalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization "Generalization") in various ways: to [higher-dimensional spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_space "Higher-dimensional space"), to [spaces that are not Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), to objects that are not right triangles, and to objects that are not triangles at all but [n-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional "N-dimensional") solids.

Proofs using constructed squares

Rearrangement proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

(The area of the white space remains constant throughout the translation rearrangement of the triangles. At all moments in time, the area is always _c_ 2. And likewise, at all moments in time, the area is always _a_ 2 + _b_ 2.)

### Rearrangement proofs

In one rearrangement proof, two squares are used whose sides have a measure of ![Image 5: {\displaystyle a+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2391acf09244b9dba74eb940e871a6be7e7973a) and which contain four right triangles whose sides are a, b and c, with the hypotenuse being c. In the square on the right side, the triangles are placed such that the corners of the square correspond to the corners of the right angle in the triangles, forming a square in the center whose sides are length c. Each outer square has an area of ![Image 6: {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ceb5efe73b6089f83653aacb8db72a3dcc0d49b) as well as ![Image 7: {\displaystyle 2ab+c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f7b08939c0a038414a1c1237d3b91ae98fe9bc7), with ![Image 8: {\displaystyle 2ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbab03eaf02d30993294767bd40ec3bad6c524b8) representing the total area of the four triangles. Within the big square on the left side, the four triangles are moved to form two similar rectangles with sides of length a and b. These rectangles in their new position have now delineated two new squares, one having side length a is formed in the bottom-left corner, and another square of side length b formed in the top-right corner. In this new position, this left side now has a square of area ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ceb5efe73b6089f83653aacb8db72a3dcc0d49b) as well as ![Image 10: {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a328bb71912027dbe20367b58ea3cee57ed00ae)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D. "Q.E.D.") Since both squares have the area of ![Image 11: {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ceb5efe73b6089f83653aacb8db72a3dcc0d49b) it follows that the other measure of the square area also equal each other such that ![Image 12: {\displaystyle 2ab+c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f7b08939c0a038414a1c1237d3b91ae98fe9bc7) = ![Image 13: {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a328bb71912027dbe20367b58ea3cee57ed00ae). With the area of the four triangles removed from both side of the equation what remains is ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90b56b985c78deb115014efe90ce634d73dd51fa)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-2)

In another proof rectangles in the second box can also be placed such that both have one corner that correspond to consecutive corners of the square. In this way they also form two boxes, this time in consecutive corners, with areas ![Image 15: {\displaystyle a^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f564e5dc0b6e68af32ca8614e972f5b36e944a24) and ![Image 16: {\displaystyle b^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acf98b04bfc723606ebb4a7942fa3ab94becd2ee)which will again lead to a second square of with the area ![Image 17: {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a328bb71912027dbe20367b58ea3cee57ed00ae).

English mathematician [Sir Thomas Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Heath_(classicist) "Thomas Heath (classicist)") gives this proof in his commentary on Proposition I.47 in [Euclid's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")_[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_, and mentions the proposals of German mathematicians [Carl Anton Bretschneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Anton_Bretschneider "Carl Anton Bretschneider") and [Hermann Hankel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hankel "Hermann Hankel") that Pythagoras may have known this proof. Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion "that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-3) Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-4)

### Algebraic proofs

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Pythagoras_algebraic2.svg/250px-Pythagoras_algebraic2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras_algebraic2.svg)

Diagram of the two algebraic proofs

The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c, as shown in the lower part of the diagram.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-5) This results in a larger square, with side _a_ + _b_ and area (_a_ + _b_)2. The four triangles and the square side c must have the same area as the larger square,

![Image 19: {\displaystyle (b+a)^{2}=c^{2}+4{\frac {ab}{2}}=c^{2}+2ab,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70bab60b318da00b5aafdc6faaf02ae44adb16b7)
giving

![Image 20: {\displaystyle c^{2}=(b+a)^{2}-2ab=b^{2}+2ab+a^{2}-2ab=a^{2}+b^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cde8c691a1b6f74d707f0c530b694fe21e8c617)
A similar proof uses four copies of a right triangle with sides a, b and c, arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-rotate-6) The triangles are similar with area ![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4164108e2658d2333ea13feee6a0cb0be43db7e8), while the small square has side _b_ − _a_ and area (_b_ − _a_)2. The area of the large square is therefore

![Image 22: {\displaystyle (b-a)^{2}+4{\frac {ab}{2}}=(b-a)^{2}+2ab=b^{2}-2ab+a^{2}+2ab=a^{2}+b^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4295ef27e5d8ef50acb33a01fc3118358140013)
But this is a square with side c and area _c_ 2, so

![Image 23: {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e10f9b628ee334c9ec8dcf1f54db092787bebdc5)
Other proofs of the theorem
---------------------------

This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_(principle)#Miscellaneous "Law (principle)") of [quadratic reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_reciprocity "Quadratic reciprocity") being another contender for that distinction); the book _The Pythagorean Proposition_ contains 370 proofs.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-7)

### Proof using similar triangles

In this section, and as usual in geometry, a "word" of two capital letters, such as AB denotes the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") defined by the points labeled with the letters, and not a multiplication. So, _AB_ 2 denotes the square of the length AB and not the product ![Image 24: {\displaystyle A\times B^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91ae95301d5d9d476cd9a4268fdd89dcbe3b8df5)

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Pythagoras_similar_triangles_simplified.svg/250px-Pythagoras_similar_triangles_simplified.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras_similar_triangles_simplified.svg)

Proof using similar triangles

This proof is based on the [proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") of the sides of three [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.

Let _ABC_ represent a right triangle, with the [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle") located at C, as shown on the figure. Draw the [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) "Altitude (triangle)") from point C, and call H its intersection with the side _AB_. Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e. The new triangle, _ACH,_ is [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") to triangle _ABC_, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as θ in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle _CBH_ is also similar to _ABC_. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [triangle postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_postulate "Triangle postulate"): The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate"). Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:

![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\frac {BC}{AB}}={\frac {BH}{BC}}{\text{ and }}{\frac {AC}{AB}}={\frac {AH}{AC}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/112d8d12375cd6fa4bc69fc197fd7455c7875d0d)
The first result equates the [cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine") of the angles θ, whereas the second result equates their [sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine").

These ratios can be written as

![Image 27: {\displaystyle BC^{2}=AB\times BH{\text{ and }}AC^{2}=AB\times AH.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/954b2dc2e38446aaa85b3d70f5322b7bfbd2c679)
Summing these two equalities results in

![Image 28: {\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB\times BH+AB\times AH=AB(AH+BH)=AB^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2965b15f3ae218505bdcac14c2ffe7a3e7ca66f2)
which, after simplification, demonstrates the Pythagorean theorem:

![Image 29: {\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4e213cc44a80531ede224cf3ec032609a4f03d4)
The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One [conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture "Conjecture") is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the _Elements_, and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-8)

### Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement

[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Einstein-trigonometric-proof.svg/250px-Einstein-trigonometric-proof.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein-trigonometric-proof.svg)

Right triangle on the hypotenuse dissected into two similar right triangles on the legs, according to Einstein's proof.

[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces do not need to be moved.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-9) Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see [Similar figures on the three sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#Similar_figures_on_the_three_sides)). In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself. The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts. Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle. Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.

### Euclid's proof

[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem.svg/250px-Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem.svg)

Proof in Euclid's _Elements_

In outline, here is how the proof in [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_ proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)"), proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.

Let A, B, C be the [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.

For the formal proof, we require four elementary [lemmata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(mathematics) "Lemma (mathematics)"):

1.   If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent ([side-angle-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_angle_side "Side angle side")).
2.   The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.
3.   The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.
4.   The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).

Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-10)

[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem2.svg/250px-Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_to_Euclid%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem2.svg)

Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF

The proof is as follows:

1.   Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.
2.   On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Gullberg-11)
3.   From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.
4.   Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.
5.   Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)#Collinear_points "Line (geometry)").
6.   Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.
7.   Since AB is equal to FB, BD is equal to BC and angle ABD equals angle FBC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC.
8.   Since A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2)
9.   Since C is collinear with A and G, and this line is parallel to FB, then square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.
10.   Therefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB 2.
11.   By applying steps 3 to 10 to the other side of the figure, it can be similarly shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC 2.
12.   Adding these two results, AB 2 + AC 2 = BD × BK + KL × KC
13.   Since BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC
14.   Therefore, AB 2 + AC 2 = BC 2, since CBDE is a square.

This proof, which appears in Euclid's _Elements_ as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1, demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-13) This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Hawking-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Pythagoras-15)

### Proofs by dissection and rearrangement

Another by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area _c_ 2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas _a_ 2 and _b_ 2, which must have the same area as the initial large square.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-16)

The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called [dissection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_problem "Dissection problem"). This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-specifics-17)

### Proof by area-preserving shearing

[![Image 34](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Visual_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem_by_area-preserving_shearing.gif/250px-Visual_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem_by_area-preserving_shearing.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visual_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem_by_area-preserving_shearing.gif)

Visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem by area-preserving shearing

As shown in the accompanying animation, area-preserving [shear mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping "Shear mapping") and translations can transform the squares on the sides adjacent to the right-angle onto the square on the hypotenuse, together covering it exactly.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-18) Each shear leaves the base and height unchanged, thus leaving the area unchanged too. The translations also leave the area unchanged, as they do not alter the shapes at all. Each square is first sheared into a parallelogram, and then into a rectangle which can be translated onto one section of the square on the hypotenuse.

### Other algebraic proofs

A related [proof by U.S. President James A. Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem "Garfield's proof of the Pythagorean theorem") was published before he was elected president; while he was a [U.S. Representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Representative "U.S. Representative").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Garfield-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-animation-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-21) Instead of a square it uses a [trapezoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid "Trapezoid"), which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The [area of the trapezoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid#Area "Trapezoid") can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is

![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(b+a)^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a8dc7ad0ad246becf4df446b35a17e91583f56f)
The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of ![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a11cfb2fdb143693b1daf78fcb5c11a023cb1c55), which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result.

### Proof using differentials

One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Staring-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-M_Hardy-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-24)

The triangle _ABC_ is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with _BC_ the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length y, the side _AC_ of length x and the side _AB_ of length a, as seen in the lower diagram part.

[![Image 37](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Pythag_differential_proof.svg/250px-Pythag_differential_proof.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythag_differential_proof.svg)

Diagram for differential proof

If x is increased by a small amount _dx_ by extending the side _AC_ slightly to D, then y also increases by _dy_. These form two sides of a triangle, _CDE_, which (with E chosen so _CE_ is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to _ABC_. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is:

![Image 38: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {x}{y}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f73a3c61f39b8208342e6d8d8520aa8d27b92624)
This can be rewritten as ![Image 39: {\displaystyle y\,dy=x\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f874f067d98a266af758be7e5d9a526c9edc68bf) , which is a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") that can be solved by direct integration:

![Image 40: {\displaystyle \int y\,dy=\int x\,dx\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/348f3e01d6b3e6722812007df16b1c4933bd9965)
giving

![Image 41: {\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+C.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87aebfb29f8e93639573592f08a118a73e5c3f7b)
The constant can be deduced from _x_ = 0, _y_ = _a_ to give the equation

![Image 42: {\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+a^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06a56940cdf522f427442fb3741a9a1fd690be73)
This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of _dx_ and _dy_.

Converse
--------

The [converse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem#Converse "Theorem") of the theorem is also true:[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Sally1-25)

> Given a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, if _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2, then the angle between sides a and b is a [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle").

For any three positive [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers")a, b, and c such that _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2, there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c as a consequence of the [converse of the triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality#Converse "Triangle inequality").

This converse appears in Euclid's _Elements_ (Book I, Proposition 48): "If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right."[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-26)

It can be proved using the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines "Law of cosines") or as follows:

Let _ABC_ be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, with _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2. Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length _c_ = √_a_ 2 + _b_ 2, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths a, b and c, the triangles are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle.

The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proved without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-28)

A [corollary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary "Corollary") of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and _a_ + _b_>_c_ (otherwise there is no triangle according to the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality")). The following statements apply:[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Wilczynski-29)

*   If _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2, then the [triangle is right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle").
*   If _a_ 2 + _b_ 2>_c_ 2, then the [triangle is acute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_Triangle "Acute Triangle").
*   If _a_ 2 + _b_ 2<_c_ 2, then the [triangle is obtuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_and_obtuse_triangles "Acute and obtuse triangles").

[Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra "Edsger W. Dijkstra") has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language:

sgn(_α_ + _β_ − _γ_) = sgn(_a_ 2 + _b_ 2 − _c_ 2),
where α is the angle opposite to side a, β is the angle opposite to side b, γ is the angle opposite to side c, and sgn is the [sign function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function "Sign function").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-30)

Consequences and uses of the theorem
------------------------------------

### Pythagorean triples

A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b, and c, such that _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2. In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Sally0-1) Such a triple is commonly written (_a_, _b_, _c_). Some well-known examples are (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13).

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Coprime") (the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor "Greatest common divisor") of a, b and c is 1).

The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100:

(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97)
There are many [formulas for generating Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulas_for_generating_Pythagorean_triples "Formulas for generating Pythagorean triples"). Of these, **Euclid's formula** is the most well-known: given arbitrary positive integers m and n, the formula states that the integers

![Image 43: {\displaystyle a=m^{2}-n^{2},\quad \,b=2mn,\quad \,c=m^{2}+n^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56f7873a44f76a32f63964d1268312e5a12f03df)
forms a Pythagorean triple.

### Inverse Pythagorean theorem

Given a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") with sides ![Image 44: {\displaystyle a,b,c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f13f068df656c1b1911ae9f81628c49a6181194d) and [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) "Altitude (triangle)")![Image 45: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the [hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse "Hypotenuse")![Image 46: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455)). The Pythagorean theorem has,

### Incommensurable lengths

[![Image 60](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Euclid_Corollary_5.svg/250px-Euclid_Corollary_5.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Euclid_Corollary_5.svg)

The [spiral of Theodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_Theodorus "Spiral of Theodorus"): A construction for line segments with lengths whose ratios are the square root of a positive integer

One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are [incommensurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensurability_(mathematics) "Commensurability (mathematics)") (so the ratio of which is not a [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number")) can be constructed using a [straightedge and compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge_constructions "Compass and straightedge constructions"). Pythagoras' theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") operation.

The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Euclid_5-32) Each triangle has a side (labeled "1") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as √2, √3, √5. For more detail, see [Quadratic irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_irrational "Quadratic irrational").

Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Lavine0-33) According to one legend, [Hippasus of Metapontum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus "Hippasus") (_ca._ 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-drown-34) A careful discussion of Hippasus's contributions is found in [Fritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Fritz "Kurt von Fritz").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Fritz-35)

### Complex numbers

[![Image 61](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Complex_conjugate_picture.svg/250px-Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Complex_conjugate_picture.svg)

The absolute value of a complex number z is the distance r from z to the origin.

For any [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")

![Image 62: {\displaystyle z=x+iy,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ee21a775fda65273b6e1a6786b7f3d51a85de65)
the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") or modulus is given by

![Image 63: {\displaystyle r=|z|={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b59629c801aa0ddcdf17ee489e028fb9f8d4ea75)
So the three quantities, r, x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation,

![Image 64: {\displaystyle r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/529bce81636e82fc3e4cd69d9228a0642f938c85)
Note that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically r is the distance of the z from zero or the origin O in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane").

This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, _z_ 1 and _z_ 2 say. The required distance is given by

![Image 65: {\displaystyle |z_{1}-z_{2}|={\sqrt {(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f92b37d6c3c6b0e0b7fd40814b49dafdea93cbbb)
so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation,

![Image 66: {\displaystyle |z_{1}-z_{2}|^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4a552e6242cd6771c1de7f1473fb9b8f4c1a04c)
### Euclidean distance

The distance formula in [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Macdonald-36) If (_x_ 1, _y_ 1) and (_x_ 2, _y_ 2) are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance"), is given by

![Image 67: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a509ef87847208478b215d31f454c45a0037800e)
More generally, in [Euclidean n-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), the Euclidean distance between two points, ![Image 68: {\displaystyle A\,=\,(a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/922c3a242b68119052accb180e53726d5478ff96) and ![Image 69: {\displaystyle B\,=\,(b_{1},b_{2},\dots ,b_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69d88fa9c610a08a9a5f3c9509bfe0f5734a6783), is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as:

![Image 70: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(a_{n}-b_{n})^{2}}}={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}-b_{i})^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54a7bc6d1fc12967450870d78c15d38b4d12c230)
If instead of Euclidean distance, the square of this value (the [squared Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squared_Euclidean_distance "Squared Euclidean distance"), or SED) is used, the resulting equation avoids square roots and is simply a sum of the SED of the coordinates:

![Image 71: {\displaystyle (a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(a_{n}-b_{n})^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}-b_{i})^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a7d6095fcea926cb5d35489cf5d93bf8aa36ef5)
The squared form is a smooth, [convex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function "Convex function") of both points, and is widely used in [optimization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_theory "Optimization theory") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), forming the basis of [least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares "Least squares").

### Euclidean distance in other coordinate systems

If Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates") are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the [applications of Legendre polynomials in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials#Applications_of_Legendre_polynomials_in_physics "Legendre polynomials"). The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras' theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates (_r_, _θ_) can be introduced as:

![Image 72: {\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta ,\ y=r\sin \theta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f9ff49d358074aef6a50f06976e30a54b1f33d6)
Then two points with locations (_r_ 1, _θ_ 1) and (_r_ 2, _θ_ 2) are separated by a distance s:

![Image 73: {\displaystyle s^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}=(r_{1}\cos \theta _{1}-r_{2}\cos \theta _{2})^{2}+(r_{1}\sin \theta _{1}-r_{2}\sin \theta _{2})^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2fb0a54ca04966888d2d2a7278a802f91629b64)
Performing the squares and combining terms, the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as:

![Image 74: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s^{2}&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\left(\cos \theta _{1}\cos \theta _{2}+\sin \theta _{1}\sin \theta _{2}\right)\\&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\cos \left(\theta _{1}-\theta _{2}\right)\\&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\cos \Delta \theta ,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e86ab87f6578a1e59d11b4df774ea7ed812fb30e)
using the trigonometric [product-to-sum formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Product-to-sum_and_sum-to-product_identities "List of trigonometric identities"). This formula is the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#Law_of_cosines), sometimes called the generalized Pythagorean theorem.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-37) From this result, for the case where the radii to the two locations are at right angles, the enclosed angle Δ _θ_ = π/2, and the form corresponding to Pythagoras' theorem is regained: ![Image 75: {\displaystyle s^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a160e5e595f42d6a982815774b42f73b5bb03f43) The Pythagorean theorem, valid for right triangles, therefore is a special case of the more general law of cosines, valid for arbitrary triangles.

In a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c, [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") determines the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") and [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine") of the angle θ between side a and the hypotenuse as:

![Image 77: {\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {b}{c}},\quad \cos \theta ={\frac {a}{c}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d646102b57a24754318119d66cf9a300e5c0699)
From that it follows:

![Image 78: {\displaystyle {\cos }^{2}\theta +{\sin }^{2}\theta ={\frac {a^{2}+b^{2}}{c^{2}}}=1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4415762b7e9c70acea87401d05e6572e882197a8)
where the last step applies Pythagoras' theorem. This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Leff-38) In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin _θ_ and adjacent side of size cos _θ_ in units of the hypotenuse.

### Relation to the cross product

[![Image 79](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Cross_product_parallelogram.svg/250px-Cross_product_parallelogram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cross_product_parallelogram.svg)

The area of a parallelogram as a cross product; vectors **a** and **b** identify a plane and **a × b** is normal to this plane.

The Pythagorean theorem relates the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") and [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") in a similar way:[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Massey-39)

![Image 80: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} \|^{2}+(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} )^{2}=\|\mathbf {a} \|^{2}\|\mathbf {b} \|^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/452ff6d569f321bbba1d44348b575d1e56652a43)
This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as

![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} &=ab\mathbf {n} \sin {\theta }\\\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} &=ab\cos {\theta },\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cae084d2d8b72996221da029264e391a601d061a)
with **n** a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") normal to both **a** and **b**. The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.

This can also be used to define the cross product. By rearranging the following equation is obtained

![Image 82: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} \|^{2}=\|\mathbf {a} \|^{2}\|\mathbf {b} \|^{2}-(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} )^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bb5f2100b065804ac858451d2a4897b1b2d1bd7)
This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in [seven dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product "Seven-dimensional cross product").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-n_dimensions-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Hildebrand-41)

### As an axiom

If the first four of the [Euclidean geometry axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms "Euclidean geometry") are assumed to be true then the Pythagorean theorem is equivalent to the fifth. That is, [Euclid's fifth postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_fifth_postulate "Euclid's fifth postulate") implies the Pythagorean theorem and vice-versa.

Generalizations
---------------

### Similar figures on the three sides

The Pythagorean theorem generalizes beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to any [similar figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similar_figures "Similar figures"). This was known by [Hippocrates of Chios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates_of_Chios "Hippocrates of Chios") in the 5th century BC,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-42) and was included by [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") in his _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_:[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Euclid_VI-43)

> If one erects similar figures (see [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry")) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.

This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are _a:b:c_).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Putz-44) While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Putz-44)

The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas A, B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a, b and c then:

![Image 83: {\displaystyle {\frac {A}{a^{2}}}={\frac {B}{b^{2}}}={\frac {C}{c^{2}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4203a52a66053946d787c81fb2fb6f4e8d091e2)![Image 84: {\displaystyle \Rightarrow A+B={\frac {a^{2}}{c^{2}}}C+{\frac {b^{2}}{c^{2}}}C\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d1adbf43b5c518c044dbd5ab22694eecb4b8cf5)
But, by the Pythagorean theorem, _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2, so _A_ + _B_ = _C_.

Conversely, if we can prove that _A_ + _B_ = _C_ for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (A and B ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) "Altitude (triangle)"). The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus _A_ + _B_ = _C_ and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 = _c_ 2. (_See also [Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's\_theorem#Einstein's\_proof\_by\_dissection\_without\_rearrangement)_)

### Law of cosines

[![Image 85](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Law_of_cosines2.svg/250px-Law_of_cosines2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Law_of_cosines2.svg)

The separation s of two points (r 1, θ 1) and (r 2, θ 2) in [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") is given by the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines "Law of cosines"). Interior angle Δθ = θ 1−θ 2.

The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem relating the lengths of sides in any triangle, the law of cosines, which states that ![Image 86: {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {\theta }=c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24abefd23a9cb7627fc539f6f33edd1ab00d84fa) where ![Image 87: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is the angle between sides ![Image 88: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) and ![Image 89: {\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3).[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Leff1-45)

When ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is ![Image 91: {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98f98bef5d4981ff6e2aa827d4699e347fb30db2) radians or 90°, then ![Image 92: {\displaystyle \cos {\theta }=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a58e6c2889d2ccc96bee10f30b3093b95f2a4830), and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem.

### Arbitrary triangle

[![Image 93](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/T%C3%A2bit_ibn_Qorra_modified.svg/250px-T%C3%A2bit_ibn_Qorra_modified.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T%C3%A2bit_ibn_Qorra_modified.svg)

Generalization of Pythagoras' theorem by [Tâbit ibn Qorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C4%81bit_ibn_Qurra "Thābit ibn Qurra").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Eves-46) Lower panel: reflection of triangle CAD (top) to form triangle DAC, similar to triangle ABC (top).

At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides _a, b, c_, inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base θ are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled c. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle _CAD_ with angle θ opposite side b and with side r along c. A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side a and a side with length s along c, as shown in the figure. [Thābit ibn Qurra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C4%81bit_ibn_Qurra "Thābit ibn Qurra") stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as:[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Sayii-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Sally2-48)

![Image 94: {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c(r+s)\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9381068d1b755b056fceabb569a192d4ceb6ef32)
As the angle θ approaches π/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths r and s overlap less and less. When _θ_ = π/2, _ADB_ becomes a right triangle, _r_ + _s_ = _c_, and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained.

One proof observes that triangle _ABC_ has the same angles as triangle _CAD_, but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex A, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the [triangle postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_postulate "Triangle postulate").) Consequently, _ABC_ is similar to the reflection of _CAD_, the triangle _DAC_ in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ,

![Image 95: {\displaystyle {\frac {c}{b}}={\frac {b}{r}}\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8adb4dcb419276739cc37c537b3bb97d70799e2e)
Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle,

![Image 96: {\displaystyle {\frac {c}{a}}={\frac {a}{s}}\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74856193a35cfe46976780623921126075571711)
[Clearing fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_fractions "Clearing fractions") and adding these two relations:

![Image 97: {\displaystyle cs+cr=a^{2}+b^{2}\ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a64dacfaa75ebf2fe9e9e016d5557699d9c8035)
the required result.

The theorem remains valid if the angle ![Image 98: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is obtuse so the lengths r and s are non-overlapping.

### General triangles using parallelograms

[![Image 99](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Pythagoras_for_scalene_triangle.svg/250px-Pythagoras_for_scalene_triangle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras_for_scalene_triangle.svg)

Generalization for arbitrary triangles,

green area = blue area

[![Image 100](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Pythagoras_construction.svg/250px-Pythagoras_construction.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras_construction.svg)

Construction for proof of parallelogram generalization

[Pappus's area theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_area_theorem "Pappus's area theorem") is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras' theorem, and was considered a generalization by [Pappus of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") in 4 AD[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Jennings-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-50)

The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.

### Solid geometry

[![Image 101](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Pythagoras_3d.svg/250px-Pythagoras_3d.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras_3d.svg)

Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides.

[![Image 102](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Tetrahedron_vertfig.svg/250px-Tetrahedron_vertfig.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tetrahedron_vertfig.svg)

A tetrahedron with outward facing right-angle corner

In terms of [solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry"), Pythagoras' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider the [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid "Cuboid") shown in the figure. The length of [face diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_diagonal "Face diagonal")_AC_ is found from Pythagoras' theorem as:

![Image 103: {\displaystyle {\overline {AC}}^{\,2}={\overline {AB}}^{\,2}+{\overline {BC}}^{\,2}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f71d7ab24274862d8fc1c5bd5e92d4b5a911231f)
where these three sides form a right triangle. Using diagonal _AC_ and the horizontal edge _CD_, the length of [body diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_diagonal "Body diagonal")_AD_ then is found by a second application of Pythagoras' theorem as:

![Image 104: {\displaystyle {\overline {AD}}^{\,2}={\overline {AC}}^{\,2}+{\overline {CD}}^{\,2}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7500a6e45e060156a55569b262a254961075653)
or, doing it all in one step:

![Image 105: {\displaystyle {\overline {AD}}^{\,2}={\overline {AB}}^{\,2}+{\overline {BC}}^{\,2}+{\overline {CD}}^{\,2}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a8bc2cd248a17db3c0285de11f434ff700c23e19)
This result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector **v** (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {**v**k} (the three mutually perpendicular sides):

![Image 106: {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {v} \|^{2}=\sum _{k=1}^{3}\|\mathbf {v} _{k}\|^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/411d7e1a17ff07124b497162050051d433c68faf)
This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras' theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.

A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [de Gua's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Gua%27s_theorem "De Gua's theorem"), named for [Jean Paul de Gua de Malves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paul_de_Gua_de_Malves "Jean Paul de Gua de Malves"): If a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron") has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(geometry) "Cube (geometry)")), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the "n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem":[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Bhatia-51)

> Let ![Image 107: {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8694289524164f895d6665f163e14c4dc5ec648d) be orthogonal vectors in **R**_n_. Consider the n-dimensional simplex S with vertices ![Image 108: {\displaystyle 0,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81ac72c8a88831a952febc7188d500d20470a7ea). (Think of the (_n_ − 1)-dimensional simplex with vertices ![Image 109: {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/737e02a5fbf8bc31d443c91025339f9fd1de1065) not including the origin as the "hypotenuse" of S and the remaining (_n_ − 1)-dimensional faces of S as its "legs".) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs.

This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The "hypotenuse" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the "legs" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the "legs" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras' theorem applies. In a different wording:[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Wong-52)

> Given an n-rectangular n-dimensional simplex, the square of the (_n_ − 1)-content of the [facet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(mathematics) "Facet (mathematics)") opposing the right vertex will equal the sum of the squares of the (_n_ − 1)-contents of the remaining facets.

### Inner product spaces

[![Image 110](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Parallelogram_equality.svg/250px-Parallelogram_equality.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parallelogram_equality.svg)

Vectors involved in the parallelogram law

The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-van_der_Heijden-53) which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_spaces "Euclidean spaces"). For example, a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") may be considered as a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Lin-54)

In an inner product space, the concept of [perpendicularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") is replaced by the concept of [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal"): two vectors **v** and **w** are orthogonal if their inner product ![Image 111: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18d022cb529f7cc349ef10f48eb80887f6ee4d6d) is zero. The [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space#Definition "Inner product space") is a generalization of the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of vectors. The dot product is called the _standard_ inner product or the _Euclidean_ inner product. However, other inner products are possible.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Rorres-55)

The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space") ‖**v**‖ of a vector **v**, defined as:[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Saxe-56)

![Image 112: {\displaystyle \lVert \mathbf {v} \rVert \equiv {\sqrt {\langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {v} \rangle }}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2deb9ace442db2f52546eabb82a79c5a7cb65e8a)
In an inner-product space, the **Pythagorean theorem** states that for any two orthogonal vectors **v** and **w** we have

![Image 113: {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}=\left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|^{2}+\left\|\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f15e09350ac7875db051990ea6a3ed9d50cfc39)
Here the vectors **v** and **w** are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the [vector sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector#Addition_and_subtraction "Euclidean vector")**v**+**w**. This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the [properties of the inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space#Definition "Inner product space"):

![Image 114: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\|\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}&=\langle \mathbf {v+w} ,\ \mathbf {v+w} \rangle \\[3mu]&=\langle \mathbf {v} ,\ \mathbf {v} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {w} ,\ \mathbf {w} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {v,\ w} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {w,\ v} \rangle \\[3mu]&=\left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|^{2}+\left\|\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2},\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c30b0575230c350ae41528af64dbe6ed55df988)
where ![Image 115: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v,\ w} \rangle =\langle \mathbf {w,\ v} \rangle =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a3e02531858b4b9d6cb9991e87a1a388cf780c7) because of orthogonality.

A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non-orthogonal vectors is the _[parallelogram law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram\_equality#Normed\_vector\_spaces\_satisfying\_the\_parallelogram\_law "Parallelogram equality")_:[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Saxe-56)

which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Any norm that satisfies this equality is _[ipso facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipso\_facto "Ipso facto")_ a norm corresponding to an inner product.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Saxe-56)

The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors. If **v**1, **v**2, ..., **v**n are pairwise-orthogonal vectors in an inner-product space, then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors (as described for 3-dimensions in the section on [solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#Solid_geometry)) results in the equation[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Douglas1998-57)

### Sets of _m_-dimensional objects in _n_-dimensional space

Another generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applies to [Lebesgue-measurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue-measurable "Lebesgue-measurable") sets of objects in any number of dimensions. Specifically, the square of the measure of an m-dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional [flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_(geometry) "Flat (geometry)") in n-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality") projections of the object(s) onto all m-dimensional coordinate subspaces.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Conant-58)

In mathematical terms:

### Non-Euclidean geometry

The Pythagorean theorem is derived from the [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry "Foundations of geometry") of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), and in fact, were the Pythagorean theorem to fail for some right triangle, then the plane in which this triangle is contained cannot be Euclidean. More precisely, the Pythagorean theorem [implies, and is implied by, Euclid's Parallel (Fifth) Postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate#Equivalent_properties "Parallel postulate").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Parallel-59)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Pruss-60) Thus, right triangles in a [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry")[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-false-61) do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in [spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), all three sides of the right triangle (say a, b, and c) bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to π/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because ![Image 119: {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=2c^{2}>c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e39e503eea47fc7e4e9badf0b8abf682c10f339f).

Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered—[spherical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry") and [hyperbolic plane geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"); in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.

However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say _A_+_B_ = _C_. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-62)

#### Spherical geometry

[![Image 120](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Triangle_sph%C3%A9rique.svg/250px-Triangle_sph%C3%A9rique.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Triangle_sph%C3%A9rique.svg)

Spherical triangle

For any right [triangle on a sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_triangle "Spherical triangle") of radius _R_ (for example, if γ in the figure is a right angle), with sides _a_, _b_, _c_, the relation between the sides takes the form:[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-O-63)

![Image 121: {\displaystyle \cos {\frac {c}{R}}=\cos {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cos {\frac {b}{R}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85482d713ff9bc8c55d6be13df483e1933bc61a6)
This equation can be derived as a special case of the [spherical law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines "Spherical law of cosines") that applies to all spherical triangles:

![Image 122: {\displaystyle \cos {\frac {c}{R}}=\cos {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cos {\frac {b}{R}}+\sin {\frac {a}{R}}\,\sin {\frac {b}{R}}\,\cos {\gamma }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31bb1468c37f0c5eed78c1f550578226210234f0)
For infinitesimal triangles on the sphere (or equivalently, for finite spherical triangles on a sphere of infinite radius), the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle reduces to the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. To see how, assume we have a spherical triangle of fixed side lengths _a_, _b_, and c on a sphere with expanding radius _R_. As _R_ approaches infinity the quantities _a/R_, _b/R_, and _c/R_ tend to zero and the spherical Pythagorean identity reduces to ![Image 123: {\displaystyle 1=1,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eaafacb3089646193f4c975413adf309dd6e478f) so we must look at its [asymptotic expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_expansion "Asymptotic expansion").

The [Maclaurin series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclaurin_series "Maclaurin series") for the cosine function can be written as ![Image 124: {\textstyle \cos x=1-{\tfrac {1}{2}}x^{2}+O{\left(x^{4}\right)}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42796117ae1d7bea19a4497afc7bfcbf99997ab2) with the remainder term in [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation"). Letting ![Image 125: {\displaystyle x=c/R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb9d4a65454e04d479a1fafe33d249d548ef670c) be a side of the triangle, and treating the expression as an asymptotic expansion in terms of R for a fixed c,

![Image 126: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\cos {\frac {c}{R}}=1-{\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab2f64ef55d11a3f4162b6e2d8cefed9ad57a2e5)
and likewise for _a_ and _b_. Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields

![Image 127: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1-{\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}&=\left(1-{\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\right)\left(1-{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\right)\\&=1-{\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}-{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29d7ea91f845ad6599f5e9f91f81f092892adbc9)
Subtracting 1 and then negating each side,

![Image 128: {\displaystyle {\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}={\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25f1d32a1ce2cd7ca7f30f4a28dc58c4637918b3)
Multiplying through by 2 _R_ 2, the asymptotic expansion for c in terms of fixed _a_, _b_ and variable R is

![Image 129: {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+O{\left(R^{-2}\right)}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8d1861463b20f555751ba617c388efde401bfe1)
The Euclidean Pythagorean relationship ![Image 130: {\textstyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eaa68c4d8821897773ef43d24c7063c836fc80b) is recovered in the limit, as the remainder vanishes when the radius R approaches infinity.

For practical computation in spherical trigonometry with small right triangles, cosines can be replaced with sines using the double-angle identity ![Image 131: {\displaystyle \cos {2\theta }=1-2\sin ^{2}{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f11239c6cb6c2fceedc033ca9892d7c25668aac) to avoid [loss of significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance "Loss of significance"). Then the spherical Pythagorean theorem can alternately be written as

![Image 132: {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}{\frac {c}{2R}}=\sin ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}+\sin ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}-2\sin ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}\,\sin ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ce4820db688c1490dae4f058483ee7b34f605ff)
#### Hyperbolic geometry

[![Image 133](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Hyperbolic_triangle.svg/250px-Hyperbolic_triangle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic_triangle.svg)

[Hyperbolic triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_triangle "Hyperbolic triangle")

In a [hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") space with uniform [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature")−1/_R_ 2, for a right [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_triangle "Hyperbolic triangle") with legs a, b, and hypotenuse c, the relation between the sides takes the form:[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Stahl-64)

![Image 134: {\displaystyle \cosh {\frac {c}{R}}=\cosh {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cosh {\frac {b}{R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/13a67a846a957ccfd2614a50cd538312c5de53e6)
where cosh is the [hyperbolic cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function "Hyperbolic function"). This formula is a special form of the [hyperbolic law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_law_of_cosines "Hyperbolic law of cosines") that applies to all hyperbolic triangles:[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Gilman-65)

![Image 135: {\displaystyle \cosh {\frac {c}{R}}=\cosh {\frac {a}{R}}\ \cosh {\frac {b}{R}}-\sinh {\frac {a}{R}}\ \sinh {\frac {b}{R}}\ \cos \gamma \ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd2f6ee63e1c3af6c4b72e8e3c0b048c082b7344)
with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side c.

By using the [Maclaurin series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclaurin_series "Maclaurin series") for the hyperbolic cosine, cosh _x_ ≈ 1 + _x_ 2/2, it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as a, b, and c all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras' theorem.

For small right triangles (_a_, _b_<<_R_), the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid [loss of significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance "Loss of significance"), giving

![Image 136: {\displaystyle \sinh ^{2}{\frac {c}{2R}}=\sinh ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}+\sinh ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}+2\sinh ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}\sinh ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34413529cad7772ea10c9963cf5bda6b13053929)
#### Very small triangles

For any uniform curvature K (positive, zero, or negative), in very small right triangles (|_K_|_a_ 2, |_K_|_b_ 2<< 1) with hypotenuse c, it can be shown that

![Image 137: {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-{\frac {K}{3}}a^{2}b^{2}-{\frac {K^{2}}{45}}a^{2}b^{2}(a^{2}+b^{2})-{\frac {2K^{3}}{945}}a^{2}b^{2}(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}+O(K^{4}c^{10})\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7bb002d50bf9b415bcb3cceedf4e2d8002d432a9)

Distance between infinitesimally separated points in [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") (top) and [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") (bottom), as given by Pythagoras' theorem

The Pythagorean theorem applies to [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mathematics) "Differential (mathematics)") triangles seen in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). In three dimensional space, the distance between two infinitesimally separated points satisfies

![Image 139: {\displaystyle ds^{2}=dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dd34f8cb982e92ba91f2e8eb370ccc09fa21c82)
with _ds_ the element of distance and (_dx_, _dy_, _dz_) the components of the vector separating the two points. Such a space is called a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). However, in [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), a generalization of this expression useful for general coordinates (not just Cartesian) and general spaces (not just Euclidean) takes the form:[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Chow-66)

which is called the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor#Arclength_and_the_line_element "Metric tensor"). (Sometimes, by abuse of language, the same term is applied to the set of coefficients _g_ _ij_.) It may be a function of position, and often describes [curved space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space"). A simple example is Euclidean (flat) space expressed in [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates").

The [Plimpton 322 tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322 "Plimpton 322") records [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple "Pythagorean triple") from [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia "Babylonia") times.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Neugebauer-67)

There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places, and the date of first discovery is uncertain, as is the date of the first proof. The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triples "Pythagorean triples"), knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some [deductive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_system "Deductive system").

Written c. 1800 BC, the [Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")[Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt "Middle Kingdom of Egypt")_[Berlin Papyrus 6619](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\_Papyrus\_6619 "Berlin Papyrus 6619")_ includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. According to [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), the ancient Egyptians did know about the 3:4:5 right triangle, identifying its sides with [Osiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris "Osiris"), [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis "Isis"), and [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus "Horus") respectively.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-68)

Historians of [Mesopotamian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") mathematics have concluded that the Pythagorean rule was in widespread use during the [Old Babylonian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Babylonian_period "Old Babylonian period") (20th to 16th centuries BC), over a thousand years before [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras "Pythagoras") was born.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-69)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-72) The Mesopotamian tablet _[Plimpton 322](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton\_322 "Plimpton 322")_, written near [Larsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsa "Larsa") also c. 1800 BC, contains entries that can be interpreted as the sides and diagonals of 15 different Pythagorean triples.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-73) Another tablet from a similar time, [YBC 7289](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBC_7289 "YBC 7289"), calculates the diagonal of a square or, equivalently, or an isosceles right triangle.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-74)

In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), the _[Baudhayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana "Baudhayana")[Shulba Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulba\_Sutras "Shulba Sutras")_, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-75) contains a list of Pythagorean triples and a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the special case of the [isosceles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle "Isosceles triangle")[right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_right_triangle "Isosceles right triangle") and in the general case, as does the _[Apastamba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apastamba "Apastamba") Shulba Sutra_ (c. 600 BC).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-78)

[Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire")[Neoplatonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism") philosopher and mathematician [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus"), writing in the fifth century AD, states two arithmetic rules, "one of them attributed to [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), the other to Pythagoras",[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-79) for generating special Pythagorean triples. The rule attributed to Pythagoras (c. 570– c. 495 BC) starts from an [odd number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics) "Parity (mathematics)") and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by one unit; the rule attributed to Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) starts from an even number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by two units. According to [Thomas L. Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._L._Heath "T. L. Heath") (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-80) However, when authors such as [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") and [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-heath144-81)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Heath3-82)[Classicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics")[Kurt von Fritz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Fritz "Kurt von Fritz") wrote, "Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally ... one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of [Pythagorean mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism")."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Fritz-35) Around 300 BC, in Euclid's _Elements_, the oldest extant [axiomatic proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") of the theorem is presented.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras's_theorem#cite_note-Aaboe-83)
