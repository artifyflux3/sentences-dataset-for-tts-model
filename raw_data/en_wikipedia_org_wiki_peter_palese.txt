Goldsmith Professor in the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City , [ 1 ] and an expert in the field of RNA viruses.

[ 2 ] Palese is the author of multiple book chapters and more than 500 scientific publications. He is also on the editorial board for Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). He has been awarded multiple patents on viral vaccines and antivirals .

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] His primary schooling consisted of Greek and Latin and very little modern science.

[ 4 ] He later developed his interest in science at the University of Vienna , where he received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1969 and his M.S. in pharmacy in 1970. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology from 1970 until 1971 when he joined the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai as an assistant professor.

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] Research [ edit ] Palese's research covers RNA-containing viruses with a particular focus on influenza viruses/vaccines.

[ 6 ] He built "the first genetic maps for influenza A , B and C viruses, identified the function of several viral genes, defined the mechanism of neuraminidase inhibitors (which are now FDA -approved antivirals ) and "pioneered the field of reverse genetics for negative-strand RNA viruses ".

[ 7 ] Furtherance of this technique has been used by Palese and his colleagues in reconstructing and studying the pathogenicity of the extinct but deadly 1918 pandemic influenza virus .

[ 8 ] Reverse genetics is also instrumental in developing new influenza viruses/vaccines.

When viruses infect cells, they respond with antiviral interferons -- Palese and Adolfo García-Sastre showed that most negative-strand RNA viruses counteract that antiviral response with protein antagonists to interferons. His work on "fundamental questions concerning the genetic make-up and biology of viruses" and virus-host interactions "uses molecular biological techniques to understand how viruses replicate and how they interact with cells to cause disease in their hosts", with emphasis on "the study of RNA viruses, including influenza, paramyxo and corona (SARS) viruses ".

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] He developed a new animal model (the guinea pig ) for studying the transmission of influenza viruses.

[ 10 ] Palese has been involved in developing novel vaccines against influenza viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 . Several of these vaccine approaches have been in human trials. Also, an anti-cancer vaccine based on a Newcastle disease virus vector has been tested in humans.

As of 2022, Palese and his team are working on creating a universal influenza virus vaccine, and SARS-CoV-2, specifically for low and middle-income countries.

[ 11 ] Patents [ edit ] Palese is named on 73 patents on Pubchem . As of 2023, recent patents include: NAME DATE GRANTED PATENT NUMBER Anti-Influenza B Virus Neuraminidase Antibodies And Uses Thereof 02/22/2022 11,254,733 [ 12 ] Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Proteins And Uses Thereof 03/08/2022 11,266,734 [ 13 ] Influenza Virus Vaccination Regimens 08/11/2020 10,736,956 [ 14 ] Influenza Virus Vaccines And Uses Thereof 03/10/2020 10,583,188 [ 15 ] Antibodies Against Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin And Uses Thereof 01/28/2020 10,544,207 [ 16 ] Memberships, honors and awards [ edit ] Palese is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (2000), the National Academy of Medicine (IOM) (2012), the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2002) and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (2006). In 2014, he was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the National Academy of Inventors . He has served the presidencies of the Harvey Society from 2003 to 2004 and the American Society of Virology from 2005 to 2006. He received honorary doctorates from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (2006), Baylor College of Medicine (2014), and McMaster University (2016).
