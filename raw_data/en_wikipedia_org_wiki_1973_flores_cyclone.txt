The cyclone formed in the Banda Sea on 26 April as a tropical low . It intensified as it moved in a west-southwest direction, before shifting to the south. On 29 April, the cyclone struck the north coast of the island of Flores , dissipating the next day. The cyclone killed 1,500 people on Palu'e island. The cyclone dropped heavy rainfall across Flores, causing deadly flash flooding that damaged buildings and roads, destroying or damaging thousands of houses.

Meteorological history [ edit ] Map plotting the storm's track and intensity, according to the Saffir–Simpson scale Map key Saffir–Simpson scale Tropical depression (≤38 mph, ≤62 km/h) Tropical storm (39–73 mph, 63–118 km/h) Category 1 (74–95 mph, 119–153 km/h) Category 2 (96–110 mph, 154–177 km/h) Category 3 (111–129 mph, 178–208 km/h) Category 4 (130–156 mph, 209–251 km/h) Category 5 (≥157 mph, ≥252 km/h) Unknown Storm type Tropical cyclone Subtropical cyclone Extratropical cyclone , remnant low, tropical disturbance, or monsoon depression There is no recorded data of the unnamed cyclone in the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center of the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency . However, Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology has records of the cyclone.

[ 1 ] On 26 April, a tropical low formed in the Banda Sea in the waters of eastern Indonesia . According to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), the low moved to the west-southwest and intensified, although this was based on a later analysis. As the storm was outside of the agency's jurisdiction, the BoM did not issue warnings on the system at the time. The low attained gale-force winds late on 27 April as it moved into the Flores Sea . Late the next day, the storm turned southwestward.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The BoM estimated that the storm reached peak intensity early on 29 April, assessing it as a Category 3 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale , with maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph).

[ 2 ] While near peak intensity, the small tropical cyclone had eye embedded within a central dense overcast , 295 km (185 mi) in diameter.

[ 3 ] The cyclone made landfall on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Flores at 09:00 WITA with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and a pressure of 975 millibars (28.79 inHg).

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] After crossing the island, the cyclone dissipated on 30 April near Flores' southern coast.

[ 2 ] Impacts [ edit ] No warnings were issued as the cyclone was not in Australia's area of responsibility. Additionally, until an eye was visible before the cyclone's landfall in Flores, forecasters were not in confidence that there was a cyclone due to limited observations which gave no indication of its presence.

[ 3 ] O Arbiru [ edit ] O Arbiru was a Portuguese-flagged government cargo vessel that was used to transport necessities to the Portuguese Timor via Bangkok.

[ 5 ] The ship was delivering a rice shipment from Bangkok , Thailand, and was making its way to Dili , Portuguese Timor.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] While in the Flores Sea, the cyclone capsized the coaster .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Of the crew of 24 people, [ 1 ] [ 10 ] only crew member Paulo do Rosário survived.

[ 6 ] They were found safe on Flores .

[ 1 ] Indonesia [ edit ] News of the disaster in Flores took a month to reach authorities in the capital, Jakarta, due to lack of communications and the remoteness of the island.

[ 3 ] [ 11 ] Across the region, the cyclone killed 1,653 people, [ 12 ] making it the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere .

[ 13 ] On Palu'e island alone, the cyclone killed 1,500 people who were mostly fishermen.

[ 12 ] [ 14 ] The storm lashed the coast with a storm surge that broke tens of meters inland, which newspapers described as a "tidal wave".

[ 1 ] [ 11 ] In Ngada Regency , 24 people drowned after being swept away by high waves.

[ 15 ] Another 10 people were killed in Manggarai Regency , [ 11 ] and another 10 in Maumere .

[ 16 ] Reports described Ngada to be the worst hit area.

[ 17 ] For three days, the storm dropped heavy rainfall across Flores, which produced deadly landslides and flash flooding that washed away rice fields, livestock, and entire homes.

[ 18 ] [ 1 ] The cyclone wrecked schools, homes, dams, and bridges. The storm also wrecked government buildings, with heavy damage reported in the regional capital of Ende .

[ 11 ] Around 1,800 houses were leveled with others being badly damaged. Boats that were in the path of the cyclone were destroyed.

[ 1 ] In Paluʼe , around 80% of houses were destroyed.

[ 14 ] At the time, losses were estimated to be at around $5 million ( USD ).

[ 1 ] [ 19 ] The storm was described as apocalyptic and was nicknamed the "Flores Death Cyclone".

[ 1 ] [ 14 ] Kompas had previously written that "This huge sea storm covered the islands of the Sikka region and the coastal areas and mainland of Flores in Sikka Regency, and the people there called it 'doomsday'".

[ 1 ] Aftermath [ edit ] After the floods, the Indonesian government constructed the Sutami Weir, which was finished in 1975. The weir controlled the water flow on the island and helped irrigate 6,500 ha (16,000 acres) of rice paddy fields.
