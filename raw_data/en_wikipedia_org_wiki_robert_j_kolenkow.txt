Kolenkow (born 1933) is an American physicist and teacher.

[ 1 ] He is best known for being the coauthor, along with Daniel Kleppner , of a popular undergraduate physics textbook, An Introduction to Mechanics .

Kolenkow did his undergraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , graduating in 1955.  For a time, he was an associate professor of physics at MIT.  His departure in 1971 generated some controversy on campus; he was regarded as an excellent teacher by his students, however, the administration was viewed as being more concerned about research than education when making its tenure decisions.

Kolenkow became a professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota .  He also co-authored a textbook on physical geography which was favorably reviewed.
