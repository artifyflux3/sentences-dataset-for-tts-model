[ 1 ] [ 2 ] HgCdTe -based detectors are typically preferred for observing in this band.

[ 3 ] Photometric systems used in astronomy are sets of filters or detectors that have well-defined windows of absorption, based around a central peak detection frequency and where the edges of the detection window are typically reported where sensitivity drops below 50% of peak. Various organizations have defined systems with various peak frequencies and cutoffs in the K band, including K ′ , and K S , and K dark .
