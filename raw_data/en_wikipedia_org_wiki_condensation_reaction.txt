[ 1 ] If water is lost, the reaction is also known as a dehydration synthesis . However other molecules can also be lost, such as ammonia , ethanol , acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide .

[ 2 ] The addition of the two molecules typically proceeds in a step-wise fashion to the addition product, usually in equilibrium , and with loss of a water molecule (hence the name condensation ).

[ 3 ] The reaction may otherwise involve the functional groups of the molecule, and is a versatile class of reactions that can occur in acidic or basic conditions or in the presence of a catalyst . This class of reactions is a vital part of life as it is essential to the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids and to the biosynthesis of fatty acids .

Many variations of condensation reactions exist. Common examples include the aldol condensation and the Knoevenagel condensation , which both form water as a by-product, as well as the Claisen condensation and the Dieckman condensation (intramolecular Claisen condensation), which form alcohols as by-products.

[ 5 ] Synthesis of prebiotic molecules [ edit ] Main article: Abiogenesis Condensation reactions likely played major roles in the synthesis of the first biotic molecules including early peptides and nucleic acids . In fact, condensation reactions would be required at multiple steps in RNA oligomerization: the condensation of nucleobases and sugars , nucleoside phosphorylation , and nucleotide polymerization.
