András Hess set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. He printed the first book in Hungary on 5 June 1473 [ 1 ] in his Buda press. Hess was probably of German origin. He dedicated the book, the Chronica Hungarorum or Buda Chronicle ( Hungarian : Budai Krónika ) to László Karai, provost of Buda, who had invited him to Hungary.

[ 1 ] Today a square is named after him in Budapest .
