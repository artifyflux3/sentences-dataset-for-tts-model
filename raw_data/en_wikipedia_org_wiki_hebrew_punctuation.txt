**Hebrew [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation")** is similar to that of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") and other [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") languages, [Modern Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew") having imported additional punctuation marks from these languages in order to avoid the ambiguities sometimes occasioned by the relative lack of such symbols in [Biblical Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew "Biblical Hebrew").

Example | Standard | Alternate |
| --- | --- |
| ”שָׁלוֹם”‎ | „שָׁלוֹם”‎ |
[![Image 1: Old style Hebrew quotation marks, from a 1923 translation of Robinson Crusoe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/OldHebrewQuotationStyle_from1923_translation_of_RobinsonCrusoe.png/500px-OldHebrewQuotationStyle_from1923_translation_of_RobinsonCrusoe.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OldHebrewQuotationStyle_from1923_translation_of_RobinsonCrusoe.png)

Old style Hebrew quotation marks, from a 1923 translation of [Robinson Crusoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe "Robinson Crusoe")

With most printed Hebrew texts from the early 1970s and before, opening quotation marks are low (as in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language")), and closing ones are high, often going above the letters themselves (as opposed to the [gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim"), which is level with the top of letters). An example of this system is „שָׁלוֹם”‎.

However, this distinction in Hebrew between opening and closing quotation marks has mostly disappeared, and today, quotations are most often punctuated as they are in English (such as ”שָׁלוֹם”‎), with both quotation marks high. This is due to the advent of the [Hebrew keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard"), which lacks the opening quotation mark 〈„⟩, as well as to the lack in Hebrew of “[smart quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Curved_quotes_and_Unicode "Quotation mark")” in certain word processing programs.

In addition, the quotation mark is often used for the similar looking but different _[gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim")_ mark ⟨״‎〉, as that too is absent from the [Hebrew keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard").

| Standard | Alternative | Names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ‏ "…" ‏ | ‏ "…" ‏ | _\_merkhaʾot\__ — מֵרְכָאוֹת‎ (plural of _\_merkha\__ — מֵרְכָא‎); a similar punctuation mark unique to Hebrew is called [gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim") — גרשיים‎ |

### Period, question mark, exclamation mark, comma

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_punctuation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Period, question mark, exclamation mark, comma")]

Periods ([full stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stops "Full stops")), [question marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"), [exclamation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark"), and [commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma") are used as in English.

A Hebrew period in a traditional [serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif "Serif") face usually has defined corners (similar to a [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_shapes "Geometric shapes")). This is also true for other [dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_(diacritic) "Dot (diacritic)") in punctuation, such as in the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark") and [exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark").

In [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"), which is also written from right to left, the question mark 〈؟‎〉 is mirrored right-to-left from the Latin question mark. (Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to font or text directionality issues.) [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") is also written right-to-left, but uses a question mark that appears on the page in the same orientation as Latin 〈?〉.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-1) Note that Hebrew commas are _not_ mirrored – although that was proposed in the 19th century (together with mirrored semi-colons, [capital letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_letter "Capital letter"), etc.) by a British minister, William Withers Ewbank.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-3)

### Colon and _\_sof pasuq\__

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_punctuation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Colon and sof pasuq")]

Stemming from Biblical Hebrew, a _\_[sof pasuq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sof\\_pasuq "Sof pasuq")\__ 〈 ׃‎ 〉 is the equivalent of a period, and is used in some writings such as prayer books. Since a _\_sof pasuq\__ is absent from the [Hebrew keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard"), and looks very similar to the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") 〈:〉, a colon is often substituted for it.

### Vertical bar and _paseq_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_punctuation&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Vertical bar and paseq")]

Example | Standard |
| --- |
| אֱלֹהִים׀‎ |
[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Crop_of_Hebrew_manuscript_meant_to_illustrate_Hebrew_punctuation_paseq.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crop_of_Hebrew_manuscript_meant_to_illustrate_Hebrew_punctuation_paseq.jpg)

In the image above, the _paseq_ can be seen on the last occurrence of the word אֱלֹהִים

The _[paseq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paseq "Paseq")_ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): פָּסֵק) 〈׀‎〉 originates from Biblical Hebrew. As it is not on a standard [Hebrew keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard"), a [vertical bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar "Vertical bar") 〈|〉 is often used instead. However, it is seldom if ever used in modern Israeli Hebrew, and is not mentioned on the [Academy of the Hebrew Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_the_Hebrew_Language "Academy of the Hebrew Language")'s guide to modern Hebrew punctuation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:0-4) The height of the _paseq_ depends on the font, but it is generally the same as the letter א‎.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:1-5)

Like much Biblical Hebrew punctuation, the meaning of the _paseq_ is not known, although a number of hypotheses exist. The word itself means "separator", but this name was a medieval innovation by later Jews; the root פּ־ס־ק‎ does not exist in the Biblical Hebrew canon.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:1-5) James Kennedy, an English [hebraist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebraist "Hebraist"), wrote a book about the _paseq_ in which he hypothesized that it was an ancient mark serving the same purpose as the modern word [sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic") (in non-Latin texts).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:1-5) The Westminster [Leningrad Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex "Leningrad Codex") contains over 500 _paseq_ s; William Wickes, an influential scholar in this area, divide them into nine classes;[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-6)[Wilhelm Gesenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Gesenius "Wilhelm Gesenius"), drawing on Wickes, divided them into five:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-7)

*   as a divider between two words which end and begin with the same letters, e.g. שָׁלוֹם׀ מַ‎ (_[Shalom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom "Shalom")_, [ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_and_papa "Mama and papa"))
*   between identical or very similar words, e.g. רַקדָן׀ רָקַד (the dancer danced)
*   between words which are to a high degree contradictory, e.g. אֱלֹהִים׀ רֶשַׁע ([God, evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence "Omnibenevolence"))
*   between words otherwise liable to be wrongly connected, e.g. כַּף׀ תּוֹר, which prevents the somewhat bizarre phrase כַּף (_kaf_, [spoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon "Spoon")) תּוֹר (_tor_, [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_area "Queue area")) from being wrongly read as כַּפְתּוֹר (_kaftor_), meaning [button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button "Button").
*   "and lastly, between heterogeneous terms, as Eleazar the High Priest, and Joshua" (אֶלְעָזָ֣ר הַכֹּהֵ֣ן׀ וִיהוֹשֻׁ֪עַ—see context in [Joshua 19:51](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0619.htm#51))

An example may be found in [Genesis 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1:5&version=wlc) in the Westminster Leningrad Codex and many other manuscripts:

> וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים׀ לָאוֹר֙ י֔וֹם וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד׃ פ‎

Example | Hebrew _\_maqaf\__ | Standard English hyphen |
| --- | --- |
| עַל־יְדֵי‎ | עַל‑יְדֵי‎ |
| The maqaf aligns with the top horizontal strokes, whereas the standard English hyphen is in the middle of the letters. |

The _\_maqaf\__ (מַקָּף‎) 〈־‎〉 is the Hebrew [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") 〈-〉, and has virtually the same purpose for connecting two words as in English. It is different from the hyphen in its positioning (a hyphen is in the middle in terms of height, the _\_maqaf\__ is at the top) and it has a biblical origin,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-8) unlike many other [Modern Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew") punctuation symbols, which have simply been imported from European languages.

The original purpose of the _maqaf_ was to show that two words should be considered one for the purpose of [dagesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagesh "Dagesh") placement, vowels, stress (_ṭaʿam_, טַעַם‎), and [cantillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation "Hebrew cantillation"). This use continues into the present beyond reprintings of Biblical texts;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:0-4) for example, the [sheet music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music "Sheet music") for modern Hebrew songs is normally printed with them.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-9) The _\_maqaf\__ is well-used in Hebrew typography; most books and newspapers use it and have the hyphens higher than one would find in English.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In typed documents, however, it is frequently not used because before the 2010s it was absent from most keyboards or cumbersome to type. As a consequence, the common hyphen 〈-〉 is most often used in online writings. This situation can be compared to that of users writing in Latin alphabets using the easily available [hyphen-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus "Hyphen-minus") 〈-〉 over [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") 〈‐〉, [minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign") 〈−〉, [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash "Dash") 〈–〉, and [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash "Dash") 〈—〉. As of the 2010s, it is possible to insert the _\_maqaf\__ ⟨־⟩ using most common computer and mobile phone operating systems.

### Brackets/parentheses

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_punctuation&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Brackets/parentheses")]

Brackets or parentheses, 〈(〉 and 〈)〉 are the same in Hebrew as in English. Since Hebrew is written from right to left, 〈)〉 becomes an opening bracket, and 〈(〉 a closing bracket, the opposite from English, which is written left to right.

Example | With shekel sign | With abbreviation |
| --- | --- |
| [Israeli new shekel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_sheqel "Israeli new sheqel") |
| ₪12,000‎ | 12,000ש״ח‎ |
| [Israeli pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_pound "Israeli pound") |
| I£12,000‎ | 12,000ל״י‎ |

The [shekel sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel_sign "Shekel sign") (₪‎) is the currency sign for the Israeli currency (the [Israeli new shekel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel "Israeli new shekel")), in the way [$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign "Dollar sign"), [£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sign "Pound sign"), and [€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_sign "Euro sign") exist for other currencies. The shekel sign, like the dollar sign 〈$〉, is usually placed to the left of the number (so _₪12,000‎_, rather than _12,000₪‎_), but since Hebrew is written from right to left, the symbol is actually written after the number. It is either not [separated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)") from the preceding number, or is separated only by a [thin space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space "Thin space").

Unlike the dollar sign, the new shekel sign is not used that often when handwriting monetary amounts, and is generally replaced by the abbreviation ש״ח‎ (standing for _\_sheqel ẖadash\__, lit. "new shekel"). The new shekel sign can be typed on desktop Linux and Windows 8 and higher systems using the combination AltGr-4 according to the SI 1452 standard.

The short-lived [Israeli old shekel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_old_shekel "Israeli old shekel"), on the other hand, which had the symbol [![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Old_Sheqel_sign.svg/20px-Old_Sheqel_sign.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Old_Sheqel_sign.svg),[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-10) is rarely referred to in Israeli texts; both due to its lifespan of only five years and the fact that due to hyperinflation it lost value daily, so that referring to a value in Israeli old shekels, even in retrospective writing, is essentially meaningless without knowing the exact time the figure was quoted.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-11) As prices changed so rapidly, advertising of the time predominately used dollars;[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-12) when the shekel was referred to at all, it was with the letter S or its full Hebrew name—שֶׁקֶל‎; although certain banks, such as [Bank Leumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Leumi "Bank Leumi"), used the letter ש‎ to refer to it on checks, as well as the Latin letters "I.S."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:2-13)

The [Israeli pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_pound "Israeli pound") was the Israeli currency until 1980. Its sign is I£, and its abbreviation is ל״י‎.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-:2-13)

### _Geresh_ and _gershayim_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_punctuation&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Geresh and gershayim")]

Example | [Geresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geresh "Geresh") | [Apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") used as a geresh |
| --- | --- |
| צ׳ארלס‎ | צ'ארלס‎ |
| [Gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim") | [Quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark") used as gershayim |
| צה״ל‎ | צה"ל‎ |

The _[geresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geresh "Geresh")_ 〈׳‎〉, is the Hebrew equivalent of a period in abbreviations (e.g. abbrev.), in addition to being attached to Hebrew letters to indicate sounds like [soft _g_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_G "Hard and soft G")[[dʒ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate "Voiced postalveolar affricate")] and [_ch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch_(digraph) "Ch (digraph)")[[tʃ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate "Voiceless postalveolar affricate")] in foreign names such as Charles ([צ׳ארלס](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A6%27%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%A1 "he:צ'ארלס")‎) and Jake (ג׳ייק‎). The _[gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim")_ 〈״‎〉, is a Hebrew symbol indicating that a sequence of characters is an acronym, and is placed _before_ the last character of the word. Owing to a [Hebrew keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard")'s having neither a _geresh_ nor _gershayim_, they are usually replaced online with, respectively, the visually similar apostrophe 〈'〉 and quotation mark 〈"⟩. The quotation mark and apostrophe are higher than the _geresh_ and _gershayim_: where the latter are placed level with the top of Hebrew letters, the apostrophe and quotation marks are above them.

Some Hebrew-specific [fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font "Font") (fonts designed primarily for Hebrew letters), such as [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_(font)&action=edit&redlink=1 "David (font) (page does not exist)"), [Narkisim](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Narkisim&action=edit&redlink=1 "Narkisim (page does not exist)") and [FrankRuehl](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FrankRuehl&action=edit&redlink=1 "FrankRuehl (page does not exist)"), do not feature the apostrophe and quotation marks as such but use the _geresh_ and _gershayim_ to substitute for them.

Mathematical expressions are written in Hebrew using the same symbols as in English, including [Western numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals"), which are written left to right. The only variant that exists is an [alternative plus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_plus_sign "Alternative plus sign"), which is a plus sign which looks like an inverted [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_letter "Capital letter") T. [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") has this symbol at position U+FB29﬩HEBREW LETTER ALTERNATIVE PLUS SIGN.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-14) The reason for this practice is that it avoids the writing of a symbol "+" that looks like a [Christian cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross "Christian cross").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-JE2-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-University_of_California-16)

**Examples of mathematical expressions written in Hebrew**
_General example_ _With alternative plus sign_
6 + [(1 × 2) ÷ 2] = 7 6 ﬩ [(1 × 2) ÷ 2] = 7
Mathematical expressions in Hebrew are nearly the same as in English.

[Reversed _nun_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversed_Nun "Reversed Nun") (also called inverted _nun_, _nun hafukha_, or _nun menuzzeret_) is a rare character found in two Biblical Hebrew texts.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17) Although in Judaic literature it is known as _nun hafukha_ ("reversed _[nun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun\_(letter) "Nun (letter)")_"), it does not function as any sort of letter in the text.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17) It is not part of a word, and it is not read aloud in any way. It is simply a mark that is written, and is therefore a punctuation mark, not a letter. Also, it is surrounded by space.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17)

While it depends on the particular manuscript or printed edition, it is found in nine places: twice in the [Book of Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers") (prior to and after Numbers 10:34-36), and seven times in [Psalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm "Psalm") 107.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17) It is uncertain today what it was intended to signify.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17)

In many manuscripts, it does not even resemble a transformed _nun_ at all, and when it does, it sometimes appears reversed (as mentioned above), sometimes inverted, and sometimes turned through 180°.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17) Other times it appears to look like the letter Z.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_punctuation#cite_note-IOS-17)

These signs (points, _\_[neqqudot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud "Niqqud")\__) indicate voweling or some other aspects of the pronunciation of a letter or word. While in Modern Hebrew they are not generally used outside poetry and children's books, a vowel point or other diacritic is occasionally added to resolve ambiguity.

One of these _\_neqqudot\__, the _\_[rafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafe "Rafe")\__, is no longer used in Hebrew, even though it is routinely used in Yiddish spelling (as defined by [YIVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIVO "YIVO")).

בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃ וְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם וְר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם׃ וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר וַֽיְהִי־אֽוֹר׃ וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב וַיַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים בֵּ֥ין הָא֖וֹר וּבֵ֥ין הַחֹֽשֶׁךְ׃ וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים׀ לָאוֹר֙ י֔וֹם וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד׃‎
_Just Cantillation Marks

(For Demonstration)_
בראש֖ית בר֣א אלה֑ים א֥ת השמ֖ים וא֥ת האֽרץ׃ והא֗רץ הית֥ה ת֙הו֙ וב֔הו וח֖שך על־פנ֣י תה֑ום ור֣וח אלה֔ים מרח֖פת על־פנ֥י המֽים׃ וי֥אמר אלה֖ים יה֣י א֑ור וֽיהי־אֽור׃ וי֧רא אלה֛ים את־הא֖ור כי־ט֑וב ויבד֣ל אלה֔ים ב֥ין הא֖ור וב֥ין החֽשך׃ ויקר֨א אלה֤ים׀ לאור֙ י֔ום ולח֖שך ק֣רא ל֑ילה וֽיהי־ע֥רב וֽיהי־ב֖קר י֥ום אחֽד׃‎
_No Cantillation or Vowel Points_
[בראשית](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA "בראשית") ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ׃ והארץ היתה תהו ובהו וחשך על־פני תהום ורוח אלהים מרחפת על־פני המים׃ ויאמר אלהים יהי אור ויהי־אור׃ וירא אלהים את־האור כי־טוב ויבדל אלהים בין האור ובין החשך׃ ויקרא אלהים׀ לאור יום ולחשך קרא לילה ויהי־ערב ויהי־בקר יום אחד׃‎

The cantillation marks ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): טעמים _\_teʿamim\__) have a very specialized use. They are only found in printed Hebrew texts of [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh "Tanakh") to be used as a guide for chanting the text, either from the printed text or, in the case of the public reading of the [Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah "Torah"), to be memorized along with vowel marks as the [Sefer Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Torah "Sefer Torah") includes only the letters of the text without cantillation or vowel marks. Outside the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh "Tanakh"), the cantillation marks are not used in modern spoken or written Hebrew at all. The cantillation marks provide a structure to sentences of Tanakh similar to that provided by punctuation marks.
