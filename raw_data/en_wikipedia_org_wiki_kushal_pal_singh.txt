[ 6 ] [ 7 ] His autobiography, named Whatever the Odds: The Incredible Story Behind DLF , was published in 2011; Jack Welch spoke at the launch.

[ 8 ] Singh has been noted for making Gurgaon , Haryana , from a village into a modern and developed city.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Singh has also been noted for his relationship with the Nehru-Gandhi political family , which, according to him, benefited his businesses especially during its early stages, and has also been a source of controversy during his career.

[ 9 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In October 2024, Singh was ranked 12th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest, with a net worth of $20.5 billion.

[ 13 ] Early life and military career [ edit ] Kushal Pal Singh was born on 15 August 1931 in Bulandshahr , United Provinces , British India .

[ 14 ] His father, Chaudhary Mukhtar Singh, was a reputed lawyer in Bulandshahr. After graduating in science from Meerut College , Uttar Pradesh , he pursued aeronautical engineering in London , England.

[ 15 ] Singh's uncle was in charge of the stables at the then-Viceregal Lodge, which is now Rashtrapati Bhavan , and during Singh's visit to his uncle, he unexpectedly met the then- Viceroy of India , Lord Wavell , who suggested he pursue riding .

[ 16 ] His father then sent him to England, hiding from Singh that he incurred financial debt to get him there.

[ 16 ] The riding skills Singh learned at the Viceregal Lodge enabled him to interact with British high society and also led to a romantic relationship with a British woman named Julie.

[ 16 ] While playing polo in near Windsor, Singh met an officer of the Indian Army who attempted to convince him to join a cavalry unit in the army.

[ 16 ] According to Singh, he was torn between settling in London with Julie or pursue a military career in India; however, after being allowed to take the Indian Military Academy entrance exam in England, and later the Indian government agreeing to pay for his journey back to India, Singh decided to join the army.

[ 16 ] He was later commissioned into the Deccan Horse regiment .

[ 4 ] He also started a battery company; however, the venture was unsuccessful and the losses from sustained from it caused Singh's creditors to take him to court.

[ 4 ] In 1960, Singh joined American Universal Electric Company and, after its merger with DLF Universal Limited (DLF) in 1979, he took over as the managing director with Chaudhary Raghuvender Singh.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] However, in 1975, Singh almost sold his shares in DLF for 25 lakhs after a decision made by his father-in-law Chaudhary Raghvendra and apathy regarding the real estate sector due to bureaucratic red tape , but Singh at the last minute declined to do the transaction, keeping his shares.

[ 20 ] In 1976, the Government of India introduced the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (ULCRA) to grow low-income housing and set limits for the ownership of vacant urban land .

[ 17 ] The law received a backlash from people who had already invested in the urban land, including Singh, who took over a dormant DLF to attempt to secure exemptions for investors while studying the city’s limitations.

[ 17 ] He identified the Old-Gurgaon Road as a key link between Delhi 's southern area and Haryana , that had not passed the ULCRA.

[ 17 ] DLF used the relaxed land acquisition laws as Singh revitalized the company, starting with its 30 acres and rapidly acquiring land from local landowners and farmers.

[ 11 ] Singh met Rajiv and spoke about business plans for Gurgaon and how certain laws were hindering his acquisition of land in the state.

[ 11 ] Singh later had meetings with Rajiv, and Rajiv convinced his mother, then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi , to change the Haryana land laws.

[ 11 ] DLF then received a license to develop land in 1981 and in 1983, the company received another license.

[ 11 ] During the early growth of DLF in the 1980s, Singh had a dispute with Bansi Lal , a senior politician who had also served as the Chief Minister of Haryana .

[ 21 ] Lal attempted to ruin Singh's business and even have him arrested, which led to Singh going into hiding on the advice then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Lal also managed to persuade other Haryana politicians to go against Singh.

[ 22 ] However, Singh's friendship with Rajiv Gandhi eventually led to Lal stopping his attacks on Singh due to pressure from Rajiv Gandhi.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Established DLF [ edit ] By the 1990s, several large foreign companies, including American Express , British Airways , IBM , and Nestle became tenants of DLF properties due to the growth in outsourcing.

[ 10 ] In 1995, Singh become chairmen of the company.

[ 23 ] Singh constructed numerous earthquake-proof office buildings, apartments, shopping malls and leisure facilities in Gurgaon.

[ 10 ] While he was the chairman of DLF, the company went for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2007 and made approximately US$2.24 billion, one of the largest IPOs in Indian history.

[ 10 ] Market capitalization of the company in 2007 increased to $24.5 billion, making Singh and his family one of the richest clans in the world.

[ 36 ] In 2011, DLF's real estate deal with businessman Robert Vadra , the husband of Priyanka Gandhi and son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi , caused controversy for Singh, who was accused of corruption by then- political activist Arvind Kejriwal , who later became the Chief Minister of Delhi .

[ 12 ] Kejriwal accused Singh of doing a real estate transaction which heavily favored Vadra in return for political favors.
