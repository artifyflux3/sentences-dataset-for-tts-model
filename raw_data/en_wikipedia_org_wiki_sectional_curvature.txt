The sectional curvature K ( σ p ) depends on a two-dimensional linear subspace σ p of the tangent space at a point p of the manifold. It can be defined geometrically as the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane σ p as a tangent plane at p , obtained from geodesics which start at p in the directions of σ p (in other words, the image of σ p under the exponential map at p ). The sectional curvature is a real-valued function on the 2- Grassmannian bundle over the manifold.

The sectional curvature determines the Riemann curvature tensor completely.

Definition [ edit ] Given a Riemannian manifold and two linearly independent tangent vectors at the same point, u and v , we can define K ( u , v ) = ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ u , u ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ v , v ⟩ ⟩ − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 {\displaystyle K(u,v)={\langle R(u,v)v,u\rangle  \over \langle u,u\rangle \langle v,v\rangle -\langle u,v\rangle ^{2}}} Here R is the Riemann curvature tensor , defined here by the convention ⁠ R ( u , v ) w = ∇ ∇ u ∇ ∇ v w − − ∇ ∇ v ∇ ∇ u w − − ∇ ∇ [ u , v ] w {\displaystyle R(u,v)w=\nabla _{u}\nabla _{v}w-\nabla _{v}\nabla _{u}w-\nabla _{[u,v]}w} ⁠ . Some sources use the opposite convention ⁠ R ( u , v ) w = ∇ ∇ v ∇ ∇ u w − − ∇ ∇ u ∇ ∇ v w − − ∇ ∇ [ v , u ] w {\displaystyle R(u,v)w=\nabla _{v}\nabla _{u}w-\nabla _{u}\nabla _{v}w-\nabla _{[v,u]}w} ⁠ , in which case K ( u , v ) must be defined with ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) u , v ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)u,v\rangle } in the numerator instead of ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)v,u\rangle .} [ 1 ] Note that the linear independence of u and v forces the denominator in the above expression to be nonzero, so that K ( u , v ) is well-defined. In particular, if u and v are orthonormal , then the definition takes on the simple form K ( u , v ) = ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle K(u,v)=\langle R(u,v)v,u\rangle .} It is straightforward to check that if u , v ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle u,v\in T_{p}M} are linearly independent and span the same two-dimensional linear subspace of the tangent space T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} as ⁠ x , y ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle x,y\in T_{p}M} ⁠ , then ⁠ K ( u , v ) = K ( x , y ) {\displaystyle K(u,v)=K(x,y)} ⁠ . So one may consider the sectional curvature as a real-valued function whose input is a two-dimensional linear subspace of a tangent space.

Alternative definitions [ edit ] Alternatively, the sectional curvature can be characterized by the circumference of small circles. Let P {\displaystyle P} be a two-dimensional plane in ⁠ T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} ⁠ . Let C P ( r ) {\displaystyle C_{P}(r)} for sufficiently small r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} denote the image under the exponential map at p {\displaystyle p} of the unit circle in ⁠ P {\displaystyle P} ⁠ , and let l P ( r ) {\displaystyle l_{P}(r)} denote the length of ⁠ C P ( r ) {\displaystyle C_{P}(r)} ⁠ . Then it can be proven that l P ( r ) = 2 π π r ( 1 − − r 2 6 σ σ ( P ) + O ( r 3 ) ) , {\displaystyle l_{P}(r)=2\pi r\left(1-{r^{2} \over 6}\sigma (P)+O(r^{3})\right),} as ⁠ r → → 0 {\displaystyle r\to 0} ⁠ , for some number ⁠ σ σ ( P ) {\displaystyle \sigma (P)} ⁠ . This number σ σ ( P ) {\displaystyle \sigma (P)} at p {\displaystyle p} is the sectional curvature of P {\displaystyle P} at ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ .

[ 2 ] Manifolds with constant sectional curvature [ edit ] One says that a Riemannian manifold has "constant curvature ⁠ κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } ⁠ " if sec ⁡ ⁡ ( P ) = κ κ {\displaystyle \operatorname {sec} (P)=\kappa } for all two-dimensional linear subspaces P ⊂ ⊂ T p M {\displaystyle P\subset T_{p}M} and for all ⁠ p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} ⁠ .

The Schur lemma states that if ( M , g ) is a connected Riemannian manifold with dimension at least three, and if there is a function f : M → → R {\displaystyle f:M\to \mathbb {R} } such that sec ⁡ ⁡ ( P ) = f ( p ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {sec} (P)=f(p)} for all two-dimensional linear subspaces P ⊂ ⊂ T p M {\displaystyle P\subset T_{p}M} and for all ⁠ p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} ⁠ , then f must be constant and hence ( M , g ) has constant curvature.

A Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature is called a space form . If κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } denotes the constant value of the sectional curvature, then the curvature tensor can be written as R ( u , v ) w = κ κ ( ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ v ) {\displaystyle R(u,v)w=\kappa {\big (}\langle v,w\rangle u-\langle u,w\rangle v{\big )}} for any ⁠ u , v , w ∈ ∈ T p M {\displaystyle u,v,w\in T_{p}M} ⁠ .

Proof Briefly: one polarization argument gives a formula for R ( u , v ) v , {\displaystyle R(u,v)v,} a second (equivalent) polarization argument gives a formula for R ( u , v ) w + R ( u , w ) v , {\displaystyle R(u,v)w+R(u,w)v,} and a combination with the first Bianchi identity recovers the given formula for R ( u , v ) w .

{\displaystyle R(u,v)w.} From the definition of sectional curvature, we know that ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ = κ κ ( | u | 2 | v | 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 ) {\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)v,u\rangle =\kappa \left(|u|^{2}|v|^{2}-\langle u,v\rangle ^{2}\right)} whenever u , v {\displaystyle u,v} are linearly independent, and this easily extends to the case that u , v {\displaystyle u,v} are linearly dependent since both sides are then zero. Now, given arbitrary u,v,w, compute ⟨ ⟨ R ( u + w , v ) v , u + w ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle R(u+w,v)v,u+w\rangle } in two ways. First, according to the above formula, it equals κ κ ( | v | 2 ( | u | 2 + | w | 2 + 2 ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ ) − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ w , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 − − 2 ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ w , v ⟩ ⟩ ) .

{\displaystyle \kappa \left(|v|^{2}\left(|u|^{2}+|w|^{2}+2\langle u,w\rangle \right)-\langle u,v\rangle ^{2}-\langle w,v\rangle ^{2}-2\langle u,v\rangle \langle w,v\rangle \right).} Secondly, by multilinearity, it equals ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ + ⟨ ⟨ R ( w , v ) v , w ⟩ ⟩ + ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , w ⟩ ⟩ + ⟨ ⟨ R ( w , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)v,u\rangle +\langle R(w,v)v,w\rangle +\langle R(u,v)v,w\rangle +\langle R(w,v)v,u\rangle ,} which, recalling the Riemannian symmetry ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , w ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ R ( w , v ) v , u ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)v,w\rangle =\langle R(w,v)v,u\rangle ,} can be simplified to κ κ ( | u | 2 | v | 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 ) + κ κ ( | w | 2 | v | 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ w , v ⟩ ⟩ 2 ) + 2 ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , w ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \kappa {\Big (}|u|^{2}|v|^{2}-\langle u,v\rangle ^{2}{\Big )}+\kappa {\Big (}|w|^{2}|v|^{2}-\langle w,v\rangle ^{2}{\Big )}+2\langle R(u,v)v,w\rangle .} Setting these two computations equal to each other and canceling terms, one finds ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) v , w ⟩ ⟩ = κ κ ( | v | 2 ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ ⟨ ⟨ w , v ⟩ ⟩ ) .

{\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)v,w\rangle =\kappa {\Big (}|v|^{2}\langle u,w\rangle -\langle u,v\rangle \langle w,v\rangle {\Big )}.} Since w is arbitrary this shows that R ( u , v ) v = κ κ ( | v | 2 u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ v ) {\displaystyle R(u,v)v=\kappa {\Big (}|v|^{2}u-\langle u,v\rangle v{\Big )}} for any u,v.

Now let u,v,w be arbitrary and compute R ( u , v + w ) ( v + w ) {\displaystyle R(u,v+w)(v+w)} in two ways. Firstly, by this new formula, it equals κ κ ( ( | v | 2 + | w | 2 + 2 ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ ) u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ v − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ v − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ w − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ w ) .

{\displaystyle \kappa \left(\left(|v|^{2}+|w|^{2}+2\langle v,w\rangle \right)u-\langle u,v\rangle v-\langle u,w\rangle v-\langle u,v\rangle w-\langle u,w\rangle w\right).} Secondly, by multilinearity, it equals R ( u , v ) v + R ( u , w ) w + R ( u , v ) w + R ( u , w ) v {\displaystyle R(u,v)v+R(u,w)w+R(u,v)w+R(u,w)v} which by the new formula equals κ κ ( | v | 2 u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ v ) + κ κ ( | w | 2 u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ w ) + R ( u , v ) w + R ( u , w ) v .

{\displaystyle \kappa \left(|v|^{2}u-\langle u,v\rangle v\right)+\kappa \left(|w|^{2}u-\langle u,w\rangle w\right)+R(u,v)w+R(u,w)v.} Setting these two computations equal to each other shows R ( u , v ) w + R ( u , w ) v = κ κ ( 2 ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ v − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ w ) .

{\displaystyle R(u,v)w+R(u,w)v=\kappa \left(2\langle v,w\rangle u-\langle u,w\rangle v-\langle u,v\rangle w\right).} Swap u {\displaystyle u} and v {\displaystyle v} , then add this to the Bianchi identity R ( v , u ) w + R ( u , w ) v + R ( w , v ) u = 0 {\displaystyle R(v,u)w+R(u,w)v+R(w,v)u=0} to get 2 R ( v , u ) w + R ( u , w ) v = κ κ ( 2 ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ v − − ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ w ) .

{\displaystyle 2R(v,u)w+R(u,w)v=\kappa \left(2\langle u,w\rangle v-\langle v,w\rangle u-\langle u,v\rangle w\right).} Subtract these two equations, making use of the symmetry R ( u , v ) w = − − R ( v , u ) w , {\displaystyle R(u,v)w=-R(v,u)w,} to get 3 R ( u , v ) w = 3 κ κ ( ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ u − − ⟨ ⟨ u , w ⟩ ⟩ v ) .

{\displaystyle 3R(u,v)w=3\kappa \left(\langle v,w\rangle u-\langle u,w\rangle v\right).} Since any Riemannian metric is parallel with respect to its Levi-Civita connection, this shows that the Riemann tensor of any constant-curvature space is also parallel. The Ricci tensor is then given by Ric = ( n − − 1 ) κ κ g {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ric} =(n-1)\kappa g} and the scalar curvature is n ( n − − 1 ) κ κ .

{\displaystyle n(n-1)\kappa .} In particular, any constant-curvature space is Einstein and has constant scalar curvature.

Model examples [ edit ] Given a positive number a , {\displaystyle a,} define ( R n , g R n ) {\displaystyle \left(\mathbb {R} ^{n},g_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\right)} to be the standard Riemannian structure ( S n ( a ) , g S n ( a ) ) {\displaystyle \left(S^{n}(a),g_{S^{n}(a)}\right)} to be the sphere S n ( a ) ≡ ≡ { x ∈ ∈ R n + 1 : | x | = a } {\displaystyle S^{n}(a)\equiv \left\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}:|x|=a\right\}} with g S n ( a ) {\displaystyle g_{S^{n}(a)}} given by the pullback of the standard Riemannian structure on R n + 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} by the inclusion map S n ( a ) → → R n + 1 {\displaystyle S^{n}(a)\to \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} ( H n ( a ) , g H n ( a ) ) {\displaystyle \left(H^{n}(a),g_{H^{n}(a)}\right)} to be the ball H n ( a ) ≡ ≡ { x ∈ ∈ R n : | x | < a } {\displaystyle H^{n}(a)\equiv \left\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:|x|<a\right\}} with g H n ( a ) = a 2 ( a 2 − − | x | 2 ) ( d x 1 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + d x n 2 ) − − ( x 1 d x 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + x n d x n ) 2 ( a 2 − − | x | 2 ) 2 .

{\displaystyle g_{H^{n}(a)}=a^{2}{\frac {{\bigl (}a^{2}-|x|{}^{2}{\bigr )}\left(dx_{1}^{2}+\cdots +dx_{n}^{2}\right)-\left(x_{1}dx_{1}+\cdots +x_{n}dx_{n}\right)^{2}}{{\bigl (}a^{2}-|x|{}^{2}{\bigr )}^{2}}}.} In the usual terminology, these Riemannian manifolds are referred to as Euclidean space , the n -sphere , and hyperbolic space . Here, the point is that each is a complete connected smooth Riemannian manifold with constant curvature. To be precise, the Riemannian metric g R n {\displaystyle g_{\mathbb {R} ^{n}}} has constant curvature 0, the Riemannian metric g S n ( a ) {\displaystyle g_{S^{n}(a)}} has constant curvature ⁠ 1 / a 2 {\displaystyle 1/a^{2}} ⁠ , and the Riemannian metric g H n ( a ) {\displaystyle g_{H^{n}(a)}} has constant curvature ⁠ − − 1 / a 2 {\displaystyle -1/a^{2}} ⁠ .

Furthermore, these are the 'universal' examples in the sense that if ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} is a smooth, connected, and simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold with constant curvature, then it is isometric to one of the above examples; the particular example is dictated by the value of the constant curvature of g , {\displaystyle g,} according to the constant curvatures of the above examples.

If ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} is a smooth and connected complete Riemannian manifold with constant curvature, but is not assumed to be simply-connected, then consider the universal covering space π π : M ~ ~ → → M {\displaystyle \pi :{\widetilde {M}}\to M} with the pullback Riemannian metric ⁠ π π ∗ ∗ g {\displaystyle \pi ^{\ast }g} ⁠ . Since π π {\displaystyle \pi } is, by topological principles, a covering map, the Riemannian manifold ( M ~ ~ , π π ∗ ∗ g ) {\displaystyle ({\widetilde {M}},\pi ^{\ast }g)} is locally isometric to ⁠ ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} ⁠ , and so it is a smooth, connected, and simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold with the same constant curvature as ⁠ g {\displaystyle g} ⁠ . It must then be isometric one of the above model examples. Note that the deck transformations of the universal cover are isometries relative to the metric ⁠ π π ∗ ∗ g {\displaystyle \pi ^{\ast }g} ⁠ .

The study of Riemannian manifolds with constant negative curvature is called hyperbolic geometry .

Scaling [ edit ] Let ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} be a smooth manifold, and let λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } be a positive number. Consider the Riemannian manifold ⁠ ( M , λ λ g ) {\displaystyle (M,\lambda g)} ⁠ . The curvature tensor, as a multilinear map T p M × × T p M × × T p M → → T p M , {\displaystyle T_{p}M\times T_{p}M\times T_{p}M\to T_{p}M,} is unchanged by this modification. Let v , w {\displaystyle v,w} be linearly independent vectors in ⁠ T p M {\displaystyle T_{p}M} ⁠ . Then K λ λ g ( v , w ) = λ λ g ( R λ λ g ( v , w ) w , v ) | v | λ λ g 2 | w | λ λ g 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ | λ λ g 2 = 1 λ λ g ( R g ( v , w ) w , v ) | v | g 2 | w | g 2 − − ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ | g 2 = 1 λ λ K g ( v , w ) .

{\displaystyle K_{\lambda g}(v,w)={\frac {\lambda g\left(R^{\lambda g}(v,w)w,v\right)}{|v|_{\lambda g}^{2}|w|_{\lambda g}^{2}-\langle v,w\rangle {\vphantom {|}}_{\lambda g}^{2}}}={\frac {1}{\lambda }}{\frac {g\left(R^{g}(v,w)w,v\right)}{|v|_{g}^{2}|w|_{g}^{2}-\langle v,w\rangle {\vphantom {|}}_{g}^{2}}}={\frac {1}{\lambda }}K_{g}(v,w).} So multiplication of the metric by λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } multiplies all of the sectional curvatures by ⁠ λ λ − − 1 {\displaystyle \lambda ^{-1}} ⁠ .

Toponogov's theorem [ edit ] Toponogov's theorem affords a characterization of sectional curvature in terms of how "fat" geodesic triangles appear when compared to their Euclidean counterparts.  The basic intuition is that, if a space is positively curved, then the edge of a triangle opposite some given vertex will tend to bend away from that vertex, whereas if a space is negatively curved, then the opposite edge of the triangle will tend to bend towards the vertex.

More precisely, let M be a complete Riemannian manifold, and let xyz be a geodesic triangle in M (a triangle each of whose sides is a length-minimizing geodesic).  Finally, let m be the midpoint of the geodesic xy .  If M has non-negative curvature, then for all sufficiently small triangles d ( z , m ) 2 ≥ ≥ 1 2 d ( z , x ) 2 + 1 2 d ( z , y ) 2 − − 1 4 d ( x , y ) 2 {\displaystyle d(z,m)^{2}\geq {\tfrac {1}{2}}d(z,x)^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}d(z,y)^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{4}}d(x,y)^{2}} where d is the distance function on M .  The case of equality holds precisely when the curvature of M vanishes, and the right-hand side represents the distance from a vertex to the opposite side of a geodesic triangle in Euclidean space having the same side-lengths as the triangle xyz .  This makes precise the sense in which triangles are "fatter" in positively curved spaces.  In non-positively curved spaces, the inequality goes the other way: d ( z , m ) 2 ≤ ≤ 1 2 d ( z , x ) 2 + 1 2 d ( z , y ) 2 − − 1 4 d ( x , y ) 2 .

{\displaystyle d(z,m)^{2}\leq {\tfrac {1}{2}}d(z,x)^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}d(z,y)^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{4}}d(x,y)^{2}.} If tighter bounds on the sectional curvature are known, then this property generalizes to give a comparison theorem between geodesic triangles in M and those in a suitable simply connected space form; see Toponogov's theorem .  Simple consequences of the version stated here are: A complete Riemannian manifold has non-negative sectional curvature if and only if the function f p ( x ) = dist 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( p , x ) {\displaystyle f_{p}(x)=\operatorname {dist} ^{2}(p,x)} is 1- concave for all points p .

A complete simply connected Riemannian manifold has non-positive sectional curvature if and only if the function f p ( x ) = dist 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( p , x ) {\displaystyle f_{p}(x)=\operatorname {dist} ^{2}(p,x)} is 1- convex .

Manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature [ edit ] In 1928, Élie Cartan proved the Cartan–Hadamard theorem : if M is a complete manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, then its universal cover is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space . In particular, it is aspherical : the homotopy groups π π i ( M ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i}(M)} for i ≥ 2 are trivial.  Therefore, the topological structure of a complete non-positively curved manifold is determined by its fundamental group .

Preissman's theorem restricts the fundamental group of negatively curved compact manifolds. The Cartan–Hadamard conjecture states that the classical isoperimetric inequality should hold in all simply connected spaces of non-positive curvature, which are called Cartan–Hadamard manifolds .

Manifolds with positive sectional curvature [ edit ] Little is known about the structure of positively curved manifolds. The soul theorem ( Cheeger & Gromoll 1972 ; Gromoll & Meyer 1969 ) implies that a complete non-compact non-negatively curved manifold is diffeomorphic to a normal bundle over a compact non-negatively curved manifold. As for compact positively curved manifolds, there are two classical results: It follows from the Myers theorem that the fundamental group of such a manifold is finite.

It follows from the Synge theorem that the fundamental group of such a manifold in even dimensions is 0, if orientable and Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} otherwise. In odd dimensions a positively curved manifold is always orientable.

Moreover, there are relatively few examples of compact positively curved manifolds, leaving a lot of conjectures (e.g., the Hopf conjecture on whether there is a metric of positive sectional curvature on ⁠ S 2 × × S 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{2}\times \mathbb {S} ^{2}} ⁠ ). The most typical way of constructing new examples is the following corollary from the O'Neill curvature formulas: if ( M , g ) {\displaystyle (M,g)} is a Riemannian manifold admitting a free isometric action of a Lie group G, and M has positive sectional curvature on all 2-planes orthogonal to the orbits of G, then the manifold M / G {\displaystyle M/G} with the quotient metric has positive sectional curvature. This fact allows one to construct the classical positively curved spaces, being spheres and projective spaces, as well as these examples ( Ziller 2007 ): The Berger spaces B 7 = SO ⁡ ⁡ ( 5 ) / SO ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) {\displaystyle B^{7}=\operatorname {SO} (5)/\operatorname {SO} (3)} and ⁠ B 13 = SU ⁡ ⁡ ( 5 ) / Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 ) ⋅ ⋅ S 1 {\displaystyle B^{13}=\operatorname {SU} (5)/\operatorname {Sp} (2)\cdot \mathbb {S} ^{1}} ⁠ .

The Wallach spaces (or the homogeneous flag manifolds): W 6 = SU ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) / T 2 {\displaystyle W^{6}=\operatorname {SU} (3)/T^{2}} , W 12 = Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) / Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 ) 3 {\displaystyle W^{12}=\operatorname {Sp} (3)/\operatorname {Sp} (1)^{3}} and W 24 = F 4 / Spin ⁡ ⁡ ( 8 ) {\displaystyle W^{24}=F_{4}/\operatorname {Spin} (8)} .

The Aloff–Wallach spaces W p , q 7 = SU ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) / diag ⁡ ⁡ ( z p , z q , z ¯ ¯ p + q ) {\displaystyle W_{p,q}^{7}=\operatorname {SU} (3)/\operatorname {diag} \left(z^{p},z^{q},{\overline {z}}^{p+q}\right)} .

The Eschenburg spaces E k , l = diag ⁡ ⁡ ( z k 1 , z k 2 , z k 3 ) ∖ ∖ SU ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) / diag ⁡ ⁡ ( z l 1 , z l 2 , z l 3 ) − − 1 .

{\displaystyle E_{k,l}=\operatorname {diag} \left(z^{k_{1}},z^{k_{2}},z^{k_{3}}\right)\backslash \operatorname {SU} (3)/\operatorname {diag} \left(z^{l_{1}},z^{l_{2}},z^{l_{3}}\right)^{-1}.} The Bazaikin spaces B p 13 = diag ⁡ ⁡ ( z 1 p 1 , … … , z 1 p 5 ) ∖ ∖ U ⁡ ⁡ ( 5 ) / diag ⁡ ⁡ ( z 2 A , 1 ) − − 1 {\displaystyle B_{p}^{13}=\operatorname {diag} \left(z_{1}^{p_{1}},\dots ,z_{1}^{p_{5}}\right)\backslash \operatorname {U} (5)/\operatorname {diag} (z_{2}A,1)^{-1}} , where A ∈ ∈ Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 ) ⊂ ⊂ SU ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 ) {\displaystyle A\in \operatorname {Sp} (2)\subset \operatorname {SU} (4)} .

Manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature [ edit ] Cheeger and Gromoll proved their soul theorem which states that any non-negatively curved complete non-compact manifold M {\displaystyle M} has a totally convex compact submanifold S {\displaystyle S} such that M {\displaystyle M} is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of ⁠ S {\displaystyle S} ⁠ . Such an S {\displaystyle S} is called the soul of ⁠ M {\displaystyle M} ⁠ . In particular, this theorem implies that M {\displaystyle M} is homotopic to its soul S {\displaystyle S} which has the dimension less than M {\displaystyle M} .
