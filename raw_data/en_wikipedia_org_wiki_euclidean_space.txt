A point in three-dimensional Euclidean space can be located by three coordinates.

**Euclidean space** is the fundamental space of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), intended to represent [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space"). Originally, in [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), it was the [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), but in modern [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") there are _Euclidean spaces_ of any positive integer [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics) "Dimension (mathematics)")_n_, which are called **Euclidean _n_-spaces** when one wants to specify their dimension.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolomentsev2001-1) For _n_ equal to one or two, they are commonly called respectively [Euclidean lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_line "Euclidean line") and [Euclidean planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"). The qualifier "Euclidean" is used to distinguish Euclidean spaces from other [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") that were later considered in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and modern mathematics.

Ancient [Greek geometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geometry#Greek_geometry "History of geometry") introduced Euclidean space for modeling the physical space. Their work was collected by the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics") mathematician [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") in his _Elements_,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBall196050%E2%80%9362-2) with the great innovation of _[proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_proof "Mathematical proof")_ all properties of the space as [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), by starting from a few fundamental properties, called _[postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate")_, which either were considered as evident (for example, there is exactly one [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") passing through two points), or seemed impossible to prove ([parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")).

After the introduction at the end of the 19th century of [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometries"), the old postulates were re-formalized to define Euclidean spaces through [axiomatic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_theory "Axiomatic theory"). Another definition of Euclidean spaces by means of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") has been shown to be equivalent to the axiomatic definition. It is this definition that is more commonly used in modern mathematics, and detailed in this article.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987-3) In all definitions, Euclidean spaces consist of points, which are defined only by the properties that they must have for forming a Euclidean space.

There is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension; that is, all Euclidean spaces of a given dimension are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism"). Therefore, it is usually possible to work with a specific Euclidean space, denoted ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/211e93d9fef6b12298e44e6237782f55c0be25e3) or ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e8fa8586d428ff5706c6d0a00a7939950fad89b), which can be represented using [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") as the [real n-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_n-space "Real n-space")![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) equipped with the standard [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product").

### History of the definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History of the definition")]

Euclidean space was introduced by [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics") as an abstraction of our physical space. Their great innovation, appearing in [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") was to build and _[prove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof\_(mathematics) "Proof (mathematics)")_ all geometry by starting from a few very basic properties, which are abstracted from the physical world, and cannot be mathematically proved because of the lack of more basic tools. These properties are called [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate"), or [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") in modern language. This way of defining Euclidean space is still in use under the name of [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry").

In 1637, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") introduced [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"), and showed that these allow reducing geometric problems to algebraic computations with numbers. This reduction of geometry to [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") was a major change in point of view, as, until then, the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") were defined in terms of lengths and distances.

Euclidean geometry was not applied in spaces of dimension more than three until the 19th century. [Ludwig Schläfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli "Ludwig Schläfli") generalized Euclidean geometry to spaces of dimension n, using both synthetic and algebraic methods, and discovered all of the regular [polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope") (higher-dimensional analogues of the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid")) that exist in Euclidean spaces of any dimension.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoxeter1973-4)

Despite the wide use of Descartes' approach, which was called [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), the definition of Euclidean space remained unchanged until the end of 19th century. The introduction of abstract [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") allowed their use in defining Euclidean spaces with a purely algebraic definition. This new definition has been shown to be equivalent to the classical definition in terms of geometric axioms. It is this algebraic definition that is now most often used for introducing Euclidean spaces.

### Motivation of the modern definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Motivation of the modern definition")]

One way to think of the Euclidean plane is as a [set of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_set "Point set") satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angles. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)")) on the plane. One is [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") around a fixed point in the plane, in which all points in the plane turn around that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two [figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_(geometry) "Figure (geometry)") (usually considered as [subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset")) of the plane should be considered equivalent ([congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)")) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Euclidean_group)).

In order to make all of this mathematically precise, the theory must clearly define what is a Euclidean space, and the related notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation. Even when used in [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") theories, Euclidean space is an [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction "Abstraction") detached from actual physical locations, specific [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference"), measurement instruments, and so on. A purely mathematical definition of Euclidean space also ignores questions of [units of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_length "Unit of length") and other [physical dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis"): the distance in a "mathematical" space is a [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), not something expressed in inches or metres.

The standard way to mathematically define a Euclidean space, as carried out in the remainder of this article, is as a set of points on which a [real vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_vector_space "Real vector space")[acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") – the _space of translations_ which is equipped with an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolomentsev2001-1) The action of translations makes the space an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), and this allows defining lines, planes, subspaces, dimension, and [parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)"). The inner product allows defining distance and angles.

The set ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) of n-tuples of real numbers equipped with the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") is a Euclidean space of dimension n. Conversely, the choice of a point called the _origin_ and an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") of the space of translations is equivalent with defining an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") between a Euclidean space of dimension n and ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) viewed as a Euclidean space.

It follows that everything that can be said about a Euclidean space can also be said about ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76ef548febfc9981762740107858be9e3a5576c3) Therefore, many authors, especially at elementary level, call ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) the _**standard Euclidean space**_ of dimension n,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987Section_9.1-5) or simply _the_ Euclidean space of dimension n.

Origin-free illustration of the Euclidean plane

A reason for introducing such an abstract definition of Euclidean spaces, and for working with ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e8fa8586d428ff5706c6d0a00a7939950fad89b) instead of ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) is that it is often preferable to work in a _coordinate-free_ and _origin-free_ manner (that is, without choosing a preferred basis and a preferred origin). Another reason is that there is no standard origin nor any standard basis in the physical world.

### Technical definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Technical definition")]

A **Euclidean vector space** is a finite-dimensional [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space") over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987Chapter_9-6)

A **Euclidean space** is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") over the [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") such that the associated vector space is a Euclidean vector space. Euclidean spaces are sometimes called _Euclidean affine spaces_ to distinguish them from Euclidean vector spaces.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987Chapter_9-6)

If E is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space (Euclidean vector space) is often denoted ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0051204f558ccfb7c22f0e5fc78c63ce2188b27c) The _dimension_ of a Euclidean space is the [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)") of its associated vector space.

The elements of E are called _points_, and are commonly denoted by capital letters. The elements of ![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) are called _[Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_vector "Euclidean vector")_ or _[free vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_vector "Free vector")_. They are also called _translations_, although, properly speaking, a [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") is the [geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") resulting from the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action "Group action") of a Euclidean vector on the Euclidean space.

The action of a translation v on a point P provides a point that is denoted _P_ + _v_. This action satisfies

![Image 14: {\displaystyle P+(v+w)=(P+v)+w.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0a8add975310f3732261bf70355c6bbd6d3dc39)

**Note:** The second + in the left-hand side is a vector addition; each other + denotes an action of a vector on a point. This notation is not ambiguous, as, to distinguish between the two meanings of +, it suffices to look at the nature of its left argument.

The fact that the action is free and transitive means that, for every pair of points (_P_, _Q_), there is exactly one [displacement vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)")v such that _P_ + _v_ = _Q_. This vector v is denoted _Q_ − _P_ or ![Image 15: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {PQ}}{\vphantom {\frac {)}{}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f583db1f1e17ac70565116ef8fdadb22e8e1facf)

As previously explained, some of the basic properties of Euclidean spaces result from the structure of affine space. They are described in [§Affine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Affine_structure) and its subsections. The properties resulting from the inner product are explained in [§Metric structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Metric_structure) and its subsections.

Prototypical examples
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Prototypical examples")]

For any vector space, the addition acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. Thus a Euclidean vector space can be viewed as a Euclidean space that has itself as the associated vector space.

A typical case of Euclidean vector space is ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) viewed as a vector space equipped with the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") as an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product"). The importance of this particular example of Euclidean space lies in the fact that every Euclidean space is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to it. More precisely, given a Euclidean space E of dimension n, the choice of a point, called an _origin_ and an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") of ![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) defines an isomorphism of Euclidean spaces from E to ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76ef548febfc9981762740107858be9e3a5576c3)

As every Euclidean space of dimension n is isomorphic to it, the Euclidean space ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) is sometimes called the _standard Euclidean space_ of dimension n.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987Section_9.1-5)

Some basic properties of Euclidean spaces depend only on the fact that a Euclidean space is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"). They are called [affine properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_property "Affine property") and include the concepts of lines, subspaces, and parallelism, which are detailed in next subsections.

Let E be a Euclidean space and ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) its associated vector space.

A _flat_, _Euclidean subspace_ or _affine subspace_ of E is a subset F of E such that

![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {F}}={\Bigl \{}{\overrightarrow {PQ}}\mathrel {\Big |} P\in F,Q\in F{\Bigr \}}{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4850b22390a7723fda61357997ccf5caa1c07d5c)

as the associated vector space of F is a [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") (vector subspace) of ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0051204f558ccfb7c22f0e5fc78c63ce2188b27c) A Euclidean subspace F is a Euclidean space with ![Image 23: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {F}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac2b5875f3997034668b7b97ed82ae892697ba9b) as the associated vector space. This linear subspace ![Image 24: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {F}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac2b5875f3997034668b7b97ed82ae892697ba9b) is also called the _direction_ of F.

If P is a point of F then

![Image 25: {\displaystyle F={\Bigl \{}P+v\mathrel {\Big |} v\in {\overrightarrow {F}}{\Bigr \}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abbecdd4c82b1bc17ffa09d935af2624757f9be2)

Conversely, if P is a point of E and ![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {V}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/139bd3df44a432d607ef688933115bc807b917ea) is a [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of ![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc2d2ae2efe2b4092a3b8feac33a91c240943fa) then

![Image 28: {\displaystyle P+{\overrightarrow {V}}={\Bigl \{}P+v\mathrel {\Big |} v\in {\overrightarrow {V}}{\Bigr \}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6bbb45f835fac9af9d049450cdee9f9acad758b)

is a Euclidean subspace of direction ![Image 29: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {V}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/139bd3df44a432d607ef688933115bc807b917ea). (The associated vector space of this subspace is ![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {V}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/139bd3df44a432d607ef688933115bc807b917ea).)

A Euclidean vector space ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) (that is, a Euclidean space that is equal to ![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae)) has two sorts of subspaces: its Euclidean subspaces and its linear subspaces. Linear subspaces are Euclidean subspaces and a Euclidean subspace is a linear subspace if and only if it contains the zero vector.

In a Euclidean space, a _line_ is a Euclidean subspace of dimension one. Since a vector space of dimension one is spanned by any nonzero vector, a line is a set of the form

![Image 33: {\displaystyle {\Bigl \{}P+\lambda {\overrightarrow {PQ}}\mathrel {\Big |} \lambda \in \mathbb {R} {\Bigr \}},{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3e23593a21e32705b7cfdd74f9f96760d02b215)

where P and Q are two distinct points of the Euclidean space as a part of the line.

It follows that _there is exactly one line that passes through (contains) two distinct points._ This implies that two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.

A more symmetric representation of the line passing through P and Q is

![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\Bigl \{}O+(1-\lambda ){\overrightarrow {OP}}+\lambda {\overrightarrow {OQ}}\mathrel {\Big |} \lambda \in \mathbb {R} {\Bigr \}},{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2b693b21ffeb47db3ed54d1b9ae27adcb13b9cb)

where O is an arbitrary point (not necessary on the line).

In a Euclidean vector space, the zero vector is usually chosen for O; this allows simplifying the preceding formula into

![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\bigl \{}(1-\lambda )P+\lambda Q\mathrel {\big |} \lambda \in \mathbb {R} {\bigr \}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7462898e76f4d9744ed30d585af91ce373594e0e)

A standard convention allows using this formula in every Euclidean space, see [Affine space §Affine combinations and barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space#Affine_combinations_and_barycenter "Affine space").

The _[line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line\_segment "Line segment")_, or simply _segment_, joining the points P and Q is the subset of points such that 0 ≤ _𝜆_ ≤ 1 in the preceding formulas. It is denoted PQ or QP; that is

![Image 36: {\displaystyle PQ=QP={\Bigl \{}P+\lambda {\overrightarrow {PQ}}\mathrel {\Big |} 0\leq \lambda \leq 1{\Bigr \}}.{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48128eae6b07d3e00f37e09aaac4d773bab3be32)

Two subspaces S and T of the same dimension in a Euclidean space are _parallel_ if they have the same direction (i.e., the same associated vector space).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-7) Equivalently, they are parallel, if there is a translation vector v that maps one to the other:

![Image 37: {\displaystyle T=S+v.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8805725d38fba90073a4e871067bd83aee8b2dcc)

Given a point P and a subspace S, there exists exactly one subspace that contains P and is parallel to S, which is ![Image 38: {\displaystyle P+{\overrightarrow {S}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/50ba6cd887aae30b32e27b4d35e4d1d82fc96930) In the case where S is a line (subspace of dimension one), this property is [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom").

It follows that in a Euclidean plane, two lines either meet in one point or are parallel.

The concept of parallel subspaces has been extended to subspaces of different dimensions: two subspaces are parallel if the direction of one of them is contained in the direction to the other.

The vector space ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) associated to a Euclidean space E is an [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"). This implies a [symmetric bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_bilinear_form "Symmetric bilinear form")

![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\overrightarrow {E}}\times {\overrightarrow {E}}&\to \mathbb {R} \\(x,y)&\mapsto \langle x,y\rangle \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e843bdf3ac9868ad2e0faed30591af7511e69286)

that is [positive definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_definite "Positive definite") (that is ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f081a4822ec7bdff2661ee2070b70a3406cf70f) is always positive for _x_ ≠ 0).

The inner product of a Euclidean space is often called _dot product_ and denoted _x_ ⋅ _y_. This is specially the case when a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") has been chosen, as, in this case, the inner product of two vectors is the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of their [coordinate vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector"). For this reason, and for historical reasons, the dot notation is more commonly used than the bracket notation for the inner product of Euclidean spaces. This article will follow this usage; that is ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9df1806ebe1fed1a728b18aed82c30be8b2a0acb) will be denoted _x_ ⋅ _y_ in the remainder of this article.

The **Euclidean norm** of a vector x is

![Image 43: {\displaystyle \|x\|={\sqrt {x\cdot x}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40156c4d98b51295509cdb202b8cdaba09132bc2)

The inner product and the norm allows expressing and proving [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") and [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") properties of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"). The next subsection describe the most fundamental ones. _In these subsections,_ E _denotes an arbitrary Euclidean space, and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) denotes its vector space of translations._

### Distance and length

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Distance and length")]

The _distance_ (more precisely the _Euclidean distance_) between two points of a Euclidean space is the norm of the translation vector that maps one point to the other; that is

![Image 45: {\displaystyle d(P,Q)={\Bigl \|}{\overrightarrow {PQ}}{\Bigr \|}.{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c13771a6a329524c6034fe78fb2de0d8e6c85563)

The _length_ of a [segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Lines_and_segments)_PQ_ is the distance _d_(_P_, _Q_) between its endpoints _P_ and _Q_. It is often denoted ![Image 46: {\displaystyle |PQ|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bce9b5b9a3507edea5dd51e5fe92e446776e4c5).

The distance is a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"), as it is positive definite, symmetric, and satisfies the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality")

![Image 47: {\displaystyle d(P,Q)\leq d(P,R)+d(R,Q).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8671f5098e666ba3a4aadf5ed61f89372e7a345)

Moreover, the equality is true if and only if a point R belongs to the segment _PQ_. This inequality means that the length of any edge of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the other edges. This is the origin of the term _triangle inequality_.

With the Euclidean distance, every Euclidean space is a [complete metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space "Complete metric space").

Two nonzero vectors u and v of ![Image 48: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) (the associated vector space of a Euclidean space E) are _perpendicular_ or _orthogonal_ if their inner product is zero:

![Image 49: {\displaystyle u\cdot v=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/746abed16e54d81e5990af958ae5f3ac24a03a45)

Two linear subspaces of ![Image 50: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) are orthogonal if every nonzero vector of the first one is perpendicular to every nonzero vector of the second one. This implies that the intersection of the linear subspaces is reduced to the zero vector.

Two lines, and more generally two Euclidean subspaces (A line can be considered as one Euclidean subspace.) are orthogonal if their directions (the associated vector spaces of the Euclidean subspaces) are orthogonal. Two orthogonal lines that intersect are said _perpendicular_.

Two segments _AB_ and _AC_ that share a common endpoint _A_ are _perpendicular_ or _form a [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right\_angle "Right angle")_ if the vectors ![Image 51: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AB}}{\vphantom {\frac {)}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ea379802af18b7933c6c32beb9697a8d71c8fd1) and ![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AC}}{\vphantom {\frac {)}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/897cb4b6f0854e47bece00856ed3560c749dddb2) are orthogonal.

If _AB_ and _AC_ form a right angle, one has

![Image 53: {\displaystyle |BC|^{2}=|AB|^{2}+|AC|^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/165ec53cf622f8113176f013835a474d2d1a0319)

This is the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). Its proof is easy in this context, as, expressing this in terms of the inner product, one has, using bilinearity and symmetry of the inner product:

![Image 54: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|BC|^{2}&={\overrightarrow {BC}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {BC}}{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}\\[2mu]&={\Bigl (}{\overrightarrow {BA}}+{\overrightarrow {AC}}{\Bigr )}\cdot {\Bigl (}{\overrightarrow {BA}}+{\overrightarrow {AC}}{\Bigr )}\\[4mu]&={\overrightarrow {BA}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {BA}}+{\overrightarrow {AC}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {AC}}-2{\overrightarrow {AB}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {AC}}\\[6mu]&={\overrightarrow {AB}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {AB}}+{\overrightarrow {AC}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {AC}}\\[6mu]&=|AB|^{2}+|AC|^{2}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/790603023e87e170e286a7d92e7233d452fb1e4b)

Here, ![Image 55: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AB}}\cdot {\overrightarrow {AC}}=0{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae4639833383df33b1ffc22b1256a454698c1fc8) is used since these two vectors are orthogonal.

[![Image 56](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/45%2C_-315%2C_and_405_co-terminal_angles.svg/250px-45%2C_-315%2C_and_405_co-terminal_angles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:45,_-315,_and_405_co-terminal_angles.svg)

Positive and negative angles on the oriented plane

The (non-oriented) _angle_ θ between two nonzero vectors x and y in ![Image 57: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) is

![Image 58: {\displaystyle \theta =\arccos \left({\frac {x\cdot y}{|x|\,|y|}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3092c780e79339c85a5c8f387bcc14ebb96db75)

where arccos is the [principal value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_value "Principal value") of the [arccosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arccosine "Arccosine") function. By [Cauchy–Schwarz inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality "Cauchy–Schwarz inequality"), the argument of the arccosine is in the interval [−1, 1]. Therefore θ is real, and 0 ≤ _θ_ ≤ _π_ (or 0 ≤ _θ_ ≤ 180 if angles are measured in degrees).

Angles are not useful in a Euclidean line, as they can be only 0 or π.

In an [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)") Euclidean plane, one can define the _[oriented angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented\_angle "Oriented angle")_ of two vectors. The oriented angle of two vectors x and y is then the opposite of the oriented angle of y and x. In this case, the angle of two vectors can have any value [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") an integer multiple of 2 _π_. In particular, a [reflex angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_angle "Reflex angle")_π_<_θ_< 2 _π_ equals the negative angle −_π_<_θ_ − 2 _π_< 0.

The angle of two vectors does not change if they are [multiplied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") by positive numbers. More precisely, if x and y are two vectors, and λ and μ are real numbers, then

![Image 59: {\displaystyle \operatorname {angle} (\lambda x,\mu y)={\begin{cases}\operatorname {angle} (x,y)\qquad \qquad {\text{if }}\lambda {\text{ and }}\mu {\text{ have the same sign}}\\\pi -\operatorname {angle} (x,y)\qquad {\text{otherwise}}.\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/beb0b7db5952cf104314c78a317bb73b73cfbe64)

If A, B, and C are three points in a Euclidean space, the angle of the segments _AB_ and _AC_ is the angle of the vectors ![Image 60: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AB}}{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f2ecb54aefa43c40310bcb48b8bd645d5d926f6) and ![Image 61: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AC}}.{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/034cc40af64b8223081a3935e16f943b3b1bc0ec) As the multiplication of vectors by positive numbers do not change the angle, the angle of two [half-lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)") with initial point A can be defined: it is the angle of the segments _AB_ and _AC_, where B and C are arbitrary points, one on each half-line. Although this is less used, one can define similarly the angle of segments or half-lines that do not share an initial point.

The angle of two lines is defined as follows. If θ is the angle of two segments, one on each line, the angle of any two other segments, one on each line, is either θ or _π_ − _θ_. One of these angles is in the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)")[0, _π_/2], and the other being in [_π_/2, _π_]. The _non-oriented angle_ of the two lines is the one in the interval [0, _π_/2]. In an oriented Euclidean plane, the _oriented angle_ of two lines belongs to the interval [−_π_/2, _π_/2].

### Cartesian coordinates

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Cartesian coordinates")]

Every Euclidean vector space has an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") (in fact, infinitely many in dimension higher than one, and two in dimension one), that is a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(vector_space) "Basis (vector space)")![Image 62: {\displaystyle (e_{1},\dots ,e_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83ccf3398cfc17c5754c3ad49d1cb98191660797) of [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") (![Image 63: {\displaystyle \|e_{i}\|=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b3d6d071d5a49ab2075aac7e2315e7d03c2d9b7)) that are pairwise orthogonal (![Image 64: {\displaystyle e_{i}\cdot e_{j}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33c518289cb3483d625b7c3de26177733fd2036c) for _i_ ≠ _j_). More precisely, given any [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(vector_space) "Basis (vector space)")![Image 65: {\displaystyle (b_{1},\dots ,b_{n}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb950795aab63cdd91c98f8cdaf13889563b1a62) the [Gram–Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process "Gram–Schmidt process") computes an orthonormal basis such that, for every i, the [linear spans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_span "Linear span") of ![Image 66: {\displaystyle (e_{1},\dots ,e_{i})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1a9b068ed5d25e798ba9a4c107460dde33a61) and ![Image 67: {\displaystyle (b_{1},\dots ,b_{i})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f423888d30c2de535fd9185abc06cc0e049d963) are equal.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-8)

Given a Euclidean space E, a _[Cartesian frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian\_frame "Cartesian frame")_ is a set of data consisting of an orthonormal basis of ![Image 68: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc2d2ae2efe2b4092a3b8feac33a91c240943fa) and a point of E, called the _origin_ and often denoted O. A Cartesian frame ![Image 69: {\displaystyle (O,e_{1},\dots ,e_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca285afbda8f7b2accf6c570da843479986bc6a4) allows defining Cartesian coordinates for both E and ![Image 70: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) in the following way.

The Cartesian coordinates of a vector v of ![Image 71: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) are the coefficients of v on the orthonormal basis ![Image 72: {\displaystyle e_{1},\dots ,e_{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cbcbf740f83c80519addd87572250282a9b9666) For example, the Cartesian coordinates of a vector ![Image 73: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) on an orthonormal basis ![Image 74: {\displaystyle (e_{1},e_{2},e_{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d9174b8943b9b8379276d0cf9b61fbbf21c0d59) (that may be named as ![Image 75: {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22a8c93372e8f8b6e24d523bd5545aed3430baf4) as a convention) in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space is ![Image 76: {\displaystyle (\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\alpha _{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24a83837e8fc0d80ad0d33831a3696cde317f8c8) if ![Image 77: {\displaystyle v=\alpha _{1}e_{1}+\alpha _{2}e_{2}+\alpha _{3}e_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fd69d0612f12e25512988496541eec1a51cef8c). As the basis is orthonormal, the i-th coefficient ![Image 78: {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b1fb627423abe4988b7ed88d4920bf1ec074790) is equal to the dot product ![Image 79: {\displaystyle v\cdot e_{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f81f3936ed6eb556bfcc1e862ea1eb3d9b2bdae1)

3-dimensional skew coordinates

As a Euclidean space is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), one can consider an [affine frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_frame "Affine frame") on it, which is the same as a Euclidean frame, except that the basis is not required to be orthonormal. This define [affine coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_coordinates "Affine coordinates"), sometimes called _skew coordinates_ for emphasizing that the basis vectors are not pairwise orthogonal.

An [affine basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_basis "Affine basis") of a Euclidean space of dimension n is a set of _n_ + 1 points that are not contained in a hyperplane. An affine basis define [barycentric coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates "Barycentric coordinates") for every point.

Many other coordinates systems can be defined on a Euclidean space E of dimension n, in the following way. Let f be a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") (or, more often, a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism")) from a [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subset "Dense subset")[open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of E to an open subset of ![Image 82: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76ef548febfc9981762740107858be9e3a5576c3) The _coordinates_ of a point x of E are the components of _f_(_x_). The [polar coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system "Polar coordinate system") (dimension 2) and the [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") and [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system "Cylindrical coordinate system") coordinate systems (dimension 3) are defined this way.

For points that are outside the domain of f, coordinates may sometimes be defined as the limit of coordinates of neighbour points, but these coordinates may be not uniquely defined, and may be not continuous in the neighborhood of the point. For example, for the spherical coordinate system, the longitude is not defined at the pole, and on the [antimeridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimeridian "Antimeridian"), the longitude passes discontinuously from –180° to +180°.

This way of defining coordinates extends easily to other mathematical structures, and in particular to [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold").

An [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry") between two [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") preserving the distance,[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-9) that is

![Image 83: {\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))=d(x,y).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65a5227bf8483b2930cb17d4508111bed0c8064d)

In the case of a Euclidean vector space, an isometry that maps the origin to the origin preserves the norm

![Image 84: {\displaystyle \|f(x)\|=\|x\|,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee480a67ac04238241cc612ab3aac82ff90f397a)

since the norm of a vector is its distance from the zero vector. It preserves also the inner product

![Image 85: {\displaystyle f(x)\cdot f(y)=x\cdot y,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93f029e6827dbdb7045d6fad96d7200205bf3c3f)

since

![Image 86: {\displaystyle x\cdot y={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(\|x+y\|^{2}-\|x\|^{2}-\|y\|^{2}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78b7f37e6fb9d952d83fcb418cf5ba5f9227637e)

An isometry of Euclidean vector spaces is a [linear isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_isomorphism "Linear isomorphism").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-10)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger1987Proposition_9.1.3-11)

An isometry ![Image 87: {\displaystyle f\colon E\to F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65e588635af63181c20287f8ea6f18389b5eaec2) of Euclidean spaces defines an isometry ![Image 88: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {f}}\colon {\overrightarrow {E}}\to {\overrightarrow {F}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6627766bc0f5b60d7580e2debdad939ba6445953) of the associated Euclidean vector spaces. This implies that two isometric Euclidean spaces have the same dimension. Conversely, if E and F are Euclidean spaces, _O_ ∈ _E_, _O_′ ∈ _F_, and ![Image 89: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {f}}\colon {\overrightarrow {E}}\to {\overrightarrow {F}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6627766bc0f5b60d7580e2debdad939ba6445953) is an isometry, then the map ![Image 90: {\displaystyle f\colon E\to F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65e588635af63181c20287f8ea6f18389b5eaec2) defined by

![Image 91: {\displaystyle f(P)=O'+{\overrightarrow {f}}{\Bigl (}{\overrightarrow {OP}}{\Bigr )}{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4308ab829a2fc1248ea435eb33046aa69de24ea)

is an isometry of Euclidean spaces.

It follows from the preceding results that an isometry of Euclidean spaces maps lines to lines, and, more generally Euclidean subspaces to Euclidean subspaces of the same dimension, and that the restriction of the isometry on these subspaces are isometries of these subspaces.

### Isometry with prototypical examples

If E is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space ![Image 92: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) can be considered as a Euclidean space.

![Image 96: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E&\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}\\P&\mapsto {\Bigl (}e_{1}\cdot {\overrightarrow {OP}},\dots ,e_{n}\cdot {\overrightarrow {OP}}{\Bigr )},{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/246a1ee498194709e38420703eb95c6b9bbf8baf)

which is an isometry of Euclidean spaces. The inverse isometry is

![Image 97: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbb {R} ^{n}&\to E\\(x_{1}\dots ,x_{n})&\mapsto \left(O+x_{1}e_{1}+\dots +x_{n}e_{n}\right).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f77121fbb42812032b1af0678f6ddf36bf344a7a)

_This means that, up to an isomorphism, there is exactly one Euclidean space of a given dimension._

This justifies that many authors talk of ![Image 98: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) as _the_ Euclidean space of dimension n.

An isometry from a Euclidean space onto itself is called _Euclidean isometry_, _Euclidean transformation_ or _rigid transformation_. The rigid transformations of a Euclidean space form a group (under [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")), called the _Euclidean group_ and often denoted E(_n_).

The simplest Euclidean transformations are [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)")

![Image 99: {\displaystyle P\to P+v.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d90daa33a19ee0a08f820506486e34b66889e4b6)

They are in bijective correspondence with vectors. This is a reason for calling _space of translations_ the vector space associated to a Euclidean space. The translations form a [normal subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup "Normal subgroup") of the Euclidean group.

A Euclidean isometry f of a Euclidean space E defines a linear isometry ![Image 100: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {f}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfa88ab873934603aafa809d533b4c49fc16adda) of the associated vector space (by _linear isometry_, it is meant an isometry that is also a [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map")) in the following way: denoting by _Q_ − _P_ the vector ![Image 101: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {PQ}},{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e8e956340c4e6cf1e3c78760b83449726bacdbc) if O is an arbitrary point of E, one has

![Image 102: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {f}}{\Bigl (}{\overrightarrow {OP}}{\Bigr )}=f(P)-f(O).{\vphantom {\frac {(}{}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b99350c1874e636de72c63948c6f03be2fa658db)

It is straightforward to prove that this is a linear map that does not depend from the choice of O.

The map ![Image 103: {\displaystyle f\to {\overrightarrow {f}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9060d749d709ae651471ae7e821f79bc6b8cf0e6) is a [group homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism") from the Euclidean group onto the group of linear isometries, called the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group"). The kernel of this homomorphism is the translation group, showing that it is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group.

The isometries that fix a given point P form the [stabilizer subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_subgroup "Stabilizer subgroup") of the Euclidean group with respect to P. The restriction to this stabilizer of above group homomorphism is an isomorphism. So the isometries that fix a given point form a group isomorphic to the orthogonal group.

Let P be a point, f an isometry, and t the translation that maps P to _f_(_P_). The isometry ![Image 104: {\displaystyle g=t^{-1}\circ f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73fa2538db70a7c77fdcd2b40cf3112886ba494f) fixes P. So ![Image 105: {\displaystyle f=t\circ g,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25b863d8bf2aa412652919fe83c80e151031b559) and _the Euclidean group is the [semidirect product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect\_product "Semidirect product") of the translation group and the orthogonal group._

The [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group") is the normal subgroup of the orthogonal group that preserves [handedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)"). It is a subgroup of [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(group_theory) "Index (group theory)") two of the orthogonal group. Its inverse image by the group homomorphism ![Image 106: {\displaystyle f\to {\overrightarrow {f}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9060d749d709ae651471ae7e821f79bc6b8cf0e6) is a normal subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, which is called the _special Euclidean group_ or the _displacement group_. Its elements are called _rigid motions_ or _displacements_.

Rigid motions include the [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function"), translations, [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") (the rigid motions that fix at least a point), and also [screw motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_axis "Screw axis").

Typical examples of rigid transformations that are not rigid motions are [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"), which are rigid transformations that fix a hyperplane and are not the identity. They are also the transformations consisting in changing the sign of one coordinate over some Euclidean frame.

As the special Euclidean group is a subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, given a reflection r, every rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion is the product of r and a rigid motion. A [glide reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection "Glide reflection") is an example of a rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion or a reflection.

All groups that have been considered in this section are [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and [algebraic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_group "Algebraic group").

The Euclidean distance makes a Euclidean space a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), and thus a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"). This topology is called the [Euclidean topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_topology "Euclidean topology"). In the case of ![Image 107: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7035fcb9fe3ebecc6bc9f372f82d0352202c8bf) this topology is also the [product topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology").

The [open sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") are the subsets that contains an [open ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_ball "Open ball") around each of their points. In other words, open balls form a [base of the topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(topology) "Base (topology)").

The [topological dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_dimension "Topological dimension") of a Euclidean space equals its dimension. This implies that Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic"). Moreover, the theorem of [invariance of domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariance_of_domain "Invariance of domain") asserts that a subset of a Euclidean space is open (for the [subspace topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_topology "Subspace topology")) if and only if it is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space of the same dimension.

Euclidean spaces are [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric "Complete metric") and [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact"). That is, a closed subset of a Euclidean space is compact if it is [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set") (that is, contained in a ball). In particular, closed balls are compact.

Axiomatic definitions
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Axiomatic definitions")]

The definition of Euclidean spaces that has been described in this article differs fundamentally of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s one. In reality, Euclid did not define formally the space, because it was thought as a description of the physical world that exists independently of human mind. The need of a formal definition appeared only at the end of 19th century, with the introduction of [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometries").

Two different approaches have been used. [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein") suggested to define geometries through their [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetries "Symmetries"). The presentation of Euclidean spaces given in this article, is essentially issued from his [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program"), with the emphasis given on the groups of translations and isometries.

On the other hand, [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") proposed a set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms"), inspired by [Euclid's postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_postulates "Euclid's postulates"). They belong to [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), as they do not involve any definition of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). Later [G. D. Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._D._Birkhoff "G. D. Birkhoff") and [Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski") proposed simpler sets of axioms, which use [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") (see [Birkhoff's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_axioms "Birkhoff's axioms") and [Tarski's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axioms "Tarski's axioms")).

In _[Geometric Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\_Algebra\_(book) "Geometric Algebra (book)")_, [Emil Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin "Emil Artin") has proved that all these definitions of a Euclidean space are equivalent.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArtin1988-12) It is rather easy to prove that all definitions of Euclidean spaces satisfy Hilbert's axioms, and that those involving real numbers (including the above given definition) are equivalent. The difficult part of Artin's proof is the following. In Hilbert's axioms, [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)") is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on segments. One can thus define the _length_ of a segment as its equivalence class. One must thus prove that this length satisfies properties that characterize nonnegative real numbers. Artin proved this with axioms equivalent to those of Hilbert.

Since the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics"), Euclidean space has been used for modeling [shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape") in the physical world. It is thus used in many [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), such as [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"). It is also widely used in all technical areas that are concerned with shapes, figure, location and position, such as [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture"), [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy"), [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography"), [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation"), [industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design "Industrial design"), or [technical drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing "Technical drawing").

Space of dimensions higher than three occurs in several modern theories of physics; see [Higher dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_dimension "Higher dimension"). They occur also in [configuration spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") of [physical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system").

Beside [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), Euclidean spaces are also widely used in other areas of mathematics. [Tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") of [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") are Euclidean vector spaces. More generally, a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") is a space that is locally approximated by Euclidean spaces. Most [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometries") can be modeled by a manifold, and [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in a Euclidean space of higher dimension. For example, an [elliptic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_space "Elliptic space") can be modeled by an [ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid "Ellipsoid"). It is common to represent in a Euclidean space mathematical objects that are _a priori_ not of a geometrical nature. An example among many is the usual representation of [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)").

Other geometric spaces
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Other geometric spaces")]

Since the introduction, at the end of 19th century, of [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometries"), many sorts of spaces have been considered, about which one can do geometric reasoning in the same way as with Euclidean spaces. In general, they share some properties with Euclidean spaces, but may also have properties that could appear as rather strange. Some of these spaces use Euclidean geometry for their definition, or can be modeled as subspaces of a Euclidean space of higher dimension. When such a space is defined by geometrical [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"), [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") the space in a Euclidean space is a standard way for proving [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") of its definition, or, more precisely for proving that its theory is consistent, if [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") is consistent (which cannot be proved).

A Euclidean space is an affine space equipped with a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"). Affine spaces have many other uses in mathematics. In particular, as they are defined over any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), they allow doing geometry in other contexts.

As soon as non-linear questions are considered, it is generally useful to consider affine spaces over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") as an extension of Euclidean spaces. For example, a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") and a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") have always two intersection points (possibly not distinct) in the complex affine space. Therefore, most of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") is built in complex affine spaces and affine spaces over [algebraically closed fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field"). The shapes that are studied in algebraic geometry in these affine spaces are therefore called [affine algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_algebraic_variety "Affine algebraic variety").

Affine spaces over the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") and more generally over [algebraic number fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_field "Algebraic number field") provide a link between (algebraic) geometry and [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"). For example, the [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem") can be stated "a [Fermat curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_curve "Fermat curve") of degree higher than two has no point in the affine plane over the rationals."

Geometry in affine spaces over a [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_fields "Finite fields") has also been widely studied. For example, [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve") over finite fields are widely used in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").

Originally, projective spaces have been introduced by adding "[points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity")" to Euclidean spaces, and, more generally to affine spaces, in order to make true the assertion "two [coplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar "Coplanar") lines meet in exactly one point". Projective space share with Euclidean and affine spaces the property of being [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic"), that is, there is no property of the space that allows distinguishing between two points or two lines. Therefore, a more isotropic definition is commonly used, which consists as defining a projective space as the set of the [vector lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_line "Vector line") in a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") of dimension one more.

As for affine spaces, projective spaces are defined over any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and are fundamental spaces of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry").

### Non-Euclidean geometries

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Non-Euclidean geometries")]

_Non-Euclidean geometry_ refers usually to geometrical spaces where the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") is false. They include [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry"), where the sum of the angles of a triangle is more than 180°, and [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), where this sum is less than 180°. Their introduction in the second half of 19th century, and the proof that their theory is [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") (if Euclidean geometry is not contradictory) is one of the paradoxes that are at the origin of the [foundational crisis in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_crisis_in_mathematics "Foundational crisis in mathematics") of the beginning of 20th century, and motivated the systematization of [axiomatic theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_theory "Axiomatic theory") in mathematics.

A [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") is a space that in the neighborhood of each point resembles a Euclidean space. In technical terms, a manifold is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), such that each point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood "Neighborhood") that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of a Euclidean space. Manifolds can be classified by increasing degree of this "resemblance" into [topological manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold"), [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"), and [analytic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_manifold "Analytic manifold"). However, none of these types of "resemblance" respect distances and angles, even approximately.

Distances and angles can be defined on a smooth manifold by providing a [smoothly varying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") Euclidean metric on the [tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at the points of the manifold (these tangent spaces are thus Euclidean vector spaces). This results in a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"). Generally, [straight lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") do not exist in a Riemannian manifold, but their role is played by [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic"), which are the "shortest paths" between two points. This allows defining distances, which are measured along geodesics, and angles between geodesics, which are the angle of their tangents in the tangent space at their intersection. So, Riemannian manifolds behave locally like a Euclidean space that has been bent.

Euclidean spaces are trivially Riemannian manifolds. An example illustrating this well is the surface of a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). In this case, geodesics are [arcs of great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"), which are called [orthodromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodrome "Orthodrome") in the context of [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation"). More generally, the spaces of [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometries "Non-Euclidean geometries") can be realized as Riemannian manifolds.

### Pseudo-Euclidean space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_space&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Pseudo-Euclidean space")]

An [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") of a real vector space is a [positive definite bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_definite_bilinear_form "Positive definite bilinear form"), and so characterized by a [positive definite quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form#Derived_quadratic_form "Bilinear form"). A [pseudo-Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Euclidean_space "Pseudo-Euclidean space") is an affine space with an associated real vector space equipped with a [non-degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-degenerate "Non-degenerate")[quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form") (that may be [indefinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_quadratic_form "Indefinite quadratic form")).

A fundamental example of such a space is the [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), which is the [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time") of [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). It is a four-dimensional space, where the metric is defined by the [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form")

![Image 108: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-t^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7aae8805cc9e3217e23eb11a985354987f7bc25)

where the last coordinate (_t_) is temporal, and the other three (_x_, _y_, _z_) are spatial.

To take [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") into account, [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") uses a [pseudo-Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold") that has Minkowski spaces as [tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"). The [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds "Curvature of Riemannian manifolds") of this manifold at a point is a function of the value of the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") at this point.
