His Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica is considered to be one of the most influential books in the history of science , laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics by describing universal gravitation and the three laws of motion . In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus .

Because of the resounding impact of his work, Newton became a science icon , as did Albert Einstein after publishing his theory of relativity more than 200 years later.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Many books, plays, and films focus on Newton or use Newton as a literary device . Newton's stature among scientists remains at the very top rank, as demonstrated by a 2005 dual survey of scientists in Britain's Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) and the general public asking who had the greater effect on the history of science and on the history of humanity, Newton or Einstein, Newton was deemed the more influential for both questions by both the public and scientists.

[ 4 ] In 1999, leading physicists voted Albert Einstein "greatest physicist ever"; Newton was the runner-up.

[ 5 ] A parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists gave the top spot to Newton.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Visual arts [ edit ] William Blake created a colour copper engraving entitled Newton , in 1795.

[ 7 ] The engraving would serve as the basis for bronze statue Newton , made in 1995 by the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi .

[ 8 ] French architect Étienne-Louis Boullée designed an unbuilt monumental Cénotaphe à Newton (1784), which he intended as an unadorned 500ft tall sphere encompassed by trees. Points of light would penetrate through the sphere in such a way as to replicate positions of the stars and planets in the night sky.

[ 9 ] Poetry [ edit ] The statue of Newton, located in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge English poet Alexander Pope was moved by Newton's accomplishments to write the famous epitaph : [ 10 ] Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "Let Newton be" and all was light.

English poet J. C. Squire satirised this: [ 11 ] It could not last; the Devil shouting "Ho!

Let Einstein be!" restored the status quo .

The following passage is from William Wordsworth 's The Prelude , in which he describes a marble statue of Newton at Trinity College, Cambridge : [ 12 ] And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The antechapel where the statue stood Of Newton with his prism and silent face, The marble index of a mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.

Isaac Newton plays a significant role in The Age of Unreason , a series of four alternate history novels written by American science fiction and fantasy author Gregory Keyes .

[ citation needed ] Newton is an important character in The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson . A major theme of these novels is the emergence of modern science, with Newton's work in the Principia being prominent. Newton's interest in alchemy and the dispute over the discovery of calculus are prominent plot points, and there is a (fictional) debate on metaphysics between Newton and Gottfried Leibniz moderated by Caroline of Ansbach . The development of an economy based on money and credit is also a major theme, with Newton's time with the Royal Mint and intrigues against counterfeit leading to a Trial of the Pyx .

Newton also displays a wry sense of humor, using his invention to prank Charles II , supposedly on the grounds of refusing to knight him.

Newton is a significant historical character in Marvel 's 616 universe , first as an inductee and subsequent member of the Brotherhood of the Shield , [ 16 ] then as the sorcerer supreme [ 17 ] of his era. He is shown to be super-intelligent and inventive and often plays a villainous role.

Newtonmas [ edit ] 25 December is the birthday of one of the truly great men ever to walk the earth. His achievements might justly be celebrated wherever his truths hold sway. And that means from one end of the universe to the other. Happy Newton Day!

– Richard Dawkins , evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist [ 29 ] Some atheists, sceptics, and others have referred to 25 December as Newtonmas , a tongue-in-cheek reference to Christmas . Celebrants send cards with "Reason's Greetings!" printed inside, and exchange boxes of apples and science-related items as gifts. The celebration may have had its origin in a meeting of the Newton Association at Christmas 1890 to talk, distribute gifts, and share laughter and good cheer. The name Newtonmas can be attributed to The Skeptics Society , which needed an alternative name for its Christmas party.

[ 30 ] Another name for this holiday is Gravmas (also spelt Gravmass or Grav-mass) which is an abbreviation of "gravitational mass" due to Newton's Theory of Gravitation.

[ 31 ] On 25 December 2014, American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted : On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec. 25, 1642.

In a subsequent interview, Tyson denied being "anti-Christian", noting that Jesus' true birthdate is unknown.

[ 32 ] Newton's birthday was 25 December under the Old Style Julian Calendar used in Protestant England at the time, but was 4 January under the New Style Gregorian Calendar used simultaneously in Catholic Europe. The period between has been proposed for a holiday season called "10 Days of Newton" to commemorate this.

Q) Where did the idea to use Isaac Newton as a model for Dornkirk (leader of Zaibach) come from? A) Kawamori answers by saying that Newton was an alchemist and wrote a book on alchemy. Kawamori came up with the theory that Newton discovered the "power" [of Atlantis]. He designed Dornkirk as not a bad guy.
