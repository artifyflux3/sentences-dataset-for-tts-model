[ 2 ] They are often stoppered with proteinaceous "pit plugs". By contrast, many fungi (only ascomycetes and basidiomycetes , as most other groups lack septa) contain septal pores − an unrelated phenomenon.

[ 3 ] Characteristics [ edit ] A sieve-like membrane may cover the pit in living algae, [ 4 ] but in the majority of algae a plug forms, they likely limit the transfer of metabolites between neighbouring cells.

[ 2 ] [ 5 ] Formation [ edit ] Primary pit connections are formed between cells in the same filament, derived from the same parent cell by its division.

[ 4 ] Such connections are always single, and usually circular; [ 4 ] this is a result of their method of formation.  The septum is formed as the walls of a filament grow inwards, dividing the cell; this results in a hole in the middle  of the tube where the walls don't quite merge.

[ 2 ] Thus pit connections are visible in the youngest of septa, widening as the septum thickens, until in some cases they may ultimately occupy the entire septum.

[ 4 ] Secondary connections, by contrast, occur between unrelated cells, and serve a role in transferring cell contents and nutrients.

[ 2 ] They may even form between cells of different species, as in the parasite Holmsella .
