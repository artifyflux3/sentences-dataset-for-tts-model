Between 1880 and 1915, dark, neutral hues such as gray, brown or blue, often dominated compositions by artists associated with the style.

[ 1 ] During the late 1890s, American art critics began to use the term "tonal" to describe these works, as well as the lesser-known synonyms Quietism and Intimism.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Two of the leading associated painters were George Inness and James McNeill Whistler .

[ 4 ] Tonalism is sometimes used to describe American landscapes derived from the French Barbizon style, [ 5 ] which emphasized mood and shadow.

[ 6 ] Tonalism was eventually eclipsed by Impressionism and European modernism .

Australian Tonalism emerged as an art movement in Melbourne during the 1910s.
