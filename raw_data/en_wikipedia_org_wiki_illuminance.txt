Illuminance Common symbols E v SI unit lux Other units phot , foot-candle In SI base units cd · sr · m −2 Dimension L − − 2 J {\displaystyle {\mathsf {L}}^{-2}{\mathsf {J}}} Illuminance diagram with units and terminology In photometry , illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area .

[ 1 ] It is a measure of how much the incident light illuminates the surface, wavelength-weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception.

[ 2 ] Similarly, luminous emittance is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface. Luminous emittance is also known as luminous exitance .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In SI units illuminance is measured in lux (lx), or equivalently in lumens per square metre ( lm · m −2 ).

[ 2 ] Luminous exitance is measured in lm·m −2 only, not lux.

[ 4 ] In the CGS system, the unit of illuminance is the phot , which is equal to 10 000 lux . The foot-candle is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography .

[ 5 ] Illuminance was formerly often called brightness , but this leads to confusion with other uses of the word, such as to mean luminance . "Brightness" should never be used for quantitative description, but only for nonquantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light.

The human eye is capable of seeing somewhat more than a 2 trillion-fold range. The presence of white objects is somewhat discernible under starlight, at 5 × 10 −5 lux (50 μlx), while at the bright end, it is possible to read large text at 10 8 lux (100 Mlx), or about 1000 times that of direct sunlight , although this can be very uncomfortable and cause long-lasting afterimages .

The usual units are apparent magnitudes in the visible band.

[ 7 ] V-magnitudes can be converted to lux using the formula [ 8 ] E v = 10 ( − − 14.18 − − m v ) / 2.5 , {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {v} }=10^{(-14.18-m_{\mathrm {v} })/2.5},} where E v is the illuminance in lux, and m v is the apparent magnitude. The reverse conversion is m v = − − 14.18 − − 2.5 log ⁡ ⁡ ( E v ) .

{\displaystyle m_{\mathrm {v} }=-14.18-2.5\log(E_{\mathrm {v} }).} Relation to luminance [ edit ] Comparison of photometric and radiometric quantities The luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the illuminance it receives: ∫ ∫ Ω Ω Σ Σ L v d Ω Ω Σ Σ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ Σ Σ = M v = E v R {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega _{\Sigma }}L_{\mathrm {v} }\mathrm {d} \Omega _{\Sigma }\cos \theta _{\Sigma }=M_{\mathrm {v} }=E_{\mathrm {v} }R} where the integral covers all the directions of emission Ω Σ , and M v is the surface's luminous exitance E v is the received illuminance, and R is the reflectance .

In the case of a perfectly diffuse reflector (also called a Lambertian reflector ), the luminance is isotropic, per Lambert's cosine law . Then the relationship is simply L v = E v R π π {\displaystyle L_{\mathrm {v} }={\frac {E_{\mathrm {v} }R}{\pi }}} See also [ edit ] Irradiance Exposure value Luminance References [ edit ] ^ "Illuminance, 17-21-060" .
