( March 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , tightness is a concept in measure theory . The intuitive idea is that a given collection of measures does not "escape to infinity ".

Definitions [ edit ] Let ( X , T ) {\displaystyle (X,T)} be a Hausdorff space , and let Œ£ Œ£ {\displaystyle \Sigma } be a œÉ-algebra on X {\displaystyle X} that contains the topology T {\displaystyle T} . (Thus, every open subset of X {\displaystyle X} is a measurable set and Œ£ Œ£ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is at least as fine as the Borel œÉ-algebra on X {\displaystyle X} .) Let M {\displaystyle M} be a collection of (possibly signed or complex ) measures defined on Œ£ Œ£ {\displaystyle \Sigma } . The collection M {\displaystyle M} is called tight (or sometimes uniformly tight ) if, for any Œµ Œµ > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} , there is a compact subset K Œµ Œµ {\displaystyle K_{\varepsilon }} of X {\displaystyle X} such that, for all measures Œº Œº ‚àà ‚àà M {\displaystyle \mu \in M} , | Œº Œº | ( X ‚àñ ‚àñ K Œµ Œµ ) < Œµ Œµ .

{\displaystyle |\mu |(X\setminus K_{\varepsilon })<\varepsilon .} where | Œº Œº | {\displaystyle |\mu |} is the total variation measure of Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } .  Very often, the measures in question are probability measures , so the last part can be written as Œº Œº ( K Œµ Œµ ) > 1 ‚àí ‚àí Œµ Œµ .

{\displaystyle \mu (K_{\varepsilon })>1-\varepsilon .\,} If a tight collection M {\displaystyle M} consists of a single measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } , then (depending upon the author) Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } may either be said to be a tight measure or to be an inner regular measure .

If Y {\displaystyle Y} is an X {\displaystyle X} -valued random variable whose probability distribution on X {\displaystyle X} is a tight measure then Y {\displaystyle Y} is said to be a separable random variable or a Radon random variable .

Another equivalent criterion of the tightness of a collection M {\displaystyle M} is sequentially weakly compact. We say the family M {\displaystyle M} of probability measures is sequentially weakly compact if for every sequence { Œº Œº n } {\displaystyle \left\{\mu _{n}\right\}} from the family, there is a subsequence of measures that converges weakly to some probability measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } . It can be shown that a family of measure is tight if and only if it is sequentially weakly compact.

Examples [ edit ] Compact spaces [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a metrizable compact space , then every collection of (possibly complex) measures on X {\displaystyle X} is tight. This is not necessarily so for non-metrisable compact spaces. If we take [ 0 , œâ œâ 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1}]} with its order topology , then there exists a measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } on it that is not inner regular. Therefore, the singleton { Œº Œº } {\displaystyle \{\mu \}} is not tight.

Polish spaces [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a Polish space , then every finite measure on X {\displaystyle X} is tight; this is Ulam's theorem. Furthermore, by Prokhorov's theorem , a collection of probability measures on X {\displaystyle X} is tight if and only if
it is precompact in the topology of weak convergence .

A collection of point masses [ edit ] Consider the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with its usual Borel topology. Let Œ¥ Œ¥ x {\displaystyle \delta _{x}} denote the Dirac measure , a unit mass at the point x {\displaystyle x} in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . The collection M 1 := { Œ¥ Œ¥ n ‚à£ ‚à£ n ‚àà ‚àà N } {\displaystyle M_{1}:=\{\delta _{n}\mid n\in \mathbb {N} \}} is not tight, since the compact subsets of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } are precisely the closed and bounded subsets, and any such set, since it is bounded, has Œ¥ Œ¥ n {\displaystyle \delta _{n}} -measure zero for large enough n {\displaystyle n} . On the other hand, the collection M 2 := { Œ¥ Œ¥ 1 / n ‚à£ ‚à£ n ‚àà ‚àà N } {\displaystyle M_{2}:=\{\delta _{1/n}\mid n\in \mathbb {N} \}} is tight: the compact interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} will work as K Œµ Œµ {\displaystyle K_{\varepsilon }} for any Œµ Œµ > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} . In general, a collection of Dirac delta measures on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is tight if, and only if, the collection of their supports is bounded.

A collection of Gaussian measures [ edit ] Consider n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} with its usual Borel topology and œÉ-algebra. Consider a collection of Gaussian measures Œì Œì = { Œ≥ Œ≥ i ‚à£ ‚à£ i ‚àà ‚àà I } , {\displaystyle \Gamma =\{\gamma _{i}\mid i\in I\},} where the measure Œ≥ Œ≥ i {\displaystyle \gamma _{i}} has expected value ( mean ) m i ‚àà ‚àà R n {\displaystyle m_{i}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and covariance matrix C i ‚àà ‚àà R n √ó √ó n {\displaystyle C_{i}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n\times n}} . Then the collection Œì Œì {\displaystyle \Gamma } is tight if, and only if, the collections { m i ‚à£ ‚à£ i ‚àà ‚àà I } ‚äÜ ‚äÜ R n {\displaystyle \{m_{i}\mid i\in I\}\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and { C i ‚à£ ‚à£ i ‚àà ‚àà I } ‚äÜ ‚äÜ R n √ó √ó n {\displaystyle \{C_{i}\mid i\in I\}\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n\times n}} are both bounded.

Tightness and convergence [ edit ] Tightness is often a necessary criterion for proving the weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures, especially when the measure space has infinite dimension . See Finite-dimensional distribution Prokhorov's theorem L√©vy‚ÄìProkhorov metric Weak convergence of measures Tightness in classical Wiener space Tightness in Skorokhod space Tightness and stochastic ordering [ edit ] A family of real-valued random variables { X i } i ‚àà ‚àà I {\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}} is tight if and only if there exists an almost surely finite random variable X {\displaystyle X} such that | X i | ‚â§ ‚â§ s t X {\displaystyle |X_{i}|\leq _{\mathrm {st} }X} for all i ‚àà ‚àà I {\displaystyle i\in I} , where ‚â§ ‚â§ s t {\displaystyle \leq _{\mathrm {st} }} denotes the stochastic order defined by A ‚â§ ‚â§ s t B {\displaystyle A\leq _{\mathrm {st} }B} if E œï œï ( A ) ‚â§ ‚â§ E œï œï ( B ) {\displaystyle E\phi (A)\leq E\phi (B)} for all nondecreasing functions œï œï {\displaystyle \phi } .

[ 1 ] Exponential tightness [ edit ] A strengthening of tightness is the concept of exponential tightness, which has applications in large deviations theory . A family of probability measures ( Œº Œº Œ¥ Œ¥ ) Œ¥ Œ¥ > 0 {\displaystyle (\mu _{\delta })_{\delta >0}} on a Hausdorff topological space X {\displaystyle X} is said to be exponentially tight if, for any Œµ Œµ > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} , there is a compact subset K Œµ Œµ {\displaystyle K_{\varepsilon }} of X {\displaystyle X} such that lim‚ÄÜsup Œ¥ Œ¥ ‚Üì ‚Üì 0 Œ¥ Œ¥ log ‚Å° ‚Å° Œº Œº Œ¥ Œ¥ ( X ‚àñ ‚àñ K Œµ Œµ ) < ‚àí ‚àí Œµ Œµ .

{\displaystyle \limsup _{\delta \downarrow 0}\delta \log \mu _{\delta }(X\setminus K_{\varepsilon })<-\varepsilon .} References [ edit ] ^ Leskel√§, L.; Vihola, M. (2013).
