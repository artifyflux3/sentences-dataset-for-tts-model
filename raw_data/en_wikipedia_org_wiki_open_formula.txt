[ citation needed ] An open formula does not have a truth value assigned to it, in contrast with a closed formula which constitutes a proposition and thus can have a truth value like true or false . An open formula can be transformed into a closed formula by applying a quantifier for each free variable. This transformation is called capture of the free variables to make them bound variables.

For example, when reasoning about natural numbers , the formula " x +2 > y " is open, since it contains the free variables x and y . In contrast, the formula " ∃ y ∀ x : x +2 > y " is closed, and has truth value true .

Open formulas are often used in rigorous mathematical definitions of properties, like " x is an aunt of y if, for some person z , z is a parent of y , and x is a sister of z " (with free variables x , y , and bound variable z ) defining the notion of "aunt" in terms of "parent" and "sister".
Another, more formal example, which defines the property of being a prime number , is " P ( x ) if ∀ m , n ∈ N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } : m >1 ∧ n >1 → x ≠ m ⋅ n ", (with free variable x and bound variables m , n ).

An example of a closed formula with truth value false involves the sequence of Fermat numbers F n = 2 2 n + 1 , {\displaystyle F_{n}=2^{2^{n}}+1,} studied by Fermat in connection to the primality. The attachment of the predicate letter P ( is prime ) to each number from the Fermat sequence gives a set of closed formulae. While they are true for n = 0,...,4, no larger value of n is known that obtains a true formula, as of 2023 [update] ; for example, F 5 = 4 294 967 297 = 641 ⋅ ⋅ 6 700 417 {\displaystyle F_{5}=4\,294\,967\,297=641\cdot 6\,700\,417} is not a prime. Thus the closed formula ∀ n P ( F n ) is false.
