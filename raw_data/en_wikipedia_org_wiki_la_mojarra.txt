( March 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) La Mojarra and other Classic era sites.

La Mojarra is an archaeological site in the Mexican state of Veracruz , located near Gulf Coast , at a bend in the Acula River.  It was continually occupied from the late Formative period (ca. 300 BCE ) until perhaps as late as 1000 CE .

Not a large site, La Mojarra has been little excavated.  It covers roughly 1 km 2 and consists of small mounds and a modest plaza. Three kilns have been unearthed, which fired locally used orange pottery.

Nonetheless, La Mojarra and environs have yielded two important Epi-Olmec culture artifacts: La Mojarra Stela 1 and the Tuxtla Statuette .  Both of these artifacts contain what has been classified as Epi-Olmec script as well as very early Long Count calendar dates.
