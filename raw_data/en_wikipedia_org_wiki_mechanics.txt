**Mechanics** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[μηχανική](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE#Ancient_Greek "wikt:μηχανική")_(\_mēkhanikḗ\_)_'of [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine")')[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-2) is the area of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") concerned with the relationships between [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), and [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") among [physical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-3) Forces applied to objects may result in [displacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)"), which are changes of an object's position relative to its environment.

Theoretical expositions of this branch of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") has its origins in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), for instance, in the writings of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-6) (see [History of classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics "History of classical mechanics") and [Timeline of classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_classical_mechanics "Timeline of classical mechanics")). During the [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period"), scientists such as [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"), [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") laid the foundation for what is now known as [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics").

As a branch of [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"), mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.

The ancient [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy") were among the first to propose that abstract principles govern nature. The main theory of mechanics in antiquity was [Aristotelian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_mechanics "Aristotelian mechanics"), though an alternative theory is exposed in the [pseudo-Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Aristotle "Pseudo-Aristotle")_[Mechanical Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics\_(Aristotle) "Mechanics (Aristotle)")_, often attributed to one of his successors.

There is another tradition that goes back to the ancient Greeks where mathematics is used more extensively to analyze bodies [statically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics") or [dynamically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)"), an approach that may have been stimulated by prior work of the Pythagorean [Archytas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archytas "Archytas").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-7) Examples of this tradition include pseudo-[Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") (_On the Balance_), [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (_On the Equilibrium of Planes_, _On Floating Bodies_), [Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") (_Mechanica_), and [Pappus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") (_Collection_, Book VIII).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-mechanics-9)

In the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with [John Philoponus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philoponus "John Philoponus") in the 6th century. A central problem was that of [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion "Projectile motion"), which was discussed by [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") and Philoponus.

Persian Islamic polymath [Ibn Sīnā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_S%C4%ABn%C4%81 "Ibn Sīnā") published his theory of motion in _[The Book of Healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Book\_of\_Healing "The Book of Healing")_ (1020). He said that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower, and viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_resistance "Air resistance") to dissipate it.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Espinoza-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Nasr-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Sayili-12) Ibn Sina made distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called "mayl"), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. So he concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that a projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon, consistent with Newton's first law of motion.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Espinoza-10)

On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab scholar [Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibat_Allah_Abu%27l-Barakat_al-Baghdaadi "Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi") (born Nathanel, Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration. According to [Shlomo Pines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Pines "Shlomo Pines"), al-Baghdaadi's theory of [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") was "the oldest negation of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration]."[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-13)

Influenced by earlier writers such as Ibn Sina[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Sayili-12) and al-Baghdaadi,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-Gutman-14) the 14th-century French priest [Jean Buridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan "Jean Buridan") developed the [theory of impetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_impetus "Theory of impetus"), which later developed into the modern theories of [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia "Inertia"), [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"). This work and others was developed in 14th-century England by the [Oxford Calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Calculators "Oxford Calculators") such as [Thomas Bradwardine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bradwardine "Thomas Bradwardine"), who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies. The concept that the main properties of a body are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th-century [Oxford Calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Calculators "Oxford Calculators").

Two central figures in the early modern age are [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"). Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his _[Two New Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\_New\_Sciences "Two New Sciences")_ (1638). Newton's 1687 _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") and providing the basis of [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-mechanics-9)

There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's _Principia_ is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and many of the mathematics results therein could not have been stated earlier without the development of the calculus. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia and falling bodies, had been developed by prior scholars such as [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are _equivalent_ to modern statements or _sufficient_ proof, or instead _similar_ to modern statements and _hypotheses_ is often debatable.

Two main modern developments in mechanics are [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") of [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

Types of mechanical bodies
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mechanics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Types of mechanical bodies")]

The often-used term **[body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body")** needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle"), [projectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectiles "Projectiles"), [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), parts of [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), parts of [solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solids "Solids"), parts of [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluids "Fluids") ([gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gases "Gases") and [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquids "Liquids")), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)"), such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)"), or non-rigid, i.e. [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"). These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") and attitude ([rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation")), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") are described by quantum mechanics.

The following are the three main designations consisting of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the "[theory of fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_theory_(physics) "Field theory (physics)")" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether it be [classical fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory "Classical field theory") or [quantum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") or [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational "Gravitational")), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function").

Historically, [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") had been around for nearly a quarter millennium before quantum mechanics developed. Classical mechanics originated with [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") in [Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"), developed over the seventeenth century. Quantum mechanics developed later, over the nineteenth century, precipitated by [Planck's postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_postulate "Planck postulate") and Albert Einstein's explanation of the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect"). Both fields are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature.

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [exact sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_science "Exact science"). Essential in this respect is the extensive use of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment") in generating and testing them.

Quantum mechanics is of a bigger scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [correspondence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle "Correspondence principle"), there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large [quantum numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_numbers "Quantum numbers"), i.e. if quantum mechanics is applied to large systems (for e.g. a baseball), the result would almost be the same if classical mechanics had been applied. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult (mainly due to computational limits) in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used. Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the Sun, the Moon, and the stars travel in circles around the Earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo") brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance travelled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton's laws were superseded by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein's theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton's laws were superseded by [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). For everyday phenomena, however, Newton's three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

Akin to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and [special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") theories of [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") have expanded the scope of [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo")'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a body approaches the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). For instance, in [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of a [free particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_particle "Free particle") is _E_ = ⁠1/2⁠_mv_ 2, whereas in relativistic mechanics, it is _E_ = (_γ_ − 1)_mc_ 2 (where _γ_ is the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor "Lorentz factor"); this formula reduces to the Newtonian expression in the low energy limit).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-17)

For high-energy processes, quantum mechanics must be adjusted to account for special relativity; this has led to the development of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics#cite_note-18)
