Seth Ward Bishop Ward, portrait by John Greenhill Born 1617 ( 1617 ) Hertfordshire , England Died 6 January 1689 (aged 71–72) London , England Education Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge Seth Ward (1617 – 6 January 1689) was an English mathematician , astronomer , [ 1 ] and bishop.

Early life [ edit ] He was born in Hertfordshire , and educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge , where he graduated B.A. in 1636 and M.A. in 1640, becoming a Fellow in that year.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 1643 he was chosen university mathematical lecturer, but he was deprived of his fellowship next year for opposing the Solemn League and Covenant (with Isaac Barrow , John Barwick and Peter Gunning ).

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] Academic [ edit ] In the 1640s, he took instruction in mathematics from William Oughtred , and stayed with relations of Samuel Ward .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1649, he became Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford University , and gained a high reputation by his theory of planetary motion,  propounded in the works entitled In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis (Oxford, 1653), against the cosmology of Ismael Boulliau , and Astronomia geometrica (London, 1656) on the system of Kepler .

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] About this time he was engaged in a decades-long philosophical controversy with Thomas Hobbes : [ 2 ] [ 7 ] Seth Ward and John Wallis, both Savilian professors and members of the Anglican clergy, felt offended by the works of Hobbes, particularly after Leviathan was released.

[ 7 ] : 273 A small part of the debate with John Webster launched by the Vindiciae academiarum he wrote with John Wilkins which also incorporated an attack on William Dell .

[ 8 ] He was one of  the original members of the Royal Society of London . 
In 1659, he was appointed President of Trinity College, Oxford , but not having the statutory qualifications he resigned in 1660.

[ 2 ] Churchman [ edit ] King Charles II appointed him to the livings of St Lawrence Jewry in London , and Uplowman in Devonshire , in 1661. 
He also became dean of Exeter Cathedral (1661) and rector of St Breock , Cornwall in 1662. 
In the latter year he was consecrated Bishop of Exeter , and in 1667 he was translated to the see of Salisbury . The office of Chancellor of the Order of the Garter was conferred on him in 1671.

[ 2 ] In his diocese he showed great severity to nonconformists , and rigidly enforced the act prohibiting conventicles (unofficial religious meetings). He spent a great deal of money on the restoration of the cathedrals of Worcester and Salisbury . 
He died at Knightsbridge on 6 January 1689.

[ 2 ] In 2017 Bishop Wordsworth's Grammar School named its new, fifth house (Ward House) after Bishop Ward.
