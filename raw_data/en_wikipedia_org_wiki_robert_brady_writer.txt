[ 1 ] He was also a physician.

Biography [ edit ] Brady was born in Denver, Norfolk in 1627.

[ 2 ] He was son of Thomas Brady, an attorney of Denver, Norfolk . He was educated in Downham Market and at Caius College, Cambridge .

[ 3 ] He was made Master of Caius College in 1660, on the English Restoration . In the 1670s, he hoped to write for the prominent politicians Joseph Williamson and Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , but they declined the offer. It was only when William Sancroft became Archbishop of Canterbury that Brady found a patron.

[ 4 ] Beginning in 1677, Brady held the position of Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge. He sat as Member of Parliament for the University in 1681 and 1685.

[ 5 ] In historical controversy, he was opposed to William Petyt and James Tyrrell , along what would become Tory versus Whig lines, then forming in the Exclusion crisis of the 1680s. Brady is regarded as holding to an uncompromising royalist position.

[ 6 ] Others on the Whig side were William Atwood , Edward Cooke, and Sir John Somers .

J. P. Kenyon takes him as a pioneer among the royalist scholars of English medieval history, who were working towards a formulation akin to Kenyon's viewpoint.

[ 7 ] John Pocock [ 8 ] regards as "unforgettably damaging" the effect the (proto-)Tory Brady and others made, in attacking the doctrine of the " Ancient Constitution " as a failed description of the real circumstances of political arrangements in the England of the Middle Ages. On the narrow point of the actual legal effects of the Norman Conquest , Brady had been anticipated by Samuel Daniel , in views that are quite close to some modern scholars.

[ 9 ] He moved from there to argue for absolutism , [ 10 ] and that Magna Carta was not a major charter for popular freedom.

[ 11 ] Brady's ideas drew on Henry Spelman and Robert Filmer .

[ 4 ] David C. Douglas remarks that although his motivations as a scholar were at least as political as those of his opponents, his techniques were so far superior that his work remained of importance.

[ 12 ] Brady was aided in his later work by a position from 1686 in the archives of the Tower of London .
