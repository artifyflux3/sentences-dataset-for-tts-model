History [ edit ] Throughout the history of chemistry , many chemical elements have been discovered. In the 19th century, Dmitri Mendeleev formulated the periodic table , a table of elements which describes their structure. Because elements have been discovered at various times and places, from antiquity through the present day, their names have derived from several languages and cultures.

Named after places [ edit ] Main article: List of chemical elements named after places 41 of the 118 known elements have names associated with, or specifically named for, places around the world or among astronomical objects. 32 of these have names tied to the places on Earth, and the other nine are named after to Solar System objects: helium and selenium for the Sun and Moon ; mercury (indirectly), tellurium , uranium and neptunium for the planets Mercury , Earth , Uranus and Neptune ; plutonium and cerium for the  dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres , both considered planets when the elements were named; and palladium for the asteroid Pallas .

[ 1 ] Named after people [ edit ] Main article: List of chemical elements named after people Nineteen elements are connected with the names of twenty people (as curium honours both Marie and Pierre Curie ). Of these, only gadolinium and samarium occur in nature; the rest are synthetic . Fifteen elements were named after scientists; four other have indirect connection to the names of non-scientists.

[ 1 ] Only Glenn T. Seaborg and Yuri Oganessian were honored during their lifetime by having elements named after them, and Oganessian is the only one still living. Elements named after four non-scientists in this table were actually named for a place or thing which in turn had been named for these people.

Samarium was named for the mineral from which it was isolated, samarskite , which was named for Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets .

Berkelium and livermorium were named for the California cities Berkeley and Livermore , the locations of the Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories; the cities were named for George Berkeley and Robert Livermore .

Americium was named for America, which was named for Amerigo Vespucci .

Named after mythological entities [ edit ] Also, mythological entities have had a significant impact on the naming of elements, directly or indirectly.

Cerium , europium , helium , iridium , mercury , neptunium , niobium , palladium , plutonium , promethium , selenium , tantalum , titanium , thorium , uranium and vanadium are all connected to mythological deities.

Named after minerals [ edit ] Elements may also have been named after minerals (in which they were discovered). For example, beryllium is named after beryl .

Controversies and failed proposals [ edit ] Main articles: List of chemical elements naming controversies and Transfermium wars Other element names given after people have been proposed but failed to gain official international recognition.  These include columbium (Cb), hahnium (Ha), joliotium (Jl), and kurchatovium (Ku), names connected to Christopher Columbus , Otto Hahn , Irène Joliot-Curie , and Igor Kurchatov ; and also cassiopeium (Cp), a name coming from the constellation Cassiopeia and is hence indirectly connected to the mythological Cassiopeia .

Current naming practices and procedures [ edit ] Main article: Systematic element name For the last two decades, IUPAC has been the governing body for naming elements. IUPAC has also provided a temporary name and symbol for unknown or recently synthesized elements.

^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o eka-... named elements : Mendeleev predicted and described properties of then-unknown elements, based on the then empty locations in his 1871 Periodic table . The predictions proved to be correct with the discovery of scandium , gallium , technetium and germanium . He named those unknown, unnamed elements "eka-...", for example "eka-boron"; the prefix means one more (i.e., one more row below boron in the periodic table). Ultimately, eka-boron was discovered, named "aluminium" and indeed is located below boron.

The elements he predicted, eka-boron , eka-aluminium , eka-manganese , and eka-silicon proved to be good predictors of scandium , gallium , technetium and germanium , respectively.

The prefix eka- , from the Sanskrit , means "one" (one place down from a known element in the table), and is sometimes used in discussions about any more undiscovered element. For example, darmstadtium is sometimes referred to as eka-platinum .

stimmi is used by the Attic tragic poets of the 5th century BC. Later Greeks also used στίβι (stibi) , which is written in Latin by Celsus and Pliny the Elder in the first century AD. Pliny also names stimi [ sic ], larbaris , and alabaster (Greek: ἀλάβαστρον ), "very common platyophthalmos ( πλατυόφθαλμος )", "wide-eye" in Greek (the description refers to the effects of the cosmetic). In Egyptian hieroglyphics, mśdmt ; the vowels are uncertain, but in Coptic and according to an Arabic tradition, it is pronounced mesdemet (Albright; Sarton, quotes Meyerhof, the translator). In Arabic, the word for powdered stibnite is kuhl .

^ The ancient Greek derivation of Prometheus from the Greek πρό pro ("before") + [μανθάνω] Error: {{Transliteration}}: transliteration text not Latin script (pos 1: μ) ( help ) manthano ("learn"), thus "forethought", which engendered a contrasting brother Epimetheus ("afterthought"), was a folk etymology ; it is succinctly expressed in Servius ' commentary on Virgil, Eclogue 6.42: " Prometheus vir prudentissimus fuit, unde etiam Prometheus dictus est ἀπὸ τής πρόμηθείας , id est a providentia ." Modern scientific linguistics suggests that the name derived from the Proto-Indo-European root that also produces the Vedic pra math , "to steal", hence pramathyu-s , "thief", cognate with "Prometheus", the thief of fire. The Vedic myth of fire's theft by Mātariśvan is an analog to the Greek account.

Pramantha was the tool used to create fire. See: Fortson, Benjamin W. (2004).
