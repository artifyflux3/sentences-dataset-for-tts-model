Communication physics is one of the applied branches of physics .  It deals with various kinds of communication systems .

[ 1 ] These can range from basic ideas such as mobile phone communication to quantum communication via quantum entanglement.

[ 2 ] Communication physics is also a journal edition created in 2018 published by Nature Research that aims to publish research that involves a different way of thinking in the research field.

[ 3 ] Applications [ edit ] Communication physics aims to study and explain how a communication system works. This can be applied in a hard science way via Computer Communication or in the way of how people communicate.

[ 1 ] An example of communication physics is how computers can transmit and receive data through networks. This would also deal with explaining how these devices encode and decode messages.
