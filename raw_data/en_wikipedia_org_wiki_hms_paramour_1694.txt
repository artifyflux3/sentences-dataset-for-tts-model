Paramour was built by Fisher Harding of Deptford and launched in April 1694. She was rigged as a three-masted ship and was the first vessel built specifically as a research vessel for the Royal Navy. On one occasion during her sea-trials the visiting Tsar Peter I took her helm.

After three voyages under Halley's captaincy she was refitted in 1702 as a bomb ketch (equipped with a large calibre mortar) in which capacity she remained in the Royal Navy until 22 August 1706 when she was sold to Captain John Constable for (probably) mercantile service. Her subsequent fate is unknown.
