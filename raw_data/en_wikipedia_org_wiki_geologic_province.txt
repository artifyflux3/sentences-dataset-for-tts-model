( May 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A geologic province or geological province is a spatial entity with common geologic attributes.

[ 1 ] A province may include a single dominant structural element such as a basin or a fold belt , or a number of contiguous related elements.  Adjoining provinces may be similar in structure but be considered separate due to differing histories .

Geologic provinces by origin [ edit ] Province Definition Subcategories Examples Shield Exposed Precambrian crystalline igneous and  metamorphic rocks that form tectonically stable areas Arabian-Nubian Shield Canadian Shield Platform Horizontal or gently-lying sedimentary strata covering a basement of igneous or metamorphic rocks Carbonate platform East European Platform Orogen Linear or arc-shaped formation where continental crust has been folded, deformed and uplifted to form mountain ranges Island arc Continental arc Forearc Laramide Orogeny Andean Orogeny Basin Low-lying formation of rock strata formed by tectonic warping of previously horizontal strata Cratonic basin Foredeep basin Sedimentary basin Illinois Basin Paraná Basin Large igneous province Accumulation of igneous rocks, including liquid rock (intrusive) or volcanic rock formations (extrusive) North Atlantic Igneous Province Columbia River Basalt Group Extended crust Continental crust thinned due to extensional strain Passive margin Rift Basin and Range Province Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province Geologic provinces by resources [ edit ] US coal regions and provinces.

Some studies classify provinces based upon mineral resources, such as mineral deposits.  There are a particularly large number of provinces identified worldwide for petroleum and other mineral fuels , such as the Niger Delta petroleum province .
