Medical condition Chromophobia Other names Chromatophobia The fear of the color red is called erythrophobia.

Specialty Psychology Chromophobia (also known as chromatophobia [ 1 ] ) is a persistent, irrational fear of, or aversion to, colors and is usually a conditioned response .

[ 2 ] While actual clinical phobias to color are rare, colors can elicit hormonal responses and psychological reactions.

[ 3 ] Chromophobia may also refer to an aversion of use of color in products or design.

[ 4 ] Within cellular biology , " chromophobic" cells are a classification of cells that do not attract hematoxylin , [ 5 ] and is related to chromatolysis .

[ 6 ] Terminology [ edit ] Names exist that mean fear of specific colors such as erythrophobia for the fear of red , xanthophobia for the fear of yellow and leukophobia for the fear of white .

[ 2 ] A fear of the color red may be associated with a fear of blood.

[ 2 ] Overview [ edit ] In his book Chromophobia published in 2000, David Batchelor says that in Western culture, color has often been treated as corrupting, foreign or superficial.

[ 7 ] Michael  Taussig states that the cultural aversion to color can be traced back a thousand years, [ 8 ] with Batchelor stating that it can be traced back to Aristotle 's privileging of line over color.

[ 9 ] In a study, hatchling loggerhead sea turtles were found to have an aversion to lights in the yellow wave spectrum which is thought to be a characteristic that helps orient themselves toward the ocean.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The Mediterranean sand smelt , Atherina hepsetus , has shown an aversion to red objects placed next to a tank while it will investigate objects of other colors.

[ 12 ] In other experiments, geese have been conditioned to have adverse reactions to foods of a particular color, although the reaction was not observed in reaction to colored water.

[ 13 ] The title character in Alfred Hitchcock 's Marnie has an aversion to the color red caused by a trauma during her childhood [ 14 ] which Hitchcock presents through expressionistic techniques, such as a wash of red coloring a close up of Marnie.

[ 15 ] The term colorphobia can also be used to refer to its literal etymological origin to refer to an apprehension towards image processing on one's vision and its visual perceptual property.

[ 16 ] However, the term's association with a racial component has been used by public figures such as Frederick Douglass .

[ 17 ] Leukophobia often takes the form of a fixation on pale skin. Those with the phobia may make implausible assumptions such as paleness necessarily representing ill health or a ghost .

[ 18 ] In other cases, leukophobia is directed more towards the symbolic meaning of whiteness, for instance in individuals who associate the color white with chastity and are opposed to or fear chastity.

[ 19 ] In Paul Beatty 's novel Slumberland , leukophobia refers to racism.
