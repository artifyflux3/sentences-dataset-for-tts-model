Monkwearmouth is located at the north side of the mouth of the River Wear . It was one of the three original settlements on the banks of the River Wear along with Bishopwearmouth and Sunderland. It includes the area around St. Peter's Church , founded in 674 [ 1 ] as part of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey , and was once the main centre of Wearside shipbuilding and coalmining in the town. It is now host to a campus of the University of Sunderland and the National Glass Centre .  It is served by the three Church of England churches of the Parish of Monkwearmouth . The first nineteenth-century Catholic church built in Monkwearmouth was St Benet's Church which remains active today.

Since 2002, Monkwearmouth has once again been served by rail transport, this time via St Peter's Tyne and Wear Metro station a few hundred metres south of the old station.
