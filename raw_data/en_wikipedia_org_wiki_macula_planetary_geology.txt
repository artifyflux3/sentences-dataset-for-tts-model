Macula / ˈ m æ k j ʊ l ə / [ 1 ] (pl.

maculae / ˈ m æ k j ʊ l iː / ) is the Latin word for 'spot'. It is used in planetary nomenclature to refer to unusually dark areas on the surface of a planet or moon .

[ 2 ] They are seen on the icy surfaces of Pluto , Jupiter's moon Europa , Saturn's moon Titan , Neptune's moon Triton , and Pluto's moon Charon . The term was adopted for planetary nomenclature when high resolution pictures of Europa revealed unusual new surface features.
