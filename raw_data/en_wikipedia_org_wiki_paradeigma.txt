It offers counsel on how the audience should act.

[ 1 ] Aristotle was a prominent ancient rhetorician who explicitly discussed the use of paradeigmata .

In the Greek tradition many paradeigmata are mythological examples, often in reference to a popular legend or well-known character in a similar position to the audience.

[ 2 ] Homer's The Iliad (24.601–619) – Achilles is trying to encourage Priam to eat rather than continue to weep for his dead son Hector . He brings up Niobe, a woman that had lost twelve children but still found the strength to eat.

[ 2 ] He is trying to counsel Priam to do what he should by using Niobe as a paradeigma , an example to guide behaviour.

It is also the etymological root of the English word " paradigm ".
