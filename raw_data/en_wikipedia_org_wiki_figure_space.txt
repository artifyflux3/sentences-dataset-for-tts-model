Its size can fluctuate somewhat depending on which font is being used.  This is the preferred space to use in numbers. It has the same width as a digit and keeps the number together for the purpose of line breaking.

[ 2 ] Standard [ edit ] In Unicode it is assigned U+ 2007 FIGURE SPACE . Its HTML character entity reference is &numsp; .
