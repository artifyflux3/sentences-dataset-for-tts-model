In other words, a bilinear form is a function B : V × V → K that is linear in each argument separately: B ( u + v , w ) = B ( u , w ) + B ( v , w ) and B ( λ u , v ) = λB ( u , v ) B ( u , v + w ) = B ( u , v ) + B ( u , w ) and B ( u , λ v ) = λB ( u , v ) The dot product on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is an example of a bilinear form which is also an inner product .

[ 1 ] An example of a bilinear form that is not an inner product would be the four-vector product.

The definition of a bilinear form can be extended to include modules over a ring , with linear maps replaced by module homomorphisms .

When K is the field of complex numbers C , one is often more interested in sesquilinear forms , which are similar to bilinear forms but are conjugate linear in one argument.

Coordinate representation [ edit ] Let V be an n - dimensional vector space with basis { e 1 , …, e n } .

The n × n matrix A , defined by A ij = B ( e i , e j ) is called the matrix of the bilinear form on the basis { e 1 , …, e n } .

If the n × 1 matrix x represents a vector x with respect to this basis, and similarly, the n × 1 matrix y represents another vector y , then: B ( x , y ) = x T A y = ∑ ∑ i , j = 1 n x i A i j y j .

{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} )=\mathbf {x} ^{\textsf {T}}A\mathbf {y} =\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}x_{i}A_{ij}y_{j}.} A bilinear form has different matrices on different bases. However, the matrices of a bilinear form on different bases are all congruent . More precisely, if { f 1 , …, f n } is another basis of V , then f j = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n S i , j e i , {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} _{j}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}S_{i,j}\mathbf {e} _{i},} where the S i , j {\displaystyle S_{i,j}} form an invertible matrix S . Then, the matrix of the bilinear form on the new basis is S T AS .

Properties [ edit ] Non-degenerate bilinear forms [ edit ] Further information: Degenerate bilinear form Every bilinear form B on V defines a pair of linear maps from V to its dual space V ∗ . Define B 1 , B 2 : V → V ∗ by B 1 ( v )( w ) = B ( v , w ) B 2 ( v )( w ) = B ( w , v ) This is often denoted as B 1 ( v ) = B ( v , ⋅) B 2 ( v ) = B (⋅, v ) where the dot ( ⋅ ) indicates the slot into which the argument for the resulting linear functional is to be placed (see Currying ).

For a finite-dimensional vector space V , if either of B 1 or B 2 is an isomorphism, then both are, and the bilinear form B is said to be nondegenerate .  More concretely, for a finite-dimensional vector space, non-degenerate means that every non-zero element pairs non-trivially with some other element: B ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle B(x,y)=0} for all y ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle y\in V} implies that x = 0 and B ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle B(x,y)=0} for all x ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle x\in V} implies that y = 0 .

The corresponding notion for a module over a commutative ring is that a bilinear form is unimodular if V → V ∗ is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated module over a commutative ring, the pairing may be injective (hence "nondegenerate" in the above sense) but not unimodular. For example, over the integers, the pairing B ( x , y ) = 2 xy is nondegenerate but not unimodular, as the induced map from V = Z to V ∗ = Z is multiplication by 2.

If V is finite-dimensional then one can identify V with its double dual V ∗∗ . One can then show that B 2 is the transpose of the linear map B 1 (if V is infinite-dimensional then B 2 is the transpose of B 1 restricted to the image of V in V ∗∗ ). Given B one can define the transpose of B to be the bilinear form given by t B ( v , w ) = B ( w , v ).

The left radical and right radical of the form B are the kernels of B 1 and B 2 respectively; [ 2 ] they are the vectors orthogonal to the whole space on the left and on the right.

[ 3 ] If V is finite-dimensional then the rank of B 1 is equal to the rank of B 2 . If this number is equal to dim( V ) then B 1 and B 2 are linear isomorphisms from V to V ∗ .  In this case B is nondegenerate. By the rank–nullity theorem , this is equivalent to the condition that the left and equivalently right radicals be trivial. For finite-dimensional spaces, this is often taken as the definition of nondegeneracy: Definition: B is nondegenerate if B ( v , w ) = 0 for all w implies v = 0 .

Given any linear map A : V → V ∗ one can obtain a bilinear form B on V via B ( v , w ) = A ( v )( w ).

This form will be nondegenerate if and only if A is an isomorphism.

If V is finite-dimensional then, relative to some basis for V , a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the associated matrix is zero. Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the determinant of the associated matrix is non-zero (the matrix is non-singular ). These statements are independent of the chosen basis. For a module over a commutative ring, a unimodular form is one for which the determinant of the associate matrix is a unit (for example 1), hence the term; note that a form whose matrix determinant is non-zero but not a unit will be nondegenerate but not unimodular, for example B ( x , y ) = 2 xy over the integers.

Symmetric, skew-symmetric, and alternating forms [ edit ] We define a bilinear form to be symmetric if B ( v , w ) = B ( w , v ) for all v , w in V ; alternating if B ( v , v ) = 0 for all v in V ; skew-symmetric or antisymmetric if B ( v , w ) = − B ( w , v ) for all v , w in V ; Proposition Every alternating form is skew-symmetric.

Proof This can be seen by expanding B ( v + w , v + w ) .

If the characteristic of K is not 2 then the converse is also true: every skew-symmetric form is alternating. However, if char( K ) = 2 then a skew-symmetric form is the same as a symmetric form and there exist symmetric/skew-symmetric forms that are not alternating.

A bilinear form is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric) if and only if its coordinate matrix (relative to any basis) is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric ). A bilinear form is alternating if and only if its coordinate matrix is skew-symmetric and the diagonal entries are all zero (which follows from skew-symmetry when char( K ) ≠ 2 ).

A bilinear form is symmetric if and only if the maps B 1 , B 2 : V → V ∗ are equal, and skew-symmetric if and only if they are negatives of one another. If char( K ) ≠ 2 then one can decompose a bilinear form into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric part as follows B + = 1 2 ( B + t B ) B − − = 1 2 ( B − − t B ) , {\displaystyle B^{+}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(B+{}^{\text{t}}B)\qquad B^{-}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(B-{}^{\text{t}}B),} where t B is the transpose of B (defined above).

Reflexive bilinear forms and orthogonal vectors [ edit ] Definition: A bilinear form B : V × V → K is called reflexive if B ( v , w ) = 0 implies B ( w , v ) = 0 for all v , w in V .

Definition: Let B : V × V → K be a reflexive bilinear form.

v , w in V are orthogonal with respect to B if B ( v , w ) = 0 .

A bilinear form B is reflexive if and only if it is either symmetric or alternating.

[ 4 ] In the absence of reflexivity we have to distinguish left and right orthogonality. In a reflexive space the left and right radicals agree and are termed the kernel or the radical of the bilinear form: the subspace of all vectors orthogonal with every other vector.  A vector v , with matrix representation x , is in the radical of a bilinear form with matrix representation A , if and only if Ax = 0 ⇔ x T A = 0 . The radical is always a subspace of V .  It is trivial if and only if the matrix A is nonsingular, and thus if and only if the bilinear form is nondegenerate.

Suppose W is a subspace.  Define the orthogonal complement [ 5 ] W ⊥ ⊥ = { v ∣ ∣ B ( v , w ) = 0 for all w ∈ ∈ W } .

{\displaystyle W^{\perp }=\left\{\mathbf {v} \mid B(\mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} )=0{\text{ for all }}\mathbf {w} \in W\right\}.} For a non-degenerate form on a finite-dimensional space, the map V/W → W ⊥ is bijective , and the dimension of W ⊥ is dim( V ) − dim( W ) .

Bounded and elliptic bilinear forms [ edit ] Definition: A bilinear form on a normed vector space ( V , ‖⋅‖) is bounded , if there is a constant C such that for all u , v ∈ V , B ( u , v ) ≤ ≤ C ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ .

{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {u} ,\mathbf {v} )\leq C\left\|\mathbf {u} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|.} Definition: A bilinear form on a normed vector space ( V , ‖⋅‖) is elliptic , or coercive , if there is a constant c > 0 such that for all u ∈ V , B ( u , u ) ≥ ≥ c ‖ u ‖ 2 .

{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {u} ,\mathbf {u} )\geq c\left\|\mathbf {u} \right\|^{2}.} Associated quadratic form [ edit ] Further information: Quadratic form § Definitions For any bilinear form B : V × V → K , there exists an associated quadratic form Q : V → K defined by Q : V → K : v ↦ B ( v , v ) .

When char( K ) ≠ 2 , the quadratic form Q is determined by the symmetric part of the bilinear form B and is independent of the antisymmetric part.  In this case there is a one-to-one correspondence between the symmetric part of the bilinear form and the quadratic form, and it makes sense to speak of the symmetric bilinear form associated with a quadratic form.

When char( K ) = 2 and dim V > 1 , this correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms breaks down.

Relation to tensor products [ edit ] By the universal property of the tensor product , there is a canonical correspondence between bilinear forms on V and linear maps V ⊗ V → K . If B is a bilinear form on V the corresponding linear map is given by v ⊗ w ↦ B ( v , w ) In the other direction, if F : V ⊗ V → K is a linear map the corresponding bilinear form is given by composing F with the bilinear map V × V → V ⊗ V that sends ( v , w ) to v ⊗ w .

The set of all linear maps V ⊗ V → K is the dual space of V ⊗ V , so bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of ( V ⊗ V ) ∗ which (when V is finite-dimensional) is canonically isomorphic to V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ .

Likewise, symmetric bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of (Sym 2 V ) * (dual of the second symmetric power of V ) and alternating bilinear forms as elements of (Λ 2 V ) ∗ ≃ Λ 2 V ∗ (the second exterior power of V ∗ ). If char( K ) ≠ 2 , (Sym 2 V ) * ≃ Sym 2 ( V ∗ ) .

Generalizations [ edit ] Pairs of distinct vector spaces [ edit ] Much of the theory is available for a bilinear mapping from two vector spaces over the same base field to that field B : V × W → K .

Here we still have induced linear mappings from V to W ∗ , and from W to V ∗ . It may happen that these mappings are isomorphisms; assuming finite dimensions, if one is an isomorphism, the other must be. When this occurs, B is said to be a perfect pairing .

In finite dimensions, this is equivalent to the pairing being nondegenerate (the spaces necessarily having the same dimensions). For modules (instead of vector spaces), just as how a nondegenerate form is weaker than a unimodular form, a nondegenerate pairing is a weaker notion than a perfect pairing. A pairing can be nondegenerate without being a perfect pairing, for instance Z × Z → Z via ( x , y ) ↦ 2 xy is nondegenerate, but induces multiplication by 2 on the map Z → Z ∗ .

Terminology varies in coverage of bilinear forms. For example, F. Reese Harvey discusses "eight types of inner product".

[ 6 ] To define them he uses diagonal matrices A ij having only +1 or −1 for non-zero elements. Some of the "inner products" are symplectic forms and some are sesquilinear forms or Hermitian forms . Rather than a general field K , the instances with real numbers R , complex numbers C , and quaternions H are spelled out. The bilinear form ∑ ∑ k = 1 p x k y k − − ∑ ∑ k = p + 1 n x k y k {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{p}x_{k}y_{k}-\sum _{k=p+1}^{n}x_{k}y_{k}} is called the real symmetric case and labeled R ( p , q ) , where p + q = n .  Then he articulates the connection to traditional terminology: [ 7 ] Some of the real symmetric cases are very important. The positive definite case R ( n , 0) is called Euclidean space , while the case of a single minus, R ( n −1, 1) is called Lorentzian space . If n = 4 , then Lorentzian space is also called Minkowski space or Minkowski spacetime . The special case R ( p , p ) will be referred to as the split-case .

General modules [ edit ] Given a ring R and a right R -module M and its dual module M ∗ , a mapping B : M ∗ × M → R is called a bilinear form if B ( u + v , x ) = B ( u , x ) + B ( v , x ) B ( u , x + y ) = B ( u , x ) + B ( u , y ) B ( αu , xβ ) = αB ( u , x ) β for all u , v ∈ M ∗ , all x , y ∈ M and all α , β ∈ R .

The mapping ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ : M ∗ × M → R : ( u , x ) ↦ u ( x ) is known as the natural pairing , also called the canonical bilinear form on M ∗ × M .

[ 8 ] A linear map S : M ∗ → M ∗ : u ↦ S ( u ) induces the bilinear form B : M ∗ × M → R : ( u , x ) ↦ ⟨ S ( u ), x ⟩ , and a linear map T : M → M : x ↦ T ( x ) induces the bilinear form B : M ∗ × M → R : ( u , x ) ↦ ⟨ u , T ( x )⟩ .

Conversely, a bilinear form B : M ∗ × M → R induces the R -linear maps S : M ∗ → M ∗ : u ↦ ( x ↦ B ( u , x )) and T ′ : M → M ∗∗ : x ↦ ( u ↦ B ( u , x )) .  Here, M ∗∗ denotes the double dual of M .
