The original space X is in blue, and the collapsed end point v is in green.

In topology , especially algebraic topology , the cone of a topological space X {\displaystyle X} is intuitively obtained by stretching X into a cylinder and then collapsing one of its end faces to a point. The cone of X is denoted by C X {\displaystyle CX} or by cone ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {cone} (X)} .

Definitions [ edit ] Formally, the cone of X is defined as: C X = ( X × × [ 0 , 1 ] ) ∪ ∪ p v = lim → → ⁡ ⁡ ( ( X × × [ 0 , 1 ] ) ↩ ↩ ( X × × { 0 } ) → p v ) , {\displaystyle CX=(X\times [0,1])\cup _{p}v\ =\ \varinjlim {\bigl (}(X\times [0,1])\hookleftarrow (X\times \{0\})\xrightarrow {p} v{\bigr )},} where v {\displaystyle v} is a point (called the vertex of the cone) and p {\displaystyle p} is the projection to that point. In other words, it is the result of attaching the cylinder X × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle X\times [0,1]} by its face X × × { 0 } {\displaystyle X\times \{0\}} to a point v {\displaystyle v} along the projection p : ( X × × { 0 } ) → → v {\displaystyle p:{\bigl (}X\times \{0\}{\bigr )}\to v} .

If X {\displaystyle X} is a non-empty compact subspace of Euclidean space , the cone on X {\displaystyle X} is homeomorphic to the union of segments from X {\displaystyle X} to any fixed point v ∉ X {\displaystyle v\not \in X} such that these segments intersect only in v {\displaystyle v} itself. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.

The cone is a special case of a join : C X ≃ ≃ X ⋆ ⋆ { v } = {\displaystyle CX\simeq X\star \{v\}=} the join of X {\displaystyle X} with a single point v ∉ X {\displaystyle v\not \in X} .

[ 1 ] : 76 Examples [ edit ] Here we often use a geometric cone ( C X {\displaystyle CX} where X {\displaystyle X} is a non-empty compact subspace of Euclidean space ). The considered spaces are compact, so we get the same result up to homeomorphism.

The cone over a point p of the real line is a line-segment in R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} , { p } × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \{p\}\times [0,1]} .

The cone over two points {0, 1} is a "V" shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.

The cone over a closed interval I of the real line is a filled-in triangle (with one of the edges being I ), otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example).

The cone over a polygon P is a pyramid with base P .

The cone over a disk is the solid cone of classical geometry (hence the concept's name).

The cone over a circle given by { ( x , y , z ) ∈ ∈ R 3 ∣ ∣ x 2 + y 2 = 1 and z = 0 } {\displaystyle \{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=1{\mbox{ and }}z=0\}} is the curved surface of the solid cone: { ( x , y , z ) ∈ ∈ R 3 ∣ ∣ x 2 + y 2 = ( z − − 1 ) 2 and 0 ≤ ≤ z ≤ ≤ 1 } .

{\displaystyle \{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=(z-1)^{2}{\mbox{ and }}0\leq z\leq 1\}.} This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed disc .

More general examples: [ 1 ] : 77, Exercise.1 The cone over an n -sphere is homeomorphic to the closed ( n + 1)- ball .

The cone over an n -ball is also homeomorphic to the closed ( n + 1)- ball .

The cone over an n - simplex is an ( n + 1)-simplex.

Properties [ edit ] All cones are path-connected since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is contractible to the vertex point by the homotopy h t ( x , s ) = ( x , ( 1 − − t ) s ) {\displaystyle h_{t}(x,s)=(x,(1-t)s)} .

The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a subspace of a contractible space.

When X is compact and Hausdorff (essentially, when X can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone C X {\displaystyle CX} can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of X to a single point. However, this picture fails when X is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the quotient topology on C X {\displaystyle CX} will be finer than the set of lines joining X to a point.

Cone functor [ edit ] The map X ↦ ↦ C X {\displaystyle X\mapsto CX} induces a functor C : : T o p → → T o p {\displaystyle C\colon \mathbf {Top} \to \mathbf {Top} } on the category of topological spaces Top . If f : : X → → Y {\displaystyle f\colon X\to Y} is a continuous map , then C f : : C X → → C Y {\displaystyle Cf\colon CX\to CY} is defined by ( C f ) ( [ x , t ] ) = [ f ( x ) , t ] {\displaystyle (Cf)([x,t])=[f(x),t]} , where square brackets denote equivalence classes .

Reduced cone [ edit ] If ( X , x 0 ) {\displaystyle (X,x_{0})} is a pointed space , there is a related construction, the reduced cone , given by ( X × × [ 0 , 1 ] ) / ( X × × { 0 } ∪ ∪ { x 0 } × × [ 0 , 1 ] ) {\displaystyle (X\times [0,1])/(X\times \left\{0\right\}\cup \left\{x_{0}\right\}\times [0,1])} where we take the basepoint of the reduced cone to be the equivalence class of ( x 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (x_{0},0)} . With this definition, the natural inclusion x ↦ ↦ ( x , 1 ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto (x,1)} becomes a based map.  This construction also gives a functor, from the category of pointed spaces to itself.
