Two graphs of linear equations in two variables

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **linear equation** is an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") that may be put in the form ![Image 2: {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+\ldots +a_{n}x_{n}+b=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d0da59e579820c9411a672c6c8f6875ba1ebb42) where ![Image 3: {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/737e02a5fbf8bc31d443c91025339f9fd1de1065) are the [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") (or [unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_(mathematics) "Unknown (mathematics)")), and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle b,a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55ac23436a15ffd304f7e517bf39be74349a7d77) are the [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient"), which are often [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). The coefficients may be considered as [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") of the equation and may be arbitrary [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)"), provided they do not contain any of the variables. To yield a meaningful equation, the coefficients ![Image 5: {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/451345cc97e2ed923dd4656fcc400c3f37119cca) are required to not all be zero.

Alternatively, a linear equation can be obtained by equating to zero a [linear polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polynomial "Linear polynomial") over some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), from which the coefficients are taken.

The [solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(equation) "Solution (equation)") of such an equation are the values that, when substituted for the unknowns, make the equality true.

In the case of just one variable, there is exactly one solution (provided that ![Image 6: {\displaystyle a_{1}\neq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca0cb76be1c21f4095283507101dd150421d2545)). Often, the term _linear equation_ refers implicitly to this particular case, in which the variable is sensibly called the _unknown_.

In the case of two variables, each solution may be interpreted as the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of a point of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"). The solutions of a linear equation form a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") in the Euclidean plane, and, conversely, every line can be viewed as the set of all solutions of a linear equation in two variables. This is the origin of the term _linear_ for describing this type of equation. More generally, the solutions of a linear equation in n variables form a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") (a subspace of dimension _n_ − 1) in the [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension n.

Linear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), partly because [non-linear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_system "Non-linear system") are often well approximated by linear equations.

This article considers the case of a single equation with coefficients from the field of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), for which one studies the real solutions. All of its content applies to [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") solutions and, more generally, to linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"). For the case of several simultaneous linear equations, see [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations").

A linear equation in one variable x can be written as ![Image 7: {\displaystyle ax+b=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24c9bc1b62401c506342ffa0379ae0fa21b541b3) with ![Image 8: {\displaystyle a\neq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f455a7f96d74aa94573d8e32da3b240ab0aa294f).

The solution is ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x=-{\frac {b}{a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f69b3a56e21089fa827bd342240d21596f915271).

A linear equation in two variables x and y can be written as ![Image 10: {\displaystyle ax+by+c=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7a398e525ff3fd08bd82d747bcaea037f6158f2) where a and b are not both 0.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-1)

If a and b are real numbers, it has infinitely many solutions.

If _b_ ≠ 0, the equation

![Image 11: {\displaystyle ax+by+c=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26ffa3f9c01bec425db7c1acc330497b6831697b)
is a linear equation in the single variable y for every value of x. It therefore has a unique solution for y, which is given by

![Image 12: {\displaystyle y=-{\frac {a}{b}}x-{\frac {c}{b}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9fc436566f1bb896bb35ca050a8712c9ef956f5)
This defines a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"). The [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of this function is a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") with [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_(mathematics) "Slope (mathematics)")![Image 13: {\displaystyle -{\frac {a}{b}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07a1b25c2a624442bd2a2a60ed363c51b78f3870) and [y-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept "Y-intercept")![Image 14: {\displaystyle -{\frac {c}{b}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16685025ab01a7d231d6e864cada82b2f2d1f085) The functions whose graph is a line are generally called _linear functions_ in the context of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). However, in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function") is a function that maps a sum to the sum of the images of the summands. So, for this definition, the above function is linear only when _c_ = 0, that is when the line passes through the origin. To avoid confusion, the functions whose graph is an arbitrary line are often called _[affine functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine\_function "Affine function")_, and the linear functions such that _c_ = 0 are often called _[linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_map "Linear map")_.

### Geometric interpretation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_equation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Geometric interpretation")]

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/X_is_a.svg/250px-X_is_a.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X_is_a.svg)

Vertical line of equation _x_ = _a_

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Y_is_b.svg/250px-Y_is_b.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Y_is_b.svg)

Horizontal line of equation _y_ = _b_

Each solution (_x_, _y_) of a linear equation

![Image 17: {\displaystyle ax+by+c=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26ffa3f9c01bec425db7c1acc330497b6831697b)
may be viewed as the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of a point in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"). With this interpretation, all solutions of the equation form a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), provided that a and b are not both zero. Conversely, every line is the set of all solutions of a linear equation.

The phrase "linear equation" takes its origin in this correspondence between lines and equations: a _linear equation_ in two variables is an equation whose solutions form a line.

If _b_ ≠ 0, the line is the [graph of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of x that has been defined in the preceding section. If _b_ = 0, the line is a _vertical line_ (that is a line parallel to the y-axis) of equation ![Image 18: {\displaystyle x=-{\frac {c}{a}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4354b65a3f02647f6e1491783aef758a9d6c34f) which is not the graph of a function of x.

Similarly, if _a_ ≠ 0, the line is the graph of a function of y, and, if _a_ = 0, one has a horizontal line of equation ![Image 19: {\displaystyle y=-{\frac {c}{b}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bbef564e8862ab18bc9a770ef4c0ce5863b6643)

There are various ways of defining a line. In the following subsections, a linear equation of the line is given in each case.

#### Slope–intercept form or Gradient-intercept form

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_equation&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Slope–intercept form or Gradient-intercept form")]

A non-vertical line can be defined by its slope m, and its y-intercept _y_ 0 (the y coordinate of its intersection with the y-axis). In this case, its _linear equation_ can be written

![Image 20: {\displaystyle y=mx+y_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acca7539441788b0def09d71fc9937b6debac213)
If, moreover, the line is not horizontal, it can be defined by its slope and its x-intercept _x_ 0. In this case, its equation can be written

![Image 21: {\displaystyle y=m(x-x_{0}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2341f92f6d3a753a56801586fc490082e8531229)
or, equivalently,

![Image 22: {\displaystyle y=mx-mx_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f2b8d0643e42b85040de53fed1b39fd08274ad79)
These forms rely on the habit of considering a nonvertical line as the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-2) For a line given by an equation

![Image 23: {\displaystyle ax+by+c=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7a398e525ff3fd08bd82d747bcaea037f6158f2)
these forms can be easily deduced from the relations

![Image 24: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}m&=-{\frac {a}{b}},\\x_{0}&=-{\frac {c}{a}},\\y_{0}&=-{\frac {c}{b}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/620c850d32c7a2010a55c0d0d84bb16cae1a82a6)

#### Point–slope form or Point-gradient form

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_equation&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Point–slope form or Point-gradient form")]

A non-vertical line can be defined by its slope m, and the coordinates ![Image 25: {\displaystyle x_{1},y_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73f24dd8ba3d61f54a1d4c80fb85ede00a915a85) of any point of the line. In this case, a linear equation of the line is

![Image 26: {\displaystyle y=y_{1}+m(x-x_{1}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46ff9d073566fd9e28dac07c3de01db1b4734554)
or

![Image 27: {\displaystyle y=mx+y_{1}-mx_{1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa50ff7438f4bd32582e818ea97fd7086d5c1672)
This equation can also be written

![Image 28: {\displaystyle y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6756ad5943432d2b4ca4f77734bda1e024a52d7)
to emphasize that the slope of a line can be computed from the coordinates of any two points.

A line that is not parallel to an axis and does not pass through the origin cuts the axes into two different points. The intercept values _x_ 0 and _y_ 0 of these two points are nonzero, and an equation of the line is[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-WilsonTracey-3)

![Image 29: {\displaystyle {\frac {x}{x_{0}}}+{\frac {y}{y_{0}}}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/296c55b4b420e769d364507d00e48614ee53bf80)
(It is easy to verify that the line defined by this equation has _x_ 0 and _y_ 0 as intercept values).

Given two different points (_x_ 1, _y_ 1) and (_x_ 2, _y_ 2), there is exactly one line that passes through them. There are several ways to write a linear equation of this line.

If _x_ 1 ≠ _x_ 2, the slope of the line is ![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8abcb13c1104340b815ae87d21c7256f58889292) Thus, a point-slope form is[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-WilsonTracey-3)

![Image 31: {\displaystyle y-y_{1}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}(x-x_{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b0f7cd92da2db00c2e67b68d2d4bbf10ff24110)
By [clearing denominators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_denominators "Clearing denominators"), one gets the equation

![Image 32: {\displaystyle (x_{2}-x_{1})(y-y_{1})-(y_{2}-y_{1})(x-x_{1})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f657c5ef46280602e0007f25f0b17b69cfd22e19)
which is valid also when _x_ 1 = _x_ 2 (to verify this, it suffices to verify that the two given points satisfy the equation).

This form is not symmetric in the two given points, but a symmetric form can be obtained by regrouping the constant terms:

![Image 33: {\displaystyle (y_{1}-y_{2})x+(x_{2}-x_{1})y+(x_{1}y_{2}-x_{2}y_{1})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd1482a5800255b86ecaf2af57fe1033b3367ea)
(exchanging the two points changes the sign of the left-hand side of the equation).

The two-point form of the equation of a line can be expressed simply in terms of a [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant"). There are two common ways for that.

The equation ![Image 34: {\displaystyle (x_{2}-x_{1})(y-y_{1})-(y_{2}-y_{1})(x-x_{1})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80b7f31e7c00b8541a6657bbd44f538056fbef4b) is the result of expanding the determinant in the equation

![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}x-x_{1}&y-y_{1}\\x_{2}-x_{1}&y_{2}-y_{1}\end{vmatrix}}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02830094c1f2750f574d95d4c838abe80513f898)
The equation ![Image 36: {\displaystyle (y_{1}-y_{2})x+(x_{2}-x_{1})y+(x_{1}y_{2}-x_{2}y_{1})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd1482a5800255b86ecaf2af57fe1033b3367ea) can be obtained by expanding with respect to its first row the determinant in the equation

![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}x&y&1\\x_{1}&y_{1}&1\\x_{2}&y_{2}&1\end{vmatrix}}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac1503cda74a34e90822f8431d535b0f3b1c2b4d)
Besides being very simple and mnemonic, this form has the advantage of being a special case of the more general equation of a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") passing through n points in a space of dimension _n_ − 1. These equations rely on the condition of [linear dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_dependence "Linear dependence") of points in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space").

More than two variables
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linear_equation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: More than two variables")]

A linear equation with more than two variables may always be assumed to have the form

![Image 38: {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}+b=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/440f1e739445deeff17f9ed4c9607a4fcc4abee4)
The coefficient b, often denoted _a_ 0 is called the _constant term_ (sometimes the _absolute term_ in old books[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#cite_note-5)). Depending on the context, the term _coefficient_ can be reserved for the _a_ _i_ with _i_> 0.

When dealing with ![Image 39: {\displaystyle n=3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c5a5a42ced00df920fad4ab2d4acdb960a4105b) variables, it is common to use ![Image 40: {\displaystyle x,\;y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ea71915567f808efa72a6699807b9efb9932d29) and ![Image 41: {\displaystyle z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf368e72c009decd9b6686ee84a375632e11de98) instead of indexed variables.

A solution of such an equation is a n-tuple such that substituting each element of the tuple for the corresponding variable transforms the equation into a true equality.

For an equation to be meaningful, the coefficient of at least one variable must be non-zero. If every variable has a zero coefficient, then, as mentioned for one variable, the equation is either _inconsistent_ (for _b_ ≠ 0) as having no solution, or all n-tuples are solutions.

The n-tuples that are solutions of a linear equation in n variables are the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of the points of an (_n_ − 1)-dimensional [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") in an n-dimensional[Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") (or [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") if the coefficients are complex numbers or belong to any field). In the case of three variables, this hyperplane is a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)").

If a linear equation is given with _a_ _j_ ≠ 0, then the equation can be solved for _x_ _j_, yielding

![Image 42: {\displaystyle x_{j}=-{\frac {b}{a_{j}}}-\sum _{i\in \{1,\ldots ,n\},i\neq j}{\frac {a_{i}}{a_{j}}}x_{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7678d35209dff0dbbafa4bbc7f5151e9884cc9d3)
If the coefficients are [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), this defines a [real-valued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-valued_function "Real-valued function")[function of n real variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_several_real_variables "Function of several real variables").
