Muller Robert Andrew Rohde is an American physicist and former graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley , where he studied under Richard A. Muller . He received his PhD in 2010 with a thesis entitled "The Development and Use of the Berkeley Fluorescence Spectrometer to Characterize Microbial Content and Detect Volcanic Ash in Glacial Ice." [ 1 ] He is also the founder of the website Global Warming Art [ 2 ] and a Wikipedia editor under the username "Dragons Flight".

[ 3 ] Research [ edit ] While a grad student, Rohde and Muller published a letter to Nature on the topic of mass extinctions throughout Earth's history. Rohde et al. found that such extinctions occur surprisingly regularly, about every 62 million years.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] During this time, he also published two papers regarding microbial metabolism in ice crystals.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] This research, which showed that microbes can survive in such conditions for up to 100,000 years, was reported on by New Scientist at the time of its publication.

[ 8 ] Starting in 2011, Rohde has attracted media attention because of his role in the Berkeley Earth project (also known as "BEST") as the lead scientist, [ 9 ] and was responsible for writing software that searched databases for global temperature records, compiled the records, and merged them into a global temperature record, a task that Muller compared to "Hercules's enormous task of cleaning the Augean stables ." [ 10 ] With regard to Rohde's role in BEST, Muller also said that Rohde was responsible for extending the temperature record determined by the project back to 1753.

[ 11 ] In 2015, he and Muller co-authored another study that found that air pollution in China was responsible for the early deaths of 1.6 million people each year.

It came as a bigger surprise over the last three to six months when our young scientist Robert Rohde was able to adopt really excellent statistical methods and push the record back to 1753.
