It rigorously defines the idea of a non-trivial "restriction" of a measure to a measure zero subset of the measure space in question. It is related to the existence of conditional probability measures . In a sense, "disintegration" is the opposite process to the construction of a product measure .

Motivation [ edit ] Consider the unit square S = [ 0 , 1 ] × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle S=[0,1]\times [0,1]} in the Euclidean plane R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} . Consider the probability measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } defined on S {\displaystyle S} by the restriction of two-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ λ 2 {\displaystyle \lambda ^{2}} to S {\displaystyle S} . That is, the probability of an event E ⊆ ⊆ S {\displaystyle E\subseteq S} is simply the area of E {\displaystyle E} . We assume E {\displaystyle E} is a measurable subset of S {\displaystyle S} .

Consider a one-dimensional subset of S {\displaystyle S} such as the line segment L x = { x } × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle L_{x}=\{x\}\times [0,1]} .

L x {\displaystyle L_{x}} has μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measure zero; every subset of L x {\displaystyle L_{x}} is a μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } - null set ; since the Lebesgue measure space is a complete measure space , E ⊆ ⊆ L x ⟹ ⟹ μ μ ( E ) = 0.

{\displaystyle E\subseteq L_{x}\implies \mu (E)=0.} While true, this is somewhat unsatisfying. It would be nice to say that μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } "restricted to" L x {\displaystyle L_{x}} is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ λ 1 {\displaystyle \lambda ^{1}} , rather than the zero measure . The probability of a "two-dimensional" event E {\displaystyle E} could then be obtained as an integral of the one-dimensional probabilities of the vertical "slices" E ∩ ∩ L x {\displaystyle E\cap L_{x}} : more formally, if μ μ x {\displaystyle \mu _{x}} denotes one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on L x {\displaystyle L_{x}} , then μ μ ( E ) = ∫ ∫ [ 0 , 1 ] μ μ x ( E ∩ ∩ L x ) d x {\displaystyle \mu (E)=\int _{[0,1]}\mu _{x}(E\cap L_{x})\,\mathrm {d} x} for any "nice" E ⊆ ⊆ S {\displaystyle E\subseteq S} . The disintegration theorem makes this argument rigorous in the context of measures on metric spaces .

Statement of the theorem [ edit ] (Hereafter, P ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X)} will denote the collection of Borel probability measures on a topological space ( X , T ) {\displaystyle (X,T)} .)
The assumptions of the theorem are as follows: Let Y {\displaystyle Y} and X {\displaystyle X} be two Radon spaces (i.e. a topological space such that every Borel probability measure on it is inner regular , e.g.

separably metrizable spaces; in particular, every probability measure on it is outright a Radon measure ).

Let μ μ ∈ ∈ P ( Y ) {\displaystyle \mu \in {\mathcal {P}}(Y)} .

Let π π : Y → → X {\displaystyle \pi :Y\to X} be a Borel- measurable function . Here one should think of π π {\displaystyle \pi } as a function to "disintegrate" Y {\displaystyle Y} , in the sense of partitioning Y {\displaystyle Y} into { π π − − 1 ( x ) | x ∈ ∈ X } {\displaystyle \{\pi ^{-1}(x)\ |\ x\in X\}} . For example, for the motivating example above, one can define π π ( ( a , b ) ) = a {\displaystyle \pi ((a,b))=a} , ( a , b ) ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle (a,b)\in [0,1]\times [0,1]} , which gives that π π − − 1 ( a ) = a × × [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(a)=a\times [0,1]} , a slice we want to capture.

Let ν ν ∈ ∈ P ( X ) {\displaystyle \nu \in {\mathcal {P}}(X)} be the pushforward measure ν ν = π π ∗ ∗ ( μ μ ) = μ μ ∘ ∘ π π − − 1 {\displaystyle \nu =\pi _{*}(\mu )=\mu \circ \pi ^{-1}} . This measure provides the distribution of x {\displaystyle x} (which corresponds to the events π π − − 1 ( x ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(x)} ).

The conclusion of the theorem: There exists a ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } - almost everywhere uniquely determined family of probability measures { μ μ x } x ∈ ∈ X ⊆ ⊆ P ( Y ) {\displaystyle \{\mu _{x}\}_{x\in X}\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}(Y)} , which provides a "disintegration" of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } into { μ μ x } x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle \{\mu _{x}\}_{x\in X}} , such that: the function x ↦ ↦ μ μ x {\displaystyle x\mapsto \mu _{x}} is Borel measurable, in the sense that x ↦ ↦ μ μ x ( B ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto \mu _{x}(B)} is a Borel-measurable function for each Borel-measurable set B ⊆ ⊆ Y {\displaystyle B\subseteq Y} ; μ μ x {\displaystyle \mu _{x}} "lives on" the fiber π π − − 1 ( x ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(x)} : for ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } - almost all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , μ μ x ( Y ∖ ∖ π π − − 1 ( x ) ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \mu _{x}\left(Y\setminus \pi ^{-1}(x)\right)=0,} and so μ μ x ( E ) = μ μ x ( E ∩ ∩ π π − − 1 ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \mu _{x}(E)=\mu _{x}(E\cap \pi ^{-1}(x))} ; for every Borel-measurable function f : Y → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle f:Y\to [0,\infty ]} , ∫ ∫ Y f ( y ) d μ μ ( y ) = ∫ ∫ X ∫ ∫ π π − − 1 ( x ) f ( y ) d μ μ x ( y ) d ν ν ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{Y}f(y)\,\mathrm {d} \mu (y)=\int _{X}\int _{\pi ^{-1}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm {d} \mu _{x}(y)\,\mathrm {d} \nu (x).} In particular, for any event E ⊆ ⊆ Y {\displaystyle E\subseteq Y} , taking f {\displaystyle f} to be the indicator function of E {\displaystyle E} , [ 1 ] μ μ ( E ) = ∫ ∫ X μ μ x ( E ) d ν ν ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (E)=\int _{X}\mu _{x}(E)\,\mathrm {d} \nu (x).} Applications [ edit ] Product spaces [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

( May 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The original example was a special case of the problem of product spaces, to which the disintegration theorem applies.

When Y {\displaystyle Y} is written as a Cartesian product Y = X 1 × × X 2 {\displaystyle Y=X_{1}\times X_{2}} and π π i : Y → → X i {\displaystyle \pi _{i}:Y\to X_{i}} is the natural projection , then each fibre π π 1 − − 1 ( x 1 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}^{-1}(x_{1})} can be canonically identified with X 2 {\displaystyle X_{2}} and there exists a Borel family of probability measures { μ μ x 1 } x 1 ∈ ∈ X 1 {\displaystyle \{\mu _{x_{1}}\}_{x_{1}\in X_{1}}} in P ( X 2 ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X_{2})} (which is ( π π 1 ) ∗ ∗ ( μ μ ) {\displaystyle (\pi _{1})_{*}(\mu )} -almost everywhere uniquely determined) such that μ μ = ∫ ∫ X 1 μ μ x 1 μ μ ( π π 1 − − 1 ( d x 1 ) ) = ∫ ∫ X 1 μ μ x 1 d ( π π 1 ) ∗ ∗ ( μ μ ) ( x 1 ) , {\displaystyle \mu =\int _{X_{1}}\mu _{x_{1}}\,\mu \left(\pi _{1}^{-1}(\mathrm {d} x_{1})\right)=\int _{X_{1}}\mu _{x_{1}}\,\mathrm {d} (\pi _{1})_{*}(\mu )(x_{1}),} which is in particular [ clarification needed ] ∫ ∫ X 1 × × X 2 f ( x 1 , x 2 ) μ μ ( d x 1 , d x 2 ) = ∫ ∫ X 1 ( ∫ ∫ X 2 f ( x 1 , x 2 ) μ μ ( d x 2 ∣ ∣ x 1 ) ) μ μ ( π π 1 − − 1 ( d x 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \int _{X_{1}\times X_{2}}f(x_{1},x_{2})\,\mu (\mathrm {d} x_{1},\mathrm {d} x_{2})=\int _{X_{1}}\left(\int _{X_{2}}f(x_{1},x_{2})\mu (\mathrm {d} x_{2}\mid x_{1})\right)\mu \left(\pi _{1}^{-1}(\mathrm {d} x_{1})\right)} and μ μ ( A × × B ) = ∫ ∫ A μ μ ( B ∣ ∣ x 1 ) μ μ ( π π 1 − − 1 ( d x 1 ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (A\times B)=\int _{A}\mu \left(B\mid x_{1}\right)\,\mu \left(\pi _{1}^{-1}(\mathrm {d} x_{1})\right).} The relation to conditional expectation is given by the identities E ⁡ ⁡ ( f ∣ ∣ π π 1 ) ( x 1 ) = ∫ ∫ X 2 f ( x 1 , x 2 ) μ μ ( d x 2 ∣ ∣ x 1 ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} (f\mid \pi _{1})(x_{1})=\int _{X_{2}}f(x_{1},x_{2})\mu (\mathrm {d} x_{2}\mid x_{1}),} μ μ ( A × × B ∣ ∣ π π 1 ) ( x 1 ) = 1 A ( x 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ μ μ ( B ∣ ∣ x 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (A\times B\mid \pi _{1})(x_{1})=1_{A}(x_{1})\cdot \mu (B\mid x_{1}).} Vector calculus [ edit ] The disintegration theorem can also be seen as justifying the use of a "restricted" measure in vector calculus . For instance, in Stokes' theorem as applied to a vector field flowing through a compact surface Σ Σ ⊂ ⊂ R 3 {\displaystyle \Sigma \subset \mathbb {R} ^{3}} , it is implicit that the "correct" measure on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is the disintegration of three-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ λ 3 {\displaystyle \lambda ^{3}} on Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } , and that the disintegration of this measure on ∂Σ is the same as the disintegration of λ λ 3 {\displaystyle \lambda ^{3}} on ∂ ∂ Σ Σ {\displaystyle \partial \Sigma } .

[ 2 ] Conditional distributions [ edit ] The disintegration theorem can be applied to give a rigorous treatment of conditional probability distributions in statistics, while avoiding purely abstract formulations of conditional probability.

[ 3 ] The theorem is related to the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox , for example.
