The **timeline of quantum mechanics** is a list of key events in the [history of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics "History of quantum mechanics"), [quantum field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") and [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry").

The initiation of [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum") science occurred in 1900,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-3) originating from the problem of [the oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation#Quantum_mechanical "Oscillation") beginning during the mid-19th century.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-4)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Becquerel_plate.jpg/250px-Becquerel_plate.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Becquerel_plate.jpg)

Image of Becquerel's photographic plate that has been fogged by exposure to radiation from a uranium salt. The shadow of a metal [Maltese Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_Cross_(symbol) "Maltese Cross (symbol)") placed between the plate and the uranium salt is clearly visible.

*   1801 – [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") establishes the wave nature of light with his [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_interference_experiment "Young's interference experiment").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-6)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-8)
*   1859 – [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff") introduces the concept of a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody "Blackbody") and proves that its emission spectrum depends only on its temperature.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)
*   1860–1900 – [Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Eduard_Boltzmann "Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann"), [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") and others develop the theory of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). Boltzmann argues that [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") is a measure of disorder.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)
*   1877 – Boltzmann suggests that the energy levels of a physical system could be discrete based on statistical mechanics and mathematical arguments; also produces the first circle diagram representation, or atomic model of a molecule (such as an iodine gas molecule) in terms of the overlapping terms α and β, later (in 1928) called molecular orbitals, of the constituting atoms.
*   1885 – [Johann Jakob Balmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Balmer "Johann Jakob Balmer") discovers a numerical relationship between visible spectral lines of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), the [Balmer series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series "Balmer series").
*   1887 – [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") discovers the photoelectric effect, shown by Einstein in 1905 to involve _quanta_ of light.
*   1888 – Hertz demonstrates experimentally that electromagnetic waves exist, as predicted by Maxwell.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)
*   1888 – [Johannes Rydberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydberg "Johannes Rydberg") modifies the Balmer formula to include all spectral series of lines for the hydrogen atom, producing the Rydberg formula that is employed later by [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") and others to verify Bohr's first quantum model of the atom.
*   1895 – [Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen") discovers X-rays in experiments with electron beams in plasma.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)
*   1896 – [Antoine Henri Becquerel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Henri_Becquerel "Antoine Henri Becquerel") accidentally discovers [radioactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity") while investigating the work of [Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen"); he finds that uranium salts emit radiation that resembled Röntgen's X-rays in their penetrating power. In one experiment, Becquerel wraps a sample of a phosphorescent substance, potassium uranyl sulfate, in photographic plates surrounded by very thick black paper in preparation for an experiment with bright sunlight; then, to his surprise, the photographic plates are already exposed before the experiment starts, showing a projected image of his sample.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-10)
*   1896–1897 – [Pieter Zeeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Zeeman "Pieter Zeeman") first observes the [Zeeman splitting effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect "Zeeman effect") by applying a magnetic field to light sources.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Zeeman-11)
*   1896–1897 – [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie "Marie Curie") (née Skłodowska, Becquerel's doctoral student) investigates uranium salt samples using a very sensitive [electrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrometer "Electrometer") device that was invented 15 years before by her husband and his brother Jacques Curie to measure electrical charge. She discovers that rays emitted by the uranium salt samples make the surrounding air electrically conductive, and measures the emitted rays' intensity. In April 1898, through a systematic search of substances, she finds that [thorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium "Thorium") compounds, like those of uranium, emitted "Becquerel rays", thus preceding the work of [Frederick Soddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy "Frederick Soddy") and [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") on the nuclear decay of thorium to [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") by three years.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-12)
*   1897: 
    *   [Ivan Borgman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Borgman "Ivan Borgman") demonstrates that [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") and [radioactive materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_material "Radioactive material") induce [thermoluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence "Thermoluminescence").
    *   [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson")'s experimentation with [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray "Cathode ray") led him to suggest a fundamental unit more than a 1,000 times smaller than an atom, based on the high [charge-to-mass ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-to-mass_ratio "Charge-to-mass ratio"). He called the particle a "corpuscle", but later scientists preferred the term [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron").
    *   [Joseph Larmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Larmor "Joseph Larmor") explained the splitting of the [spectral lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") in a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") by the [oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") of electrons.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-13)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-14)
    *   Larmor, created the first solar system model of the atom in 1897. He also postulated the proton, calling it a "positive electron". He said the destruction of this type of atom making up matter "is an occurrence of infinitely small probability".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-15)

*   1899–1903 – [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") investigates radioactivity. He coins the terms [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_ray "Alpha ray") and [beta rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_ray "Beta ray") in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of radiation emitted by [thorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium "Thorium") and [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") salts. Rutherford is joined at McGill University in 1900 by [Frederick Soddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy "Frederick Soddy") and together they discover [nuclear transmutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation "Nuclear transmutation") when they find in 1902 that radioactive thorium is converting itself into [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium "Radium") through a process of [nuclear decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decay "Nuclear decay") and a gas (later found to be 4

2 He); they report their interpretation of radioactivity in 1903.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-16) Rutherford becomes known as the "father of [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics")" with his [nuclear atom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model "Rutherford model") of 1911.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-17)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Einstein_patentoffice.jpg/250px-Einstein_patentoffice.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein_patentoffice.jpg)

Einstein, in 1905, when he wrote the [_Annus Mirabilis_ papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers "Annus Mirabilis papers")

*   1900 – To explain [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation") (1862), [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") suggests that electromagnetic energy could only be emitted in quantized form, i.e. the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit _E_ = _hν_, where _h_ is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") and _ν_ is the frequency of the radiation.
*   1902 – To explain the [octet rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule "Octet rule") (1893), [Gilbert N. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis") develops the "[cubical atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubical_atom "Cubical atom")" theory in which electrons in the form of dots are positioned at the corner of a cube. Predicts that single, double, or triple "[bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond")" result when two atoms are held together by multiple pairs of electrons (one pair for each bond) located between the two atoms.
*   1903 – Antoine Becquerel, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie share the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on [spontaneous radioactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity").
*   1904 – [Richard Abegg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Abegg "Richard Abegg") notes the pattern that the numerical difference between the maximum positive valence, such as +6 for H 2 SO 4, and the maximum negative valence, such as −2 for H 2 S, of an element tends to be eight ([Abegg's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abegg%27s_rule "Abegg's rule")).
*   1905: 
    *   [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") explains the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") (reported in 1887 by [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz")), i.e. that shining light on certain materials can function to eject electrons from the material. He postulates, as based on Planck's quantum hypothesis (1900), that light itself consists of individual quantum particles (photons).
    *   Einstein explains the effects of [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion") as caused by the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") (i.e., movement) of atoms, which was subsequently, experimentally verified by [Jean Baptiste Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin "Jean Baptiste Perrin"), thereby settling the century-long dispute about the validity of [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton")'s [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory").
    *   Einstein publishes his [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity")
    *   Einstein theoretically derives the [equivalence of matter and energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_of_matter_and_energy "Equivalence of matter and energy").

*   1907 to 1917 – Ernest Rutherford: To test his _planetary_ model of 1904, later known as the [Rutherford model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model "Rutherford model"), he sent a beam of positively charged [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") onto a gold foil and noticed that some bounced back, thus showing that an atom has a small-sized positively charged [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") at its center. However, he received in 1908 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances",[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-18) which followed on the work of Marie Curie, not for his planetary model of the atom; he is also widely credited with first "splitting the atom" in 1917. In 1911 Ernest Rutherford explained the [Geiger–Marsden experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment "Geiger–Marsden experiment") by invoking a [nuclear atom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory") and derived the [Rutherford cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics) "Cross section (physics)").
*   1909 – [Geoffrey Ingram Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Ingram_Taylor "Geoffrey Ingram Taylor") demonstrates that interference patterns of light were generated even when the light energy introduced consisted of only one photon. This discovery of the [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality") of matter and energy is fundamental to the later development of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").
*   1909 and 1916 – Einstein shows that, if [Planck's law of black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law_of_black-body_radiation "Planck's law of black-body radiation") is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")_p_ = _h_ / _λ_, making them full-fledged [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle").

*   1911: 
    *   [Lise Meitner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner "Lise Meitner") and [Otto Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn "Otto Hahn") perform an experiment that shows that the energies of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") emitted by [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay") had a continuous rather than discrete spectrum. This is in apparent contradiction to the law of conservation of energy, as it appeared that energy was lost in the beta decay process. A second problem is that the spin of the [nitrogen-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen-14 "Nitrogen-14") atom was 1, in contradiction to the Rutherford prediction of 1⁄2. These anomalies are later explained by the discoveries of the [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") and the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron").
    *   [Ștefan Procopiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98tefan_Procopiu "Ștefan Procopiu") performs experiments in which he determines the correct value of electron's magnetic dipole moment, _μ_ B = 9.27×10−21 erg·Oe−1 (in 1913 he is also able to calculate a theoretical value of the [Bohr magneton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_magneton "Bohr magneton") based on Planck's quantum theory).
    *   [John William Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Nicholson "John William Nicholson") is noted as the first to create an atomic model that quantized angular momentum as _h_/2 _π_.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-19)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-20)[Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") quoted him in his 1913 paper of the [Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") of the atom.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-21)

*   1912 – [Victor Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hess "Victor Hess") discovers the existence of [cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_radiation "Cosmic radiation").
*   1912 – [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") publishes an influential mathematical argument in support of the essential nature of energy quanta.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-McCormmach-22)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Irons-23)
*   1913: 
    *   [Robert Andrews Millikan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan "Robert Andrews Millikan") publishes the results of his "oil drop" experiment, in which he precisely determines the [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of the electron. Determination of the fundamental unit of electric charge makes it possible to calculate the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant") (which is the number of atoms or molecules in one [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)") of any substance) and thereby to determine the [atomic weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_weight "Atomic weight") of the atoms of each [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element").
    *   [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") publishes his 1913 paper of the [Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") of the atom.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-24)
    *   [Ștefan Procopiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98tefan_Procopiu "Ștefan Procopiu") publishes a theoretical paper with the correct value of the electron's magnetic dipole moment _μ_ B.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-25)
    *   Niels Bohr obtains theoretically the value of the electron's magnetic dipole moment _μ_ B as a consequence of his atom model
    *   [Johannes Stark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Stark "Johannes Stark") and [Antonino Lo Surdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Lo_Surdo "Antonino Lo Surdo") independently discover the shifting and splitting of the spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of the light source in an external static electric field.
    *   To explain the [Rydberg formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_formula "Rydberg formula") (1888), which correctly modeled the light emission spectra of atomic hydrogen, Bohr hypothesizes that negatively charged electrons revolve around a positively charged nucleus at certain fixed "quantum" distances and that each of these "spherical orbits" has a specific energy associated with it such that electron movements between orbits requires "quantum" emissions or absorptions of energy.

*   1914 – [James Franck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franck "James Franck") and [Gustav Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Ludwig_Hertz "Gustav Ludwig Hertz") report their [experiment on electron collisions with mercury atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck%E2%80%93Hertz_experiment "Franck–Hertz experiment"), which provides a new test of Bohr's quantized model of atomic energy levels.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Pais2-26)
*   1915 – Einstein first presents to the [Prussian Academy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Science "Prussian Academy of Science") what are now known as the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations"). These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter is present, and form the core of Einstein's [General Theory of Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Theory_of_Relativity "General Theory of Relativity"). Although this theory is not directly applicable to quantum mechanics, theorists of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") seek to reconcile them.
*   1916 – [Paul Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sophus_Epstein "Paul Sophus Epstein")[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-27) and [Karl Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild "Karl Schwarzschild"),[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-28) working independently, derive equations for the linear and quadratic [Stark effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_effect "Stark effect") in hydrogen.
*   1916 – [Gilbert N. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis") conceives the theoretical basis of [Lewis dot formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_dot_formulas "Lewis dot formulas"), diagrams that show the [bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bonding "Chemical bonding") between [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") of a [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") and the [lone pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_pair "Lone pair") of electrons that may exist in the molecule.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-29)
*   1916 – To account for the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect "Zeeman effect") (1896), i.e. that atomic absorption or emission spectral lines change when the light source is subjected to a magnetic field, [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") suggests there might be "elliptical orbits" in atoms in addition to spherical orbits.
*   1918 – Sir Ernest Rutherford notices that, when [alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") are shot into [nitrogen gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_gas "Nitrogen gas"), his [scintillation detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_detectors "Scintillation detectors") shows the signatures of hydrogen nuclei. Rutherford determines that the only place this hydrogen could have come from was the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen must contain hydrogen nuclei. He thus suggests that the hydrogen nucleus, which is known to have an [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number") of 1, is an [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"), which he decides must be the [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") hypothesized by [Eugen Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Goldstein "Eugen Goldstein").
*   1919 – Building on the work of Lewis (1916), [Irving Langmuir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Langmuir "Irving Langmuir") coins the term "covalence" and postulates that [coordinate covalent bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_covalent_bond "Coordinate covalent bond") occur when two electrons of a pair of atoms come from both atoms and are equally shared by them, thus explaining the fundamental nature of chemical bonding and molecular chemistry.

*   1920 – [Hendrik Kramers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Anthony_Kramers "Hendrik Anthony Kramers") uses [Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Sommerfeld_quantization "Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization") to derive formulas for intensities of spectral transitions of the [Stark effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_effect "Stark effect"). Kramers also includes the effect of [fine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure "Fine structure"), including corrections for relativistic kinetic energy and coupling between electron spin and orbit.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-30)
*   1921–1922 – Frederick Soddy receives the Nobel Prize for 1921 in Chemistry one year later, in 1922, "for his contributions to our knowledge of the chemistry of radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope")"; he writes in his Nobel Lecture of 1922: "The interpretation of radioactivity which was published in 1903 by Sir Ernest Rutherford and myself ascribed the phenomena to the [spontaneous disintegration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disintegration "Nuclear disintegration") of the atoms of the radio-element, whereby a part of the original atom was violently ejected as a radiant particle, and the remainder formed a totally new kind of atom with a distinct chemical and physical character."
*   1922: 
    *   [Arthur Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Compton "Arthur Compton") finds that X-ray wavelengths increase due to scattering of the [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy "Radiant energy") by [free electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_particle "Free particle"). The scattered [quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum") have less energy than the quanta of the original ray.

At first this radiation is thought to be [gamma radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_radiation "Gamma radiation"), although it is more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results are very difficult to interpret on this basis. Some scientists begin to hypothesize the possible existence of another fundamental particle.
    *   [Erich Hückel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_H%C3%BCckel "Erich Hückel") redefines the property of [aromaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity "Aromaticity") in a quantum mechanical context by introducing the [4 _n_+2 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4n%2B2_rule "4n+2 rule"), or [Hückel's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel%27s_rule "Hückel's rule"), which predicts whether an organic [planar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") ring [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") will have aromatic properties.

This is not in itself inconsistent with the proposed [gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray") nature of the new radiation, but detailed quantitative analysis of the data become increasingly difficult to reconcile with such a hypothesis.
    *   [James Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick "James Chadwick") performs a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis for the unknown radiation produced by alpha particles is untenable, and that the new particles must be the [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") hypothesized by Fermi.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Peacock-9)

    *   [Mark Oliphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Oliphant "Mark Oliphant"): Building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments of Ernest Rutherford done a few years earlier, observes fusion of light nuclei (hydrogen isotopes). The steps of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars are subsequently worked out by Hans Bethe over the next decade.

Assuming that [local realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_realism "Local realism") is valid, they demonstrated that there would need to be [hidden parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory#EPR_paradox "Hidden variable theory") to explain how measuring the quantum state of one particle could influence the quantum state of another particle without apparent contact between them.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Einstein1935-38)
    *   Schrödinger develops the [Schrödinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat "Schrödinger's cat") thought experiment.

The latter process is called the [Jahn–Teller effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahn%E2%80%93Teller_effect "Jahn–Teller effect"); this effect was recently considered also in relation to the superconductivity mechanism in [YBCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBCO "YBCO") and other [high temperature superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_temperature_superconductor "High temperature superconductor").

Hahn calls this new phenomenon a 'bursting' of the uranium nucleus. Simultaneously, Hahn communicates these results to [Lise Meitner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner "Lise Meitner"). Meitner, and her nephew [Otto Robert Frisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Robert_Frisch "Otto Robert Frisch"), correctly interpret these results as being a [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission"). Frisch confirms this experimentally on 13 January 1939.

In particular, this scheme provides a consistent foundation for the electrodynamic laws, and agrees with the actual relations between radiation and moving matter." 
    *   "A formula for optical dispersion was obtained in § 11 of the second part of this memoir, on the simple hypothesis that the electric polarization of the molecules vibrated as a whole in unison with the electric field of the radiation."
    *   "... that of the transmission of radiation across a medium permeated by molecules, each consisting of a system of electrons in steady orbital motion, and each capable of free oscillations about the steady state of motion with definite free periods analogous to those of the planetary inequalities of the Solar System"
    *   "'A' will be a positive electron in the medium, and 'B' will be the complementary negative one…We shall thus have created two permanent conjugate electrons 'A' and 'B'; each of them can be moved about through the medium, but they will both persist until they are destroyed by an extraneous process the reverse of that by which they are formed."

Now the beauty of Franck and Hertz's work lies not only in the measurement of the energy loss _E_ 2-_E_ 1 of the impinging electron, but they also observed that, when the energy of that electron exceeds 4.9 eV, mercury begins to emit ultraviolet light of a definite frequency _ν_ as defined in the above formula. Thereby they gave (unwittingly at first) the first direct experimental proof of the Bohr relation!
