[ 1 ] In other words, it is a non-empty preordered set A {\displaystyle A} such that for any a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} in A {\displaystyle A} there exists c {\displaystyle c} in A {\displaystyle A} with a ≤ ≤ c {\displaystyle a\leq c} and b ≤ ≤ c {\displaystyle b\leq c} .

[ a ] A directed set's preorder is called a direction .

The notion defined above is sometimes called an upward directed set . A downward directed set is defined symmetrically, [ 2 ] meaning that every finite subset has a lower bound .

[ 3 ] Some authors (and this article) assume that a directed set is directed upward, unless otherwise stated. Other authors call a set directed if and only if it is directed both upward and downward.

[ 4 ] Directed sets are a generalization of nonempty totally ordered sets . That is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast partially ordered sets , which need not be directed).

Join-semilattices (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, lattices are directed sets both upward and downward.

In topology , directed sets are used to define nets , which generalize sequences and unite the various notions of limit used in analysis . Directed sets also give rise to direct limits in abstract algebra and (more generally) category theory .

Examples [ edit ] The set of natural numbers N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } with the ordinary order ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} is one of the most important examples of a directed set. Every totally ordered set is a directed set, including ( N , ≤ ≤ ) , {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ,\leq ),} ( N , ≥ ≥ ) , {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ,\geq ),} ( R , ≤ ≤ ) , {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,\leq ),} and ( R , ≥ ≥ ) .

{\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,\geq ).} A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is not directed is the set { a , b } , {\displaystyle \{a,b\},} in which the only order relations are a ≤ ≤ a {\displaystyle a\leq a} and b ≤ ≤ b .

{\displaystyle b\leq b.} A less trivial example is like the following example of the "reals directed towards x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} " but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} (that is, if one takes an element a {\displaystyle a} to the left of x 0 , {\displaystyle x_{0},} and b {\displaystyle b} to its right, then a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are not comparable, and the subset { a , b } {\displaystyle \{a,b\}} has no upper bound).

Product of directed sets [ edit ] Let D 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} _{1}} and D 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} _{2}} be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set D 1 × × D 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} _{1}\times \mathbb {D} _{2}} can be made into a directed set by defining ( n 1 , n 2 ) ≤ ≤ ( m 1 , m 2 ) {\displaystyle \left(n_{1},n_{2}\right)\leq \left(m_{1},m_{2}\right)} if and only if n 1 ≤ ≤ m 1 {\displaystyle n_{1}\leq m_{1}} and n 2 ≤ ≤ m 2 .

{\displaystyle n_{2}\leq m_{2}.} In analogy to the product order this is the product direction on the Cartesian product.  For example, the set N × × N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} \times \mathbb {N} } of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining ( n 0 , n 1 ) ≤ ≤ ( m 0 , m 1 ) {\displaystyle \left(n_{0},n_{1}\right)\leq \left(m_{0},m_{1}\right)} if and only if n 0 ≤ ≤ m 0 {\displaystyle n_{0}\leq m_{0}} and n 1 ≤ ≤ m 1 .

{\displaystyle n_{1}\leq m_{1}.} Directed towards a point [ edit ] If x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a real number then the set I := R ∖ ∖ { x 0 } {\displaystyle I:=\mathbb {R} \backslash \lbrace x_{0}\rbrace } can be turned into a directed set by defining a ≤ ≤ I b {\displaystyle a\leq _{I}b} if | a − − x 0 | ≥ ≥ | b − − x 0 | {\displaystyle \left|a-x_{0}\right|\geq \left|b-x_{0}\right|} (so "greater" elements are closer to x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} ). We then say that the reals have been directed towards x 0 .

{\displaystyle x_{0}.} This is an example of a directed set that is neither partially ordered nor totally ordered . This is because antisymmetry breaks down for every pair a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} equidistant from x 0 , {\displaystyle x_{0},} where a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are on opposite sides of x 0 .

{\displaystyle x_{0}.} Explicitly, this happens when { a , b } = { x 0 − − r , x 0 + r } {\displaystyle \{a,b\}=\left\{x_{0}-r,x_{0}+r\right\}} for some real r ≠ ≠ 0 , {\displaystyle r\neq 0,} in which case a ≤ ≤ I b {\displaystyle a\leq _{I}b} and b ≤ ≤ I a {\displaystyle b\leq _{I}a} even though a ≠ ≠ b .

{\displaystyle a\neq b.} Had this preorder been defined on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } instead of R ∖ ∖ { x 0 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \backslash \lbrace x_{0}\rbrace } then it would still form a directed set but it would now have a (unique) greatest element , specifically x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} ; however, it still wouldn't be partially ordered. This example can be generalized to a metric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} by defining on X {\displaystyle X} or X ∖ ∖ { x 0 } {\displaystyle X\setminus \left\{x_{0}\right\}} the preorder a ≤ ≤ b {\displaystyle a\leq b} if and only if d ( a , x 0 ) ≥ ≥ d ( b , x 0 ) .

{\displaystyle d\left(a,x_{0}\right)\geq d\left(b,x_{0}\right).} Maximal and greatest elements [ edit ] An element m {\displaystyle m} of a preordered set ( I , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (I,\leq )} is a maximal element if for every j ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle j\in I,} m ≤ ≤ j {\displaystyle m\leq j} implies j ≤ ≤ m .

{\displaystyle j\leq m.} [ b ] It is a greatest element if for every j ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle j\in I,} j ≤ ≤ m .

{\displaystyle j\leq m.} Any preordered set with a greatest element is a directed set with the same preorder. 
For instance, in a poset P , {\displaystyle P,} every lower closure of an element; that is, every subset of the form { a ∈ ∈ P : a ≤ ≤ x } {\displaystyle \{a\in P:a\leq x\}} where x {\displaystyle x} is a fixed element from P , {\displaystyle P,} is directed.

Every maximal element of a directed preordered set is a greatest element.  Indeed, a directed preordered set is characterized by equality of the (possibly empty) sets of maximal and of greatest elements.

Subset inclusion [ edit ] The subset inclusion relation ⊆ ⊆ , {\displaystyle \,\subseteq ,\,} along with its dual ⊇ ⊇ , {\displaystyle \,\supseteq ,\,} define partial orders on any given family of sets . 
A non-empty family of sets is a directed set with respect to the partial order ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,} (respectively, ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,} ) if and only if the intersection (respectively, union) of any two of its members contains as a subset (respectively, is contained as a subset of) some third member. 
In symbols, a family I {\displaystyle I} of sets is directed with respect to ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,} (respectively, ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,} ) if and only if for all A , B ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle A,B\in I,} there exists some C ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle C\in I} such that A ⊇ ⊇ C {\displaystyle A\supseteq C} and B ⊇ ⊇ C {\displaystyle B\supseteq C} (respectively, A ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle A\subseteq C} and B ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle B\subseteq C} ) or equivalently, for all A , B ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle A,B\in I,} there exists some C ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle C\in I} such that A ∩ ∩ B ⊇ ⊇ C {\displaystyle A\cap B\supseteq C} (respectively, A ∪ ∪ B ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle A\cup B\subseteq C} ).

Many important examples of directed sets can be defined using these partial orders. 
For example, by definition, a prefilter or filter base is a non-empty family of sets that is a directed set with respect to the partial order ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,} and that also does not contain the empty set (this condition prevents triviality because otherwise, the empty set would then be a greatest element with respect to ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,} ). 
Every π -system , which is a non-empty family of sets that is closed under the intersection of any two of its members, is a directed set with respect to ⊇ ⊇ .

{\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,.} Every λ-system is a directed set with respect to ⊆ ⊆ .

{\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,.} Every filter , topology , and σ-algebra is a directed set with respect to both ⊇ ⊇ {\displaystyle \,\supseteq \,} and ⊆ ⊆ .

{\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,.} Tails of nets [ edit ] By definition, a net is a function from a directed set and a sequence is a function from the natural numbers N .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} .} Every sequence canonically becomes a net by endowing N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } with ≤ ≤ .

{\displaystyle \,\leq .\,} If x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is any net from a directed set ( I , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (I,\leq )} then for any index i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} the set x ≥ ≥ i := { x j : j ≥ ≥ i with j ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle x_{\geq i}:=\left\{x_{j}:j\geq i{\text{ with }}j\in I\right\}} is called the tail of ( I , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (I,\leq )} starting at i .

{\displaystyle i.} The family Tails ⁡ ⁡ ( x ∙ ∙ ) := { x ≥ ≥ i : i ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle \operatorname {Tails} \left(x_{\bullet }\right):=\left\{x_{\geq i}:i\in I\right\}} of all tails is a directed set with respect to ⊇ ⊇ ; {\displaystyle \,\supseteq ;\,} in fact, it is even a prefilter.

Neighborhoods [ edit ] If T {\displaystyle T} is a topological space and x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a point in T , {\displaystyle T,} the set of all neighbourhoods of x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} can be turned into a directed set by writing U ≤ ≤ V {\displaystyle U\leq V} if and only if U {\displaystyle U} contains V .

{\displaystyle V.} For every U , {\displaystyle U,} V , {\displaystyle V,} and W {\displaystyle W} : U ≤ ≤ U {\displaystyle U\leq U} since U {\displaystyle U} contains itself.

if U ≤ ≤ V {\displaystyle U\leq V} and V ≤ ≤ W , {\displaystyle V\leq W,} then U ⊇ ⊇ V {\displaystyle U\supseteq V} and V ⊇ ⊇ W , {\displaystyle V\supseteq W,} which implies U ⊇ ⊇ W .

{\displaystyle U\supseteq W.} Thus U ≤ ≤ W .

{\displaystyle U\leq W.} because x 0 ∈ ∈ U ∩ ∩ V , {\displaystyle x_{0}\in U\cap V,} and since both U ⊇ ⊇ U ∩ ∩ V {\displaystyle U\supseteq U\cap V} and V ⊇ ⊇ U ∩ ∩ V , {\displaystyle V\supseteq U\cap V,} we have U ≤ ≤ U ∩ ∩ V {\displaystyle U\leq U\cap V} and V ≤ ≤ U ∩ ∩ V .

{\displaystyle V\leq U\cap V.} Finite subsets [ edit ] The set Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Finite} (I)} of all finite subsets of a set I {\displaystyle I} is directed with respect to ⊆ ⊆ {\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,} since given any two A , B ∈ ∈ Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) , {\displaystyle A,B\in \operatorname {Finite} (I),} their union A ∪ ∪ B ∈ ∈ Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle A\cup B\in \operatorname {Finite} (I)} is an upper bound of A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} in Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Finite} (I).} This particular directed set is used to define the sum ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i {\displaystyle {\textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in I}}r_{i}} of a generalized series of an I {\displaystyle I} -indexed collection of numbers ( r i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(r_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} (or more generally, the sum of elements in an abelian topological group , such as vectors in a topological vector space ) as the limit of the net of partial sums F ∈ ∈ Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) ↦ ↦ ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ F r i ; {\displaystyle F\in \operatorname {Finite} (I)\mapsto {\textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in F}}r_{i};} that is: ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i := lim F ∈ ∈ Finite ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ F r i = lim { ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ F r i : F ⊆ ⊆ I , F finite } .

{\displaystyle \sum _{i\in I}r_{i}~:=~\lim _{F\in \operatorname {Finite} (I)}\ \sum _{i\in F}r_{i}~=~\lim \left\{\sum _{i\in F}r_{i}\,:F\subseteq I,F{\text{ finite }}\right\}.} Logic [ edit ] See also: Preorder § Preorders and partial orders on partitions Let S {\displaystyle S} be a formal theory , which is a set of sentences with certain properties (details of which can be found in the article on the subject ). For instance, S {\displaystyle S} could be a first-order theory (like Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ) or a simpler zeroth-order theory . The preordered set ( S , ⇐ ⇐ ) {\displaystyle (S,\Leftarrow )} is a directed set because if A , B ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle A,B\in S} and if C := A ∧ ∧ B {\displaystyle C:=A\wedge B} denotes the sentence formed by logical conjunction ∧ ∧ , {\displaystyle \,\wedge ,\,} then A ⇐ ⇐ C {\displaystyle A\Leftarrow C} and B ⇐ ⇐ C {\displaystyle B\Leftarrow C} where C ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle C\in S.} If S / ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle S/\sim } is the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra associated with S {\displaystyle S} then ( S / ∼ ∼ , ⇐ ⇐ ) {\displaystyle \left(S/\sim ,\Leftarrow \right)} is a partially ordered set that is also a directed set.

Contrast with semilattices [ edit ] Example of a directed set which is not a join-semilattice Directed set is a more general concept than (join) semilattice: every join semilattice is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired c .

{\displaystyle c.} The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} ordered bitwise (e.g.

1000 ≤ ≤ 1011 {\displaystyle 1000\leq 1011} holds, but 0001 ≤ ≤ 1000 {\displaystyle 0001\leq 1000} does not, since in the last bit 1 > 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no least upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.) Directed subsets [ edit ] The order relation in a directed set is not required to be antisymmetric , and therefore directed sets are not always partial orders . However, the term directed set is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset A {\displaystyle A} of a partially ordered set ( P , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (P,\leq )} is called a directed subset if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the empty set , and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of A {\displaystyle A} is inherited from P {\displaystyle P} ; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.

A directed subset of a poset is not required to be downward closed ; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an ideal . While the definition of a directed set is for an "upward-directed" set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a filter .

Directed subsets are used in domain theory , which studies directed-complete partial orders .

[ 5 ] These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a least upper bound . In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.

^ This implies j = m {\displaystyle j=m} if ( I , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (I,\leq )} is a partially ordered set .
