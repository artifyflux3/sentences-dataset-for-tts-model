Idealism is common among Reformed theologians and it is associated with amillennialism .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] There exists degrees of Idealism, the most radical form sees it as entirely symbolic, while a more moderate view may allow for some historical fulfillment of events.

[ 3 ] Idealism was common in medieval writers and is still taught by some modern theologians.

[ 4 ] F. D. Maurice (1805–1872) interpreted the Kingdom of Heaven idealistically as a symbol representing society's general improvement, instead of as a physical and political kingdom.

Karl Barth (1886–1968) interpreted eschatology as representing existential truths that bring the individual hope, rather than as history or as future-history.

[ 5 ] Barth's ideas provided fuel for the Social Gospel philosophy in America , which saw social change not as performing "required" good works , but because the individuals involved felt that Christians could not simply ignore society's problems with future dreams.

[ 6 ] Different authors have suggested that the Beast of Revelation represents various social injustices, such as exploitation of workers , [ 7 ] wealth, the elite, commerce , [ 8 ] materialism , and imperialism .

[ 9 ] Various Christian anarchists , such as Jacques Ellul (1912–1994), have identified the State and political power as the Beast.

[ 10 ] Christian eschatological idealism is distinct from Preterism , Futurism and Historicism in that it does not see any of the prophecies (except in some cases the Second Coming , and Final Judgment ) as being fulfilled in a literal, physical, earthly sense in the past, present or future.

[ 11 ] It views interpretation of the eschatological portions of the Bible in a historical or future-historical fashion as an erroneous understanding.
