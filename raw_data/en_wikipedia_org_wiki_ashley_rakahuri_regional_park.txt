It covers 417 hectares (1,030 acres) on the banks of Ashley River / Rakahuri and Okuku River , and is operated by Environment Canterbury . The park is used for fishing, walking, swimming, cycling and family picnics.

[ 1 ] Geography and ecology [ edit ] The regional park an area Ashley River / Rakahuri and Okuku River, including pine forest blocks and mixed stands of exotic trees like willows and poplar . Pockets of native vegetation are gradually being restored.

[ 1 ] Ashley River is steeper than other braided rivers in New Zealand, moving large amounts of sediment.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Ashley River has a history of flooding. It breached its stopbanks in 1953 next to the Rangiora Traffic Bridge, causing flooding in Rangiora , Kaiapoi , Woodend and Waikuku causing large amounts of damage. River engineering and protection work has been carried out since then to prevent similar flooding events.

[ 1 ] The land of the Ashley Rakahuri Regional Park was vested in Environment Canterbury to protect that work.

[ 1 ] The first areas of the regional park were formally opened on 14 October 2012.

[ 2 ] In July 2020, Environment Canterbury felled 500 trees in the reserve without community consultation.

[ 3 ] In January 2021, a group of motorcyclists and four-wheel-drivers rode through a colony of nesting black-billed gulls in the park, killing several rare birds.

[ 4 ] In June 2021, parts of the park were closed due to flooding.

[ 5 ] Recreation [ edit ] The park has a range of places of fishing, swimming, game-bird hunting, walking, cycling and picnicking.

[ 1 ] Dogs are allowed but must be kept under control at all times.

[ 1 ] Gas barbecues are allowed away from vegetation, but there are no on-site barbecues and there is a complete ban on fires.

[ 1 ] The Mike Kean Walkway connects the State Highway 1 road bridge and the rail bridge.

[ 1 ] The Rakahuri Trail, a shared mountain biking and walking track, follows the river downstream from Groyne 1, with shorter single-track mountain bike tracks branch off.

[ 1 ] The main track is a two-way shared path with loose compact shingle.

[ 6 ] In October 2017, Rakahuri Trail was extended to Waikuku Beach , doubling its length.

[ 7 ] The North Canterbury BMX Club has tracks that can be accessed off Milton Ave.

[ 1 ] The most popular access points for the regional park are at the Rangiora/Ashley traffic bridge and State Highway 1 bridge. There are carparks on River Road, the Ashley picnic site, Break Bank, the rail bridge, and the Rakahuri picnic area.
