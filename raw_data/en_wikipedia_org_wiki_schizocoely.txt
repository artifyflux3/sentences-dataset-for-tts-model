The schizocoely mechanism occurs when secondary body cavities ( coeloms ) are formed by splitting a solid mass of mesodermal embryonic tissue.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] All schizocoelomates are protostomians [ contradictory ] and they show holoblastic, spiral, determinate cleavage.

Etymology [ edit ] The term schizocoely derives from the Ancient Greek words σχίζω ( skhízō ), meaning 'to split', and κοιλία ( koilía ), meaning 'cavity'.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] This refers to the fact that fluid-filled body cavities are formed by splitting of mesodermal cells.

Taxonomic distribution [ edit ] Animals called protostomes develop through schizocoely for which they are also known as schizocoelomates .

Schizocoelous development often occurs in protostomes , [ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] as in phyla Mollusca , Annelida , and Arthropoda .

Deuterostomes usually exhibit enterocoely ; [ 7 ] however, some deuterostomes like enteropneusts can exhibit schizocoely as well.

[ 8 ] Embryonic development [ edit ] The term refers to the order of organization of cells in the gastrula leading to development of the coelom . In mollusks, annelids, and arthropods, the mesoderm (the middle germ layer ) forms as a solid mass of migrated cells from the single layer of the gastrula. The new mesoderm then splits, creating the pocket-like cavity of the coelom.
