In [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), **escape velocity** or **escape speed** is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape from contact with or orbit of a [primary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)"), assuming:

*   [Ballistic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trajectory "Ballistic trajectory") – no other forces are acting on the object, such as [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsion "Propulsion") and [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction")
*   No other gravity-producing objects exist.

Although the term _escape velocity_ is common, it is more accurately described as a [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") than as a [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") because it is independent of direction. Because gravitational force between two objects depends on their combined mass, the escape speed also depends on mass. For [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite") and small natural objects, the mass of the object makes a negligible contribution to the combined mass, and so is often ignored.

Escape speed varies with distance from the center of the primary body, as does the velocity of an object traveling under the gravitational influence of the primary. If an object is in a circular or elliptical orbit, its speed is always less than the escape speed at its current distance. In contrast if it is on a [hyperbolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory "Hyperbolic trajectory") its speed will always be higher than the escape speed at its current distance. (It will slow down as it gets to greater distance, but do so [asymptotically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotically "Asymptotically") approaching a positive speed.) An object on a [parabolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory "Parabolic trajectory") will always be traveling exactly the escape speed at its current distance. It has precisely balanced positive [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and negative [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy "Gravitational potential energy");[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-1) it will always be slowing down, asymptotically approaching zero speed, but never quite stop.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-2)

Escape velocity calculations are typically used to determine whether an object will remain in the [gravitational sphere of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics) "Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)") of a given body. For example, in [solar system exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system_exploration "Solar system exploration") it is useful to know whether a probe will continue to orbit the Earth or escape to a [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit"). It is also useful to know how much a probe will need to slow down in order to be [gravitationally captured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_capture "Gravitational capture") by its destination body. Rockets do not have to reach escape velocity in a single maneuver, and objects can also use a [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist "Gravity assist") to siphon kinetic energy away from large bodies.

Precise trajectory calculations require taking into account small forces like [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag"), [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure"), and [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"). A rocket under continuous or intermittent thrust (or an object climbing a [space elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator "Space elevator")) can attain escape at any non-zero speed, but the minimum amount of energy required to do so is always the same.

Escape speed at a distance _d_ from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body (such as a star or a planet) with mass _M_ is given by the formula[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-3)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-4)

![Image 1: {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{d}}}={\sqrt {2gd\ }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65e377ad4ec651a967e723f8a792032119fa20cc)
where:

*   _G_ is the [universal gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant") (_G_ ≈ 6.67×10−11 m 3⋅kg−1⋅s−2[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-physconst-G-5))
*   _g_ = _GM_/_d_ 2 is the local gravitational acceleration (or the [surface gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity "Surface gravity"), when _d_ = _r_).

The value _GM_ is called the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter"), or _μ_, and is often known more accurately than either _G_ or _M_ separately.

When given an initial speed _V_ greater than the escape speed _v_ e, the object will asymptotically approach the _[hyperbolic excess speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic\_trajectory "Hyperbolic trajectory")_ _v_∞, satisfying the equation:[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-6)

![Image 2: {\displaystyle {v_{\infty }}^{2}=V^{2}-{v_{\text{e}}}^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f4d0407cde8471342eab58189add516243119fc)
For example, with the definitional value for [standard gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity") of 9.80665 m/s 2 (32.1740 ft/s 2),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-7) the escape velocity from Earth is 11.186 km/s (40,270 km/h; 25,020 mph; 36,700 ft/s).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-8)

For an object of mass ![Image 3: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) the energy required to escape a celestial body's gravitational field is _GMm_/_r_, a function of the object's mass (where _r_ is the radius of the planet, which for Earth is 6,371 kilometres (3,959 mi), _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), and _M_ is the mass of the planet, which for Earth is _M_ = 5.9736 × 10 24 kg). A related quantity is the [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy") which is essentially the sum of the kinetic and potential energy divided by the mass. An object has reached escape velocity when the specific orbital energy is greater than or equal to zero.

### Conservation of energy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Conservation of energy")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/RIAN_archive_510848_Interplanetary_station_Luna_1_-_blacked.jpg/250px-RIAN_archive_510848_Interplanetary_station_Luna_1_-_blacked.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RIAN_archive_510848_Interplanetary_station_Luna_1_-_blacked.jpg)

[Luna 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_1 "Luna 1"), launched in 1959, was the first artificial object to attain escape velocity from Earth.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-9) (See [List of Solar System probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_probes "List of Solar System probes") for more.)

The existence of escape velocity can be thought of as a consequence of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") and an energy field of finite depth. For an object with a given total energy, which is moving subject to [conservative forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force") (such as a static gravity field) it is only possible for the object to reach combinations of locations and speeds which have that total energy; places which have a higher potential energy than this cannot be reached at all. Adding speed (kinetic energy) to an object expands the region of locations it can reach, until, with enough energy, everywhere to infinity becomes accessible.

The formula for escape velocity can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. For the sake of simplicity, unless stated otherwise, we assume that an object will escape the gravitational field of a uniform spherical planet by moving away from it and that the only significant force acting on the moving object is the planet's gravity. Imagine that a spaceship of mass _m_ is initially at a distance _r_ from the center of mass of the planet, whose mass is _M_, and its initial speed is equal to its escape velocity, _v_ e. At its final state, it will be an infinite distance away from the planet, and its speed will be negligibly small. [Kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy")_K_ and [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy "Gravitational potential energy")_U_ g are the only types of energy that we will deal with (we will ignore the drag of the atmosphere), so by the conservation of energy,

![Image 5: {\displaystyle (K+U_{\text{g}})_{\text{initial}}=(K+U_{\text{g}})_{\text{final}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f565f3a56b5da042126ae707f7a0ded53a9367b0)
We can set _K_ final = 0 because final velocity is arbitrarily small, and _U_ g final = 0 because final gravitational potential energy is defined to be zero a long distance away from a planet, so

![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Rightarrow {}&{\frac {1}{2}}m{v_{\text{e}}}^{2}+{\frac {-GMm}{r}}=0+0\\[3pt]\Rightarrow {}&v_{\text{e}}={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4475d931bbe4ca1d57c396fa55e9d4efbaa0cb0)
The same result is obtained by a [relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") calculation, in which case the variable _r_ represents the _radial coordinate_ or _reduced circumference_ of the [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric "Schwarzschild metric").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-11)

### From the surface of a body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: From the surface of a body")]

An alternative expression for the escape velocity _v_ e particularly useful at the surface on the body is:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}={\sqrt {2gr}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4d20e90caa8adf5211977ed875c5d096e8706b4)
where _r_ is the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") between the center of the body and the point at which escape velocity is being calculated and _g_ is the [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration") at that distance (i.e., the [surface gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity "Surface gravity")).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-12)

For a body with a spherically symmetric distribution of mass, the escape velocity _v_ e from the surface is proportional to the radius assuming constant density, and proportional to the square root of the average density _ρ_.

![Image 8: {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}=Kr{\sqrt {\rho }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45027ef13c2d5823e4adf92e02a6d1e82212622a)
where ![Image 9: {\textstyle K={\sqrt {{\frac {8}{3}}\pi G}}\approx \mathrm {2.364\times 10^{-5}~m^{1.5}{\cdot }kg^{-0.5}{\cdot }s^{-1}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2d802349fdfee60daa74b3ea2305887b1dc51cdf).

This escape velocity is relative to a non-rotating frame of reference, not relative to the moving surface of the planet or moon, as explained below.

### From a rotating body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: From a rotating body")]

The escape velocity _relative to the surface_ of a rotating body depends on direction in which the escaping body travels. For example, as the Earth's rotational velocity is 465 m/s at the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth's equator to the east requires an initial velocity of about 10.735 km/s _relative to the moving surface at the point of launch_ to escape whereas a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth's equator to the west requires an initial velocity of about 11.665 km/s _relative to that moving surface_. The surface velocity decreases with the [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") of the geographic latitude, so space launch facilities are often located as close to the equator as feasible, e.g. the American [Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station "Cape Canaveral Air Force Station") (latitude 28°28′N) and the French [Guiana Space Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiana_Space_Centre "Guiana Space Centre") (latitude 5°14′N).

### Practical considerations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Practical considerations")]

In most situations it is impractical to achieve escape velocity almost instantly, because of the acceleration implied, and also because if there is an atmosphere, the hypersonic speeds involved (on Earth a speed of 11.2 km/s, or 40,320 km/h) would cause most objects to burn up due to [aerodynamic heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_heating "Aerodynamic heating") or be torn apart by [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag"). For an actual escape orbit, a spacecraft will accelerate steadily out of the atmosphere until it reaches the escape velocity appropriate for its altitude (which will be less than on the surface). In many cases, the spacecraft may be first placed in a [parking orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_orbit "Parking orbit") (e.g. a [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") at 160–2,000 km) and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude, which will be slightly lower (about 11.0 km/s at a low Earth orbit of 200 km). The required additional [change in speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v"), however, is far less because the spacecraft already has a significant [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") (in low Earth orbit speed is approximately 7.8 km/s, or 28,080 km/h).

### From an orbiting body

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: From an orbiting body")]

The escape velocity at a given height is ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff) times the speed in a circular orbit at the same height, (compare this with the velocity equation in [circular orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit")). This corresponds to the fact that the potential energy with respect to infinity of an object in such an orbit is minus two times its kinetic energy, while to escape the sum of potential and kinetic energy needs to be at least zero. The velocity corresponding to the circular orbit is sometimes called the **first cosmic velocity**, whereas in this context the escape velocity is referred to as the **second cosmic velocity**.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-13)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-15)

For a body in an elliptical orbit wishing to accelerate to an escape orbit the required speed will vary, and will be greatest at [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") when the body is closest to the central body. However, the orbital speed of the body will also be at its highest at this point, and the change in velocity required will be at its lowest, as explained by the [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect "Oberth effect").

### Barycentric escape velocity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Barycentric escape velocity")]

Escape velocity can either be measured as relative to the other, central body or relative to [center of mass or barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of the system of bodies. Thus for systems of two bodies, the term _escape velocity_ can be ambiguous, but it is usually intended to mean the barycentric escape velocity of the less massive body. Escape velocity usually refers to the escape velocity of zero mass [test particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particles "Test particles"). For zero mass test particles we have that the 'relative to the other' and the 'barycentric' escape velocities are the same, namely ![Image 11: {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{d}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/407e26ea5e55ee7c9a6bd77a7de1e235867f29ee).

But when we can't neglect the smaller mass (say _m_) we arrive at slightly different formulas.

Because the system has to obey the [law of conservation of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation "Momentum") we see that both the larger and the smaller mass must be accelerated in the gravitational field. Relative to the center of mass the velocity of the larger mass (_v_ p, for planet) can be expressed in terms of the velocity of the smaller mass (_v_ r, for rocket). We get ![Image 12: {\displaystyle v_{p}=-{\frac {m}{M}}v_{r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af512afbbfe67bd3b2b9839c4d20cbc429cdacfa).

The 'barycentric' escape velocity now becomes ![Image 13: {\displaystyle v_{r}={\sqrt {\frac {2GM^{2}}{d(M+m)}}}\approx {\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{d}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48c1365c98cd8a15f4a564b9374890220937864d), while the 'relative to the other' escape velocity becomes ![Image 14: {\displaystyle v_{r}-v_{p}={\sqrt {\frac {2G(m+M)}{d}}}\approx {\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{d}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/882576bc84627cc48819bd2d45f2ea153af035af).

### Height of lower-velocity trajectories

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Height of lower-velocity trajectories")]

Ignoring all factors other than the gravitational force between the body and the object, an object projected vertically at speed _v_ from the surface of a spherical body with escape velocity _v_ e and radius _R_ will attain a maximum height _h_ satisfying the equation[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-16)

![Image 15: {\displaystyle v=v_{\text{e}}{\sqrt {\frac {h}{R+h}}}\ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a67b01c6a313c6a33698a3d39abb4f3a3a3ae18)
which, solving for _h_ results in

![Image 16: {\displaystyle h={\frac {x^{2}}{1-x^{2}}}\ R\ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70427d879d3072c12ad0d9f3c592d47f81d9e8c5)
where _x_ = _v_/_v_ e is the ratio of the original speed _v_ to the escape velocity _v_ e.

Unlike escape velocity, the direction (vertically up) is important to achieve maximum height.

If an object attains exactly escape velocity, but is not directed straight away from the planet, then it will follow a curved path or trajectory. Although this trajectory does not form a closed shape, it can be referred to as an orbit. Assuming that gravity is the only significant force in the system, this object's speed at any point in the trajectory will be equal to the escape velocity _at that point_ due to the conservation of energy, its total energy must always be 0, which implies that it always has escape velocity; see the derivation above. The shape of the trajectory will be a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") whose focus is located at the center of mass of the planet. An actual escape requires a course with a trajectory that does not intersect with the planet, or its atmosphere, since this would cause the object to crash. When moving away from the source, this path is called an [escape orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_orbit "Escape orbit"). Escape orbits are known as _C_ 3 = 0 orbits. _C_ 3 is the [characteristic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_energy "Characteristic energy"), −_GM_/2 _a_, where _a_ is the [semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis "Semi-major axis") length, which is infinite for parabolic trajectories.

If the body has a velocity greater than escape velocity then its path will form a [hyperbolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory "Hyperbolic trajectory") and it will have an excess hyperbolic velocity, equivalent to the extra energy the body has. A relatively small extra [delta-_v_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v") above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed can result in a relatively large speed at infinity. [Some orbital manoeuvres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer "Bi-elliptic transfer") make use of this fact. For example, at a place where escape speed is 11.2 km/s, the addition of 0.4 km/s yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02 km/s:

![Image 17: {\displaystyle v_{\infty }={\sqrt {V^{2}-{v_{\text{e}}}^{2}}}={\sqrt {(11.6{\text{ km/s}})^{2}-(11.2{\text{ km/s}})^{2}}}\approx 3.02{\text{ km/s}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0dfd6b5d2395cec6e9b7c56fee80b670abee3ad5)
If a body in circular orbit (or at the [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis") of an elliptical orbit) accelerates along its direction of travel to escape velocity, the point of acceleration will form the periapsis of the escape trajectory. The eventual direction of travel will be at 90 degrees to the direction at the point of acceleration. If the body accelerates to beyond escape velocity the eventual direction of travel will be at a smaller angle, and indicated by one of the asymptotes of the hyperbolic trajectory it is now taking. This means the timing of the acceleration is critical if the intention is to escape in a particular direction.

If the speed at periapsis is v, then the [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_vector "Eccentricity vector") of the trajectory is given by:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle e=2(v/v_{\text{e}})^{2}-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f493850868293e2c9f97edf434d1d9cebea6061)
This is valid for elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic trajectories. If the trajectory is hyperbolic or parabolic, it will [asymptotically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotically "Asymptotically") approach an angle ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) from the direction at periapsis, with

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \sin \theta =1/e.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5925a892c9e461173843c781fdd3bc597696d8cf)
The speed will asymptotically approach

![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {v^{2}-{v_{\text{e}}}^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84c087d96e06d1fde63b72947fe9ae801b5888be)

List of escape velocities

In this table, the left-hand half gives the escape velocity from the visible surface (which may be gaseous as with Jupiter for example), relative to the centre of the planet or moon (that is, not relative to its moving surface). In the right-hand half, _V_ e refers to the speed relative to the central body (for example the sun), whereas _V_ te is the speed (at the visible surface of the smaller body) relative to the smaller body (planet or moon).

Deriving escape velocity using calculus
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Escape_velocity&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Deriving escape velocity using calculus")]

Let _G_ be the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant") and let _M_ be the [mass of the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mass "Earth mass") (or other gravitating body) and _m_ be the mass of the escaping body or projectile. At a distance _r_ from the centre of gravitation the body feels an attractive force

![Image 22: {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb141dec57838d1b58565ee05bc0ef64b22e6444)
The work needed to move the body over a small distance _dr_ against this force is therefore given by

![Image 23: {\displaystyle dW=F\,dr=G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}\,dr.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91e1db564860d1f3ea56da523727d6af6020f4e2)
The total work needed to move the body from the surface _r_ 0 of the gravitating body to infinity is then[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#cite_note-21)

![Image 24: {\displaystyle W=\int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}\,dr=G{\frac {Mm}{r_{0}}}=mgr_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7bb6ab21b83c3ea16a0a832546c9d7f6e4158ca2)
In order to do this work to reach infinity, the body's minimal kinetic energy at departure must match this work, so the escape velocity _v_ 0 satisfies

![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}m{v_{0}}^{2}=G{\frac {Mm}{r_{0}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68a9c7c2bb39a3e9720a677b71bf984572673337)
which results in

![Image 26: {\displaystyle v_{0}={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r_{0}}}}={\sqrt {2gr_{0}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d64da7a1bdb59f5ee3e8c897e1f44ad028957b3)
