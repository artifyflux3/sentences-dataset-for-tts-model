In 1987, he was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy in arbitration law at Trinity College, Cambridge .

In a 2018 op-ed he criticized British politicians for "condemning UK universities as broken and in need of market discipline." [ 15 ] During his annual university address, [ 16 ] in 2020 he announced Cambridge was removing fossil fuel investments from its portfolio.
