He wrote commentaries on Aristotle 's second book of the Analytica Posteriora and the Ethica Nicomachea.

Biography [ edit ] Eustratius was a pupil of John Italus , although he had deliberately dissociated himself from John's supposed heretical views when John was condemned around 1082.

[ 2 ] A few years after the trial of Italus, he wrote a dialogue and treatise on the use of icons directed against Leo , the bishop of Chalcedon , who had accused the emperor Alexios I Komnenos of sacrilege and iconoclasm in the way in which he had stripped the churches of gold to fund his wars.

[ 3 ] For this he gained the emperor Alexios I 's friendship, and this probably helped him to become Metropolitan bishop of Nicaea . Eustratius was said by Anna Comnena to have been wise both in mundane and in religious matters and especially expert in argument.

[ 4 ] Nevertheless he found himself accused of heresy in 1117 and a charge was placed before the Synod of Constantinople which narrowly succeeded despite a defence by Patriarch John IX of Constantinople .

[ 2 ] As a result of the condemnation Eustratius was formally suspended for life.

Two commentaries by Eustratius on the works of Aristotle survive: [ 1 ] Commentary on the Posterior Analytics , book 2 Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics , books 1 and 6, found in vol. 20 of Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca (CAG).
