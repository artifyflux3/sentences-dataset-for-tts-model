Her research considers agroecology and the conservation of biodiversity. She was elected a Fellow of the Ecological Society of America in 2021.

Early life and education [ edit ] Philpott studied science at the University of Washington . She moved to the University of Michigan for doctoral research, where she studied ecology and evolutionary biology. She joined the Ecological Society of America as a student in 2000.

[ 1 ] Her doctoral research considered the diversity and ecology of coffee agroecosystems.

[ 2 ] Philpott spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Zoological Park .

[ citation needed ] Research and career [ edit ] Philpott started her independent scientific career at the University of Toledo .

[ 3 ] In 2012, Philpott joined the faculty at the University of California, Santa Cruz .

[ 3 ] Her research considers insect ecology and the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem status.

[ 1 ] Philpott makes use of urban community gardens to understand ecological relationships. She studies the agroecosystems in 25 gardens across the coastline of California.

[ 4 ] At the same time, Philpott investigates coffee agro-forestry and the role of ants [ 5 ] as a form of pest control in agro-forestry systems.

[ 6 ] She has studied the biodiversity of dung beetles, and the benefits they provide to ecosystems.

[ 7 ] Philpott was elected Fellow of the Ecological Society of America in 2021.
