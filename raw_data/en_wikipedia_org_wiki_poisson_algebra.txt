Poisson algebras appear naturally in Hamiltonian mechanics , and are also central in the study of quantum groups .

Manifolds with a Poisson algebra structure are known as Poisson manifolds , of which the symplectic manifolds and the Poisson–Lie groups are a special case.  The algebra is named in honour of Siméon Denis Poisson .

Definition [ edit ] A Poisson algebra is a vector space over a field K equipped with two bilinear products, ⋅ and {, }, having the following properties: The product ⋅ forms an associative K -algebra .

The product {, }, called the Poisson bracket , forms a Lie algebra , and so it is anti-symmetric, and obeys the Jacobi identity .

The Poisson bracket acts as a derivation of the associative product ⋅, so that for any three elements x , y and z in the algebra, one has { x , y ⋅ z } = { x , y } ⋅ z + y ⋅ { x , z }.

The last property often allows a variety of different formulations of the algebra to be given, as noted in the examples below.

Examples [ edit ] Poisson algebras occur in various settings.

Symplectic manifolds [ edit ] The space of real-valued smooth functions over a symplectic manifold forms a Poisson algebra. On a symplectic manifold, every real-valued  function H on the manifold induces a vector field X H , the Hamiltonian vector field .  Then, given any two smooth functions F and G over the symplectic manifold, the Poisson bracket may be defined as: { F , G } = d G ( X F ) = X F ( G ) {\displaystyle \{F,G\}=dG(X_{F})=X_{F}(G)\,} .

This definition is consistent in part because the Poisson bracket acts as a derivation. Equivalently, one may define the bracket {,} as X { F , G } = [ X F , X G ] {\displaystyle X_{\{F,G\}}=[X_{F},X_{G}]\,} where [,] is the Lie derivative .  When the symplectic manifold is R 2 n with the standard symplectic structure, then the Poisson bracket takes on the well-known form { F , G } = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ F ∂ ∂ q i ∂ ∂ G ∂ ∂ p i − − ∂ ∂ F ∂ ∂ p i ∂ ∂ G ∂ ∂ q i .

{\displaystyle \{F,G\}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial F}{\partial q_{i}}}{\frac {\partial G}{\partial p_{i}}}-{\frac {\partial F}{\partial p_{i}}}{\frac {\partial G}{\partial q_{i}}}.} Similar considerations apply for Poisson manifolds , which generalize symplectic manifolds by allowing the symplectic bivector to be rank deficient.

Lie algebras [ edit ] The tensor algebra of a Lie algebra has a Poisson algebra structure. A very explicit construction of this is given in the article on universal enveloping algebras .

The construction proceeds by first building the tensor algebra of the underlying vector space of the Lie algebra. The tensor algebra is simply the disjoint union ( direct sum ⊕) of all tensor products of this vector space. One can then show that the Lie bracket can be consistently lifted to the entire tensor algebra: it obeys both the product rule, and the Jacobi identity of the Poisson bracket, and thus is the Poisson bracket, when lifted. The pair of products {,} and ⊗ then form a Poisson algebra. Observe that ⊗ is neither commutative nor is it anti-commutative: it is merely associative.

Thus, one has the general statement that the tensor algebra of any Lie algebra is a Poisson algebra.  The universal enveloping algebra is obtained by modding out the Poisson algebra structure.

Associative algebras [ edit ] If A is an associative algebra , then imposing the commutator [ x , y ] = xy − yx turns it into a Poisson algebra (and thus, also a Lie algebra) A L . Note that the resulting A L should not be confused with the tensor algebra construction described in the previous section. If one wished, one could also apply that construction as well, but that would give a different Poisson algebra, one that would be much larger.

Vertex operator algebras [ edit ] For a vertex operator algebra ( V , Y , ω , 1), the space V / C 2 ( V ) is a Poisson algebra with { a , b } = a 0 b and a ⋅ b = a −1 b .  For certain vertex operator algebras, these Poisson algebras are finite-dimensional.

Z 2 grading [ edit ] Poisson algebras can be given a Z 2 - grading in one of two different ways. These two result in the Poisson superalgebra and the Gerstenhaber algebra . The difference between the two is in the grading of the product itself. For the Poisson superalgebra, the grading is given by | { a , b } | = | a | + | b | {\displaystyle |\{a,b\}|=|a|+|b|} whereas in the Gerstenhaber algebra, the bracket decreases the grading by one: | { a , b } | = | a | + | b | − − 1 {\displaystyle |\{a,b\}|=|a|+|b|-1} In both of these expressions | a | = deg ⁡ ⁡ a {\displaystyle |a|=\deg a} denotes the grading of the element a {\displaystyle a} ; typically, it counts how a {\displaystyle a} can be decomposed into an even or odd product of generating elements. Gerstenhaber algebras conventionally occur in BRST quantization .
