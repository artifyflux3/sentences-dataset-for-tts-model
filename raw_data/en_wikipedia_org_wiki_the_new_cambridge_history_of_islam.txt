[ 1 ] The general editor is Michael Cook .

The history replaced the original Cambridge History of Islam which was published in 1970.

[ 2 ] As well as being greatly expanded from the earlier history, which was of two volumes, the new history introduces more thematic sections and covers wider ground by, for instance, a detailed examination of Sufism . It also cautiously questions the narrative of the history of Islam believed by Muslims which it finds lacks reliable textual evidence for the earliest period.
