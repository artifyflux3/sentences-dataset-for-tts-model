Surfaces have different uses, including producing new film or layers of material and being a base to which another substance is bonded.

Description [ edit ] In materials science and engineering , a substrate refers to a base material on which processing is conducted. This surface could be used to produce new film or layers of material such as deposited coatings .  It could be the base to which paint, adhesives, or adhesive tape is bonded.

A typical substrate might be rigid such as metal , concrete , or glass , onto which a coating might be deposited. Flexible substrates are also used.

[ 1 ] Some substrates are anisotropic with surface properties being different depending on the direction: examples include wood and paper products.

Coatings [ edit ] Main article: Coating With all coating processes, the condition of the surface of the substrate can strongly affect the bond of subsequent layers.  This can include cleanliness, smoothness, surface energy , moisture, etc.

Coating can be by a variety of processes, including: Adhesives and adhesive tapes [ 2 ] Coating and printing processes Chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition Conversion coating Anodizing Chromate conversion coating Plasma electrolytic oxidation Phosphate coating Paint Enamel paint Powder coating [ 3 ] Industrial coating Silicate mineral paint Fusion bonded epoxy coating (FBE coating) Pickled and oiled , a type of plate steel coating.

Plating Electroless plating Electrochemical plating Polymer coatings, such as Teflon Sputtered or vacuum deposited materials Vitreous enamel In optics , glass may be used as a substrate for an optical coating —either an antireflection coating to reduce reflection, or a mirror coating to enhance it. Ceramic substrates are also used in the renewable energy sector to produce inverters for photovoltaic solar systems and concentrators for concentrated photovoltaic systems.

[ 4 ] A substrate may be also an engineered surface where an unintended or natural process occurs, like in: Fouling Corrosion Biofouling Heterogeneous catalysis Adsorption See also [ edit ] List of coating techniques Thin film Wetting References [ edit ] ^ Barthel, E (2007).
