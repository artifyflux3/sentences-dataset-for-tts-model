He was one of the historic leaders of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and of the Workers' General Union (UGT). Although he entered politics as a moderate leftist, after the 1933 general election in which the conservative CEDA party won the majority, he took a more radical turn and began to advocate for a socialist revolution, materialized with the failed Revolution of 1934 in Asturias .

After the victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 Spanish general election and following the July coup , Caballero served as prime minister of Spain during the Spanish Civil War from 4 September 1936 until 17 May 1937. Exiled in France following the Republican defeat in 1939, Caballero was imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp after the Nazi invasion of France .

Early life [ edit ] Born in Madrid , as a young man he made his living stuccoing walls. He participated in a construction workers strike in 1890 and joined the PSOE in 1894. Upon the death in 1925 of party founder Pablo Iglesias , Largo Caballero became head of the party and of the UGT.

[ 1 ] Political career [ edit ] Moderate in his positions at the beginning of his political life, he advocated maintaining a degree of UGT cooperation with the dictatorial government of General Miguel Primo de Rivera , which permitted the union to continue functioning under his military dictatorship (which lasted from 1923 to 1930).

[ 2 ] This cooperation was the start of Largo Caballero's political conflict with Indalecio Prieto , who opposed all collaboration with Primo de Rivera.

Largo Caballero was Minister of Labor Relations between 1931 and 1933 in the first governments of the Second Spanish Republic , headed by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora , and in that of his successor Manuel Azaña .

[ 3 ] Caballero attempted to improve the conditions of landless labourers ( braceros ) in the rural south. On 28 April 1931 he introduced a decree of municipal boundaries to prevent the importation of foreign labour while there remained unemployed workers within the municipality. In May he established mixed juries ( jurados mixtos ) to arbitrate in agrarian labour disputes, and introduced an eight-hour working day in the countryside. Alongside these, a decree on obligatory cultivation prevented owners from using their land however they wanted.

[ 4 ] He enjoyed great popularity among the masses of workers, who saw their own austere existences reflected in his way of life.

[ 1 ] In the elections of 19 November 1933, the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) won power in Spain, beginning the Black Biennium, as called by the left. The government nominally led by the centrist Radical Alejandro Lerroux was dependent on CEDA's parliamentary support. Responding to this reversal of fortune, Largo abandoned his moderate positions and became more openly far left. In the January 3, 1934 edition of El Socialista , the PSOE newspaper, he wrote "Harmony? No!

Class war ! Hatred for the criminal bourgeoise to the death!" A few weeks later, the PSOE compiled a new platform that called for the nationalization of all land, dissolution of all religious orders and the confiscation of their property, and the dissolution of the army, to be replaced by socialist militias.

[ 5 ] In early October 1934, after three CEDA ministers entered the government, he was one of the leaders of the failed armed rising of workers (mainly in Asturias ) which was forcefully put down by the CEDA-dominated government.

[ 6 ] He defended the pact of alliance with the other workers' political parties and trade unions, such as the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and the anarchist trade union, the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Once again, this placed him at odds with Prieto.

[ 7 ] He declared, that he, Largo Caballero "shall be the second Lenin ", whose aim is the union of Iberian Soviet republics .

[ dead link ] [ 8 ] After the Popular Front won the elections in February 1936, president Manuel Azaña proposed that Prieto join the government, but Largo blocked these attempts at collaboration between PSOE and the Republican government.

[ 9 ] Largo dismissed fears of a military coup, and predicted that, were it to happen, a general strike would defeat it, opening the door to the workers' revolution.

In the event, the coup attempt by the colonial army and the right came on 17 July 1936. While not immediately successful, further actions by rebellious army units sparked the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), in which the republic was ultimately defeated and destroyed.

Prime Minister of Spain [ edit ] Francisco Largo Caballero's office, kept in the Archives of the Labor Movement in Alcalá de Henares .

Monument of Largo Caballero A few months into the civil war, after the Republican Left Party government of José Giral resigned on 4 September 1936, President Manuel Azaña asked Largo Caballero to form a new government.

[ 10 ] There resulted  a broader-based Popular Front cabinet.

[ 11 ] Largo Cabellero served as Prime Minister [ 12 ] and also took the post of Minister of War .

[ 13 ] Besides conducting the war, he also focused on maintaining military discipline and government authority within the Republic.

[ 14 ] On 4 November 1936 Largo Caballero persuaded the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT; "National Confederation of Labour") to join the government, with four members assigned to junior ministries including Justice, Health and Trade. The decision was controversial with the CNT members.

[ 15 ] Throughout his tenure in office the once-radicalised Caballero became more and more disenchanted with his earlier flirtations with the radical left and communists during the Black Biennium. When diplomatic recognition was established with the USSR in 1936, the exchange of ambassadors left Caballero with Soviet ambassador Marcel Rosenberg , who according to Caballerist PSOE member Luis Araquistain in his memoirs, “acted like a Russian viceroy in Spain.” At one occasion PSOE member Gines Ganga wrote of an incident witnessed by numerous people where Caballero, showing Rosenberg and Communust sympathetic foreign minister Julio Alvarez del Vayo the door at a heated meeting, yelled: Get out! Get out! You must learn, Señor Ambassador, that Spaniards may be poor and need help from abroad, but we are sufficiently proud not to accept that a foreign ambassador should try to impose his will on the head of the Spanish government.

Caballero also found himself under attack from the Communists when he was forced to accept the removal, to appease them, of his favourite Jose Asencio Torrado from the post of Undersecretary of War after the military failure of February 1937 of the fall of Malaga , according to Burnett Bolloten. When he attempted to remove from del Vayo, who was also Comissariat General of the People’s Army, the right of naming political commissars, the Communists stirred up a furor, antagonising them further.

The Barcelona May Days of 3 to 8 May 1937 led to a governmental crisis [ 16 ] that forced Caballero to resign on 17 May 1937. His attempted defence of the POUM , one of the parties involved in the May Days, led to the opposition of various moderate pro-centralisation PSOE ministers like Indalecio Prieto and Jose Giral as well as the Communists, who seized the opportunity to walk out with their colleagues on Caballero, therefore crippling his government.

Juan Negrín , also a member of the PSOE, was appointed prime minister in his stead.

[ 17 ] For the rest of the war Caballero was out of office, writing to express his opinions in his publication La Claridad. He openly sided with Negrin and Prieto against Communist hegemony in the army and security forces.

Largo Cabellero's cabinet, formed on 4 September 1936 and reshuffled on 4 November 1936, consisted of: [ 18 ] Ministry Start End Officeholder Party Prime Minister and War 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Francisco Largo Caballero PSOE (left) State (Foreign Affairs) 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Julio Álvarez del Vayo PSOE (left) Finance 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Juan Negrín López PSOE (moderate) Interior 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Ángel Galarza PSOE (left) Industry and Commerce 4 September 1936 4 November 1936 Anastasio de Gracia Villarrubia PSOE (moderate) Industry 4 November 1936 17 May 1937 Juan Peiró Belis CNT Commerce 4 November 1936 17 May 1937 Juan López Sánchez CNT Navy and Air 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Indalecio Prieto Tuero PSOE (moderate) Education and Fine Arts 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Jesús Hernández Tomás PCE Agriculture 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Vicente Uribe Galdeano PCE Justice 4 September 1936 4 November 1936 Mariano Ruiz-Funes García IR 4 November 1936 17 May 1937 Juan García Oliver CNT Communications and Merchant Marine 4 September 1936 17 May 1937 Bernardo Giner de los Ríos UR Labor and Health 4 September 1936 4 November 1936 José Tomás y Piera ERC Labor and Planning 4 November 1936 15 May 1937 Anastasio de Gracia Villarrubia PSOE (moderate) Health and Social Assistance 4 November 1936 17 May 1937 Federica Montseny Mañé CNT Public Works 4 September 1936 15 September 1936 Vicente Uribe Galdeano (Interim) PCE 15 September 1936 17 May 1937 Julio Just Gimeno IR Propaganda 4 November 1936 17 May 1937 Carlos Esplá Rizo IR Without portfolio 4 September 1936 15 May 1937 José Giral Pereira IR Without portfolio 4 September 1936 15 May 1937 Manuel Irujo y Ollo PNV Without portfolio 4 November 1936 17 May 1936 Jaime Ayguadé Miró ERC Exile, death, and legacy [ edit ] Upon the defeat of the Republic in 1939, he fled to France. Arrested during the German occupation of France , he spent most of World War II imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg concentration camp, until the liberation of the camps at the end of the war.

[ 19 ] He died in exile in Paris in 1946; [ 1 ] his remains were returned to Madrid in 1978 after Franco's death in 1975.
