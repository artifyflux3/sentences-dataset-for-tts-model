Find sources: "Incentive compatibility" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In game theory and economics , a mechanism is called incentive-compatible ( IC ) [ 1 ] : 415 if every participant can achieve their own best outcome by reporting their true preferences.

[ 1 ] : 225 [ 2 ] For example, there is incentive compatibility if high-risk clients are better off in identifying themselves as high-risk to insurance firms , who only sell discounted insurance to high-risk clients. Likewise, they would be worse off if they pretend to be low-risk. Low-risk clients who pretend to be high-risk would also be worse off.

[ 3 ] The concept is attributed to the Russian-born American economist Leonid Hurwicz .

[ 2 ] Typology [ edit ] There are several different degrees of incentive-compatibility: [ 4 ] The stronger degree is dominant-strategy incentive-compatibility ( DSIC ).

[ 1 ] : 415 This means that truth-telling is a weakly- dominant strategy , i.e. you fare best or at least not worse by being truthful, regardless of what the others do. In a DSIC mechanism, strategic considerations cannot help any agent achieve better outcomes than the truth; such mechanisms are called strategyproof , [ 1 ] : 244, 752 truthful, or straightforward.

A weaker degree is Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatibility ( BNIC ).

[ 1 ] : 416 This means there is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in which all participants reveal their true preferences. In other words, if all other players act truthfully, then it is best to be truthful.

[ 1 ] : 234 Every DSIC mechanism is also BNIC, but a BNIC mechanism may exist even if no DSIC mechanism exists.

Typical examples of DSIC mechanisms are second-price auctions and a simple majority vote between two choices. Typical examples of non-DSIC mechanisms are ranked voting with three or more alternatives (by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem ) or first-price auctions .

In randomized mechanisms [ edit ] A randomized mechanism is a probability-distribution on deterministic mechanisms. There are two ways to define incentive-compatibility of randomized mechanisms: [ 1 ] : 231–232 The stronger definition is: a randomized mechanism is universally-incentive-compatible if every mechanism selected with positive probability is incentive-compatible (i.e. if truth-telling gives the agent an optimal value regardless of the coin-tosses of the mechanism).

The weaker definition is: a randomized mechanism is incentive-compatible-in-expectation if the game induced by expectation is incentive-compatible (i.e. if truth-telling gives the agent an optimal expected value ).

Revelation principles [ edit ] Main article: Revelation principle The revelation principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of incentive-compatibility: The dominant-strategy revelation-principle says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in dominant-strategies can be implemented by a DSIC mechanism.

The Bayesian–Nash revelation-principle says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian–Nash equilibrium ( Bayesian game , i.e. game of incomplete information) can be implemented by a BNIC mechanism.
