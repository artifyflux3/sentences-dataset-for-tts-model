1569928 Links Journal homepage Foundations of Physics is a monthly journal "devoted to the conceptual bases and fundamental theories of modern physics and cosmology, emphasizing the logical, methodological, and philosophical premises of modern physical theories and procedures".

[ 1 ] The journal publishes results and observations based on fundamental questions from all fields of physics, including: quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , special relativity , general relativity , string theory , M-theory , cosmology , thermodynamics , statistical physics , and quantum gravity Foundations of Physics has been published since 1970. Its founding editors were Henry Margenau and Wolfgang Yourgrau .

[ 2 ] The 1999 Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft was editor-in-chief from January 2007. At that stage, it absorbed the associated journal for shorter submissions Foundations of Physics Letters , which had been edited by Alwyn Van der Merwe since its foundation in 1988. Past editorial board members (which include several Nobel laureates) include Louis de Broglie , Robert H. Dicke , Murray Gell-Mann , Abdus Salam , Ilya Prigogine and Nathan Rosen .

Carlo Rovelli was announced as new editor-in-chief in February 2016.

[ 3 ] Einstein–Cartan–Evans theory [ edit ] Between 2003 and 2005, Foundations of Physics Letters published a series of papers by Myron W. Evans [ 4 ] claiming to make obsolete well-established results of quantum field theory and general relativity.  In 2008,  an editorial was written by the new Editor-in-Chief Gerard 't Hooft distancing the journal from the topic of Einstein–Cartan–Evans theory .

[ 5 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2021 impact factor of 1.276.
