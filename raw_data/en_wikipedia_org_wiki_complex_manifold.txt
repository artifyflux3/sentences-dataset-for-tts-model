Holomorphic Maps

In [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [complex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry "Complex geometry"), a **complex manifold** is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") with a _complex structure_, that is an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)") of [charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_(topology) "Chart (topology)") to the [open unit disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_unit_disc "Open unit disc")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold#cite_note-1) in the [complex coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_coordinate_space "Complex coordinate space")![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258), such that the [transition maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_map "Transition map") are [holomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function").

The term "complex manifold" is variously used to mean a complex manifold in the sense above (which can be specified as an _integrable_ complex manifold) or an [_almost_ complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_manifold "Almost complex manifold").

Implications of complex structure
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_manifold&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Implications of complex structure")]

Since [holomorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function") are much more rigid than [smooth functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function"), the theories of [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") and complex manifolds have very different flavors: [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") complex manifolds are much closer to [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") than to differentiable manifolds.

For example, the [Whitney embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem "Whitney embedding theorem") tells us that every smooth _n_-dimensional manifold can be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") as a smooth submanifold of **R**2 _n_, whereas it is "rare" for a complex manifold to have a holomorphic embedding into **C**_n_. Consider for example any [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") connected complex manifold _M_: any holomorphic function on it is constant by [the maximum modulus principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_modulus_principle "Maximum modulus principle"). Now if we had a holomorphic embedding of _M_ into **C**_n_, then the coordinate functions of **C**_n_ would restrict to nonconstant holomorphic functions on _M_, contradicting compactness, except in the case that _M_ is just a point. Complex manifolds that can be embedded in **C**_n_ are called [Stein manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_manifold "Stein manifold") and form a very special class of manifolds including, for example, smooth complex affine algebraic varieties.

The classification of complex manifolds is much more subtle than that of differentiable manifolds. For example, while in dimensions other than four, a given topological manifold has at most finitely many [smooth structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_structure "Smooth structure"), a topological manifold supporting a complex structure can and often does support uncountably many complex structures. [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), two dimensional manifolds equipped with a complex structure, which are topologically classified by the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)"), are an important example of this phenomenon. The set of complex structures on a given orientable surface, modulo biholomorphic equivalence, itself forms a complex algebraic variety called a [moduli space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space"), the structure of which remains an area of active research.

Since the transition maps between charts are biholomorphic, complex manifolds are, in particular, smooth and canonically oriented (not just [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable "Orientable"): a biholomorphic map to (a subset of) **C**_n_ gives an orientation, as biholomorphic maps are orientation-preserving).

### Smooth complex algebraic varieties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_manifold&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Smooth complex algebraic varieties")]

Smooth complex [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties") are complex manifolds, including:

*   Complex vector spaces.
*   [Complex projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_space "Complex projective space"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold#cite_note-2)**P**_n_(**C**).
*   Complex [Grassmannians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian").
*   Complex [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_groups "Lie groups") such as GL(_n_, **C**) or Sp(_n_, **C**).

The [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected") 1-dimensional complex manifolds are isomorphic to either:

*   Δ, the unit [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") in **C**
*   **C**, the complex plane
*   **Ĉ**, the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere")

Note that there are inclusions between these as Δ ⊆ **C** ⊆ **Ĉ**, but that there are no non-constant holomorphic maps in the other direction, by [Liouville's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(complex_analysis) "Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)").

Disc vs. space vs. polydisc
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_manifold&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Disc vs. space vs. polydisc")]

The following spaces are different as complex manifolds, demonstrating the more rigid geometric character of complex manifolds (compared to smooth manifolds):

*   the [polydisc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydisc "Polydisc")

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \left\{z=(z_{1},\dots ,z_{n})\in \mathbb {C} ^{n}:\vert z_{j}\vert <1\ \forall j=1,\dots ,n\right\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06432dea992b70b61a627e4c492ab7e037457d6d)

Almost complex structures
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_manifold&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Almost complex structures")]

An [almost complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_structure "Almost complex structure") on a real 2n-manifold is a GL(_n_, **C**)-structure (in the sense of [G-structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-structure "G-structure")) – that is, the tangent bundle is equipped with a [linear complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complex_structure "Linear complex structure").

Concretely, this is an [endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism "Endomorphism") of the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") whose square is −_I_; this endomorphism is analogous to multiplication by the imaginary number _i_, and is denoted _J_ (to avoid confusion with the identity matrix _I_). An almost complex manifold is necessarily even-dimensional.

An almost complex structure is _weaker_ than a complex structure: any complex manifold has an almost complex structure, but not every almost complex structure comes from a complex structure. Note that every even-dimensional real manifold has an almost complex structure defined locally from the local coordinate chart. The question is whether this almost complex structure can be defined globally. An almost complex structure that comes from a complex structure is called [integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_theorem_(differential_topology) "Frobenius theorem (differential topology)"), and when one wishes to specify a complex structure as opposed to an almost complex structure, one says an _integrable_ complex structure. For integrable complex structures the so-called [Nijenhuis tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijenhuis_tensor "Nijenhuis tensor") vanishes. This tensor is defined on pairs of vector fields, _X_, _Y_ by

![Image 5: {\displaystyle N_{J}(X,Y)=[X,Y]+J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY]-[JX,JY]\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0657943fc0c667681387a682be413da0030ec1d)
For example, the 6-dimensional [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere "Hypersphere")**S**6 has a natural almost complex structure arising from the fact that it is the [orthogonal complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_complement "Orthogonal complement") of _i_ in the unit sphere of the [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion"), but this is not a complex structure. (The question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the _Hopf problem,_ after [Heinz Hopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Hopf "Heinz Hopf").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold#cite_note-3)) Using an almost complex structure we can make sense of holomorphic maps and ask about the existence of holomorphic coordinates on the manifold. The existence of holomorphic coordinates is equivalent to saying the manifold is complex (which is what the chart definition says).

Tensoring the tangent bundle with the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") we get the _complexified_ tangent bundle, on which multiplication by complex numbers makes sense (even if we started with a real manifold). The eigenvalues of an almost complex structure are ±_i_ and the eigenspaces form sub-bundles denoted by _T_ 0,1 _M_ and _T_ 1,0 _M_. The [Newlander–Nirenberg theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newlander%E2%80%93Nirenberg_theorem "Newlander–Nirenberg theorem") shows that an almost complex structure is actually a complex structure precisely when these subbundles are _involutive_, i.e., closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields, and such an almost complex structure is called [integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_theorem_(differential_topology) "Frobenius theorem (differential topology)").

Kähler and Calabi–Yau manifolds
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_manifold&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Kähler and Calabi–Yau manifolds")]

One can define an analogue of a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") for complex manifolds, called a [Hermitian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_metric "Hermitian metric"). Like a Riemannian metric, a Hermitian metric consists of a smoothly varying, positive definite inner product on the tangent bundle, which is Hermitian with respect to the complex structure on the tangent space at each point. As in the Riemannian case, such metrics always exist in abundance on any complex manifold. If the skew symmetric part of such a metric is [symplectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry"), i.e. closed and nondegenerate, then the metric is called [Kähler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Kähler manifold"). Kähler structures are much more difficult to come by and are much more rigid.

Examples of [Kähler manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Kähler manifold") include smooth [projective varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_varieties "Projective varieties") and more generally any complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold. The [Hopf manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_manifold "Hopf manifold") are examples of complex manifolds that are not Kähler. To construct one, take a complex vector space minus the origin and consider the action of the group of integers on this space by multiplication by exp(_n_). The quotient is a complex manifold whose first [Betti number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betti_number "Betti number") is one, so by the [Hodge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_theory "Hodge theory"), it cannot be Kähler.

A [Calabi–Yau manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold") can be defined as a compact [Ricci-flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci-flat_manifold "Ricci-flat manifold") Kähler manifold or equivalently one whose first [Chern class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_class "Chern class") vanishes.
