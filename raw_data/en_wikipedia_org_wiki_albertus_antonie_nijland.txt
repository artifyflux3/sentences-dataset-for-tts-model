He was professor of astronomy at the Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht , and served as director of the Sterrewacht Sonnenborgh (now the Sterrekundig Instituut ) of the university.

Nijland was born in Utrecht . In 1901 he participated in a Dutch solar eclipse expedition to Karang Sago , Sumatra .

He was noted for his observations of variable stars , and published a number of papers on the subject in Astronomische Nachrichten , and elsewhere, from 1917 until 1936. He proposed naming variable stars in each constellation using a simple numbering system beginning with V1, V2, ... and so forth. However the double-letter system starting with RR was already in
widespread use. As a result, variable stars after QZ were numbered according to Nijland's system beginning with V335.

In 1923 Nijland became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 1 ] The crater Nijland on the Moon is named after him.
