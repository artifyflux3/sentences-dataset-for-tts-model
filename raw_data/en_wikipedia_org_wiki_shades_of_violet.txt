Varieties of the color violet Violet Spectral coordinates Wavelength 380–450 nm Frequency 800–715 THz Color coordinates Hex triplet #8000FF sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (128, 0, 255) HSV ( h , s , v ) (270°, 100%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (41, 134, 275°) Source W3C [ 1 ] B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The color violet is named for the violet flower.

Violet is a color term derived from the flower of the same name . There are numerous variations of the color violet , a sampling of which are shown below.

Definition [ edit ] The term violet has different meanings in different languages, countries and epochs. Even among many modern speakers within the English-speaking world there is confusion about the terms purple and violet.

[ 2 ] The blue-dominated spectral color beyond blue is referred to as purple by many speakers in the United States, but this color is called violet by many speakers in the United Kingdom.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In some British authoritative texts the term purple refers to any mixture of red and blue, suggesting the color term purple covers the full range between red and blue in the United Kingdom.

[ 3 ] In other texts it is the term violet that covers the same full range of colors.

[ 5 ] The uncertainty about the range of meanings of the color terms violet and purple is even larger when other languages and historical texts are considered.

[ 6 ] Variations of spectral violet [ edit ] Although pure spectrum violet is outside the color gamut of the RGB color space , the three colors displayed below are rough approximations of the range of colors of actual spectral violet, although the accuracy of the approximation can vary depending on the individual's color vision, and on the color rendition of one's computer monitor.

Color wheel violet [ edit ] Violet (color wheel) Color coordinates Hex triplet #8000FF sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (128, 0, 255) HSV ( h , s , v ) (270°, 100%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (41, 134, 275°) Source HTML Color Chart [ 7 ] [ 8 ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid violet B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The tertiary color on the HSV color wheel (also known as the RGB color wheel ) precisely halfway between blue and magenta is called color wheel violet . This tone of violet—an approximation of the color violet at about 417 nanometers as plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram —is shown at right. This tone of violet is actually somewhat toward indigo assuming indigo is accepted as a separate spectrum color, usually quoted as having a range of from about 420 to 450 nanometers.

[ 9 ] Another name for this color is near violet .

Electric violet [ edit ] Electric Violet Color coordinates Hex triplet #8F00FF sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (143, 0, 255) HSV ( h , s , v ) (274°, 100%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (43, 134, 278°) Source HTML Color Chart @274 [ 10 ] [ failed verification ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid violet B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The color at right, electric violet , is the closest approximation to middle spectrum violet that can be made on a computer screen, given the limitations of the sRGB color gamut . It is an approximation of the color violet at about 400 nanometers as plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram, in the middle of the violet range of from 380 nanometers to 420 nanometers, assuming indigo as a separate spectrum color from 420 to 450 nanometers.

[ 9 ] Other names for this color are middle violet or simply violet .

Vivid violet [ edit ] Vivid Violet Color coordinates Hex triplet #9F00FF sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (159, 0, 255) HSV ( h , s , v ) (277°, 100%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (45, 134, 281°) Source HTML Color Chart @277 [ 11 ] [ failed verification ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid violet B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) Displayed at right is the color vivid violet , a color approximately equivalent to the violet seen at the extreme edge of human visual perception.

[ citation needed ] When plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram, it can be seen that this is a hue corresponding to that of a visual stimulus of approximately 380 nm on the spectrum. Thus another name for this color is extreme violet .

Web colors [ edit ] Web color "violet" [ edit ] Violet (web color) Color coordinates Hex triplet #EE82EE sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (238, 130, 238) HSV ( h , s , v ) (300°, 45%, 93%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (70, 85, 308°) Source X11 [ 12 ] X11 color names [ 13 ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid purple B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The so-called web color "violet" is in actuality not really a tint of violet, a spectral color, but is a non-spectral color . The web color violet is actually a rather pale tint of magenta because it has equal amounts of red and blue (the definition of magenta for computer display), and some of the green primary mixed in, unlike most other variants of violet that are closer to blue. This same color appears as "violet" in the X11 color names .

Pigment violet (web color dark violet) [ edit ] Dark Violet Color coordinates Hex triplet #9400D3 sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (148, 0, 211) HSV ( h , s , v ) (282°, 100%, 83%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (40, 110, 285°) Source X11 ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid violet B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The color box at right displays the web color dark violet which is equivalent to pigment violet , i.e., the color violet as it would typically be reproduced by artist's paints, colored pencils, or crayons as opposed to the brighter "electric" violet above that it is possible to reproduce on a computer screen.

[ citation needed ] Compare the subtractive colors to the additive colors in the two primary color charts in the article on primary colors to see the distinction between electric colors as reproducible from light on a computer screen (additive colors) and the pigment colors reproducible with pigments (subtractive colors); the additive colors are a lot brighter because they are produced from light instead of pigment.

[ citation needed ] Pigment violet (web color dark violet) represents the way the color violet was always reproduced in pigments, paints, or colored pencils in the 1950s.
By the 1970s, because of the advent of psychedelic art , artists became used to brighter pigments, and pigments called "Violet" that are the pigment equivalent of the electric violet reproduced in the section above became available in artists pigments and colored pencils.

[ citation needed ] (When approximating electric violet in artists pigments, a bit of white pigment is added to pigment violet.

[ citation needed ] ) Other variations of the color violet [ edit ] Ultra Violet (Pantone) [ edit ] Ultra Violet Color coordinates Hex triplet #645394 sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (100, 83, 148) HSV ( h , s , v ) (256°, 44%, 58%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (40, 50, 274°) Source Pantone TPX [ 14 ] [ 15 ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Moderate violet B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) The color Ultra Violet is displayed at right.
