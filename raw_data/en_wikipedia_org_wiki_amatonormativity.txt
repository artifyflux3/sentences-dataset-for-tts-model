Social model of disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Amatonormativity ( / ə ˌ m æ t ə n ɔːr m ə ˈ t ɪ v ə t i / ) is the set of societal assumptions that everyone prospers with an exclusive romantic relationship .

Elizabeth Brake coined the neologism to capture societal assumptions about romance .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Brake wanted to describe the pressure she received by many to prioritize marriage in her own life when she did not want to. Amatonormativity extends beyond social pressures for marriage to include general pressures involving romance.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Etymology [ edit ] The word amatonormativity comes from amatus , which is the Latin word for "loved", and normativity , referring to societal norms.

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] Related terms include allonormativity , which means a worldview that assumes all people experience sexual and romantic attraction, and compulsory sexuality , which means social norms and practices that marginalize non-sexuality.

[ 5 ] The term was modeled after the term heteronormativity , the belief that heterosexuality is the default for sexual orientation.

[ 2 ] Normative bias against ethical non-monogamy in particular is known as mononormativity .

[ 6 ] Examples [ edit ] Elizabeth Brake describes the term as a pressure or desire for romance and/or marriage.
The desire to find relationships that are romantic, sexual, and lifelong has many social consequences. People who are asexual , aromantic and/or just want to stay single become social oddities. According to researcher Bella DePaulo, it puts a stigma on single people as incomplete and pushes romantic partners to stay in unhealthy relationships because of a fear the partners may have of being single.

[ 7 ] [ 1 ] According to Brake, one way in which amatonormativity is institutionally applied is the law and morality surrounding marriage.

Loving friendships , queerplatonic , and other relationships are not given the same legal protections romantic partners are given through marriage.

[ 8 ] In her 2012 book Minimizing Marriage , Brake defines amatonormativity as "the widespread assumption that everyone is better off in an exclusive, romantic, long-term coupled relationship, and that everyone is seeking such a relationship."
