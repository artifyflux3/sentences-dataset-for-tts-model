Headquartered in Warsaw , it is responsible for spearheading the development of science across the country by a society of distinguished scholars and a network of research institutes. It was established in 1951, during the early period of the Polish People's Republic following World War II .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The Polish Academy of Sciences is a Polish state-sponsored institution of higher learning , headquartered in Warsaw , that was established by the merger of earlier science societies, including the Polish Academy of Learning ( Polska Akademia Umiejętności , abbreviated PAU ), with its seat in Kraków , and the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning (Science), which had been founded in the late 18th century.

[ 3 ] The Polish Academy of Sciences functions as a learned society acting through an elected assembly of leading scholars and research institutions. The Academy has also, operating through its committees, become a major scientific advisory body. Another aspect of the Academy is its coordination and overseeing of numerous (several dozen) research institutes . PAN institutes employ over 2,000 people and are funded by about a third of the Polish government's budget for science.

[ 4 ] Leadership [ edit ] The Polish Academy of Sciences is led by a President, elected by the assembly of Academy members for a four-year term, together with a number of Vice Presidents.

The President for the 2019–2022 term was Jerzy Duszyński (his second term in the post), [ 5 ] together with five Vice Presidents: Stanisław Czuczwar , Stanisław Filipowicz , Paweł Rowiński , Roman Słowiński , and Romuald Zabielski .
