Tangent plane to a sphere

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the **tangent line** (or simply **tangent**) to a [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") at a given [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") is, intuitively, the [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") that "just touches" the curve at that point. [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "Leibniz") defined it as the line through a pair of [infinitely close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") points on the curve.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-2) More precisely, a straight line is tangent to the curve _y_ = _f_(_x_) at a point _x_ = _c_ if the line passes through the point (_c_, _f_(_c_)) on the curve and has [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope")_f_'(_c_), where _f_' is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of _f_. A similar definition applies to [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve "Space curve") and curves in _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

The point where the tangent line and the curve meet or [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)") is called the _**point of tangency**_. The tangent line is said to be "going in the same direction" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point. The tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a _[tangent line approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent\_line\_approximation "Tangent line approximation")_, the graph of the [affine function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_function "Affine function") that best approximates the original function at the given point.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-3)

Similarly, the **tangent plane** to a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") at a given point is the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") that "just touches" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and has been extensively generalized; see [Tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space").

The word "tangent" comes from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_[tangere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:tangere#Latin "wikt:en:tangere")_, "to touch".

[Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") makes several references to the tangent (ἐφαπτομένη _ephaptoménē_) to a circle in book III of the _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_ (c. 300 BC).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-4) In [Apollonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga")' work _Conics_ (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being _a line such that no other straight line could fall between it and the curve_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-Shenk-5)

[Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) found the tangent to an [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral "Archimedean spiral") by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-Shenk-5)

In the 1630s [Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat "Fermat") developed the technique of [adequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adequality "Adequality") to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adequality is similar to taking the difference between ![Image 3: {\displaystyle f(x+h)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d79d112f0e80b791b42f289ae9b9b520ca2edd28) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074) and dividing by a power of ![Image 5: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a). Independently [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") used his [method of normals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_normals "Method of normals") based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-6)

These methods led to the development of [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus") in the 17th century. Many people contributed. [Roberval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Roberval "Gilles de Roberval") discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-7)[René-François de Sluse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9-Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Sluse "René-François de Sluse") and [Johannes Hudde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hudde "Johannes Hudde") found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-8) Further developments included those of [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") and [Isaac Barrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow "Isaac Barrow"), leading to the theory of [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz").

An 1828 definition of a tangent was "a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-9) This old definition prevents [inflection points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point "Inflection point") from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"), who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of [infinitely close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") points on the curve; in modern terminology, this is expressed as: the tangent to a curve at a point P on the curve is the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)") of the line passing through two points of the curve when these two points tends to P.

Tangent line to a plane curve
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Tangent line to a plane curve")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/CIRCLE_LINES-en.svg/250px-CIRCLE_LINES-en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CIRCLE_LINES-en.svg)

A tangent, a [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)"), and a [secant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line") to a circle

The intuitive notion that a tangent line "touches" a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines ([secant lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line")) passing through two points, _A_ and _B_, those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at _A_ is the limit when point _B_ approximates or tends to _A_. The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as "differentiability." For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which "point _B_" approaches the vertex.

At most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an _[inflection point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection\_point "Inflection point")_. [Circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), [hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola") and [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a [cubic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function "Cubic function"), which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function") of the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine").

Conversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") and not intersecting it otherwise—where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In [convex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_geometry "Convex geometry"), such lines are called [supporting lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporting_hyperplane "Supporting hyperplane").

### Analytical approach

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Analytical approach")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Graph_of_sliding_derivative_line.gif/330px-Graph_of_sliding_derivative_line.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Graph_of_sliding_derivative_line.gif)

At each point, the moving line is always tangent to the [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"). Its slope is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative"); green marks positive derivative, red marks negative derivative and black marks zero derivative. The point (x,y) = (0,1) where the tangent intersects the curve, is not a [max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima "Maxima and minima"), or a min, but is a [point of inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_inflection "Point of inflection"). (Note: the figure contains the incorrect labeling of 0,0 which should be 0,1)

The geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the **tangent line problem,** was one of the central questions leading to the development of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") in the 17th century. In the second book of his _[Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La\_Geometrie "La Geometrie")_, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-10)[said](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/fr:Page:Descartes_La_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie.djvu/52 "s:fr:Page:Descartes La Géométrie.djvu/52") of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, "And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-11)

#### Intuitive description

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Intuitive description")]

Suppose that a curve is given as the graph of a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), _y_ = _f_(_x_). To find the tangent line at the point _p_ = (_a_, _f_(_a_)), consider another nearby point _q_ = (_a_ + _h_, _f_(_a_ + _h_)) on the curve. The [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the [secant line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line") passing through _p_ and _q_ is equal to the [difference quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_quotient "Difference quotient")

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c924ec6626c572300b256a28bbb285cc98fe040)

As the point _q_ approaches _p_, which corresponds to making _h_ smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value _k_, which is the slope of the tangent line at the point _p_. If _k_ is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:

![Image 9: {\displaystyle y-f(a)=k(x-a).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c724e4b5c789c601569f0da3a65454294b44b79)

#### More rigorous description

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: More rigorous description")]

To make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value _k_. The precise mathematical formulation was given by [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy "Augustin-Louis Cauchy") in the 19th century and is based on the notion of [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function "Limit of a function"). Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at _p_ and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near _p_. Then there is a unique value of _k_ such that, as _h_ approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to _k_, and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of _h_, if _h_ is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function _f_. This limit is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative#Definition_via_difference_quotients "Derivative") of the function _f_ at _x_ = _a_, denoted _f_′(_a_). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/965437402e3a1f3ce00d7bd86c09b9b3ede10d48)
Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the [power function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_function "Power function"), [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions "Trigonometric functions"), [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function"), [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm"), and their various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.

#### How the method can fail

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: How the method can fail")]

Calculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function _f_ is _non-differentiable_. There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.

The graph _y_ = _x_ 1/3 illustrates the first possibility: here the difference quotient at _a_ = 0 is equal to _h_ 1/3/_h_ = _h_−2/3, which becomes very large as _h_ approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.

The graph _y_ = _x_ 2/3 illustrates another possibility: this graph has a _[cusp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp\_(singularity) "Cusp (singularity)")_ at the origin. This means that, when _h_ approaches 0, the difference quotient at _a_ = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of _x_. Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which _y_=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), as a _double tangent_.

The graph _y_ = |_x_| of the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point _q_ approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point _q_ approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope −1. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a _corner_.

Finally, since differentiability implies continuity, the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition "Contraposition") states _discontinuity_ implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity

When the curve is given by _y_ = _f_(_x_) then the slope of the tangent is ![Image 11: {\displaystyle dy/dx,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/edbe4907fdff0ed999bb704dd0058cddd9f3e675) so by the [point–slope formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#Point%E2%80%93slope_form_or_Point-gradient_form "Linear equation") the equation of the tangent line at (_X_,_Y_) is

![Image 12: {\displaystyle y-Y={\frac {dy}{dx}}(X)\cdot (x-X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a790ded61bed61e14545c5ba37f9974f18298d)
where (_x_,_y_) are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at ![Image 13: {\displaystyle x=X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef78499ff6c3e72781859cfc41329b199b550bc5).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E191-12)

When the curve is given by _y_ = _f_(_x_), the tangent line's equation can also be found[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-13) by using [polynomial division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_division "Polynomial division") to divide ![Image 14: {\displaystyle f\,(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad330d9fb9a55de9c53cf4d9180bd27a8b18e970) by ![Image 15: {\displaystyle (x-X)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5999ba86ca976faf17a79cc19feae69c05cd3737); if the remainder is denoted by ![Image 16: {\displaystyle g(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6ca91363022bd5e4dcb17e5ef29f78b8ef00b59), then the equation of the tangent line is given by

![Image 17: {\displaystyle y=g(x).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7a8ed7668a45c00356659eb684cfd430f479ff1)
When the equation of the curve is given in the form _f_(_x_,_y_) = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by [implicit differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_and_explicit_functions#Implicit_differentiation "Implicit and explicit functions"), giving

![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\bigg /}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b93f34950e906b5b2b43497a6a5a74385369272e)
The equation of the tangent line at a point (_X_,_Y_) such that _f_(_X_,_Y_) = 0 is then[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E191-12)

![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(X,Y)\cdot (x-X)+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(X,Y)\cdot (y-Y)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/869ea1c2363776c2f2499591c106d169295c6209)
This equation remains true if

![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(X,Y)=0,\quad {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(X,Y)\neq 0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b238aeb2b5e00016146be209da97a91c33c9c458)
in which case the slope of the tangent is infinite. If, however,

![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(X,Y)={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(X,Y)=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8d92bc10aa73f84311e5a7f7d709a129bce22d51)
the tangent line is not defined and the point (_X_,_Y_) is said to be [singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_a_curve "Singular point of a curve").

For [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve"), computations may be simplified somewhat by converting to [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinate "Homogeneous coordinate"). Specifically, let the homogeneous equation of the curve be _g_(_x_,_y_,_z_) = 0 where _g_ is a homogeneous function of degree _n_. Then, if (_X_,_Y_,_Z_) lies on the curve, [Euler's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity "Homogeneous function") implies ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}\cdot X+{\frac {\partial g}{\partial y}}\cdot Y+{\frac {\partial g}{\partial z}}\cdot Z=ng(X,Y,Z)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d964b7e5be1f90a960e4f294b830debab2b030be) It follows that the homogeneous equation of the tangent line is

![Image 23: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial g}{\partial x}}(X,Y,Z)\cdot x+{\frac {\partial g}{\partial y}}(X,Y,Z)\cdot y+{\frac {\partial g}{\partial z}}(X,Y,Z)\cdot z=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92e96ae8bcac941962d26361b156108bd0651cb7)
The equation of the tangent line in Cartesian coordinates can be found by setting _z_=1 in this equation.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E192-14)

To apply this to algebraic curves, write _f_(_x_,_y_) as

![Image 24: {\displaystyle f=u_{n}+u_{n-1}+\dots +u_{1}+u_{0}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f966ef9c5dc747fc2e8b70deb861f55b594c1da)
where each _u_ _r_ is the sum of all terms of degree _r_. The homogeneous equation of the curve is then

![Image 25: {\displaystyle g=u_{n}+u_{n-1}z+\dots +u_{1}z^{n-1}+u_{0}z^{n}=0.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d132f29baa6539d17c392e0d5b7d5b4baa89bc3e)
Applying the equation above and setting _z_=1 produces

![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(X,Y)\cdot x+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(X,Y)\cdot y+{\frac {\partial g}{\partial z}}(X,Y,1)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/775ca49bd0f1a1500786d6212bc7d49eeaf4f8f8)
as the equation of the tangent line.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E193-15) The equation in this form is often simpler to use in practice since no further simplification is needed after it is applied.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E192-14)

If the curve is given [parametrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") by

![Image 27: {\displaystyle x=x(t),\quad y=y(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ddb9759f2a8af4b9fce3834658f7df87958858)
then the slope of the tangent is

![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {dy}{dt}}{\bigg /}{\frac {dx}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c6083ef2d9a479764e887c418e68720f87fd9a7)

the tangent line is not defined. However, it may occur that the tangent line exists and may be computed from an implicit equation of the curve.

### Normal line to a curve

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Normal line to a curve")]

The line perpendicular to the tangent line to a curve at the point of tangency is called the _normal line_ to the curve at that point. The slopes of perpendicular lines have product −1, so if the equation of the curve is _y_ = _f_(_x_) then slope of the normal line is

![Image 32: {\displaystyle -1{\bigg /}{\frac {dy}{dx}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132001a249e200119211ae75c789391377e1536b)
and it follows that the equation of the normal line at (X, Y) is

![Image 33: {\displaystyle (x-X)+{\frac {dy}{dx}}(y-Y)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52cd5adda4f4e23a88e9d85718d7681c3f6a30fb)
Similarly, if the equation of the curve has the form _f_(_x_,_y_) = 0 then the equation of the normal line is given by[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E194-17)

![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x-X)-{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(y-Y)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bd2311c9b8064e2da8d98e13ad9a6010620cbf2)
If the curve is given parametrically by

![Image 35: {\displaystyle x=x(t),\quad y=y(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ddb9759f2a8af4b9fce3834658f7df87958858)
then the equation of the normal line is[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E196-16)

![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dt}}(x-X)+{\frac {dy}{dt}}(y-Y)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/958a8ed2ea23c43ac0a98c14e3ea73cca7184794)

### Angle between curves

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Angle between curves")]

The angle between two curves at a point where they intersect is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point. More specifically, two curves are said to be tangent at a point if they have the same tangent at a point, and orthogonal if their tangent lines are orthogonal.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E195-18)

### Multiple tangents at a point

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Multiple tangents at a point")]

[![Image 37](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Lima%C3%A7onTrisectrix.svg/330px-Lima%C3%A7onTrisectrix.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lima%C3%A7onTrisectrix.svg)

The limaçon trisectrix: a curve with two tangents at the origin.

The formulas above fail when the point is a [singular point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_a_curve "Singular point of a curve"). In this case there may be two or more branches of the curve that pass through the point, each branch having its own tangent line. When the point is the origin, the equations of these lines can be found for algebraic curves by factoring the equation formed by eliminating all but the lowest degree terms from the original equation. Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables (or by [translating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") the curve) this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.

For example, the equation of the [limaçon trisectrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima%C3%A7on_trisectrix "Limaçon trisectrix") shown to the right is

![Image 38: {\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2}-2ax)^{2}=a^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}).\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a325ca3fe826557e7b702f17caa1e8f51b3d5f5)
Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives

![Image 39: {\displaystyle a^{2}(3x^{2}-y^{2})=0\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb6b1fbed355a462704eb1862b11d4654c4595ef)
which, when factored, becomes

![Image 40: {\displaystyle y=\pm {\sqrt {3}}x.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4dd3705c9d3b8a6c3e3e79185012d6afd3c2fb36)
So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-E197-19)

When the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the [left and right derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_and_right_derivative "Left and right derivative") are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve _y_ = |_x_ | is not differentiable at _x_ = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes −1 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line#cite_note-20)

Sometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve _y_ = _x_ 2/3, for which both the left and right derivatives at _x_ = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation _x_ = 0.

Tangent line to a space curve
-----------------------------

Two pairs of tangent circles. Above internally and below externally tangent

Two distinct circles lying in the same plane are said to be _tangent_ to each other if they meet at exactly one point.

If points in the plane are described using [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"), then two [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circles "Circles"), with [radii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radii "Radii")![Image 42: {\displaystyle r_{1},r_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d00a857c907f8c4b3858f06a1b5c1db4282ab027) and centers ![Image 43: {\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fc74086e56542bd28b46a84faaee3cebdd4a899) and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d52d44e16a796acee486af49af05f678566d181a) are tangent to each other whenever

The two circles are called _externally tangent_ if the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#Geometry "Distance") between their centres is equal to the sum of their radii,

![Image 46: {\displaystyle \left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)^{2}=\left(r_{1}+r_{2}\right)^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8cf27addc760773762e2acd24a7338cbf700c163)

Tangent plane to a surface
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tangent&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Tangent plane to a surface")]

"Tangent plane" redirects here. For the geographical concept, see [Local tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_tangent_plane "Local tangent plane").

The **tangent plane** to a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(geometry) "Surface (geometry)") at a given point _p_ is defined in an analogous way to the tangent line in the case of curves. It is the best approximation of the surface by a plane at _p_, and can be obtained as the limiting position of the planes passing through 3 distinct points on the surface close to _p_ as these points converge to _p_. Mathematically, if the surface is given by a function ![Image 48: {\displaystyle z=f(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1eefb2840000f404c8c0f3f5d6d72f2624854591), the equation of the tangent plane at point ![Image 49: {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39177ddeeb9f9a393b664e522bc8e3bf0face153) can be expressed as:

![Image 50: {\displaystyle z-z_{0}={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0})(x-x_{0})+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0})(y-y_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/819b29bc256fb10a4a5d52722a95c790590b7554).

Here, ![Image 51: {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74ea04d099c68b829877f9405b8129b3900382d8) and ![Image 52: {\textstyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e7dd673d5a4029312a24f82550574b5f14d9de5) are the partial derivatives of the function ![Image 53: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) with respect to ![Image 54: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 55: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) respectively, evaluated at the point ![Image 56: {\displaystyle (x_{0},y_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29c296094af9a1c665425debeac5eaab99a37a04). In essence, the tangent plane captures the local behavior of the surface at the specific point _p_. It's a fundamental concept used in calculus and differential geometry, crucial for understanding how functions change locally on surfaces.
