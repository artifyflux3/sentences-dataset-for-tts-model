Early life and career [ edit ] Welander was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley , California. Her mother and father immigrated from Mexico to Los Angeles in the early 1970's.

[ 2 ] She received her undergraduate degree from Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1998.

[ 3 ] She has a master's degree (2003) and a Ph.D. (2007) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign .

[ 3 ] She went on to do postdoctoral studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Departments of Biology and of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.

[ 4 ] Welander began her position at Stanford University in 2013, [ 3 ] and was awarded tenure in 2019.

[ 4 ] Research [ edit ] Welander's graduate research examined factors controlling the use of methane by a group of Archaea .

[ 5 ] For her postdoctoral research, she examined the production of a group of chemical compounds known as hopanoids .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Welander has examined lipids in acid-loving archaea and how changes in the lipids alter a cell's ability to grow.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Her research has further expanded our understanding of the organisms that produce triterpenoid lipids in aquatic environments.

[ 10 ] Her more recent research centers on lipids, known as glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), that are found in archaeal cell walls.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Collectively, her research on lipids can be used to characterize how microbial life on Earth has changed over time.

[ 13 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] In 2018, Welander received the Geobiology and Geomicrobiology Division Award for Outstanding Research from the Geological Society of America .

[ 14 ] She also received a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation.
