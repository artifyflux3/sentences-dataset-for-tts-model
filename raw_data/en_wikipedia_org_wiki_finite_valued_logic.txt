Traditionally, in Aristotle's logic , the bivalent logic , also known as binary logic was the norm, as the law of the excluded middle precluded more than two possible values (i.e., "true" and "false") for any proposition .

[ 1 ] Modern three-valued logic (ternary logic) allows for an additional possible truth value (i.e. "undecided").

[ 2 ] The term finitely many-valued logic is typically used to describe many-valued logic having three or more, but not infinite, truth values. The term finite-valued logic encompasses both finitely many-valued logic and bivalent logic.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Fuzzy logics , which allow for degrees of values between "true" and "false", are typically not considered forms of finite-valued logic.

[ 5 ] However, finite-valued logic can be applied in Boolean-valued modeling , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] description logics , [ 8 ] and defuzzification [ 9 ] [ 10 ] of fuzzy logic. A finite-valued logic is decidable (sure to determine outcomes of the logic when it is applied to propositions ) if and only if it has a computational semantics .

[ 11 ] History [ edit ] Aristotle 's collected works regarding logic, known as the Organon , describe bivalent logic primarily, though Aristotle's views may have allowed for propositions that are not actually true or false. The Organon influenced philosophers and mathematicians throughout the Enlightenment .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] George Boole developed an algebraic structure and an algorithmic probability theory based on bivalent logic in the 19th century.

[ 14 ] Jan Łukasiewicz developed a system of three-valued logic in 1920.

Emil Leon Post introduced further truth degrees in 1921.

[ 15 ] Stephen Cole Kleene and Ulrich Blau expanded the three-valued logic system of Łukasiewicz, for computer applications and for natural language analyses, respectively.

Nuel Belnap and J. Michael Dunn developed a four-valued logic for computer applications in 1977.

[ 16 ] Since the mid-1970s, various procedures for providing arbitrary finite-valued logics have been developed.

[ 17 ] Examples [ edit ] In linguistics , finite-valued logic is used to treat presuppositions as product systems with ordered pairs of truth degrees, or truth tables . This enables assumptions built into verbal or written statements to be associated with varying degrees of truth values in the course of natural-language processing .

[ 18 ] In the study of formal languages , finite-valued logic has shown that encapsulating a truth predicate in a language can render the language inconsistent .

Saul Kripke has built on work pioneered by Alfred Tarski [ 19 ] to demonstrate that such a truth predicate can be modeled using three-valued logic.

[ 20 ] Philosophical questions, including the Sorites paradox , have been considered based on a finite-valued logic known as fuzzy plurivaluationism.

[ 21 ] The Sorites paradox suggests that if adding a grain of sand to something that is not a heap cannot create a heap, then a heap of sand cannot be created. A logical model of a heap in which there are as many truth degrees as grains of sand tends to refute that suggestion.

[ 22 ] In electronics design , a logical model of the stable states of a circuit, in which there are as many truth degrees as there are states, serves as a model for finite-valued switching.

[ 23 ] Three-valued operators can be realized in integrated circuits .

[ 24 ] In fuzzy logic , typically applied for approximate reasoning , a finitely-valued logic can represent propositions that may acquire values within a finite set .

[ 25 ] In mathematics , logical matrices having multiple truth degrees are used to model systems of axioms .

[ 26 ] Biophysical indications suggest that in the brain , synaptic charge injections occur in finite steps, [ 27 ] and that neuron arrangements can be modeled based on the probability distribution of a finitely valued random variable .

[ 28 ] In the study of logic itself, finite-valued logic has served as an aid to understand the nature and existence of infinite-valued logic .

Kurt Gödel attempted to comprehend the human ability for logical intuition in terms of finite-valued logic before concluding that the ability is based on infinite-valued logic.
