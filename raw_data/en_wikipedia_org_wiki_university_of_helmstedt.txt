History [ edit ] Founded by and named after Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel on 15 October 1576, the first university of the duchy and the first Protestant university of the northern Holy Roman Empire quickly became one of the largest German universities.

[ 1 ] In order to train pastors and administrators for work in the Lutheran churches, the duchy needed a university of its own. In 1575, Julius obtained the Emperor's permission to open a university in Helmstedt. One year later the first lectures started.

[ 2 ] The princes of Wolfenbüttel held the office of the rector, starting with Julius' 12-year-old son John Henry .

Tilemann Heshusius was an important early Lutheran theologian at Helmstedt. He developed a clergy network in the region that supported other Helmstedt professors, including Daniel Hofmann, Gottfried Schulter, Basilius Sattler, and Tilemann's son, Heinrich Heshusius .

[ 3 ] The university developed four faculties for theology , law , medicine and philosophy including the seven liberal arts . The great auditorium, the Juleum Novum, was erected in 1592.

In the late 18th century, Helmstedt lost popularity to newer universities, such as the University of Göttingen . It was closed in 1810 on initiative of Johannes von Müller , director of public instruction in the Kingdom of Westphalia .
