For information about other types of connections in mathematics, see Connection (mathematics) .

In mathematics , and especially differential geometry and gauge theory , a connection is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to "connect" or identify fibers over nearby points. A principal G -connection on a principal G-bundle P {\displaystyle P} over a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a particular type of connection that is compatible with the action of the group G {\displaystyle G} .

A principal connection can be viewed as a special case of the notion of an Ehresmann connection , and is sometimes called a principal Ehresmann connection . It gives rise to (Ehresmann) connections on any fiber bundle associated to P {\displaystyle P} via the associated bundle construction. In particular, on any associated vector bundle the principal connection induces a covariant derivative , an operator that can differentiate sections of that bundle along tangent directions in the base manifold. Principal connections generalize to arbitrary principal bundles the concept of a linear connection on the frame bundle of a smooth manifold .

Formal definition [ edit ] A principal bundle connection form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } may be thought of as a projection operator on the tangent bundle T P {\displaystyle TP} of the principal bundle P {\displaystyle P} . The kernel of the connection form is given by the horizontal subspaces for the associated Ehresmann connection .

A connection is equivalently specified by a choice of horizontal subspace H p ⊂ ⊂ T p P {\displaystyle H_{p}\subset T_{p}P} for every tangent space to the principal bundle P {\displaystyle P} .

A principal bundle connection is required to be compatible with the right group action of G {\displaystyle G} on P {\displaystyle P} . This can be visualized as the right multiplication R g {\displaystyle R_{g}} taking the horizontal subspaces into each other. This equivariance of the horizontal subspaces H ⊂ ⊂ T P {\displaystyle H\subset TP} interpreted in terms of the connection form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } leads to its characteristic equivariance properties.

Let π π : P → → M {\displaystyle \pi :P\to M} be a smooth principal G -bundle over a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} . Then a principal G {\displaystyle G} -connection on P {\displaystyle P} is a differential 1-form on P {\displaystyle P} with values in the Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} of G {\displaystyle G} which is G {\displaystyle G} -equivariant and reproduces the Lie algebra generators of the fundamental vector fields on P {\displaystyle P} .

In other words, it is an element ω of Ω Ω 1 ( P , g ) ≅ ≅ C ∞ ∞ ( P , T ∗ ∗ P ⊗ ⊗ g ) {\displaystyle \Omega ^{1}(P,{\mathfrak {g}})\cong C^{\infty }(P,T^{*}P\otimes {\mathfrak {g}})} such that Ad g ( R g ∗ ∗ ω ω ) = ω ω {\displaystyle {\hbox{Ad}}_{g}(R_{g}^{*}\omega )=\omega } where R g {\displaystyle R_{g}} denotes right multiplication by g {\displaystyle g} , and Ad g {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ad} _{g}} is the adjoint representation on g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} (explicitly, Ad g ⁡ ⁡ X = d d t g exp ⁡ ⁡ ( t X ) g − − 1 | t = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Ad} _{g}X={\frac {d}{dt}}g\exp(tX)g^{-1}{\bigl |}_{t=0}} ); if ξ ξ ∈ ∈ g {\displaystyle \xi \in {\mathfrak {g}}} and X ξ ξ {\displaystyle X_{\xi }} is the vector field on P associated to ξ by differentiating the G action on P , then ω ω ( X ξ ξ ) = ξ ξ {\displaystyle \omega (X_{\xi })=\xi } (identically on P {\displaystyle P} ).

Sometimes the term principal G {\displaystyle G} -connection refers to the pair ( P , ω ω ) {\displaystyle (P,\omega )} and ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } itself is called the connection form or connection 1-form of the principal connection.

Computational remarks [ edit ] Most known non-trivial computations of principal G {\displaystyle G} -connections are done with homogeneous spaces because of the triviality of the (co)tangent bundle. (For example, let G → → H → → H / G {\displaystyle G\to H\to H/G} , be a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle over H / G {\displaystyle H/G} .) This means that real-valued 1-forms on the total space H {\displaystyle H} are canonically isomorphic to C ∞ ∞ ( H , h ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(H,{\mathfrak {h}}^{*})} , where h ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {h}}^{*}} is the dual Lie algebra, hence G {\displaystyle G} -connections are in bijection with C ∞ ∞ ( H , h ∗ ∗ ⊗ ⊗ g ) G {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(H,{\mathfrak {h}}^{*}\otimes {\mathfrak {g}})^{G}} .

Relation to Ehresmann connections [ edit ] A principal G {\displaystyle G} -connection ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } on P {\displaystyle P} determines an Ehresmann connection on P {\displaystyle P} in the following way. First note that the fundamental vector fields generating the G {\displaystyle G} action on P {\displaystyle P} provide a bundle isomorphism (covering the identity of P {\displaystyle P} ) from the bundle V {\displaystyle V} to P × × g {\displaystyle P\times {\mathfrak {g}}} , where V = ker ⁡ ⁡ ( d π π ) {\displaystyle V=\ker(d\pi )} is the kernel of the tangent mapping d π π : : T P → → T M {\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }\pi \colon TP\to TM} which is called the vertical bundle of P {\displaystyle P} . It follows that ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } determines uniquely a bundle map v : T P → → V {\displaystyle v:TP\rightarrow V} which is the identity on V {\displaystyle V} . Such a projection v {\displaystyle v} is uniquely determined by its kernel, which is a smooth subbundle H {\displaystyle H} of T P {\displaystyle TP} (called the horizontal bundle ) such that T P = V ⊕ ⊕ H {\displaystyle TP=V\oplus H} . This is an Ehresmann connection.

Conversely, an Ehresmann connection H ⊂ ⊂ T P {\displaystyle H\subset TP} (or v : T P → → V {\displaystyle v:TP\rightarrow V} ) on P {\displaystyle P} defines a principal G {\displaystyle G} -connection ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } if and only if it is G {\displaystyle G} -equivariant in the sense that H p g = d ( R g ) p ( H p ) {\displaystyle H_{pg}=\mathrm {d} (R_{g})_{p}(H_{p})} .

Pull back via trivializing section [ edit ] A trivializing section of a principal bundle P {\displaystyle P} is given by a section s of P {\displaystyle P} over an open subset U {\displaystyle U} of M {\displaystyle M} . Then the pullback s * ω of a principal connection is a 1-form on U {\displaystyle U} with values in g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} .
If the section s is replaced by a new section sg , defined by ( sg )( x ) = s ( x ) g ( x ), where g : M → G is a smooth map, then ( s g ) ∗ ∗ ω ω = Ad ⁡ ⁡ ( g ) − − 1 s ∗ ∗ ω ω + g − − 1 d g {\displaystyle (sg)^{*}\omega =\operatorname {Ad} (g)^{-1}s^{*}\omega +g^{-1}dg} . The principal connection is uniquely determined by this family of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 1-forms, and these 1-forms are also called connection forms or connection 1-forms , particularly in older or more physics-oriented literature.

Bundle of principal connections [ edit ] The group G {\displaystyle G} acts on the tangent bundle T P {\displaystyle TP} by right translation.  The quotient space TP / G is also a manifold, and inherits the structure of a fibre bundle over TM which shall be denoted dπ : TP / G → TM .  Let ρ: TP / G → M be the projection onto M .  The fibres of the bundle TP / G under the projection ρ carry an additive structure.

The bundle TP / G is called the bundle of principal connections ( Kobayashi 1957 ).  A section Γ of dπ: TP / G → TM such that Γ : TM → TP / G is a linear morphism of vector bundles over M , can be identified with a principal connection in P .  Conversely, a principal connection as defined above gives rise to such a section Γ of TP / G .

Finally, let Γ be a principal connection in this sense.  Let q : TP → TP / G be the quotient map.  The horizontal distribution of the connection is the bundle H = q − − 1 Γ Γ ( T M ) ⊂ ⊂ T P .

{\displaystyle H=q^{-1}\Gamma (TM)\subset TP.} We see again the link to the horizontal bundle and thus Ehresmann connection.

Affine property [ edit ] If ω and ω ′ are principal connections on a principal bundle P , then the difference ω ′ − ω is a g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 1-form on P that is not only G -equivariant, but horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on any section of the vertical bundle V of P . Hence it is basic and so is determined by a 1-form on M with values in the adjoint bundle g P := P × × G g .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}_{P}:=P\times ^{G}{\mathfrak {g}}.} Conversely, any such one form defines (via pullback) a G -equivariant horizontal 1-form on P , and the space of principal G -connections is an affine space for this space of 1-forms.

Examples [ edit ] Maurer-Cartan connection [ edit ] For the trivial principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle π π : E → → X {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X} where E = G × × X {\displaystyle E=G\times X} , there is a canonical connection [ 1 ] pg 49 ω ω M C ∈ ∈ Ω Ω 1 ( E , g ) {\displaystyle \omega _{MC}\in \Omega ^{1}(E,{\mathfrak {g}})} called the Maurer-Cartan connection. It is defined at a point ( g , x ) ∈ ∈ G × × X {\displaystyle (g,x)\in G\times X} by ( ω ω M C ) ( g , x ) = ( L g − − 1 ∘ ∘ π π 1 ) ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle (\omega _{MC})_{(g,x)}=(L_{g^{-1}}\circ \pi _{1})_{*}} for x ∈ ∈ X , g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle x\in X,g\in G} which is a composition T ( g , x ) E → π π 1 ∗ ∗ T g G → ( L g − − 1 ) ∗ ∗ T e G = g {\displaystyle T_{(g,x)}E\xrightarrow {\pi _{1*}} T_{g}G\xrightarrow {(L_{g^{-1}})_{*}} T_{e}G={\mathfrak {g}}} defining the 1-form. Note that ω ω 0 = ( L g − − 1 ) ∗ ∗ : T g G → → T e G = g {\displaystyle \omega _{0}=(L_{g^{-1}})_{*}:T_{g}G\to T_{e}G={\mathfrak {g}}} is the Maurer-Cartan form on the Lie group G {\displaystyle G} and ω ω M C = π π 1 ∗ ∗ ω ω 0 {\displaystyle \omega _{MC}=\pi _{1}^{*}\omega _{0}} .

Trivial bundle [ edit ] For a trivial principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle π π : E → → X {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X} , the identity section i : X → → G × × X {\displaystyle i:X\to G\times X} given by i ( x ) = ( e , x ) {\displaystyle i(x)=(e,x)} defines a 1-1 correspondence i ∗ ∗ : Ω Ω 1 ( E , g ) → → Ω Ω 1 ( X , g ) {\displaystyle i^{*}:\Omega ^{1}(E,{\mathfrak {g}})\to \Omega ^{1}(X,{\mathfrak {g}})} between connections on E {\displaystyle E} and g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 1-forms on X {\displaystyle X} [ 1 ] pg 53 . For a g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 1-form A {\displaystyle A} on X {\displaystyle X} , there is a unique 1-form A ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}} on E {\displaystyle E} such that A ~ ~ ( X ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}(X)=0} for X ∈ ∈ T x E {\displaystyle X\in T_{x}E} a vertical vector R g ∗ ∗ A ~ ~ = Ad ( g − − 1 ) ∘ ∘ A ~ ~ {\displaystyle R_{g}^{*}{\tilde {A}}={\text{Ad}}(g^{-1})\circ {\tilde {A}}} for any g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} Then given this 1-form, a connection on E {\displaystyle E} can be constructed by taking the sum ω ω M C + A ~ ~ {\displaystyle \omega _{MC}+{\tilde {A}}} giving an actual connection on E {\displaystyle E} . This unique 1-form can be constructed by first looking at it restricted to ( e , x ) {\displaystyle (e,x)} for x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} . Then, A ~ ~ ( e , x ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}_{(e,x)}} is determined by A {\displaystyle A} because T ( x , e ) E = k e r ( π π ∗ ∗ ) ⊕ ⊕ i ∗ ∗ T x X {\displaystyle T_{(x,e)}E=ker(\pi _{*})\oplus i_{*}T_{x}X} and we can get A ~ ~ ( g , x ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}_{(g,x)}} by taking A ~ ~ ( g , x ) = R g ∗ ∗ A ~ ~ ( e , x ) = Ad ( g − − 1 ) ∘ ∘ A ~ ~ ( e , x ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}_{(g,x)}=R_{g}^{*}{\tilde {A}}_{(e,x)}={\text{Ad}}(g^{-1})\circ {\tilde {A}}_{(e,x)}} Similarly, the form A ~ ~ ( x , g ) = Ad ( g − − 1 ) ∘ ∘ A x ∘ ∘ π π ∗ ∗ : T ( x , g ) E → → g {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}_{(x,g)}={\text{Ad}}(g^{-1})\circ A_{x}\circ \pi _{*}:T_{(x,g)}E\to {\mathfrak {g}}} defines a 1-form giving the properties 1 and 2 listed above.

Extending this to non-trivial bundles [ edit ] This statement can be refined [ 1 ] pg 55 even further for non-trivial bundles E → → X {\displaystyle E\to X} by considering an open covering U = { U a } a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}=\{U_{a}\}_{a\in I}} of X {\displaystyle X} with trivializations { ϕ ϕ a } a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \{\phi _{a}\}_{a\in I}} and transition functions { g a b } a , b ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \{g_{ab}\}_{a,b\in I}} . Then, there is a 1-1 correspondence between connections on E {\displaystyle E} and collections of 1-forms { A a ∈ ∈ Ω Ω 1 ( U a , g ) } a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \{A_{a}\in \Omega _{1}(U_{a},{\mathfrak {g}})\}_{a\in I}} which satisfy A b = A d ( g a b − − 1 ) ∘ ∘ A a + g a b ∗ ∗ ω ω 0 {\displaystyle A_{b}=Ad(g_{ab}^{-1})\circ A_{a}+g_{ab}^{*}\omega _{0}} on the intersections U a b {\displaystyle U_{ab}} for ω ω 0 {\displaystyle \omega _{0}} the Maurer-Cartan form on G {\displaystyle G} , ω ω 0 = g − − 1 d g {\displaystyle \omega _{0}=g^{-1}dg} in matrix form.

Global reformulation of space of connections [ edit ] For a principal G {\displaystyle G} bundle π π : E → → M {\displaystyle \pi :E\to M} the set of connections in E {\displaystyle E} is an affine space [ 1 ] pg 57 for the vector space Ω Ω 1 ( M , E g ) {\displaystyle \Omega ^{1}(M,E_{\mathfrak {g}})} where E g {\displaystyle E_{\mathfrak {g}}} is the associated adjoint vector bundle. This implies for any two connections ω ω 0 , ω ω 1 {\displaystyle \omega _{0},\omega _{1}} there exists a form A ∈ ∈ Ω Ω 1 ( M , E g ) {\displaystyle A\in \Omega ^{1}(M,E_{\mathfrak {g}})} such that ω ω 0 = ω ω 1 + A {\displaystyle \omega _{0}=\omega _{1}+A} We denote the set of connections as A ( E ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}(E)} , or just A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} if the context is clear.

Connection on the complex Hopf-bundle [ edit ] We [ 1 ] pg 94 can construct C P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}} as a principal C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{*}} -bundle γ γ : H C → → C P n {\displaystyle \gamma :H_{\mathbb {C} }\to \mathbb {CP} ^{n}} where H C = C n + 1 − − { 0 } {\displaystyle H_{\mathbb {C} }=\mathbb {C} ^{n+1}-\{0\}} and γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the projection map γ γ ( z 0 , … … , z n ) = [ z 0 , … … , z n ] {\displaystyle \gamma (z_{0},\ldots ,z_{n})=[z_{0},\ldots ,z_{n}]} Note the Lie algebra of C ∗ ∗ = G L ( 1 , C ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{*}=GL(1,\mathbb {C} )} is just the complex plane. The 1-form ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω 1 ( H C , C ) {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega ^{1}(H_{\mathbb {C} },\mathbb {C} )} defined as ω ω = z ¯ ¯ t d z | z | 2 = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n z ¯ ¯ i | z | 2 d z i {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega &={\frac {{\overline {z}}^{t}dz}{|z|^{2}}}\\&=\sum _{i=0}^{n}{\frac {{\overline {z}}_{i}}{|z|^{2}}}dz_{i}\end{aligned}}} forms a connection, which can be checked by verifying the definition. For any fixed λ λ ∈ ∈ C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \lambda \in \mathbb {C} ^{*}} we have R λ λ ∗ ∗ ω ω = ( z λ λ ) ¯ ¯ t d ( z λ λ ) | z λ λ | 2 = λ λ ¯ ¯ λ λ z ¯ ¯ t d z | λ λ | 2 ⋅ ⋅ | z | 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R_{\lambda }^{*}\omega &={\frac {{\overline {(z\lambda )}}^{t}d(z\lambda )}{|z\lambda |^{2}}}\\&={\frac {{\overline {\lambda }}\lambda {\overline {z}}^{t}dz}{|\lambda |^{2}\cdot |z|^{2}}}\end{aligned}}} and since | λ λ | 2 = λ λ ¯ ¯ λ λ {\displaystyle |\lambda |^{2}={\overline {\lambda }}{\lambda }} , we have C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{*}} -invariance. This is because the adjoint action is trivial since the Lie algebra is Abelian. For constructing the splitting, note for any z ∈ ∈ H C {\displaystyle z\in H_{\mathbb {C} }} we have a short exact sequence 0 → → C → v z T z H C → γ γ ∗ ∗ T [ z ] C P n → → 0 {\displaystyle 0\to \mathbb {C} \xrightarrow {v_{z}} T_{z}H_{\mathbb {C} }\xrightarrow {\gamma _{*}} T_{[z]}\mathbb {CP} ^{n}\to 0} where v z {\displaystyle v_{z}} is defined as v z ( λ λ ) = z ⋅ ⋅ λ λ {\displaystyle v_{z}(\lambda )=z\cdot \lambda } so it acts as scaling in the fiber (which restricts to the corresponding C ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{*}} -action). Taking ω ω z ∘ ∘ v z ( λ λ ) {\displaystyle \omega _{z}\circ v_{z}(\lambda )} we get ω ω z ∘ ∘ v z ( λ λ ) = z ¯ ¯ d z | z | 2 ( z λ λ ) = z ¯ ¯ z λ λ | z | 2 = λ λ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{z}\circ v_{z}(\lambda )&={\frac {{\overline {z}}dz}{|z|^{2}}}(z\lambda )\\&={\frac {{\overline {z}}z\lambda }{|z|^{2}}}\\&=\lambda \end{aligned}}} where the second equality follows because we are considering z λ λ {\displaystyle z\lambda } a vertical tangent vector, and d z ( z λ λ ) = z λ λ {\displaystyle dz(z\lambda )=z\lambda } . The notation is somewhat confusing, but if we expand out each term d z = d z 0 + ⋯ ⋯ + d z n z = a 0 z 0 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n z n d z ( z ) = a 0 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n d z ( λ λ z ) = λ λ ⋅ ⋅ ( a 0 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n ) z ¯ ¯ = a 0 ¯ ¯ + ⋯ ⋯ + a n ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}dz&=dz_{0}+\cdots +dz_{n}\\z&=a_{0}z_{0}+\cdots +a_{n}z_{n}\\dz(z)&=a_{0}+\cdots +a_{n}\\dz(\lambda z)&=\lambda \cdot (a_{0}+\cdots +a_{n})\\{\overline {z}}&={\overline {a_{0}}}+\cdots +{\overline {a_{n}}}\end{aligned}}} it becomes more clear (where a i ∈ ∈ C {\displaystyle a_{i}\in \mathbb {C} } ).

Induced covariant and exterior derivatives [ edit ] For any linear representation W of G there is an associated vector bundle P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} over M , and a principal connection induces a covariant derivative on any such vector bundle. This covariant derivative can be defined using the fact that the space of sections of P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} over M is isomorphic to the space of G -equivariant W -valued functions on P . More generally, the space of k -forms with values in P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} is identified with the space of G -equivariant and horizontal W -valued k -forms on P . If α is such a k -form, then its exterior derivative d α , although G -equivariant, is no longer horizontal. However, the combination d α + ω Λ α is. This defines an exterior covariant derivative d ω from P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} -valued k -forms on M to P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} -valued ( k +1)-forms on M . In particular, when k =0, we obtain a covariant derivative on P × × G W {\displaystyle P\times ^{G}W} .

Curvature form [ edit ] The curvature form of a principal G -connection ω is the g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 2-form Ω defined by Ω Ω = d ω ω + 1 2 [ ω ω ∧ ∧ ω ω ] .

{\displaystyle \Omega =d\omega +{\tfrac {1}{2}}[\omega \wedge \omega ].} It is G -equivariant and horizontal, hence corresponds to a 2-form on M with values in g P {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}_{P}} . The identification of the curvature with this quantity is sometimes called the (Cartan's) second structure equation .

[ 2 ] Historically, the emergence of the structure equations are found in the development of the Cartan connection .  When transposed into the context of Lie groups , the structure equations are known as the Maurer–Cartan equations : they are the same equations, but in a different setting and notation.

Flat connections and characterization of bundles with flat connections [ edit ] We say that a connection ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is flat if its curvature form Ω Ω = 0 {\displaystyle \Omega =0} . There is a useful characterization of principal bundles with flat connections; that is, a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle π π : E → → X {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X} has a flat connection [ 1 ] pg 68 if and only if there exists an open covering { U a } a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \{U_{a}\}_{a\in I}} with trivializations { ϕ ϕ a } a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left\{\phi _{a}\right\}_{a\in I}} such that all transition functions g a b : U a ∩ ∩ U b → → G {\displaystyle g_{ab}:U_{a}\cap U_{b}\to G} are constant. This is useful because it gives a recipe for constructing flat principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundles over smooth manifolds; namely taking an open cover and defining trivializations with constant transition functions.

Connections on frame bundles and torsion [ edit ] If the principal bundle P is the frame bundle , or (more generally) if it has a solder form , then the connection is an example of an affine connection , and the curvature is not the only invariant, since the additional structure of the solder form θ , which is an equivariant R n -valued 1-form on P , should be taken into account. In particular, the torsion form on P , is an R n -valued 2-form Θ defined by Θ Θ = d θ θ + ω ω ∧ ∧ θ θ .

{\displaystyle \Theta =\mathrm {d} \theta +\omega \wedge \theta .} Θ is G -equivariant and horizontal, and so it descends to a tangent-valued 2-form on M , called the torsion . This equation is sometimes called the (Cartan's) first structure equation .

Definition in algebraic geometry [ edit ] If X is a scheme (or more generally, stack, derived stack, or even prestack), we can associate to it its so-called de Rham stack , denoted X dR . This has the property that a principal G bundle over X dR is the same thing as a G bundle with *flat* connection over X .
