| Tie |

The **tie** is a symbol in the shape of an [arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(geometry) "Arc (geometry)") similar to a large [breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve"), used in [Central Alaskan Yupʼik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Alaskan_Yup%CA%BCik "Central Alaskan Yupʼik"), [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), phonetic alphabets, and [Z notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation "Z notation"). It can be used between two characters with spacing as [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"), non-spacing as a [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic"), or (underneath) as a [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading") mark. It can be above or below, and reversed. Its forms are called **tie**, **double breve**, **enotikon** or **papyrological hyphen**, **ligature tie**, and **undertie**.

### Cyrillic transliteration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tie_(typography)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Cyrillic transliteration")]

In the [ALA-LC romanization for Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALA-LC_romanization_for_Russian "ALA-LC romanization for Russian"), a tie symbol is placed over some combinations of Latin letters that are represented by a single letter in the Cyrillic alphabet, e.g., T͡S for [Ц](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A6 "Ц") and i͡a for [Я](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF "Я"). This is not uniformly applied, however; some letters corresponding to common digraphs in English, such as SH for [Ш](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8 "Ш") and KH for [Х](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5 "Х") do not employ the tie. In practice, the tie ligature is often omitted.

"Enotikon" redirects here; not to be confused with [emoticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon "Emoticon").

The **enotikon** (ἑνωτικόν, _henōtikón_, lit."uniter", from ἑνωτικός "a serving to unite or unify"), **papyrological hyphen**, or **Greek hyphen** was a low tie mark found in late [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greek "Classical Greek") and [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Greek "Byzantine Greek")[papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyri "Papyri").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-nickyh-1) In an era when Greek texts were typically written _[scripta continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripta\_continua "Scripta continua")_, the enotikon served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word rather than misunderstood as two separate words. (Its companion mark was the [hypodiastole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodiastole "Hypodiastole"), which showed that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-nicky-2)) Although [modern Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek "Modern Greek") now uses the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script")[hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen"), the [Hellenic Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Organization_for_Standardization "Hellenic Organization for Standardization") included mention of the enotikon in its [romanization standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-elot-3) and [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") is able to reproduce the symbol with its characters U+203F‿UNDERTIE and U+035C◌͜◌COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-nicky-2)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-litchfield-4)

The enotikon was also used in [Greek musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_musical_notation "Greek musical notation"), as a [slur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slur_(music) "Slur (music)") under two notes. When a syllable was sung with three notes, this slur was used in combination with a [double point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") and a [diseme overline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline "Overline").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-litchfield-4)

### International Phonetic Alphabet

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tie_(typography)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: International Phonetic Alphabet")]

The [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") uses two type of ties: the ligature tie (IPA #433), above or below two symbols and the undertie (IPA #509) between two symbols.

The ligature tie, also called double inverted breve, is used to represent [double articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_articulated_consonant "Doubly articulated consonant") (e.g. [k͡p]), [affricates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate_consonant "Affricate consonant") (e.g. [t͡ʃ]) or [prenasalized consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenasalized_consonant "Prenasalized consonant") (e.g. [m͡b]) in the IPA. It is mostly found above but can also be found below when more suitable (e.g. [k͜p]).

On computers, it is encoded with characters U+0361◌͡◌COMBINING DOUBLE INVERTED BREVE and, as an alternative when ascenders might be interfering with the bow, U+035C◌͜◌COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW.

The undertie is used to represent linking (absence of a break) in the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, it is used to indicate [liaison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_(French) "Liaison (French)") (e.g. /vuz‿ave/) but can also be used for other types of [sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi "Sandhi").

On computers, the character used is U+203F‿[UNDERTIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Punctuation#Block "General Punctuation"). This is a [spacing character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_character "Spacing character"), not to be confused with the alternative (below-letter) form of the ligature tie (a͜b U+035C◌͜◌COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW), which is a [combining character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character "Combining character").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-5)

### Uralic Phonetic Alphabet

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tie_(typography)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Uralic Phonetic Alphabet")]

The [Uralic Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_Phonetic_Alphabet "Uralic Phonetic Alphabet") uses several forms of the tie or double breve:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-7)

*   The triple inverted breve or triple breve below indicates a [triphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triphthong "Triphthong")
*   The double inverted breve, also known as the ligature tie, marks a [diphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong")
*   The double inverted breve below indicates a syllable boundary between vowels
*   The undertie is used for [prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics) "Prosody (linguistics)")
*   The inverted undertie is used for prosody.

In musical score [engraving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_engraving "Music engraving"), the undertie symbol is called an "elision slur" or "lyric slur",[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-8) and is used to indicate [synalepha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synalepha "Synalepha"): the elision of two or more spoken syllables into a single note; this is in contrast to the more common [melisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisma "Melisma"), the extension of a _single_ spoken syllable over _multiple_ sung notes. Although rare in English texts, synalepha is often encountered in musical lyrics written in the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages").

In use, the undertie is placed between the words of the lyric that are to be sung as one note to prevent the space between them being interpreted as a syllable break. For example, in the printed lyric "the‿im - mor - tal air", the undertie between "the" and "im-" instructs the singer to elide these two syllables into one, thus reducing five spoken syllables into four sung notes.

Various forms of the tie

In [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading"), the undertie was used to indicate that word in a manuscript had been divided incorrectly by a space. (See [Hyphen §Origin and history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Origin_and_history "Hyphen")). The indicator used in modern practice is U+2050⁐CLOSE UP.

In the field of computing, the Unicode character U+2040⁀CHARACTER TIE is used to represent concatenation of sequences in [Z notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation "Z notation"). For example, "s⁀t" represents the concatenation sequence of sequences called _s_ and _t_, while the notation "⁀/q" is the distributed concatenation of the sequence of sequences called _q_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-9)

The double breve is used in the phonetic notation of the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language "The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language") in combination with a double o, o͝o, to represent the [near-close near-back rounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-back_rounded_vowel "Near-close near-back rounded vowel") (/ʊ/ in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-10)

The triple breve below is used in the phonetic writing [Rheinische Dokumenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinische_Dokumenta "Rheinische Dokumenta") for three-letter combinations.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography)#cite_note-11)

In the practical [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, the tie is used in the [digraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)") ‹u͡g, u͡r› and the [trigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigraph_(orthography) "Trigraph (orthography)") ‹u͡rr›.

The diacritic marks _triple inverted breve_, _triple breve_, and _double inverted breve_ do not have explicit code-points in Unicode, but can be reproduced using [combining half marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Half_Marks "Combining Half Marks").

Unicode has characters similar to the tie:

*   U+23DC⏜TOP PARENTHESIS and U+23DD⏝BOTTOM PARENTHESIS
*   U+2322⌢FROWN and U+2323⌣SMILE
*   U+2050⁐CLOSE UP, which is a [proofreading mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading_mark "Proofreading mark")

*   [Typographic ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature")– Glyph combining two or more letterforms
*   [Legato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legato "Legato")– Indicates that musical notes are played or sung smoothly and connected
*   [Breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve")– Diacritical mark, ◌̆
*   [Inverted breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_breve "Inverted breve")– Diacritical mark, ◌̑
*   [Underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore "Underscore")– Typographic symbol (_) (underline)
