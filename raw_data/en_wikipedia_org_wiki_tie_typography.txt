It can be used between two characters with spacing as punctuation , non-spacing as a diacritic , or (underneath) as a proofreading mark. It can be above or below, and reversed. Its forms are called tie , double breve , enotikon or papyrological hyphen , ligature tie , and undertie .

Uses [ edit ] Cyrillic transliteration [ edit ] In the ALA-LC romanization for Russian , a tie symbol is placed over some combinations of Latin letters that are represented by a single letter in the Cyrillic alphabet, e.g., T͡S for Ц and i͡a for Я . This is not uniformly applied, however; some letters corresponding to common digraphs in English, such as SH for Ш and KH for Х do not employ the tie. In practice, the tie ligature is often omitted.

Greek [ edit ] "Enotikon" redirects here; not to be confused with emoticon .

The enotikon ( ἑνωτικόν , henōtikón , lit.

"uniter", from ἑνωτικός "a serving to unite or unify"), papyrological hyphen , or Greek hyphen was a low tie mark found in late Classical and Byzantine papyri .

[ 1 ] In an era when Greek texts were typically written scripta continua , the enotikon served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word rather than misunderstood as two separate words. (Its companion mark was the hypodiastole , which showed that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words.

[ 2 ] ) Although modern Greek now uses the Latin hyphen , the Hellenic Organization for Standardization included mention of the enotikon in its romanization standard [ 3 ] and Unicode is able to reproduce the symbol with its characters U+203F ‿ UNDERTIE and U+035C ◌͜◌ COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW .

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] The enotikon was also used in Greek musical notation , as a slur under two notes. When a syllable was sung with three notes, this slur was used in combination with a double point and a diseme overline .

[ 4 ] International Phonetic Alphabet [ edit ] The International Phonetic Alphabet uses two type of ties: the ligature tie (IPA #433), above or below two symbols and the undertie (IPA #509) between two symbols.

Ligature tie [ edit ] The ligature tie, also called double inverted breve, is used to represent double articulation (e.g.

[k͡p] ), affricates (e.g.

[t͡ʃ] ) or prenasalized consonants (e.g.

[m͡b] ) in the IPA. It is mostly found above but can also be found below when more suitable (e.g.

[k͜p] ).

On computers, it is encoded with characters U+0361 ◌͡◌ COMBINING DOUBLE INVERTED BREVE and, as an alternative when ascenders might be interfering with the bow, U+035C ◌͜◌ COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW .

Undertie [ edit ] The undertie is used to represent linking (absence of a break) in the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, it is used to indicate liaison (e.g.

/vuz‿ave/ ) but can also be used for other types of sandhi .

On computers, the character used is U+203F ‿ UNDERTIE . This is a spacing character , not to be confused with the alternative (below-letter) form of the ligature tie (a͜b U+035C ◌͜◌ COMBINING DOUBLE BREVE BELOW ), which is a combining character .

[ 5 ] Uralic Phonetic Alphabet [ edit ] The Uralic Phonetic Alphabet uses several forms of the tie or double breve: [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The triple inverted breve or triple breve below indicates a triphthong The double inverted breve, also known as the ligature tie, marks a diphthong The double inverted breve below indicates a syllable boundary between vowels The undertie is used for prosody The inverted undertie is used for prosody.

Vocal music scores [ edit ] In musical score engraving , the undertie symbol is called an "elision slur" or "lyric slur", [ 8 ] and is used to indicate synalepha : the elision of two or more spoken syllables into a single note; this is in contrast to the more common melisma , the extension of a single spoken syllable over multiple sung notes. Although rare in English texts, synalepha is often encountered in musical lyrics written in the Romance languages .

In use, the undertie is placed between the words of the lyric that are to be sung as one note to prevent the space between them being interpreted as a syllable break. For example, in the printed lyric "the‿im - mor - tal air", the undertie between "the" and "im-" instructs the singer to elide these two syllables into one, thus reducing five spoken syllables into four sung notes.

Other uses [ edit ] Various forms of the tie In proofreading , the undertie was used to indicate that word in a manuscript had been divided incorrectly by a space. (See Hyphen § Origin and history ). The indicator used in modern practice is U+2050 ⁐ CLOSE UP .

In the field of computing, the Unicode character U+2040 ⁀ CHARACTER TIE is used to represent concatenation of sequences in Z notation . For example, "s⁀t" represents the concatenation sequence of sequences called s and t , while the notation "⁀/q" is the distributed concatenation of the sequence of sequences called q .

[ 9 ] The double breve is used in the phonetic notation of the American Heritage Dictionary in combination with a double o, o͝o, to represent the near-close near-back rounded vowel ( /ʊ/ in IPA ).

[ 10 ] The triple breve below is used in the phonetic writing Rheinische Dokumenta for three-letter combinations.

[ 11 ] In the practical orthography of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, the tie is used in the digraphs ‹ u͡g, u͡r › and the trigraph ‹ u͡rr ›.
