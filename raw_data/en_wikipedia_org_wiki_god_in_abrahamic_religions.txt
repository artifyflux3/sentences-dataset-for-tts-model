[ 2 ] The most prominent Abrahamic religions are Judaism , Christianity , and Islam .

[ 3 ] They—alongside Samaritanism , Druzism , the Baháʼí Faith , [ 3 ] and Rastafari [ 3 ] —all share a common foundation in worshipping Abraham's God, who is called Yahweh in Hebrew and Allah in Arabic .

[ 7 ] Likewise, the Abrahamic religions share similar features distinguishing them from other categories of religions : [ 8 ] all of their theological traditions are, to some extent, influenced by the depiction of the God of Israel in the Hebrew Bible ; [ 10 ] all of them trace their roots to Abraham as a common genealogical and spiritual patriarch .

[ 11 ] In the Abrahamic tradition, God is one , eternal , omnipotent , omniscient , and the creator of the universe .

[ 1 ] God is typically referred to with masculine grammatical articles and pronouns only, [ 1 ] [ 12 ] and is further held to have the properties of holiness , justice , omnibenevolence , and omnipresence . Adherents of the Abrahamic religions believe God is also transcendent , meaning he is outside of both space and time and therefore not subject to anything within his creation , but at the same time a personal God : intimately involved, listening to individual prayer, and reacting to the actions of his creatures.

With regard to Christianity, religion scholars have differed on whether Mormonism belongs with mainstream Christian tradition as a whole (i.e., Nicene Christianity ), with some asserting that it amounts to a distinct Abrahamic religion in itself due to noteworthy theological differences .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Rastafari, the heterogenous movement that originated in Jamaica in the 1930s, is variously classified by religion scholars as either an international socio-religious movement, a distinct Abrahamic religion, or a new religious movement .

[ 15 ] Judaism [ edit ] Main article: God in Judaism Further information: Elohim , Shema Yisrael , and Tetragrammaton The Mesha Stele bears the earliest known reference (840 BCE) to the Israelite god Yahweh .

[ 16 ] Judaism, the oldest Abrahamic religion, is based on a strict, exclusive monotheism , [ 4 ] [ 17 ] finding its origins in the sole veneration of Yahweh , [ 4 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the predecessor to the Abrahamic conception of God.

[ Note 1 ] The names of God used most often in the Hebrew Bible are the Tetragrammaton ( Hebrew : יהוה , romanized : YHWH ) and Elohim .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Jews traditionally do not pronounce it, and instead refer to God as HaShem , literally "the Name". In prayer, the Tetragrammaton is substituted with the pronunciation Adonai , meaning "My Lord".

[ 27 ] This is referred to primarily in the Torah: " Hear O Israel: the LORD is our God, the LORD is One " ( Deuteronomy 6:4 ).

[ 27 ] God is conceived as unique and perfect, free from all faults, deficiencies, and defects, and further held to be omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient , and completely infinite in all of his attributes, who has no partner or equal, being the sole creator of everything in existence.

[ 4 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In Judaism, God is never portrayed in any image .

[ 17 ] [ 29 ] The idea of God as a duality or trinity is heretical in Judaism—it's considered akin to polytheism .

[ 4 ] [ 17 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The Torah specifically forbade ascribing partners to share his singular sovereignty, [ 4 ] [ 17 ] [ 27 ] as he is considered to be the absolute one without a second, indivisible, and incomparable being, who is similar to nothing and nothing is comparable to him.

[ 4 ] [ 28 ] Thus, God is unlike anything in or of the world as to be beyond all forms of human thought and expression.

[ 4 ] [ 28 ] God in Judaism is conceived as anthropomorphic , [ 4 ] [ 26 ] [ 30 ] unique, benevolent, eternal, the creator of the universe, and the ultimate source of morality .

[ 4 ] [ 31 ] Thus, the term God corresponds to an actual ontological reality, and is not merely a projection of the human psyche.

[ 32 ] Traditional interpretations of Judaism generally emphasize that God is personal yet also transcendent and able to intervene in the world, [ 5 ] while some modern interpretations of Judaism emphasize that God is an impersonal force or ideal rather than a supernatural being concerned with the universe.

[ 17 ] [ 30 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 38 ] Most Christian denominations believe Jesus to be the incarnated Son of God, which is the main theological divergence with respect to the exclusive monotheism of the other Abrahamic religions: Judaism , Samaritanism , the Baháʼí Faith , and Islam .

[ 17 ] [ 30 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Although personal salvation is implicitly stated in Judaism, personal salvation by grace and a recurring emphasis in orthodox theological beliefs is particularly emphasized in Christianity, [ 39 ] often contrasting this with a perceived over-emphasis in law observance as stated in Jewish law , where it is contended that a belief in an intermediary between man and God or in the multiplicity of persons in the Godhead is against the Noahide laws , and thus not monotheistic .

[ 40 ] [ better source needed ] In mainstream Christianity , theology and beliefs about God are enshrined in the doctrine of monotheistic Trinitarianism , which holds that the three persons of the trinity are distinct but all of the same indivisible essence, meaning that the Father is God, the Holy Spirit is God, and the Son is God, yet there is one God as there is one indivisible essence.

[ 39 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] These mainstream Christian doctrines were largely formulated at the Council of Nicaea and are enshrined in the Nicene Creed .

[ 39 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The Trinitarian view emphasizes that God has a will , and that God the Son has two natures, divine and human, though these are never in conflict but joined in the hypostatic union .

[ 39 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Mormonism [ edit ] Main article: God in Mormonism Further information: Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints In his 1838 personal history, Joseph Smith wrote that he had seen two personages in the spring of 1820. In 1843, Smith stated that these personages, God the Father and Jesus Christ , had separate, tangible bodies.

[ 43 ] In the belief system held by the Christian churches that adhere to the Latter Day Saint movement and most Mormon denominations , including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the term God refers to Elohim ( God the Father ), [ 43 ] [ 44 ] whereas Godhead means a council of three distinct gods: Elohim (the Eternal Father), Jehovah ( God the Son , Jesus Christ), and the Holy Ghost , in a Non-trinitarian conception of the Godhead .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] The Father and Son have perfected, material bodies, while the Holy Ghost is a spirit and does not have a body.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] This differs significantly from mainstream Christian Trinitarianism; in Mormonism, the three persons are considered to be physically separate beings, or personages, but united in will and purpose.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] As such, the term Godhead differs from how it is used in mainstream Christianity.

[ 44 ] [ 43 ] This description of God represents the orthodoxy of the LDS Church, established early in the 19th century.

[ 44 ] Unitarianism [ edit ] A small minority of Christians, largely coming under the heading of Unitarianism , hold Non-trinitarian conceptions of God .

Islam [ edit ] Part of a series on Islam Allah ( God in Islam ) Allah , Jal-la Jalalu-hu in Arabic calligraphy Theology Allah Names Attributes Phrases and expressions Islam (religion) Throne of God Sufi metaphysics Theology Schools of Islamic theology Oneness Kalam Anthropomorphism and corporealism Expressions and phrases Tasbih (Subhan Allah) Takbir (Allahu Akbar) Hamd (Praise) Shahada Basmala Hawqala Ta'awwudh Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un Allahumma Be, and it is Terms Shirk (polytheism) Iman (belief) Ihsan (development) Nifaq (hypocrisy) Kufr (disobidience/denial) Ta'til (denial of divine attributes) Tanzih (transcendance) Bila Kayf Tafwid Scripture Quran Al-Ikhlas Throne Verse Verse of Light Al-Mu'awwidhatayn Hadith Qudsi Others Inshallah Mashallah Alhamdulillah Jazakallah Istighfar Fi sabilillah Al-Ism al-A'zam Dhikr Ghaib Ilah Islam portal • Category v t e Main articles: Allah and God in Islam In Islam , God ( Allah ) ( Arabic : ٱلل‍َّٰه , romanized : Allāh , IPA: [ɑɫˈɫɑː(h)] ⓘ , lit. "the God") [ 6 ] is the supreme being, all-powerful and all-knowing creator, sustainer, ordainer, and judge of the universe.

[ 6 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular ( tawhid ).

[ 6 ] [ 48 ] He is considered to be unique ( wahid ) and inherently one of them ( ahad ), all-merciful and omnipotent.

[ 6 ] [ 49 ] According to the Quran , there are 99 Names of God ( al-asma al-husna , lit. meaning: "The best names") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of God.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] All these names refer to Allah, considered to be the supreme and all-comprehensive divine Arabic name.

[ 6 ] [ 52 ] Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Entirely Merciful" ( al-Rahman ) and "the Especially Merciful" ( al-Rahim ).

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Islam rejects the doctrine of the Incarnation and the notion of a personal God as anthropomorphic , because it is seen as demeaning to the transcendence of God . The Quran prescribes the fundamental transcendental criterion in the following verses: "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know any one equal to Him?" ( 19:65 ); "(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things)" ( 42:11 ); "And there is none comparable unto Him" ( 112:4 ). Therefore, Islam strictly rejects all forms of anthropomorphism and anthropopathism of the concept of God , and thus categorically rejects the Christian concept of the Trinity or division of persons in the Godhead .

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Muslims believe that Allah is the same God worshipped by the members of the Abrahamic religions that preceded Islam, i.e.

Judaism and Christianity ( 29:46 ).

[ 55 ] Creation and ordering of the universe is seen as an act of prime mercy for which all creatures sing his glories and bear witness to his unity and lordship. According to the Quran: "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things" ( 6:103 ).

[ 47 ] Similarly to Jews, Muslims explicitly reject the divinity of Jesus and don't believe in him as the incarnated God or Son of God, but instead consider him a human prophet and the promised Messiah sent by God, although the Islamic tradition itself is not unanimous on the question of Jesus' death and afterlife .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Baháʼí Faith [ edit ] Part of a series on the Baháʼí Faith Central figures Baháʼu'lláh The Báb ʻAbdu'l-Bahá Basics Teachings Unity of God Unity of humanity Unity of religion Laws Prayer Calendar Nineteen Day Feast Key scripture Kitáb-i-Aqdas Kitáb-i-Íqán The Hidden Words Some Answered Questions Other Texts Institutions Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh Administrative Order The Guardianship Universal House of Justice Spiritual Assemblies History Baháʼí history Timeline Bábism Persecution People Shoghi Effendi Hands of the Cause Apostles Other Baháʼís Bábis Letters of the Living Mullá Husayn Táhirih Places House of Worship Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh Qiblih Shrine of the Báb Síyáh-Chál World Centre Pilgrimage Haifa Acre Other topics Socioeconomic development Progressive revelation Cosmology Symbols Criticism Homosexuality Gender Science Prophecies Statistics Orthography Category v t e Main article: God in the Baháʼí Faith Further information: Baháʼí cosmology and Baháʼí teachings The writings of the Baháʼí Faith describe a monotheistic , personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] : 106 The existence of God and the universe is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.

[ 61 ] Though transcendent and inaccessible directly, [ 62 ] : 438–446 God is nevertheless seen as conscious of the creation, [ 62 ] : 438–446 with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers recognized in the Baháʼí Faith as the Manifestations of God [ 60 ] : 106 (all the Jewish prophets , Zoroaster , Krishna , Gautama Buddha , Jesus , Muhammad , the Báb , and ultimately Baháʼu'lláh ).

[ 62 ] : 438–446 The purpose of the creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator, [ 60 ] : 111 through such methods as prayer , reflection , and being of service to humankind .

[ 63 ] God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through his intermediaries, the prophets and messengers who have founded various world religions from the beginning of humankind up to the present day, [ 60 ] : 107–108 [ 62 ] : 438–446 and will continue to do so in the future.

[ 62 ] : 438–446 The Manifestations of God reflect divine attributes, which are creations of God made for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment, onto the physical plane of existence.

[ 64 ] In the Baháʼí view, all physical beings reflect at least one of these attributes, and the human soul can potentially reflect all of them.

[ 65 ] The Baháʼí conception of God rejects all pantheistic , anthropomorphic , and incarnationist beliefs about God.

[ 60 ] : 106 Rastafari [ edit ] Rastafari refer to God as Jah , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] a shortened version of " Jehovah " in the King James Bible .

[ 69 ] Jah is said to be immanent , [ 70 ] but is also incarnate in each individual.

[ 71 ] This belief is reflected in the Rasta aphorism that "God is man and man is God".

[ 72 ] Rastas describe "knowing" Jah, rather than simply "believing" in him.

[ 73 ] In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces mysticism .

[ 74 ] Closeness to Jah may be accomplished through Livity , a form of the Nazirite creed.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] The Rastafari conception of God has similarities with the Hindu ātman .

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Jesus is an important figure in Rastafari, [ 81 ] but practitioners reject the traditional Christian view of Jesus, and particularly the depiction of him as a white European .

[ 82 ] Many Rastas instead see Haile Selassie I as the fulfilment of Psalm 68:31, and therefore the Messiah or Jah incarnate.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Thus, in this page's context, "Yahweh" is used to refer to God as conceived in the Ancient Hebrew religion, and should not be referenced when describing his later worship in today's Abrahamic religions.

Jewish Virtual Library . American–Israeli Cooperative Enterprise (AICE). 2021 [2017].

Archived from the original on 10 February 2017 . Retrieved 17 October 2021 .

Even though the Talmud and Maimonides stipulate that a non-Jew who violated the Noachide laws was liable to capital punishment , contemporary authorities have expressed the view that this is only the maximal punishment. According to this view, there is a difference between Noachide law and halakhah. According to halakhah, when a Jew was liable for capital punishment it was a mandatory punishment, provided that all conditions had been met, whereas in Noachide law death is the maximal punishment, to be enforced only in exceptional cases. In view of the strict monotheism of Islam, Muslims were considered as Noachides whereas the status of Christians was a matter of debate . Since the late Middle Ages , however, Christianity too has come to be regarded as Noachide, on the ground that Trinitarianism is not forbidden to non-Jews.

The term Godhead also appears several times in Lecture 2 in its sense as used in the Authorized King James Version , meaning divinity .

Quotes: "The Psalms gave the Rastas the trademark name 'JAH' for their hero and deity, Ras Tafari, Emperor Haile Selassie I; the title JAH is found once in the Psalms as an abbreviation for Yahweh (or Jahweh), the four-letter word (tetragrammaton) YHWH. Psalm 68:4 reads, 'Sing unto God, sing praises to His name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice in him.'" "To Leonard Howell, one of the Jamaican pioneers of Rastafari, the prophetic declaration in Psalm 68:31—'Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God'—was an indispensable paradigm for positing the messianic fulfillment of the Bible in the person of Haile Selassie I." ^ Tomei, Renato.
