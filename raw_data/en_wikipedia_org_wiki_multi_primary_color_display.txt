In addition to the standard RGB (red, green, and blue) color subpixels, the technology utilizes additional colors, such as yellow , magenta and cyan , and thus increases the range of displayable colors.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Sharp 's Quattron is the brand name of an LCD color display technology that utilizes a yellow fourth color subpixel.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is used in Sharp's Aquos LCD TV product line, particularly in models with screens 40 inches across and larger.
