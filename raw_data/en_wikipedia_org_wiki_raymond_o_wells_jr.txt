Wells, Jr.

) R. O. Wells Jr.

American mathematician Raymond O'Neil Wells Jr.

(born 1940), "Ronny", is an American mathematician, working in complex analysis in several variables [ 1 ] as well as wavelets .

Wells received his BA from Rice University in 1962 and his Ph.D. in 1965 from New York University under the supervision of Lipman Bers ( On the local holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in several complex variables ).

[ 2 ] He was Professor of Mathematics at Rice University, where he served as chairman of the Department of Mathematics. After becoming Professor Emeritus from Rice, he co-founded the Jacobs University Bremen . He was Professor of Mathematics and Vice-President of External Affairs.

He has written books on twistors , wavelets , and analysis on complex manifolds.

In 1970–71 and 1979–80, he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

From 1974 to 1975 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and received the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award . He was editor of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society . He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .
