880 –943, was a medieval scholar who served as the court physician of the Abbasid caliphs al-Muqtadir ( r.

908–934 ), al-Qahir ( r.

932–934 ), and al-Radi ( r.

934–940 ).

[ 1 ] As the son of Thabit ibn Qurra ( c. 830–901 ) and the father of Ibrahim ibn Sinan (908–946), Sinan belonged to an illustrious family of astronomers and mathematicians who hailed from the Upper-Mesopotamian city of Harran and who worked at the Abbasid court in Baghdad .

[ 2 ] He and his family belonged to a religious sect of star worshippers known as the Sabians of Harran , though Sinan was forced to convert to Islam during al-Qahir's brief reign (932–934), in which the Abbasid caliph persecuted the Sabians and eventually forced Sinan to flee to Khurasan for a short period.

[ 3 ] It appears that his children remained Sabian: [ 4 ] his sons Ibrahim ibn Sinan and Thabit ibn Sinan (died 976) both remained Sabian, while one his daughters married into another Sabian family, giving birth to Ibrahim ibn Hilal al-Sabi' (925–994), who also resisted multiple attempts to convert him from his ancestral faith.

[ 5 ] Although Sinan ibn Thabit was primarily known as a physician, [ 6 ] having built several hospitals in Baghdad and having overseen a licensing system for physicians, [ 7 ] he apparently did not write anything on medicine.

[ 8 ] His works, which dealt with political philosophy , mathematics, and astronomy, [ 9 ] are all lost except for a short treatise on moral philosophy called Siyāsat al-nufūs ("On Governing Souls").

[ 10 ] His work on political philosophy, which was inspired by Plato 's Republic , was criticized by the historian al-Mas'udi (died 956).

Thabit. Over eight hundred and sixty physicians passed the examination and each was given a license defining the practice he was to pursue." ^ De Blois 1995 .
