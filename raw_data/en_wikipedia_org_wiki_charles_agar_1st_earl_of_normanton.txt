He served as Dean of Kilmore , as Bishop of Cloyne , as Archbishop of Cashel , and finally as Archbishop of Dublin from 1801 until his death.

Early life [ edit ] Agar was the third son of Henry Agar of Gowran in County Kilkenny and his wife Anne Ellis, daughter of the Most Reverend Welbore Ellis , Bishop of Meath . His brothers included James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden , and Welbore Ellis Agar , a notable art collector.

[ 1 ] Welbore Ellis, 1st Baron Mendip , was his maternal uncle.

Agar was educated at Westminster School [ 2 ] and Christ Church, Oxford , where he matriculated on 31 May 1755, aged 18. He graduated BA in 1759, promoted by seniority to MA in 1762. On 31 December 1765, he was created a Doctor of Civil Law .

[ 3 ] Career [ edit ] Agar is known to have held particularly marked Calvinistic positions. He served as Dean of Kilmore from 1765 to 1768, [ 4 ] and then as Bishop of Cloyne until 1779.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 1776 he married Jane Benson, a daughter of William Benson, of Downpatrick , County Down .

[ 7 ] In 1779 he was appointed as Archbishop of Cashel and also joined the Irish Privy Council .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In 1784, while he was in office, the new St. John's Cathedral, Cashel , was completed, and two years later its important Samuel Green organ was built.

[ 10 ] In 1794 Agar was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Somerton .

[ 11 ] In 1801, he was translated to become Archbishop of Dublin [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and was created Viscount Somerton .

[ 11 ] In 1806 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Normanton .

[ 14 ] These titles were all in the Peerage of Ireland. He remained as archbishop of Dublin until his death in 1809, [ 12 ] and from the beginning of 1801 onwards sat in the House of Lords as one of the twenty-eight original Irish representative peer , following the Acts of Union 1800 which united Ireland and Great Britain .

[ 15 ] Archbishop Normanton died in July 1809, aged 72, and was succeeded in his secular titles by his son Welbore Ellis Agar . He is buried in the north transept of Westminster Abbey ; his widow Jane, Countess of Normanton, was buried alongside him following her death in 1826.

[ 2 ] His tomb dates from 1815 and was created by John Bacon .
