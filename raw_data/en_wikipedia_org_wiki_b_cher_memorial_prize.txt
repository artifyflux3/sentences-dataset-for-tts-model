It is awarded every three years (formerly every five years) for a notable research work in analysis that has appeared during the past six years. The work must be published in a recognized, peer-reviewed venue. The current award is $5,000.

[ 1 ] There have been forty-one prize recipients. The first woman to win the award, Laure Saint-Raymond , did so in 2020. About eighty percent of the journal articles recognized since 2000 have been from Annals of Mathematics , the Journal of the American Mathematical Society , Inventiones Mathematicae , and Acta Mathematica .
