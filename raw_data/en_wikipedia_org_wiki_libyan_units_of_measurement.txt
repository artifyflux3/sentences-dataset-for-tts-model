[ 1 ] System before the metric system [ edit ] A number of different units were used.

Tripoli and Cyrenaica [ edit ] Length [ edit ] Several units were used to measure length.  One pik was equal to 0.68 m as it was defined by metric equivalent.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Some other units are given below (Note: these units too were defined by metric equivalents): 1 handaze = 1 pik 1 palmo = 1 ⁄ 3 pik 1 draa = 0.46 m.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In Tripoli, draa was equal to 26.42 in and arbi draa (lesser pik) was equal to 19.029 in.

[ 4 ] Mass [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure mass.  One rottolo was equal to 0.512 8 kg as it was defined by metric equivalent.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Some other units are given below (Note: these units too were defined by metric equivalents): 1 oka = 2.5 rottolo = 1282 g 1 metical = 4.76 g 1 kharouba = 1 ⁄ 2560 oka 1 dram = 1 ⁄ 160 oka 1 termino = 1 ⁄ 128 oka 1 uckin = 1 ⁄ 16 oka 1 mattaro = 42 oka 1 cantar = 100 oka.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In Tripoli, metical (73.6 grains) wnuas to measure gold and silver.

[ 4 ] Area [ edit ] Several units were used to measure area.  One pik 2 was equal to 0.4624 m 2 as it was defined by it metric equivalent.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Some other units were given below: 1 denum = 1600 pik 2 1 jabia = 1800 pik 2 .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Capacity [ edit ] Two systems, dry and liquid were used to measure capacity.

Dry [ edit ] Several units were used to measure dry capacity.  One orba was equal to 7.5 L as it was defined by metric equivalent (According to some sources, one orba was equal to 7.692 L [ 3 ] ).

[ 2 ] Some other units were given below: 1 nufsorbah = 1 ⁄ 2 orba 1 marta = 2 orba [ 3 ] 1 kele = 2 orba [ 3 ] 1 temen = 4 orba 1 ueba = 16 orba.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Following units were also used to measure dry capacity by weight: 1 oka =1282 g (defined by metric equivalent) 1 marta = 11–14 (oka of water) 1 kele = 2 marta.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In Tripoli, 1 cafiso (20 tiberi) was equal to 1.152 bushels.

[ 4 ] Liquid [ edit ] Several units were used to measure liquid capacity.  One barile was equal to 64.8 L as it was defined by metric equivalent (According to sources, one barile was equal to 62.4975 L .

[ 3 ] ).

[ 2 ] One bozze was equal to 1/24 barile.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] One gorraf was equal to 1/5 barrile, and giarra was nearly equal to 50/71 barile.

[ 3 ] Following units were also used to measure liquid capacity by weight: 1 oka = 1282 g (defined by metric equivalent) 1 gorraf = 9.75 oka (of water) 1 giarra = 58.5 oka.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In Tripoli, Mataro, for oil, was equal to 9.163 gal.

[ 4 ] Marj (ancient Barca) and Fezzan [ edit ] Barca and Fezzan had the same units as units in Tripoli.
