It is the flagship campus of the University of Hawaiʻi system and houses the main offices of the system. Most of the campus occupies the eastern half of the mouth of Mānoa Valley on Oahu , with the John A. Burns School of Medicine located adjacent to Kakaʻako Waterfront Park .

UH offers over 200 degree programs across 17 colleges and schools. It is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission and governed by the Hawaii State Legislature and a semi-autonomous board of regents. It also a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities .

Mānoa is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 9 ] It is a land-grant university that also participates in the sea-grant , space-grant , and sun-grant research consortia; it is one of only three such universities in the country to participate in all four consortia ( Oregon State University and Pennsylvania State University are the others). UH and its subsidiary, the Applied Research Laboratory, is one of only fourteen University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) of the United States Department of Defense and is one of five UARCs in the country for the United States Navy .

Notable UH alumni include Patsy Mink , Robert Ballard , Richard Parsons , and the parents of Barack Obama – Barack Obama Sr.

and Stanley Ann Dunham . Forty-four percent of Hawaii's state senators and 51 percent of its state representatives are UH graduates.

[ 10 ] History [ edit ] Hawaiʻi Hall was the heart of the University of Hawaiʻi when it opened in 1912. It housed classrooms, administrative offices, and the campus's library.

Entrance to UH Mānoa campus Founding [ edit ] The University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa was founded in 1907 as a land-grant college of agriculture and mechanical arts establishing "the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of the Territory of Hawaiʻi and to Provide for the Government and Support Thereof".

[ 11 ] The bill Maui Senator William J. Huelani Coelho through the initiatives of Native Hawaiian legislators, a newspaper editor, petition of an Asian American bank cashier, and a president of Cornell University , [ 12 ] was introduced into the Territorial Legislature March 1, 1907 as Act 24, and signed into law March 25, 1907 by Governor George Carter , which officially established the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of the Territory of Hawaiʻi under a five-member Board of Regents [ 12 ] on the corner of Beretania and Victoria streets (now the location of the Honolulu Museum of Art School).

[ 11 ] The Board of Regents first selected J.E. Roadhouse of the University of California to head the new college in October 1907 but unfortunately had died before leaving Berkeley.

[ 12 ] With classes scheduled to start in February 1908, the regents persuaded Willis T. Pope, vice principal of the Territorial Normal School, to head the college for its first semester. In Spring 1908, the regents appointed John W. Gilmore, professor of agriculture at Cornell University , as the college's first president. The Cornell connection would strongly influence the shaping of the new college, even today.

[ 12 ] It officially became an institution of higher learning on September 14, 1908, when it enrolled 5 freshmen registered for a bachelor of science degree. Willis T. Pope went on to become the Superintendent of Public Instruction in the Territory of Hawai’i from 1910 until 1913 and later a professor of botany and horticulture at the university.

In September 1912 it moved to its present location in Mānoa Valley on 90 acres of land that had been cobbled together from leased and private lands and was renamed the College of Hawaii.

[ 11 ] William Kwai Fong Yap, a cashier at Bank of Hawaii , and a group of citizens petitioned the Hawaii Territorial Legislature six years later for university status which led to another renaming finally to the University of Hawaiʻi on April 30, 1919, with the addition of the College of Arts and Sciences and College of Applied Science.

[ 13 ] [ 12 ] In the years following, the university expanded to include more than 300 acres. In 1931 the Territorial Normal School was absorbed into the university, becoming Teacher's College, [ 13 ] now the College of Education.

20th century [ edit ] The university continued its growth throughout the 1930s and 1940s increasing from 232 to 402 acres.  The number of buildings grew from 4 to 17. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, classes were suspended for two months while the Corps of Engineers occupied much of the campus, including the Teacher's College, for various purposes. The university's ROTC program was put into active duty, which made the campus resemble a military school. When classes resumed on February 11, 1942, about half of the student and faculty body left to enter the war or military service. Students who returned to campus found classes cancelled due to lack of faculty and were required to carry gas masks to classes and bomb shelters were kept at a ready.

[ 13 ] Once the war was over, student enrollment grew faster than the university had faculty and space for.

In 1947, the university opened an extension center in Hilo on Hawaiʻi Island in the old Hilo Boarding School. In 1951, Hilo Center was designated the University of Hawaii Hilo Branch [ 13 ] before its reorganization by an act of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature in 1970.

[ 14 ] By the 1950s, enrollment increased to more than 5,000 students, and the university had expanded to include a Graduate Division, College of Education, College of Engineering, College of Business Administration, College of Tropical Agriculture, and College of Arts and Sciences.

[ 14 ] When Hawaiʻi was granted statehood in 1959, the university became a constitutional agency rather than a legislative agency with the Board of Regents having oversight over the university. Enrollment continued to grow to 19,000 at the university through the 1960s and the campus became nationally recognized in research and graduate education.

[ 14 ] In 1965, the state legislature created a system of community colleges and placed it within the university at the recommendations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare 's report on higher education in Hawaii and UH President Thomas H. Hamilton.

[ 12 ] By the end of the 1960s, the University of Hawaiʻi was very different from what it had since its beginning. It had become larger and with the addition of the community colleges, a broad range of activities extending from vocational education to community college education, which were all advanced through research and postdoctoral training.

[ 14 ] The university was renamed the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to distinguish it from other campuses in the University of Hawaiʻi System in 1972.

The board also appoints the president of the University of Hawaiʻi System, who provides leadership for all 10 campuses, including as the chief executive of UH Mānoa. Day-to-day academic and operational management of UH Mānoa is the responsibility of the Provost.

University of Hawaiʻi president (pre-1965) [ edit ] When UH began as the College of Hawaiʻi, Willis T. Pope served as acting dean from 1907 to 1908, despite declining the title of "acting president." Since that initial period, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa has always been led by a president, chancellor, or provost, including interim or acting roles.

From 1908 to 1965, the president of the University of Hawaiʻi, before the creation of the University of Hawaii System (UH System), served as chief executive of the university. Technical and community colleges and Hilo College operated separately from what would later become the UH System.

[ 54 ] Charles H. Atherton YMCA [ edit ] The University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and the YMCA of Honolulu has enjoyed a close and robust partnership since the university's founding.

[ 55 ] Beginning informally in 1908, the YMCA held bible classes and discussions at the University of Hawaiʻi, when it was the College of Hawaiʻi. In 1912, the YMCA of Honolulu followed the college to Mānoa valley and continued its work in Hawaiʻi Hall.  In 1922, the relationship was formalized and it was one of the largest and most active groups on the university's campus, including hosting events for high school and incoming students.

[ 56 ] [ 55 ] In 1932, through funding by the Atherton family, the YMCA moved across the street to a three-story cement building on University Avenue. The building, called the Charles H. Atherton House or the "Pink Building", in addition to being the center for YMCA activities, also served as student housing and dining hall. In 1995, the YMCA purchased the Mary Atherton House next door to provide additional residential and activity space.

In 2017, the Atherton building was sold to the university and University of Hawaiʻi Foundation.

[ 56 ] [ 55 ] Today, its main offices are located in the Queen Lili'uokalani Center for Student Services building on the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where they continue serve UH students and families throughout Hawaiʻi.

The Atherton building has since been closed and renovations began July 2021 to turn the Pink Building into student housing and an innovation center.
