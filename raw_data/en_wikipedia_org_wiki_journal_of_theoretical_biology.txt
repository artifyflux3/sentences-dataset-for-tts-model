645600912 Links Journal homepage Online access The Journal of Theoretical Biology is a biweekly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering theoretical biology , as well as mathematical , computational , and statistical aspects of biology . Some research areas covered by the journal include cell biology , evolutionary biology , population genetics , morphogenesis , and immunology .

The journal was established in 1961.

[ 1 ] Its founding editor-in-chief was English biologist James F. Danielli , who remained editor until his death in 1984.

[ 2 ] The journal is published by Elsevier and, as of 2021 [update] , the editors-in-chief are Denise Kirschner ( University of Michigan Medical School ), Mark Chaplain ( University of St. Andrews ), and Akira Sasaki (The university for advanced studies, SOKENDAI, Hayama).

Lewis Wolpert served as editor-in-chief for more than 55 years.

[ 3 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports the journal has a 2020 impact factor of 2.691.
