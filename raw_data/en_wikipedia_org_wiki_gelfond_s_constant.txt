Its decimal expansion is given by: e π = 23.140 692 632 779 269 005 72 ... (sequence A039661 in the OEIS ) Like both e and π , this constant is both irrational and transcendental . This follows from the Gelfond–Schneider theorem , which establishes a b to be transcendental, given that a is algebraic and not equal to zero or one and b is algebraic but not rational . We have e π π = ( e i π π ) − − i = ( − − 1 ) − − i , {\displaystyle e^{\pi }=(e^{i\pi })^{-i}=(-1)^{-i},} where i is the imaginary unit . Since − i is algebraic but not rational, e π is transcendental. The numbers π and e π are also known to be algebraically independent over the rational numbers , as demonstrated by Yuri Nesterenko .

[ 3 ] It is not known whether e π is a Liouville number.

[ 4 ] The constant was mentioned in Hilbert's seventh problem alongside the Gelfond–Schneider constant 2 √ 2 and the name "Gelfond's constant" stems from Soviet mathematician Alexander Gelfond .

[ 5 ] Occurrences [ edit ] The constant e π appears in relation to the volumes of hyperspheres : Graphs of volumes ( ⁠ V n {\displaystyle V_{n}} ⁠ ) and surface areas ( ⁠ S n − − 1 {\displaystyle S_{n-1}} ⁠ ) of n -balls of radius 1 .

The volume of an n-sphere with radius R is given by: V n ( R ) = π π n 2 R n Γ Γ ( n 2 + 1 ) , {\displaystyle V_{n}(R)={\frac {\pi ^{\frac {n}{2}}R^{n}}{\Gamma \left({\frac {n}{2}}+1\right)}},} where Γ is the gamma function . Considering only unit spheres ( R = 1 ) yields: V n ( 1 ) = π π n 2 Γ Γ ( n 2 + 1 ) , {\displaystyle V_{n}(1)={\frac {\pi ^{\frac {n}{2}}}{\Gamma \left({\frac {n}{2}}+1\right)}},} Any even-dimensional 2 n-sphere now gives: V 2 n ( 1 ) = π π n Γ Γ ( n + 1 ) = π π n n !

{\displaystyle V_{2n}(1)={\frac {\pi ^{n}}{\Gamma (n+1)}}={\frac {\pi ^{n}}{n!}}} summing up all even-dimensional unit sphere volumes and utilizing the series expansion of the exponential function gives: [ 6 ] ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ V 2 n ( 1 ) = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ π π n n !

= exp ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ) = e π π .

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }V_{2n}(1)=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {\pi ^{n}}{n!}}=\exp(\pi )=e^{\pi }.} We also have: If one defines k 0 = ⁠ 1 / √ 2 ⁠ and k n + 1 = 1 − − 1 − − k n 2 1 + 1 − − k n 2 {\displaystyle k_{n+1}={\frac {1-{\sqrt {1-k_{n}^{2}}}}{1+{\sqrt {1-k_{n}^{2}}}}}} for n > 0 , then the sequence ( 4 / k n + 1 ) 2 − − n {\displaystyle (4/k_{n+1})^{2^{-n}}} converges rapidly to e π .

[ 7 ] Similar or related constants [ edit ] Ramanujan's constant [ edit ] The number e π √ 163 is known as Ramanujan's constant . Its decimal expansion is given by: e π √ 163 = 262 537 412 640 768 743 .999 999 999 999 250 072 59 ... (sequence A060295 in the OEIS ) which turns out to be very close to the integer 640320 3 + 744 : This is an application of Heegner numbers , where 163 is the Heegner number in question. This number was discovered in 1859 by the mathematician Charles Hermite .

[ 8 ] In a 1975 April Fool article in Scientific American magazine, [ 9 ] "Mathematical Games" columnist Martin Gardner made the hoax claim that the number was in fact an integer, and that the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan had predicted it—hence its name. Ramanujan's constant is also a transcendental number.

The coincidental closeness, to within one trillionth of the number 640320 3 + 744 is explained by complex multiplication and the q -expansion of the j-invariant , specifically: j ( ( 1 + − − 163 ) / 2 ) = ( − − 640 320 ) 3 {\displaystyle j((1+{\sqrt {-163}})/2)=(-640\,320)^{3}} and, ( − − 640 320 ) 3 = − − e π π 163 + 744 + O ( e − − π π 163 ) {\displaystyle (-640\,320)^{3}=-e^{\pi {\sqrt {163}}}+744+O\left(e^{-\pi {\sqrt {163}}}\right)} where O ( e - π √ 163 ) is the error term, O ( e − − π π 163 ) = − − 196 884 / e π π 163 ≈ ≈ − − 196 884 / ( 640 320 3 + 744 ) ≈ ≈ − − 0.000 000 000 000 75 {\displaystyle {\displaystyle O\left(e^{-\pi {\sqrt {163}}}\right)=-196\,884/e^{\pi {\sqrt {163}}}\approx -196\,884/(640\,320^{3}+744)\approx -0.000\,000\,000\,000\,75}} which explains why e π √ 163 is 0.000 000 000 000 75 below 640320 3 + 744 .

(For more detail on this proof, consult the article on Heegner numbers .) The number e π − π [ edit ] The number e π − π is also very close to an integer, its decimal expansion being given by: e π − π = 19.999 099 979 189 475 767 26 ... (sequence A018938 in the OEIS ) The explanation for this seemingly remarkable coincidence was given by A. Doman in September 2023, and is a result of a sum related to Jacobi theta functions as follows: ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ ( 8 π π k 2 − − 2 ) e − − π π k 2 = 1.

{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }\left(8\pi k^{2}-2\right)e^{-\pi k^{2}}=1.} The first term dominates since the sum of the terms for k ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle k\geq 2} total ∼ ∼ 0.0003436.

{\displaystyle \sim 0.0003436.} The sum can therefore be truncated to ( 8 π π − − 2 ) e − − π π ≈ ≈ 1 , {\displaystyle \left(8\pi -2\right)e^{-\pi }\approx 1,} where solving for e π π {\displaystyle e^{\pi }} gives e π π ≈ ≈ 8 π π − − 2.

{\displaystyle e^{\pi }\approx 8\pi -2.} Rewriting the approximation for e π π {\displaystyle e^{\pi }} and using the approximation for 7 π π ≈ ≈ 22 {\displaystyle 7\pi \approx 22} gives e π π ≈ ≈ π π + 7 π π − − 2 ≈ ≈ π π + 22 − − 2 = π π + 20.

{\displaystyle e^{\pi }\approx \pi +7\pi -2\approx \pi +22-2=\pi +20.} Thus, rearranging terms gives e π π − − π π ≈ ≈ 20.

{\displaystyle e^{\pi }-\pi \approx 20.} Ironically, the crude approximation for 7 π π {\displaystyle 7\pi } yields an additional order of magnitude of precision.

[ 10 ] The number π e [ edit ] The decimal expansion of π e is given by: π π e = {\displaystyle \pi ^{e}=} 22.459 157 718 361 045 473 42 ... (sequence A059850 in the OEIS ) It is not known whether or not this number is transcendental. Note that, by Gelfond–Schneider theorem , we can only infer definitively whether or not a b is transcendental if a and b are algebraic ( a and b are both considered complex numbers ).

In the case of e π , we are only able to prove this number transcendental due to properties of complex exponential forms and the above equivalency given to transform it into (−1) − i , allowing the application of Gelfond–Schneider theorem.

π e has no such equivalence, and hence, as both π and e are transcendental, we can not use the Gelfond–Schneider theorem to draw conclusions about the transcendence of π e . However the currently unproven Schanuel's conjecture would imply its transcendence.

[ 11 ] The number i i [ edit ] Using the principal value of the complex logarithm i i = ( e i π π / 2 ) i = e − − π π / 2 = ( e π π ) − − 1 / 2 {\displaystyle i^{i}=(e^{i\pi /2})^{i}=e^{-\pi /2}=(e^{\pi })^{-1/2}} The decimal expansion of is given by: i i = {\displaystyle i^{i}=} 0.207 879 576 350 761 908 54 ... (sequence A049006 in the OEIS ) Its transcendence follows directly from the transcendence of e π and directly from Gelfond–Schneider theorem.
