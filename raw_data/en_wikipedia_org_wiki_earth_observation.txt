**Earth observation** (**EO**) is the gathering of information about the physical, chemical, and [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") systems of the planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-eObs-1) It can be performed via [remote-sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing") technologies ([Earth observation satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite")) or through direct-contact sensors in ground-based or airborne platforms (such as [weather stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_stations "Weather stations") and [weather balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloons "Weather balloons"), for example).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-apEobs-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-neObsG-3)

According to the [Group on Earth Observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_on_Earth_Observations "Group on Earth Observations") (GEO), the concept encompasses both "[space-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based "Space-based") or remotely-sensed data, as well as ground-based or [in situ data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ#Earth_and_atmospheric_sciences "In situ")".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-GEO_at_a_Glance-4) Earth observation is used to monitor and assess the status of and changes in [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment") and [built environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment "Built environment").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-eObs-1)

In Europe, _Earth observation_ has often been used to refer to satellite-based remote sensing,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-eObs-1) but the term is also used to refer to any form of observations of the Earth system, including in situ and airborne observations, for example. The GEO, which has over 100 member countries and over 100 participating organizations, uses EO in this broader sense.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-GEO_at_a_Glance-4)

In the US, the term _remote sensing_ has been used since the 1960s[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-Pennisi-5) to refer to satellite-based remote sensing. Remote sensing has also been used more broadly for observations utilizing any form of remote sensing technology, including airborne sensors and even ground-based sensors such as cameras.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-Pennisi-5) Perhaps the least ambiguous term to use for satellite-based sensors is _satellite remote sensing_ (SRS), an acronym which is gradually starting to appear in the literature.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-Pennisi-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-eklundh-6)

Earth observations may include:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-neObsG-3)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-Pennisi-5)

*   numerical measurements taken by a [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"), [wind gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer "Anemometer"), ocean [buoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoy "Buoy"), [altimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter "Altimeter") or [seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer "Seismometer")
*   photos and radar or sonar images taken from ground or ocean-based instruments
*   photos and radar images taken from remote-sensing satellites[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-waterSurvey-7)
*   decision-support tools based on processed information, such as maps and models

Just as Earth observations consist of a wide variety of possible elements, they can be applied to a wide variety of uses. Some of the specific applications of Earth observations are:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-eklundh-6)

*   [forecasting weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting")
*   tracking [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") and [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") trends
*   measuring [land-use change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-use_change "Land-use change") (such as [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation"))
*   monitoring and responding to [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster "Natural disaster"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-:1-8) including fires, [floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood "Flood"), [earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake"), landslides, land subsidence and [tsunamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami "Tsunami")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-:1-8)
*   managing [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource "Natural resource"), such as [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater") and [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture")
*   addressing emerging diseases and other health risks
*   predicting, adapting to and mitigating [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change")

The quality and quantity of Earth observations continue to mount rapidly. In addition to the ongoing launch of new remote-sensing satellites, increasingly sophisticated in situ instruments located on the ground, on balloons and airplanes, and in rivers, lakes and oceans, are generating increasingly comprehensive, nearly real-time observations.

In 2017 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-:1-8) Earth observation have become increasingly technologically sophisticated. It has also become more important due to the [dramatic impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment") that modern human [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") is having on the [world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World "World") and the need to minimize negative effects (e.g. [geohazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohazard "Geohazard")),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation#cite_note-:1-8) along with the opportunities such observation provides to improve social and economic well-being.
