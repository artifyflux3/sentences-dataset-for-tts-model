The Toyama Plain is good farmland and historically it was a point of strategic and traffic importance since prehistoric times.

Feudal period [ edit ] During the Sengoku period , it was frequently a battlefield, coming under the control of warlord Sassa Narimasa , who built a castle town around Toyama Castle and channeled rivers to bringing about a flourishing agricultural industry.

Early modern ages [ edit ] Edo period The area subsequently became part of Kaga Domain under the Maeda clan during the Edo period , during which time a positive industrial promotion policy was implemented on the production of Chinese medicine and washi (Japanese paper).
Also, thanks to the improvement of kitamaebune sea transportation routes, these industries thrived and Toyama became known nationwide as the province of medicine.

Meiji period [ edit ] After the Meiji Restoration , with the creation of the municipalities system, the city of Toyama was established on April 1, 1889, as one of the first 30 cities in Japan. Economically, the area developed heavy and chemical industries based on abundant hydroelectric electricity. 
Toyama has become one of the most influential cities on the Sea of Japan with its good water supply, drainage system and thriving agricultural, forestry, fishery, commercial and manufacturing industries.

World War II [ edit ] During World War II , Allied prisoners of war (POWs) were sent to Toyama as forced labor.

[ 6 ] The city was almost completely destroyed on the night of August 1–2, 1945.  At the time of the bombing, the city was a center for aluminum, ball-bearing and special steel production. Left unscathed however, were the war-related factories just outside the city.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The city during the time had a population of around 150,000 residents.  The city also held Kakure Kirishitan , or "Hidden Christians" in Japan, forced from Nagasaki into internment camps after the Tokugawa government tried to punish them for their Christian beliefs.
