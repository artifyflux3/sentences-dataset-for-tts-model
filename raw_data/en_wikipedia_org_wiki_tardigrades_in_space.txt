The tardigrade _[Milnesium tardigradum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnesium\_tardigradum "Milnesium tardigradum")_ demonstrated its ability to survive the vacuum and ultraviolet radiation of space in the TARDIS experiment on the 2007 [FOTON-M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton-M "Foton-M") mission.

The use of **tardigrades in space**, first proposed in 1964 because of [their extreme tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_tolerance_in_tardigrades "Environmental tolerance in tardigrades") to radiation, began in 2007 with the [FOTON-M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton-M "Foton-M") mission in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"), where they were exposed to space's vacuum for 10 days, and reanimated, just by rehydration, back on Earth. In 2011, [tardigrades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade "Tardigrade") were on board the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") on [STS-134](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134 "STS-134"). In 2019, a capsule containing tardigrades was on board the Israeli [lunar lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander "Lunar lander")_[Beresheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet "Beresheet")_ which crashed on the Moon.

When dried, terrestrial tardigrades draw in their legs and go into a [cryptobiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptobiosis "Cryptobiosis") 'tun' state. They quickly revive when re-wetted.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Brusca_2016-1)

Tardigrades are small [arthropods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod") able to tolerate extreme environments. Many live in tufts of moss, such as on rooftops, where they get repeatedly dried out and rewetted. Others live in the Arctic or atop mountains, where they are exposed to cold. When dried, they go into a [cryptobiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptobiosis "Cryptobiosis") 'tun' state in which metabolism is suspended.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Brusca_2016-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2) They have been described as the [toughest animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile "Extremophile") on Earth.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2) Their DNA is protected from damage, such as by radiation, by [Dsup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dsup "Dsup") proteins.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-3)

In 1964, R.M. May and colleagues proposed that the tardigrade _Macrobiotus areolatus_ would be a suitable [model organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism "Model organism") for space experiments because of its exceptional radiation tolerance.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-4)

In 2001, R. Bertolani and colleagues proposed tardigrades as a model for a study of animal survival in space.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-5) As terrestrial experiments on tardigrades proceeded, knowledge of [their survival abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_tolerance_in_tardigrades "Environmental tolerance in tardigrades") grew, enabling K.I. Jönsson in 2007,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-J%C3%B6nsson_2007-6) and then other researchers such as Daiki Horikawa in 2008[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Horikawa_2008-7) and Roberto Guidetti in 2012,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Guidetti_Rizzo_2012-8) to present evidence that they would resist desiccation, radiation, heat, and cold, suiting them for [astrobiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology") studies.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)

In 2008, F. Ono and colleagues suggested that tardigrades might be able to survive a journey through space on a meteorite, enabling [panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia "Panspermia"), the transfer of life from one planet to another.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Ono_Saigusa_2008-9)

### BIOPAN on FOTON-M3, 2007

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tardigrades_in_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: BIOPAN on FOTON-M3, 2007")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Biopan_Space_Expo_001.jpg/250px-Biopan_Space_Expo_001.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Biopan_Space_Expo_001.jpg)

The 2007 [FOTON-M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton-M "Foton-M") mission carrying the [BIOPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN "BIOPAN") astrobiology [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload "Payload") (illustrated) exposed tardigrades to vacuum, solar ultraviolet, or both, showing their ability to survive in the space environment.

Tardigrades have survived exposure to space. In 2007, dehydrated tardigrades were taken into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") on the [FOTON-M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton-M "Foton-M") mission carrying the [BIOPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN "BIOPAN") astrobiology [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload "Payload"). For 10 days, in the "Tardigrade Resistance to Space Effects" (TARSE) experiment, groups of _[Paramacrobiotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobiotidae "Macrobiotidae") richtersi_ tardigrades, some of them previously dehydrated, some of them not, were exposed to the [hard vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_vacuum "Hard vacuum") of space, or vacuum and solar [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") radiation.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-low-earth-orbit-10) Back on Earth, more than 68% of the subjects protected from solar ultraviolet radiation were reanimated within 30 minutes following rehydration; although subsequent mortality was high, many produced viable embryos.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-low-earth-orbit-10)

In contrast, in the "Tardigrades in Space" (TARDIS) experiment, hydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar ultraviolet radiation had significantly reduced survival, with only three subjects of _[Milnesium tardigradum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnesium\_tardigradum "Milnesium tardigradum")_ surviving.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-low-earth-orbit-10) The space vacuum did not much affect egg-laying in either _Richtersius coronifer_ or _M. tardigradum_, whereas UV radiation did reduce egg-laying in _M. tardigradum_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-low-earth-orbit-10)

The third FOTON-M3 experiment, "Rotifers, Tardigrades and Radiation" (RoTaRad) focused mainly on radiation survival.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)

### LIFE prototype on STS-134, 2011

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tardigrades_in_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: LIFE prototype on STS-134, 2011")]

In 2011, Angela Maria Rizzo and colleagues sent tardigrades on board the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") Endeavour along with extremophiles on [STS-134](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134 "STS-134"), in the "Tardigrades in Space" (TARDIKISS) experiment.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weronika_%C5%81ukasz_2017-2)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-11) They concluded that [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgravity "Microgravity") and [cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_radiation "Cosmic radiation") "did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight" and that tardigrades were useful in space research,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-13) with implications for [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology"), where they should be suitable [model organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism "Model organism").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Gabriel_McNuff_2007-14)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Guidetti_Rizzo_2012-8)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Rizzo_Altiero_Corsetto_2015-15)

Model of the _[Beresheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet "Beresheet")_ Moon lander which crashed, probably destroying its tardigrade payload[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-O'Callaghan_2021-16)

The mission was a prototype for the "[Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Interplanetary_Flight_Experiment "Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment")" (LIFE)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-17) which was to have travelled to the Martian moon [Phobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon) "Phobos (moon)") on the Russian [Fobos-Grunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fobos-Grunt "Fobos-Grunt") spacecraft.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Space.com-11-11-11-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-19) The spacecraft however failed to leave Earth orbit and was destroyed.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Novosti-2011-12-13-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-UT-11-12-13-21)

### Lunar lander _Beresheet_, 2019

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tardigrades_in_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Lunar lander Beresheet, 2019")]

In 2019, a capsule containing tardigrades in a [cryptobiotic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptobiotic_state "Cryptobiotic state") was on board the Israeli [lunar lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander "Lunar lander")_[Beresheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet "Beresheet")_ which crashed on the Moon. They were described as unlikely to have survived the impact because the shock pressure of the crash would have been well above the 1.14 GPa that they have been measured as surviving.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-O'Callaghan_2021-16)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-22) Despite tardigrades' ability to survive in space, they would still need food, lacking on the moon, to be able to grow and reproduce.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-23) The possibility that tardigrades survived the crash attracted concern about [contamination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_contamination#Forward_contamination "Interplanetary contamination") of the Moon with biological material.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Davidson_Institute_2020-24) However, even supposing they had survived the crash, they are unlikely to become rehydrated because of the lack of liquid [water on the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_water "Lunar water").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-Weisberger_2023-25)

Spilling tardigrades across the Moon is legal.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-27) The [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") only explicitly bans weapons and experiments or tools that could interfere with other missions.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-:2-28) Large space agencies typically follow guidelines for sterilizing mission equipment, but there is no single entity to enforce these rules globally.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades_in_space#cite_note-:5-29)
