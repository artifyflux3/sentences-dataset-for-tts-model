In mathematical logic , an abstract logic is a formal system consisting of a class of sentences and a satisfaction relation with specific properties related to occurrence, expansion, isomorphism, renaming and quantification.

[ 1 ] Based on Lindström 's characterization, first-order logic is, up to equivalence, the only abstract logic that is countably compact and has Löwenheim number ω.

[ 2 ] See also [ edit ] Abstract algebraic logic – Study of the algebraization of deductive systems, based on the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra Abstract model theory Löwenheim number – Smallest cardinal number for which a weak downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem holds Lindström's theorem – Theorem in mathematical logic Universal logic – Subfield of logic that studies the features common to all logical systems References [ edit ] ^ C.
