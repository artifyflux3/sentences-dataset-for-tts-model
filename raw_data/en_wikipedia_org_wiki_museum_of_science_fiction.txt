Museum of Science Fiction Established April 2013 ( 2013-04 ) Location Washington, D.C.

Type Science Fiction Museum Director Greg Viggiano, PhD Curator Rachel Frederick Website www .museumofsciencefiction .org The Museum of Science Fiction (MOSF) is a 501c(3) nonprofit museum that originally had plans to be based in Washington, D.C.

It was founded in the spring of 2013 by Greg Viggiano and a team of 22 volunteer professionals with a goal of becoming the world's first comprehensive science fiction museum.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As of 2023, the Museum does not yet have a permanent building or location and is currently developing a virtual reality-based photo-realistic, digital twin of several proposed museum galleries and exhibitions.

[ 4 ] The Museum is also a frequent collaborator with other organizations, such as the London Science Museum for their 2022 exhibition on science fiction.

[ 5 ] Museum of Science Fiction Press Publisher Greg Viggiano, PhD Associate Publisher Mandy Sweeney Founded 2023 Establishment [ edit ] The Museum of Science Fiction was planning to open a preview museum in late 2015 as a step toward opening the full museum in 2018. The preview museum was envisioned to be a 4,000 square foot multi-purpose location, open for 48 months near a DC Metro station before redeployment as a satellite location that traveled to other global cities to promote the Museum and its mission. This first physical iteration of the preview museum was to feature four gallery change-outs to encourage higher revisit-rates and provide a way for curators to capture early visitor feedback. The interior was expected to also function as a venue for special events including dinners, presentations, film screenings, and lectures with seating for up to 150 attendees.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Despite an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign not reaching its goal, [ 14 ] in July 2014 the Museum hosted an architecture design contest [ 15 ] for the Museum's first home, with locations in D.C. and northern Virginia under consideration.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] In August 2014, the Museum hosted an exhibit design competition seeking exhibits that would have been used in the four-year life of the preview museum.

The permanent galleries include: The Creators; Other Worlds; Vehicles ; Time Travel ; Lifeforms; Computers and Robots ; and Technology .

[ 20 ] Science fiction is to be presented as a form of rational speculation that has influenced and been influenced by scientific and technological progress for centuries.

[ 21 ] In March 2022, it was announced that work had begun on a VR museum that would provide a photo-realistic virtual reality experience until a physical space is constructed.

[ 22 ] The first group of galleries are on schedule to open in the fall of 2023.

In September 2022, the Museum received a community education grant from BAE Systems for the design of a quantum computer virtual reality tour to be part of the Computer and Robots Gallery in its VR Museum.

Publishing [ edit ] Cover art for the book 'Landscapes of Dying Worlds' by Michal Klimczak.

Landscapes of Dying Worlds: The Art of Michal Klimczak [ edit ] In October 2024, the Museum launched a Kickstarter campaign for an art book entitled "Landscapes of Dying Worlds."

Future of Travel Exhibit [ edit ] In July 2015, the Museum opened its first public exhibition in the form of the “Future of Travel” gallery.

[ 40 ] This four-month exhibition in the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport featured a large-scale model of the Orion III spaceplane from 2001: A Space Odyssey , retro-futuristic travel posters designed by artist Steve Thomas, and a digital companion guide via the Museum mobile app.

Mobile App [ edit ] In June 2015, the Museum released a free mobile app for iPhones that featured a science fiction trivia game and guide to the Future of Travel exhibit that it would open the following month.

[ 41 ] Film Screenings [ edit ] In 2014, the Museum of Science Fiction partnered with the District of Columbia Public Library system to host a monthly science fiction movie screening.

[ 42 ] Partnerships [ edit ] Beginning in 2014, the Museum started a partnership with the John Eaton Elementary School (Washington, DC) to bring a range of STEAM programs to local school children using science fiction as an educational tool. The Museum worked with educators to develop enrichment experiences and classroom workshops for students. Planned activities include the art of storytelling, writing, illustration techniques, and numerous project-based learning science activities.

[ 43 ] Additional notable partnerships which have been reported in the Washington Post include the Science Channel and Awesome Con .

[ 44 ] In January 2018, the Museum of Science Fiction began a quarterly lecture series in Washington, DC that focused on present day and near future developments in the fields of commercial space travel, artificial intelligence, robotics, and other technology. The first lecture, "AI and Cognitive Computing," took place on February 22 at the offices of K&L Gates , a co-sponsor of the series.

In February 2016, the Museum of Science Fiction co-sponsored a workshop in Los Angeles on the future of human space exploration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Science & Entertainment Exchange . “Homesteading in Space — Inspiring the Nation through Science Fiction” brought together stakeholders from academia, government, the commercial space industry, and the entertainment industry to focus on developing a positive, inventive view of future space exploration.

In May 2015, the Museum entered into a Space Act Agreement with NASA which helped to support the launch of the first Escape Velocity convention the following year. In addition to the Space Act Agreement, in 2016 the Museum of Science Fiction joined the NASA Heliophysics Education Consortium at the Goddard Space Flight Center and received a $200,000 5-year grant through a NASA Cooperative Agreement. During this time, NASA and the Museum prototyped a VR environment of a 4,000 square-foot museum space that allowed visitors to interact with exhibits and operate a heliophysics science station that offers an unprecedented view of the sun. The solar data provided by NASA satellites ensured that visitors experienced the most realistic and scientifically accurate presentation of the heliosphere and solar weather.  "We are always looking for disruptive innovations on better storytelling," said Bryan Stephenson, a VR developer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center working on the project. "New virtual reality technologies, like the Oculus Rift, will bring about a revolution in education and entertainment that will completely change how we experience digital realms. We are delighted to begin exploring how we may deliver this new content with the Museum of Science Fiction." The VR Museum was later incorporated into NASA's STEM Innovation Lab.

In spring of 2015, the Museum partnered with the costume production MFA program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to create screen-accurate costume replicas for display of iconic costumes from science fiction films.

[ 45 ] These costumes are displayed at the Escape Velocity convention and are part of the museum's permanent collection. The graduate students create the replicas under the supervision of the program faculty and with the assistance of undergraduate costume lab students. Examples of costumes created are the spaceflight attendant from 2001: A Space Odyssey , Neo's costume in the first Matrix film, the Stillsuit from the original Dune film, a Borg unit from Star Trek , and the Frankenstein creature from classic horror iconography.

The Museum of Science Fiction has also hosted a monthly science fiction movie screening in conjunction with the District of Columbia Public Library System.
