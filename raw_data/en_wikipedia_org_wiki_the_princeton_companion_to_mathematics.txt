Edited by Timothy Gowers with associate editors June Barrow-Green and Imre Leader , it has been noted for the high caliber of its contributors. The book was the 2011 winner of the Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America , given annually to "an outstanding book about mathematics".

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Topics and organization [ edit ] The book concentrates primarily on modern pure mathematics rather than applied mathematics , although it does also cover both applications of mathematics and the mathematics that relates to those applications;
it provides a broad overview of the significant ideas and developments in research mathematics.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] It is organized into eight parts: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 10 ] An introduction to mathematics, outlining the major areas of study, key definitions, and the goals and purposes of mathematical research.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] An overview of the history of mathematics, in seven chapters including the development of important concepts such as number, geometry, mathematical proof, and the axiomatic approach to the foundations of mathematics.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] A chronology of significant events in mathematical history is also provided later in the book.

[ 5 ] Three core sections, totalling approximately 600 pages. The first of these sections provides an alphabetized set of articles on 99 specific mathematical concepts such as the axiom of choice , expander graphs , and Hilbert space . The second core section includes long surveys of 26 branches of research mathematics such as algebraic geometry and combinatorial group theory . The third describes 38 important mathematical problems and theorems such as the four color theorem , the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture , and the Halting problem .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 9 ] A collection of biographies of nearly 100 famous deceased mathematicians, arranged chronologically, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 9 ] also including a history of Nicolas Bourbaki 's pseudonymous collaboration.

[ 6 ] [ 9 ] Essays describing the influences and applications of mathematics in the sciences, technology, business, medicine, and the fine arts.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] A section of perspectives on the future of mathematics, problem solving techniques, the ubiquity of mathematics, and advice to young mathematicians.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Despite its length, the range of topics included is selective rather than comprehensive: some important established topics such as diophantine approximation are omitted, transcendental number theory , differential geometry , and cohomology get short shrift, and the most recent frontiers of research are also generally not included.

[ 6 ] Target audience [ edit ] The book's authors have attempted to keep their work accessible by forgoing abstraction and technical nomenclature as much as possible and by making heavy use of concrete examples and illustrations.

[ 2 ] Compared to the concise and factual coverage of mathematics in sources such as Wikipedia and MathWorld , the articles in the Princeton Companion are intended to be more reflective and discursive, [ 5 ] and to convey the beauty and depth of modern mathematics.

[ 8 ] Quoting a passage from Bertrand Russell that "Pure Mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form p implies q ", the editor of the Companion states that it "is about everything that Russell’s definition leaves out." [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The core sections of the Companion are aimed primarily at readers who are already familiar with mathematics at the undergraduate level.

[ 2 ] [ 5 ] Much of the rest of the book, such as its collection of biographies, would be accessible to a mathematically inclined high school student, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 6 ] and there is enough depth of coverage in the book to interest even professional research mathematicians.

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] Reviewer Jonathan Borwein summarizes the audience for this book broadly: [ 7 ] [ 11 ] Every research mathematician, every  university student of mathematics, and every serious amateur of mathematical science should own at least one copy of the Companion .

Contributors [ edit ] The contributors to The Princeton Companion to Mathematics consist of 133 of the world's best mathematicians.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 9 ] Timothy Gowers, its editor, is the recipient of the Fields Medal , considered to be the top honor in mathematics.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] Other contributors include Fields medalists Michael Atiyah , Alain Connes , Charles Fefferman , and Terence Tao , and well-known mathematicians Noga Alon , George Andrews , Béla Bollobás , John P. Burgess , Kevin Buzzard , Clifford Cocks , Ingrid Daubechies , Persi Diaconis , Jordan Ellenberg , Oded Goldreich , Andrew Granville , Jeremy Gray , Frank Kelly , Sergiu Klainerman , Jon Kleinberg , János Kollár , Peter Lax , Dusa McDuff , Barry Mazur , Carl Pomerance , Eleanor Robson , Peter Sarnak , Madhu Sudan , Clifford Taubes , and Avi Wigderson . Among the historians who contributed to it are Charles C. Gillispie , Ivor Grattan-Guinness , Jeremy Gray , Niccolò Guicciardini , Ulf Hashagen , Eberhard Knobloch , Karen Hunger Parshall , Eleanor Robson , and Erhard Scholz .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Awards [ edit ] Gowers and the Princeton Companion were the 2011 winners of the Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America , given annually to "an outstanding book about mathematics".

[ 1 ] The Princeton Companion was also listed as an outstanding title by Choice Magazine , a publication of the American Library Association , in 2009.
