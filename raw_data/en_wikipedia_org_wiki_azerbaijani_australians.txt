The total number of the Azerbaijani diaspora varies by sources, however, at least 5–10 million Azeris live outside of Iran and Azerbaijan.

According to Ethnologue , there were over 1 million Azerbaijani-speakers of the north dialect in southern Dagestan , Armenia , Estonia , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as of 1993.

[ 33 ] Other sources, such as national censuses, confirm the presence of Azerbaijanis throughout the former Soviet Union . The Ethnologue figures are outdated in the case of Armenia, where the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has affected the population of Azerbaijanis.

[ 34 ] Ethnologue further reports that an additional 1 million Iranian Azerbaijanis live outside Iran, but these figures most likely are a reference to the Iraqi Turkmen , a distinct though related Turkic people.

[ 35 ] The number of Azerbaijanis around the world is estimated about 30-35 million people, only 10,180,770 [ 36 ] of which are in Azerbaijan and another 13-30 million in Iran.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Azerbaijanis in North America [ edit ] The Azerbaijani diaspora in the United States and Canada was established in the mid-to-late 20th century. The Azerbaijanis have settled in the North, Central and Southern parts of the U.S. and in all major Canadian cities. The majority of Azerbaijanis have settled in the states of California , New Jersey , New York, Michigan , Pennsylvania , Texas and District of Columbia. Most Azerbaijanis living in the U.S. are migrants from Iran .

There are several organizations connecting Azerbaijani Americans [ 44 ] as well as Azerbaijani Canadians .

[ 45 ] Azerbaijan America Alliance [ edit ] Azerbaijan America Alliance is a non-governmental organization.

[ 58 ] Its mission emphasizes fostering a strong Azerbaijani identity through educational programs, cultural events, language classes, and community initiatives, aimed at creating an inclusive environment for Azerbaijanis to connect and share their traditions.

Azerbaijanis in Asia [ edit ] Azerbaijanis in Iran.

Iranian Azerbaijan , also known as South Azerbaijan, is considered to be the primary home of Azerbaijanis "Young noble Tatar," Shusha , 1865 Apart from Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan itself, Azerbaijanis in Asia primarily live in Central Asia , in countries such as Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan .

Up until 1917, a sizable minority of Azerbaijanis also lived within Armenia. The Russian census of 1897 recorded 300,000 Azeris (Tatars) living within the Erivan Governorate (corresponding to Iğdır Province of Turkey , Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan and central modern-day Armenia , but excluding southern and northern Armenia).

[ 59 ] During the Armenian–Azerbaijani War (1918–1920) , 135,000 Azeris were displaced from the Erevan district .

[ 60 ] In the corresponding timeframe, Azerbaijani inhabitants of the region would be subjected to ethnic cleansing from the Armenian side , resulting in massacres and deportations of the population.

[ 61 ] In addition, Stalin's population transfer policies resulted in the deportation of 100,000 Azeris from the Armenian SSR between 1930 and 1952.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Many Azerbaijanis are assumed to be involved in the Basmachi movement , a Turkic uprising which was led by Enver Pasha against the Russian Republic and later Bolsheviks , inspired by Islamic beliefs .

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] The presence of Azerbaijanis in Turkmenistan is believed to date back to early twentieth century, while Azerbaijani migration to Kyrgyzstan began in 1929-1930 and 1940s-1950s in Kazakhstan.

[ 66 ] Another primary reason why Azeris may reside in the region is the Soviet-era labour migration , which could have also affected Turkic populations of South Caucasus .

[ 67 ] There are approximately 220,000 Azerbaijanis living in Central Asia. Prominent Central Asians of Azerbaijani origin include: Hajibala Abutalybov , Stalik Khankishiev , Rafael Fiziev , Elnur Hüseynov and others.

In the present-day, besides Central Asia, a sizeable population of Azerbaijanis also live in East Asia . The ancestors of Azerbaijanis have had a historical presence in the Far East (East Asia) and the Gobi-Manchurian steppe since the formation of the Göktürk Khaganate (552–744 CE), a Turkic state that spanned from the territories of Goguryeo to Greater Caucasus . Although there are no official numbers of Azerbaijani nationals in the People's Republic of China , reports of the Republic of Korea state that there are 608 Azeris living in the country, of which about 200 of them are university students .

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Statistics on foreign residents of Japan have reported 166 Azerbaijanis residing in the country.

[ 70 ] However, there are also estimates that 30,000 Azerbaijanis currently reside in China and some 10,000 in Japan.

[ 71 ] Korean nationals of Azerbaijani descent represent a small community. While some have acquired South Korean citizenship through marriage, others have done so by pursuing higher education . Azerbaijanis in Korea are particularly prominent in the business sector , with many employed by major Korean corporations . Additionally, a significant number are engaged in roles within governmental organizations .

[ 72 ] Influx of Azerbaijanis to East Asia may be explained by the economic prosperity of the nations in the region. Economic opportunities and academic endeavors are among many factors that can attribute to migration to the region.

Azerbaijanis in Europe [ edit ] The Federation of Turkish-Azerbaijani Associations [ edit ] The Federation of Turkish-Azerbaijani Associations was established in 2004 in Kocaeli . The Heydar Aliyev Park was opened in the Kartepe municipal area on the eve of the World Azerbaijanis Solidarity Day in 2010 as a result of the activity of Turkish-Azerbaijani Associations Federation. Another park in Derince was put into operation on 29 November 2011. A chairman of Turkey-Azerbaijan Federation of Associations is Bilal Dundar.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] Azerbaijani Youth Union of Russia [ edit ] The Azerbaijani Youth Union of Russia was established on 18 April 2009 in Moscow . Its purpose is to protect the Azerbaijan national cultural values, support of Azerbaijani youth, better integration of Azerbaijani youth into the cultural life of Russian society and the development of education. Its central office is located in Moscow and there are several regional offices in the north and west of Russia, Volga area, North Caucasus, Far East and Siberia. The chairwoman is Leyla Aliyeva .

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Organizations [ edit ] The State Committee of Azerbaijan Republic on Work with Diaspora was established to handle the communication with the diaspora and to drive the creation of new societies and organizations. In 2004 the committee effected the creation of about 40 new Azerbaijani communities worldwide.

On March 10, 1948, the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a resolution entitled : "Planned measures for the resettlement of collective farm workers and other Azerbaijanis from the Armenian SSR to the Kura-Arax lowlands." According to this plan some 100,000 people had to be "voluntarily" resettled.

Under Stalin, too, deportations of whole populations took place. Thus, in 1948, around 100,000 Azerbaijanis were deported from Armenia. In a recent polemic, Gorbachev reminded the Armenians that before the Revolution, Azerbaijanis had formed 43 per cent of the population of Erevan.
