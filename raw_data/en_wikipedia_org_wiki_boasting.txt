[ 4 ] Forms of bragging [ edit ] Although a brag can be as straightforward as a simple claim to riches or greatness, it often assumes a variety of more subtle forms [ 5 ] in order to shield the speaker from any opprobrium they might otherwise receive for transgressing the social norms of humility. The most popular of these forms is the humblebrag, a term coined by comedian Harris Wittels , whereby the brag is masked in a complaint.

He puts forth that the discourse around westward expansion was marked by boastfulness. Thus establishing the need to explain boastfulness (due to it being relevant to American history), he writes, "In America, success often counts more than achievement. When these lesser things count more than the greater, bragging and self-advertisement come to the fore because they pay, as they have throughout our history."
