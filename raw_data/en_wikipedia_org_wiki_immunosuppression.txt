ICD-10-PCS D89.9 MeSH D007165 [ edit on Wikidata ] Immunosuppression is a reduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system . Some portions of the immune system itself have immunosuppressive effects on other parts of the immune system, and immunosuppression may occur as an adverse reaction to treatment of other conditions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In general, deliberately induced immunosuppression is performed to prevent the body from rejecting an organ transplant .

[ 3 ] Additionally, it is used for treating graft-versus-host disease after a bone marrow transplant , or for the treatment of auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , Sjögren's syndrome , or Crohn's disease . This is typically done using medications, but may involve surgery ( splenectomy ), plasmapheresis , or radiation. A person who is undergoing immunosuppression, or whose immune system is weak for some other reasons (such as chemotherapy or HIV ), is said to be immunocompromised .

[ 4 ] Deliberately induced [ edit ] Further information: Immunosuppressive drug Azathioprine White blood cells (and red blood cells) Administration of immunosuppressive medications or immunosuppressants is the main method for deliberately inducing immunosuppression; in optimal circumstances, immunosuppressive drugs primarily target hyperactive components of the immune system.

[ 5 ] People in remission from cancer who require immunosuppression are not more likely to experience a recurrence.

[ 6 ] Throughout its history, radiation therapy has been used to decrease the strength of the immune system.

[ 7 ] Dr. Joseph Murray of Brigham and Women's Hospital was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for work on immunosuppression.

[ 8 ] Immunosuppressive drugs have the potential to cause immunodeficiency , which can increase susceptibility to opportunistic infection and decrease cancer immunosurveillance .

[ 9 ] Immunosuppressants may be prescribed when a normal immune response is undesirable, such as in autoimmune diseases .

[ 10 ] Steroids were the first class of immunosuppressant drugs identified, though side-effects of early compounds limited their use. The more specific [ vague ] azathioprine was identified in 1960, but it was the discovery of ciclosporin in 1980 (together with azathioprine) that allowed significant expansion of transplantation to less well-matched donor-recipient pairs as well as broad application to lung transplantation , pancreas transplantation , and heart transplantation .

[ 3 ] After an organ transplantation , the body will nearly always reject the new organ(s) due to differences in human leukocyte antigen between the donor and recipient. As a result, the immune system detects the new tissue as "foreign", and attempts to remove it by attacking it with white blood cells , resulting in the death of the donated tissue. Immunosuppressants are administered in order to help prevent rejection; however, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy during the course of such treatment.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Non-deliberate immunosuppression [ edit ] Leukemia Further information: Immunodeficiency Non-deliberate immunosuppression can occur in, for example, ataxia–telangiectasia , complement deficiencies , many types of cancer , and certain chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The unwanted effect in non-deliberate immunosuppression is immunodeficiency that results in increased susceptibility to pathogens , such as bacteria and viruses.

[ 1 ] Immunodeficiency is also a potential adverse effect of many immunosuppressant drugs , in this sense, the scope of the term immunosuppression in general includes both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system.

[ 14 ] B cell deficiency and T cell deficiency are immune impairment that individuals are born with or are acquired, which in turn can lead to immunodeficiency problems.

[ 15 ] Nezelof syndrome is an example of an immunodeficiency of T-cells.
