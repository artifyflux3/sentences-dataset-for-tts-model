Definition [ edit ] Let L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} be a first-order language and T {\displaystyle T} be a theory over L .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}.} For a model A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} of T {\displaystyle T} one expands L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} to a new language L A := L ∪ ∪ { c a : a ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{A}:={\mathcal {L}}\cup \{c_{a}:a\in A\}} by adding a new constant symbol c a {\displaystyle c_{a}} for each element a {\displaystyle a} in A , {\displaystyle A,} where A {\displaystyle A} is a subset of the domain of A .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}.} Now one may expand A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} to the model A A := ( A , a ) a ∈ ∈ A .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}_{A}:=({\mathfrak {A}},a)_{a\in A}.} The positive diagram  of A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} , sometimes denoted D + ( A ) {\displaystyle D^{+}({\mathfrak {A}})} , is the set of all those atomic sentences which hold in A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} while the negative diagram, denoted D − − ( A ) , {\displaystyle D^{-}({\mathfrak {A}}),} thereof is the set of all those atomic sentences which do not hold in A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} .

The diagram D ( A ) {\displaystyle D({\mathfrak {A}})} of A {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}} is the set of all atomic sentences and negations of atomic sentences of L A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{A}} that hold in A A .

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}_{A}.} [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Symbolically, D ( A ) = D + ( A ) ∪ ∪ ¬ ¬ D − − ( A ) {\displaystyle D({\mathfrak {A}})=D^{+}({\mathfrak {A}})\cup \neg D^{-}({\mathfrak {A}})} .
