Occupation Author, explorer, museum exhibit designer Genre Narrative nonfiction Years active 2005–present Website valerievanheest .com Valerie Olson van Heest is an American author, explorer, and museum exhibit designer. She is co-founder of the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association.

Early life [ edit ] Valerie was born in Wilmette , Illinois . She graduated from New Trier East High School. Her father, Robert V. Olson, was the son a of Swedish immigrant, who volunteered at 17 to join the U.S. Navy at the outbreak of WW II. Robert was a Boatswain's mate and Underwater Demolition Team diver in the Pacific Theater. After the war, he encouraged his long time friend and neighbor Sam Davison to start the Davison Corporation to manufacture scuba gear.

[ 1 ] At 16 Valerie began working at the Dacor factory making scuba gear and became a certified scuba diver through the company's training program. She attended Harrington College of Design in Chicago and Loyola University and graduated with a B.A. in Interior Design . She worked at several architectural firms as a designer and project manager in Chicago.

Career [ edit ] In Chicago, she joined the Chicago Maritime Museum "dive group" and with others co-founded an offshoot organization, the Underwater Archaeological Society of Chicago [ 2 ] where she served as its president for 8 years. During that time, she led investigations of over a dozen shipwrecks, and testified in the Lady Elgin case, The People of the State of Illinois ex rel . Illinois Historic Preservation Agency et al ., Appellees, v. Harry Zych, d/b/a American Diving & Salvage Company, et al ., Appellants, [ 3 ] regarding her observations conducting an investigation of three sites of Lady Elgin wreckage strewn on the lake bottom.

During that time, she co-authored reports on the shipwrecks Lady Elgin , Goshawk , and Wells Burt , [ 4 ] and created archaeological site drawings on over a dozen shipwrecks.

After relocating to Holland, Michigan, she joined the Committee to establish the Southwest Michigan Underwater Preserve . In 2000, the state of Michigan approved Southwest Michigan Underwater Preserve as 10th underwater preserve.

[ 5 ] Soon thereafter, van Heest, her husband Jack, Craig Rich, Geoffrey Reynolds, and others founded the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association specifically to research, explore, document, and interpret shipwrecks of Lake Michigan. She is a co-director of that organization currently.

[ 6 ] In 2006, Valerie was inducted into Women Divers Hall of Fame [ 7 ] for her years of preserving and interpreting Great Lakes shipwrecks.

In 2007, the Historical Society of Michigan awarded van Heest the State History Award for distinguished volunteer service in promoting Michigan's submerged maritime heritage.

After the collaboration on Buckets and Belts in 2009, [ 8 ] the co-author, William Lafferty and van Heest formed the museum exhibit design firm Lafferty van Heest and Associates.

[ 12 ] Literary career [ edit ] Valerie van Heest has written numerous articles for several magazines and historical journals. including Michigan History , Wreck Diving Magazine , The Great Laker , Inland Seas , among others.

[ 13 ] Van Heest began writing her first book in 2005. The recent MSRA discovery of the S.S. Michigan inspired her to find a way to share this story with her daughters by writing a young reader's book. Van Heest used her graphic art talents to create them herself.

[ 14 ] After receiving an award from the Historical Society of Michigan for her first book, Icebound! The Adventures of Young George Sheldon and the SS Michigan , van Heest continued in a new direction by writing non-fiction books about Great Lakes shipwrecks and other historical topics.

While working with NUMA's Clive Cussler during the search for NWA Flight 2501 , in 2006 Cussler encouraged her to write a book about that aircraft tragedy. That book, Fatal Crossing , was published in 2013. He wrote a "blurb" about the book that appears on the cover.

[ 15 ] Michigan Shipwreck Research Association [ edit ] Van Heest is a co-founder of the Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates , a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. Its mission is to preserve and interpret Michigan's submerged maritime history. The organization conducts side-scan sonar expeditions in search of shipwrecks and aircraft wrecks in Lake Michigan. Board members do research and documentation of submerged cultural resources and create educational resources including its website, and newsletter, documentary films, informative articles, books, and museum exhibits. Its Board of Directors make presentations to organizations of all kinds. Since 1998, MSRA hosts an annual public symposium to showcase its projects and those of other Great Lakes explorers.

Van Heest has been a leading member in the annual search expeditions in lower Lake Michigan resulting in the discovery of numerous shipwrecks, such as the H.C. Akeley, SS Michigan , Hennepin, John V. Moran, Milwaukee, Hattie Wells, William Tell.
