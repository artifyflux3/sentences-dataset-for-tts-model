Thermal radiation in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork. Its emission in the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") is invisible to the human eye. [Infrared cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermographic_camera "Thermographic camera") are capable of capturing this infrared emission (see _[Thermography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography "Thermography")_).

**Thermal radiation** is [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") emitted by the [thermal motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_motion "Thermal motion") of particles in [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). All matter with a [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") greater than [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero") emits thermal radiation. The emission of energy arises from a combination of electronic, molecular, and lattice oscillations in a material.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:9-1)[Kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") is converted to [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") due to [charge-acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_formula "Larmor formula") or [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole") oscillation. At [room temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature "Room temperature"), most of the emission is in the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") (IR) spectrum,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:1-2): 73–86  though above around 525°C (977°F) enough of it becomes [visible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum") for the matter to visibly glow. This visible glow is called **incandescence**. Thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of [heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer "Heat transfer"), along with [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction "Thermal conduction") and [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_(heat_transfer) "Convection (heat transfer)").

The primary method by which the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") transfers heat to the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") is thermal radiation. This energy is partially absorbed and scattered in the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), the latter process being the reason why the sky is visibly blue.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:3-3) Much of the Sun's radiation transmits through the atmosphere to the surface where it is either absorbed or reflected.

Thermal radiation can be used to detect objects or phenomena normally invisible to the human eye. [Thermographic cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_camera "Infrared camera") create an image by sensing infrared radiation. These images can represent the temperature gradient of a scene and are commonly used to locate objects at a higher temperature than their surroundings. In a dark environment where visible light is at low levels, infrared images can be used to locate animals or people due to their body temperature. [Cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation") is another example of thermal radiation.

[Blackbody radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation") is a concept used to analyze thermal radiation in idealized systems. This model applies if a radiating object meets the physical characteristics of a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body") in [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium "Thermodynamic equilibrium").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:8-4): 278 [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law") describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation, and relates the radiative heat flux from a body to its temperature. [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law "Wien's displacement law") determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law "Stefan–Boltzmann law") gives the radiant intensity.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:8-4): 280  Where blackbody radiation is not an accurate approximation, emission and absorption can be modeled using [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") (QED).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:9-1)

Thermal radiation is the emission of [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves") from all matter that has a [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") greater than [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-blundell-5)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:1-2) Thermal radiation reflects the conversion of [thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy "Thermal energy") into [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_energy "Electromagnetic energy"). Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") in matter. It is present in all matter of nonzero temperature. These atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles, i.e., [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"). The kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge acceleration and [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole") oscillation. This results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), radiating energy away from the body. Electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, will propagate indefinitely in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating, including its temperature and its spectral [emissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity "Emissivity"), as expressed by [Kirchhoff's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation "Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-blundell-5) The radiation is not monochromatic, i.e., it does not consist of only a single frequency, but comprises a continuous spectrum of photon energies, its characteristic spectrum. If the radiating body and its surface are in [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium "Thermodynamic equilibrium") and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths, it is characterized as a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body"). A black body is also a perfect emitter. The radiation of such perfect emitters is called [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation"). The ratio of any body's emission relative to that of a black body is the body's [emissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity "Emissivity"), so a black body has an emissivity of one.

Absorptivity, [reflectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity "Reflectivity"), and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation. Due to [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(electromagnetism) "Reciprocity (electromagnetism)"), absorptivity and emissivity for any particular wavelength are equal at equilibrium – a good absorber is necessarily a good emitter, and a poor absorber is a poor emitter. The temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation.

The distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law"). At any given temperature, there is a frequency _f_ max at which the power emitted is a maximum. Wien's displacement law, and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength, indicates that the peak frequency _f_ max is proportional to the absolute temperature _T_ of the black body. The photosphere of the sun, at a temperature of approximately 6000 K, emits radiation principally in the (human-)visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light, and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected. Earth's surface emits the absorbed radiation, approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 K with spectral peak at _f_ max. At these lower frequencies, the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from Earth's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere. Though about 10% of this radiation escapes into space, most is absorbed and then re-emitted by atmospheric gases. It is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect"), contributing to [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming") and [climate change in general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_(general_concept) "Climate change (general concept)") (but also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing).

[Burning glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_glass "Burning glass") are known to date back to about 700 BC. One of the first accurate mentions of burning glasses appears in [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes "Aristophanes")'s comedy _[The Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Clouds "The Clouds")_, written in 423 BC.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6) According to the [Archimedes' heat ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_heat_ray "Archimedes' heat ray") anecdote, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") is purported to have developed mirrors to concentrate heat rays in order to burn attacking [Roman ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_navy "Roman navy") during the [Siege of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(213%E2%80%93212_BC) "Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)") (c. 213–212 BC), but no sources from the time have been confirmed.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6)_Catoptrics_ is a book attributed to [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") on how to focus light in order to produce heat, but the book might have been written in 300 AD.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6)

During the Renaissance, [Santorio Santorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorio_Santorio "Santorio Santorio") came up with one of the earliest [thermoscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoscope "Thermoscope"). In 1612, he published his results on the heating effects from the Sun and his attempts to measure heat from the Moon.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6)

Earlier, in 1589, [Giambattista della Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta "Giambattista della Porta") reported on the heat felt on his face, emitted by a remote candle and facilitated by a concave metallic mirror. He also reported the cooling felt from a solid ice block.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6) Della Porta's experiment would be replicated many times with increasing accuracy. It was replicated by astronomers [Giovanni Antonio Magini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Antonio_Magini "Giovanni Antonio Magini") and [Christopher Heydon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Heydon "Christopher Heydon") in 1603, and supplied instructions for [Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor") who performed it in 1611. In 1660, della Porta's experiment was updated by the [Accademia del Cimento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_del_Cimento "Accademia del Cimento") using a thermometer invented by [Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II,_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany "Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:4-6)

In 1761, [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin") wrote a letter describing his experiments on the relationship between color and heat absorption.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-7) He found that darker color clothes got hotter when exposed to sunlight than lighter color clothes. One experiment he performed consisted of placing square pieces of cloth of various colors out in the snow on a sunny day. He waited some time and then measured that the black pieces sank furthest into the snow of all the colors, indicating that they got the hottest and melted the most snow.

[Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") considered that radiation of heat was concerned with the condition of the surface of a physical body rather than the material of which it was composed.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:22-8) Lavoisier described a poor radiator to be a substance with a polished or smooth surface as it possessed its molecules lying in a plane closely bound together thus creating a surface layer of caloric fluid which insulated the release of the rest within.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:22-8) He described a good radiator to be a substance with a rough surface as only a small proportion of molecules held caloric in within a given plane, allowing for greater escape from within.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:22-8)[Count Rumford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson "Benjamin Thompson") would later cite this explanation of caloric movement as insufficient to explain the radiation of cold, which became a point of contention for the theory as a whole.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:22-8)

In his first memoir, [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel") responded to a view he extracted from a French translation of [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s _[Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics")_. He says that Newton imagined particles of light traversing space uninhibited by the caloric medium filling it, and refutes this view (never actually held by Newton) by saying that a body under illumination would increase indefinitely in heat.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-9)

In [Marc-Auguste Pictet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Auguste_Pictet "Marc-Auguste Pictet")'s famous [experiment of 1790](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictet%27s_experiment "Pictet's experiment"), it was reported that a thermometer detected a lower temperature when a set of mirrors were used to focus "frigorific rays" from a cold object.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-10)

In 1791, [Pierre Prevost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Prevost_(physicist) "Pierre Prevost (physicist)") a colleague of Pictet, introduced the concept of [radiative equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_equilibrium "Radiative equilibrium"), wherein all objects both radiate and absorb heat.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:5-11) When an object is cooler than its surroundings, it absorbs more heat than it emits, causing its temperature to increase until it reaches equilibrium. Even at equilibrium, it continues to radiate heat, balancing absorption and emission.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:5-11)

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel"). Herschel published his results in 1800 before the [Royal Society of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_London "Royal Society of London"). Herschel used a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_prism_(optics) "Triangular prism (optics)") to [refract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refract "Refract") light from the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and detected the calorific rays, beyond the [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red "Red") part of the spectrum, by an increase in the temperature recorded on a [thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer") in that region.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-13)

### Electromagnetic theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Electromagnetic theory")]

At the end of the 19th century, it was shown that the transmission of light or of [radiant heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_heat "Radiant heat") was allowed by the propagation of [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-hsu-14)[Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television") and [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") broadcasting waves are types of electromagnetic waves with specific [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelengths "Wavelengths").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-becker-15) All [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves") travel at the same speed; therefore, shorter [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelengths "Wavelengths") are associated with high frequencies. All bodies generate and receive electromagnetic waves at the expense of heat exchange.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-becker-15)

In 1860, [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff") published a mathematical description of [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium") (i.e. [Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation "Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation")).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:7-16): 275–301  By 1884 the emissive power of a perfect blackbody was inferred by [Josef Stefan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Stefan "Josef Stefan") using [John Tyndall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall "John Tyndall")'s experimental measurements, and derived by [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") from fundamental statistical principles.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-17) This relation is known as [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law "Stefan–Boltzmann law").

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Max_Planck_1901.GIF/250px-Max_Planck_1901.GIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Max_Planck_1901.GIF)

Max Planck in 1901

The microscopic theory of radiation is best known as the [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and was first offered by [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") in 1900.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-hsu-14) According to this theory, energy emitted by a radiator is not continuous but is in the form of quanta. Planck noted that energy was emitted in quantas of frequency of vibration similarly to the wave theory.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:6-18) The energy _E_ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum is found by the expression _E_ = _hf_, where _h_ is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") and _f_ is its frequency.

Bodies at higher temperatures emit radiation at higher frequencies with an increasing energy per quantum. While the propagation of electromagnetic waves of all wavelengths is often referred as "radiation", thermal radiation is often constrained to the visible and infrared regions. For engineering purposes, it may be stated that thermal radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation which varies on the nature of a surface and its temperature.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-hsu-14)

Radiation waves may travel in unusual patterns compared to conduction [heat flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flow "Heat flow"). Radiation allows waves to travel from a heated body through a cold non-absorbing or partially absorbing medium and reach a warmer body again.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-hsu-14) An example is the case of the radiation waves that travel from the Sun to the Earth.

A comparison of a thermal image (top) and an ordinary photograph (bottom). The plastic bag is mostly transparent to long-wavelength infrared, but the man's glasses are opaque.

Thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies. The frequency distribution is given by [Planck's law of black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law_of_black-body_radiation "Planck's law of black-body radiation") for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top.

The dominant frequency (or color) range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases. For example, a _red hot_ object radiates mainly in the long wavelengths (red and orange) of the visible band. If it is heated further, it also begins to emit discernible amounts of green and blue light, and the spread of frequencies in the entire visible range cause it to appear white to the human eye; it is _white hot_. Even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 K, 99% of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared. This is determined by [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law "Wien's displacement law"). In the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increases.

| 580°C (1,076°F) | dark red |
| 730°C (1,350°F) | bright red, slightly orange |
| 930°C (1,710°F) | bright orange |

| 1,300°C (2,370°F) | yellowish white |

### Relationship to temperature

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Relationship to temperature")]

The total radiation intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature, as expressed by the [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law "Stefan–Boltzmann law"). A kitchen oven, at a temperature about double room temperature on the absolute temperature scale (600 K vs. 300 K) radiates 16 times as much power per unit area. An object at the temperature of the filament in an [incandescent light bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb")—roughly 3000 K, or 10 times room temperature—radiates 10,000 times as much energy per unit area.

As for [photon statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_statistics "Photon statistics"), thermal light obeys [Super-Poissonian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_statistics#Super-Poissonian_light "Photon statistics").

When the temperature of a body is high enough, its thermal radiation spectrum becomes strong enough in the [visible range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_range "Visible range") to visibly glow. The visible component of thermal radiation is sometimes called _incandescence_,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-20) though this term can also refer to thermal radiation in general. The term derives from the Latin verb _incandescere_, 'to glow white'.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-21)

In practice, virtually all solid or liquid substances start to glow around 798 K (525°C; 977°F), with a mildly dull red color, whether or not a chemical reaction takes place that produces light as a result of an exothermic process. This limit is called the [Draper point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draper_point "Draper point"). The incandescence does not vanish below that temperature, but it is too weak in the visible spectrum to be perceptible.

The rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body at a given frequency is proportional to the rate that the body absorbs radiation at that frequency, a property known as [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(electromagnetism) "Reciprocity (electromagnetism)"). Thus, a surface that absorbs more red light thermally radiates more red light. This principle applies to all properties of the wave, including [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") (color), direction, [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves) "Polarization (waves)"), and even [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)"). It is therefore possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized, coherent, and directional; though polarized and coherent sources are fairly rare in nature.

Fundamental principles
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Fundamental principles")]

Thermal radiation is one of the three principal mechanisms of [heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer "Heat transfer"). It entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object's temperature. Other mechanisms are [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") and [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction "Heat conduction").

### Electromagnetic waves

Electromagnetic wave with perpendicular electric and magnetic components

Thermal radiation is characteristically different from conduction and convection in that it does not require a medium and, in fact it reaches maximum [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency "Efficiency") in a [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"). Thermal radiation is a type of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") which is often modeled by the propagation of waves. These waves have the standard wave properties of frequency, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468) and [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelengths "Wavelengths"), ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a) which are related by the equation ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {c}{\nu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91436039f817d629f3a8e50c18476d0d0f991e34) where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455) is the speed of light in the medium.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 769

_Thermal irradiation_ is the rate at which radiation is incident upon a surface per unit area.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 771  It is measured in [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") per square meter. Irradiation can either be _reflected_, _absorbed_, or _transmitted_. The components of irradiation can then be characterized by the equation ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \alpha +\rho +\tau =1\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce1bdd9fcff6840177329a8d0e03672a59e413a9) where ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) represents the [absorptivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)"), ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64) represents [reflectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance#Reflectivity "Reflectance") and ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \tau }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c) represents [transmissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmittance "Transmittance").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 772  These components are a function of the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave as well as the material properties of the medium.

#### Absorptivity and emissivity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Absorptivity and emissivity")]

The spectral absorption is equal to the [emissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity "Emissivity")![Image 15: {\displaystyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2); this relation is known as [Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation "Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation"). An object is called a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body") if this holds for all frequencies, and the following formula applies: ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \alpha =\epsilon =1.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8d0ee88b060a992903ca46e50c4d325778fe5e2)

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/ThermalPaint.png/500px-ThermalPaint.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ThermalPaint.png)

Spectral response of two paints and a mirrored surface, in the visible and the infrared. From NASA.

If objects appear white (reflective in the [visual spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_spectrum "Visual spectrum")), they are not necessarily equally reflective (and thus non-emissive) in the thermal infrared – see the diagram at the left. Most household radiators are painted white, which is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat, and are not designed as thermal radiators at all – instead, they are actually [convectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_heater "Convection heater"), and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy. Acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93% blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-23) (meaning the term "black body" does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object). These materials that do not follow the "black color = high emissivity/absorptivity" caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivity/absorptivity dependence.

Only truly _gray_ systems (relative equivalent emissivity/absorptivity and no directional transmissivity dependence in _all_ control volume bodies considered) can achieve reasonable steady-state heat flux estimates through the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Encountering this "ideally calculable" situation is almost impossible (although common engineering procedures surrender the dependency of these unknown variables and "assume" this to be the case). Optimistically, these "gray" approximations will get close to real solutions, as most divergence from Stefan-Boltzmann solutions is very small (especially in most [standard temperature and pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure "Standard temperature and pressure") lab controlled environments).

[Reflectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity "Reflectivity") deviates from the other properties in that it is bidirectional in nature. In other words, this property depends on the direction of the incident of radiation as well as the direction of the reflection. Therefore, the reflected rays of a radiation spectrum incident on a real surface in a specified direction forms an irregular shape that is not easily predictable. In practice, surfaces are often assumed to reflect either in a perfectly specular or a diffuse manner. In a [specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection "Specular reflection"), the angles of reflection and incidence are equal. In [diffuse reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection "Diffuse reflection"), radiation is reflected equally in all directions. Reflection from smooth and polished surfaces can be assumed to be specular reflection, whereas reflection from rough surfaces approximates diffuse reflection.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-hsu-14) In [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation")[analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis "Analysis") a surface is defined as smooth if the height of the surface roughness is much smaller relative to the wavelength of the incident radiation.

A medium that experiences no transmission (![Image 18: {\displaystyle \tau =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4422051052da869dc5b1f0e1cfb06a045ee0c36a)) is _opaque,_ in which case absorptivity and reflectivity sum to unity: ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \rho +\alpha =1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce2013d60676ace9b7b7bba7656ce9d5ec0a2a97)

### Radiation intensity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Radiation intensity")]

Radiation emitted from a surface can propagate in any direction from the surface.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 773  Irradiation can also be incident upon a surface from any direction. The amount of irradiation on a surface is therefore dependent on the relative orientation of both the emitter and the receiver. The parameter _radiation intensity,_![Image 20: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) is used to quantify how much radiation makes it from one surface to another.

Radiation intensity is often modeled using a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 773

_Emissive power_ is the rate at which radiation is emitted per unit area.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 776  It is a measure of [heat flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flux "Heat flux"). The total emissive power from a surface is denoted as ![Image 21: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) and can be determined by, ![Image 22: {\displaystyle E=\pi I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4929035f3da81b95e87490d82b3e95bdae1448a4) where ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a) is in units of [steradians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian "Steradian") and ![Image 24: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) is the total intensity.

The total emissive power can also be found by integrating the _spectral emissive power_ over all possible wavelengths.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 776  This is calculated as, ![Image 25: {\displaystyle E=\int _{0}^{\infty }E_{\lambda }(\lambda )d\lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b12f95bd3a6a98d9209b76eee74ce9b7c990922) where ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \lambda }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b43d0ea3c9c025af1be9128e62a18fa74bedda2a) represents wavelength.

The spectral emissive power can also be determined from the spectral intensity, ![Image 27: {\displaystyle I_{\lambda }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62191ee151a9bf9cb12490516bbdfabb43ddf032) as follows, ![Image 28: {\displaystyle E_{\lambda }(\lambda )=\pi I_{\lambda }(\lambda )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41339e32f9e56b0684a6792538b4cb67392cf050) where both spectral emissive power and emissive intensity are functions of wavelength.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 776

### Blackbody radiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Blackbody radiation")]

A "black body" is a body which has the property of allowing all incident rays to enter without surface reflection and not allowing them to leave again.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:7-16)

Blackbodies are idealized surfaces that act as the perfect absorber and emitter.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 782–783  They serve as the standard against which real surfaces are compared when characterizing thermal radiation. A blackbody is defined by three characteristics:

1.   _A blackbody absorbs all incident radiation, regardless of wavelength and direction._
2.   _No surface can emit more energy than a blackbody for a given temperature and wavelength._
3.   _A blackbody is a diffuse emitter._

#### The Planck distribution

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: The Planck distribution")]

The spectral intensity of a blackbody, ![Image 29: {\displaystyle I_{\lambda ,b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/811e12eaa6d4e68674d3863584876f5c659a7c45) was first determined by Max Planck.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:3-3) It is given by [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law") per unit wavelength as: ![Image 30: {\displaystyle I_{\lambda ,b}(\lambda ,T)={\frac {2hc^{2}}{\lambda ^{5}}}\cdot {\frac {1}{e^{hc/k_{\rm {B}}T\lambda }-1}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/695f199c14fa23b86973b09e39bc746df05f43e0)

This formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in [quantized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics) "Quantization (physics)") electromagnetic field which is in complete [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium") with the radiating object. Planck's law shows that radiative energy increases with temperature, and explains why the peak of an emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures. It can also be found that energy emitted at shorter wavelengths increases more rapidly with temperature relative to longer wavelengths.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-rtps-24)

The equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies in a semi-sphere region. The energy, ![Image 31: {\displaystyle E=h\nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6c0386dc6d9530519404f95570fcc8548ed2326), of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency, and the probability that each of those states will be occupied.

#### Stefan-Boltzmann law

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Stefan-Boltzmann law")]

[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Emissive_Power.svg/500px-Emissive_Power.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emissive_Power.svg)

Power emitted by a black body plotted against the temperature according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.

The Planck distribution can be used to find the spectral emissive power of a blackbody, ![Image 33: {\displaystyle E_{\lambda ,b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b32e3ba34417cabd55bc32e5f3ad5f10469f665) as follows,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:2-22): 784–785

![Image 34: {\displaystyle E_{\lambda ,b}=\pi I_{\lambda ,b}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56a0c17888f88abfd9bd843a0ace3cfd7b0a58b0)

The total emissive power of a blackbody is then calculated as, ![Image 35: {\displaystyle E_{b}=\int _{0}^{\infty }\pi I_{\lambda ,b}d\lambda .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8353eb4b6e127f21612d1ec34afb2d1b141b4cc)

The solution of the above integral yields a remarkably elegant equation for the total emissive power of a blackbody, the _Stefan-Boltzmann law_, which is given as, ![Image 36: {\displaystyle E_{b}=\sigma T^{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5ce5a53779c77876e4eead5be989c3a390bc179) where ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36) is the _Steffan-Boltzmann constant_.

#### Wien's displacement law

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Wien's displacement law")]

The peak wavelength and total-s radiated amount vary with temperature according to [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law "Wien's displacement law"). Although this shows relatively high temperatures, the same relationships hold true for any temperature down to absolute zero.

The wavelength ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \lambda \,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/988b7b8a22b11081bc97378c30391f573535c21c) for which the emission intensity is highest is given by Wien's displacement law as: ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}={\frac {b}{T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf5c9c4bae9e811fd33cdcc49fc06a464d47f4d8)

### Emission from non-black surfaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Emission from non-black surfaces")]

For surfaces which are not black bodies, one has to consider the (generally frequency dependent) emissivity factor ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \epsilon (\nu )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20a01b9dad7a79e1c5438527ae3df2a1fe395a0d). This factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration. If it is taken as a constant, the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \epsilon }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3837cad72483d97bcdde49c85d3b7b859fb3fd2) as a factor: ![Image 48: {\displaystyle P=\epsilon \sigma AT^{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/975a012ddddb6871f97568d368530551b303b91a)

This type of theoretical model, with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body, is often known as a _grey body_. For frequency-dependent emissivity, the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence, though in general there is no simple expression for it. Practically speaking, if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength, the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral.

Heat transfer between surfaces
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Heat transfer between surfaces")]

Calculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of objects, including a 'cavity' or 'surroundings' requires solution of a set of [simultaneous equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations "Simultaneous equations") using the [radiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosity_(heat_transfer) "Radiosity (heat transfer)") method. In these calculations, the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called [view factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_factor "View factor"), which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface. These calculations are important in the fields of [solar thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy "Solar thermal energy"), [boiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler "Boiler") and [furnace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnace_(house_heating) "Furnace (house heating)") design and [raytraced computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics) "Ray tracing (graphics)").

The _net_ radiative heat transfer from one surface to another is the radiation leaving the first surface for the other minus that arriving from the second surface.

Formulas for radiative heat transfer can be derived for more particular or more elaborate physical arrangements, such as between parallel plates, concentric spheres and the internal surfaces of a cylinder.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:6-18)

Thermal radiation is an important factor of many engineering applications, especially for those dealing with high temperatures.

Diagram of a solar radiation balance model

Sunlight is the incandescence of the "white hot" surface of the Sun. Electromagnetic radiation from the sun has a peak wavelength of about 550 nm,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:9-1) and can be harvested to generate heat or electricity.

Thermal radiation can be concentrated on a tiny spot via reflecting mirrors, which [concentrating solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrating_solar_power "Concentrating solar power") takes advantage of. Instead of mirrors, [Fresnel lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens "Fresnel lens") can also be used to concentrate [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy "Radiant energy"). Either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight. For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the [PS10 Solar Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS10_Solar_Power_Plant "PS10 Solar Power Plant"), and during the day it can heat water to 285°C (558 K; 545°F).

A [selective surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_surface "Selective surface") can be used when energy is being extracted from the sun. Selective surfaces are surfaces tuned to maximize the amount of energy they absorb from the sun's radiation while minimizing the amount of energy they lose to their own thermal radiation. Selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors.

### Incandescent light bulbs

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Incandescent light bulbs")]

The [incandescent light bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb") creates light by heating a filament to a temperature at which it emits significant visible thermal radiation. For a tungsten filament at a typical temperature of 3000 K, only a small fraction of the emitted radiation is visible, and the majority is infrared light. This infrared light does not help a person see, but still transfers heat to the environment, making incandescent lights relatively inefficient as a light source.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-25) If the filament could be made hotter, efficiency would increase; however, there are currently no materials able to withstand such temperatures which would be appropriate for use in lamps.

More efficient light sources, such as [fluorescent lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp "Fluorescent lamp") and [LEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED "LED"), do not function by incandescence.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-26)

[![Image 50](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Radiant_heat_panel_nrc_ottawa.jpg/250px-Radiant_heat_panel_nrc_ottawa.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Radiant_heat_panel_nrc_ottawa.jpg)

Radiant heat panel for testing precisely quantified energy exposures at [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Council_(Canada) "National Research Council (Canada)"), near [Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa "Ottawa"), [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario"), Canada

Thermal radiation plays a crucial role in human comfort, [influencing perceived temperature sensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_radiation_on_perceived_temperature "Effect of radiation on perceived temperature"). Various technologies have been developed to enhance thermal comfort, including personal heating and cooling devices.

The [mean radiant temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_radiant_temperature "Mean radiant temperature") is a metric used to quantify the exchange of radiant heat between a human and their surrounding environment.

[Radiant personal heaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_heating_and_cooling "Radiant heating and cooling") are devices that convert energy into infrared radiation that are designed to increase a user's perceived temperature. They typically are either gas-powered or electric. In domestic and commercial applications, gas-powered radiant heaters can produce a higher heat flux than electric heaters which are limited by the amount of current that can be drawn through a circuit breaker.

Personalized cooling technology is an example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial. Conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection. However, the human body is a very efficient emitter of infrared radiation, which provides an additional cooling mechanism. Most conventional fabrics are opaque to infrared radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment. Fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable infrared transmission to directly pass through clothing, while being opaque at visible wavelengths, allowing the wearer to remain cooler.

[Low-emissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-emissivity "Low-emissivity") windows in houses are a more complicated technology, since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light. To reduce the heat transfer from a surface, such as a glass window, a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface. "Low-emittance (low-E) coatings are microscopically thin, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the U-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-27) By adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window.

Shiny metal surfaces, have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared. Such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions; an example of this is the [multi-layer insulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-layer_insulation "Multi-layer insulation") used to insulate spacecraft.

Since any electromagnetic radiation, including thermal radiation, conveys momentum as well as energy, thermal radiation also induces very small forces on the radiating or absorbing objects. Normally these forces are negligible, but they must be taken into account when considering spacecraft navigation. The [Pioneer anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_anomaly "Pioneer anomaly"), where the motion of the craft slightly deviated from that expected from gravity alone, was eventually tracked down to asymmetric thermal radiation from the spacecraft. Similarly, the orbits of asteroids are perturbed since the asteroid absorbs solar radiation on the side facing the Sun, but then re-emits the energy at a different angle as the rotation of the asteroid carries the warm surface out of the Sun's view (the [YORP effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect "Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect")).

Nanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:0-28) e.g., for [daytime radiative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_radiative_cooling "Daytime radiative cooling") of photovoltaic cells and buildings. These applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range. A selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky, enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-29)

### Metabolic temperature regulation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Metabolic temperature regulation")]

In a practical, room-temperature setting, humans lose considerable energy due to infrared thermal radiation in addition to that lost by conduction to air (aided by concurrent convection, or other air movement like drafts). The heat energy lost is partially regained by absorbing heat radiation from walls or other surroundings. Human skin has an emissivity of very close to 1.0.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-30) A human, having roughly 2 m 2 in surface area, and a temperature of about 307[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"), continuously radiates approximately 1000 W. If people are indoors, surrounded by surfaces at 296 K, they receive back about 900 W from the wall, ceiling, and other surroundings, resulting in a net loss of 100 W. These estimates are highly dependent on extrinsic variables, such as wearing clothes.

Lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less of the illuminating light, and as a result heat up less. However, color makes little difference in the heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings. This is because the dominant emitted wavelengths are not in the visible spectrum, but rather infrared. Emissivities at those wavelengths are largely unrelated to visual emissivities (visible colors); in the far infra-red, most objects have high emissivities. Thus, except in sunlight, the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth; likewise, paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit.

Thermal radiation is a phenomenon that can burn skin and ignite flammable materials. The time to a damage from exposure to thermal radiation is a function of the rate of delivery of the heat. Radiative heat flux and effects are given as follows:[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-31)

Near-field radiative heat transfer
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_radiation&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Near-field radiative heat transfer")]

At distances on the scale of the wavelength of a radiated electromangetic wave or smaller, Planck's law is not accurate. For objects this small and close together, the [quantum tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling "Quantum tunnelling") of EM waves has a significant impact on the rate of radiation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:9-1)

A more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface. For example, although [far-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field "Near and far field") thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent, near-field thermal radiation (i.e., radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths) may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-32)

Planck's law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions. This deviation is especially strong (up to several orders in magnitude) when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects. However, to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer, the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers. This limitation significantly complicates practical device designs.

Another way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-:0-28) This approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells, wires and dots, and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two- and three-dimensional potential traps, including wells, wires, and dots. Such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#cite_note-33) To achieve the required level of photon confinement, the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by Planck's law. Most importantly, the emission spectrum of thermal wells, wires and dots deviates from Planck's law predictions not only in the near field, but also in the far field, which significantly expands the range of their applications.
