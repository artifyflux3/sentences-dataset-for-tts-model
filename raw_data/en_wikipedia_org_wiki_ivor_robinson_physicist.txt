He was a principal organizer of the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics .

Biography [ edit ] Born in Liverpool , October 7, 1923, "into a comfortable Jewish middle-class family", [ 3 ] Ivor Robinson read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge , as an undergraduate, where he was influenced by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch .

[ 2 ] He took his  B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 1947. His first academic placements were at University College of Wales , King's College London , University of North Carolina , University of Hamburg , Syracuse University and Cornell University .

[ 2 ] Alfred Schild was developing a department strong in relativity at Austin, Texas, when a second Texas center for relativity research was proposed.

Lloyd Berkner was directing the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies at Dallas and brought Ivor Robinson there in 1963 when it was a "windowless cube on the Southern Methodist University campus".

[ 4 ] Robinson was head of the Mathematics and Mathematical Physics division.

[ 5 ] "Ivor was charged with the formation of a mathematical physics group concentrating on general relativity and cosmology ." [ 2 ] He brought Istvan Ozsváth and Wolfgang Rindler to the Dallas area as permanent members of the newly formed group, alongside a host of distinguished visitors and temporary appointments. This institution became the University of Texas at Dallas .

According to Rindler, "No one who knew him will forget what a brilliant conversationalist he was, with his sonorous deep voice and ultra-English accent, with his convictions and occasional mischievousness." [ 2 ] "Ivor Robinson is a brilliant mathematician who showed us the elegant simplicity of space-time by pointing to its null structure." [ 4 ] Robinson retired in 2000, remaining Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Scientific Contributions [ edit ] Ivor Robinson contributed extensively to modern developments in the theory of relativity. He is known for his pioneering work on null electromagnetic fields ("Robinson's theorem"), for his collaboration with Andrzej Trautman on models for spherical gravitational waves, and for the Bel–Robinson tensor .

Roger Penrose has credited him as an important influence in the development of twistor theory , through his construction of the so-called Robinson congruences .

[ 6 ] Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics [ edit ] Astrophysical sciences developed with attention to spectra of celestial sources to ascertain the chemical origin of these sources. The addition of radio astronomy extended the range of these spectra and revealed quasi-stellar sources with peculiar spectra.

Maarten Schmidt and Jesse Greenstein found extreme red shifts in their studies, which demanded an explanation. Relativistic astrophysics offered its services as a generator of models such as black holes and their environs. Robinson, Schücking , and others organized the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics for December, 1963, in Dallas.

[ 4 ] The Proceedings were published by University of Chicago Press as Quasi-stellar Sources and Gravitational Collapse .  "It is now conventional wisdom that quasars are probably powered by rotating black holes , but it was here at Dallas that the black hole concept emerged as a serious astronomical hypothesis." [ 4 ] It was also at this Symposium that Roy Kerr presented his two page paper on the mathematics of rotating black holes. Of this S. Chandrasekhar (Nobel laureate, 1983) is quoted as saying "In my entire scientific life, extending over forty-five years, the most shattering experience has been the realization that an exact solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, discovered by the New Zealand mathematician, Roy Kerr, provides the absolutely exact representation of untold numbers of massive black holes that populate the universe" [ 7 ] The following year, a second Symposium, had Quasars and High-energy Astronomy as its published proceedings. The series continued with Symposia in alternate years. The sixth Symposium, held in New York in 1972, had its proceedings published by the New York Academy of Sciences . The following volumes of the Annals of the Academy are proceedings of the Symposium series: 224, 264, 302, 336, 375, 422, 470, 571, 647, 688, and 759. In 1974 the Symposium was back in Dallas, but then it travelled: Boston, Munich (twice), Baltimore, Austin (twice), Jerusalem, Chicago, Brighton, Berkeley, Paris, Stanford, and many subsequent venues. From the point of view of astrophysics, a rotating  black hole corresponds to a Kerr metric . The astronomical picture of a quasar involves an active galactic nucleus with a supermassive black hole .
