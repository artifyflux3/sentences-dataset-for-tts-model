The system has two core campuses and five regional campuses, as well as two regional centers under Indiana University Indianapolis . The system's flagship campus is Indiana University Bloomington .

Campuses [ edit ] Core campuses [ edit ] Indiana University Bloomington (IU Bloomington) is the flagship campus of Indiana University.

[ 3 ] The Bloomington campus is home to numerous premier Indiana University schools, including the College of Arts and Sciences, the Hutton Honors College , the Jacobs School of Music , an extension of the Indiana University School of Medicine , the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering , which includes the former School of Library and Information Science (now Department of Library and Information Science), School of Optometry, the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs , the Maurer School of Law , the School of Education , and the Kelley School of Business .

[ 4 ] Indiana University Indianapolis (IU Indianapolis or IU Indy) is Indiana's premier urban research and academic health sciences campus.

[ 5 ] The campus was established in 2024 following the breakup of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis . Located just west of downtown Indianapolis, it is the central location of several Indiana University schools, including the primary campus of the School of Medicine , the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences , the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, the School of Dentistry , the Kelley School of Business, the School of Nursing , the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, the School of Social Work, the Herron School of Art and Design , the world's first School of Philanthropy, and the Robert H. McKinney School of Law .

[ 6 ] Regional campuses [ edit ] In addition to its core campuses, Indiana University maintains five regional campuses throughout Indiana : [ 7 ] Indiana University East (IU East) established 1971, located in Richmond .

Indiana University Kokomo (IU Kokomo) established 1945, located in Kokomo .

Indiana University Northwest (IU Northwest) established 1963, located in Gary .

Indiana University South Bend (IU South Bend) established 1922, located in South Bend .

Indiana University Southeast (IU Southeast or IUS) established 1941, located in New Albany .

Regional centers [ edit ] There are two regional centers under the administration of IU Indianapolis: Indiana University Columbus (IUC) established 1970, located in Columbus . After IUPUI split in 2024, Indiana University—Purdue University Columbus was rebranded into IUC.

Indiana University Fort Wayne (IU Fort Wayne) established 2018, located in Fort Wayne . It was established after the dissolution of the former entity Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), which had been an extension similar to that of IUPUI under the administration of Purdue University . IU Fort Wayne took over IPFW's academic programs in health sciences, with all other IPFW academic programs taken over by the new entity, Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW).

Cross-campus schools [ edit ] The School of Medicine and the School of Social Work each have degree programs running across multiple IU campuses.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The School of Medicine additionally has degree programs located at non-Indiana University system campuses, including but not limited to Purdue University 's main campus in West Lafayette , Indiana State University in Terre Haute , and Ball State University in Muncie . The Kelley School of Business, the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, the O'Neil School of Public and Environmental Affairs, and the School of Education each have degree programs at the IU Bloomington and IU Indianapolis campuses.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The School of Nursing has degree programs at the IU Bloomington, IU Indianapolis, and IU Fort Wayne campuses.

[ 13 ] The Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health has degree programs at the IU Indianapolis and IU Fort Wayne campuses.

[ 14 ] Endowment [ edit ] According to the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), the value of the endowment of the Indiana University and affiliated foundations in 2016 is over $1.986 billion.

[ 15 ] The annual budget across all campuses totals over $3 Billion.

[ 16 ] The Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation (IURTC) is a not-for-profit agency that assists IU faculty and researchers in realizing the commercial potential of their discoveries. Since 1997, university clients have been responsible for more than 1,800 inventions, nearly 500 patents, and 38 start-up companies.

[ 17 ] In fiscal year 2016, the IURTC was issued 53 U.S. patents and 112 global patents.

[ 16 ] History [ edit ] 21st century [ edit ] In April 2002, thousands of IU students and staff, along with Bloomington residents, rioted across the university campus before merging into adjacent city blocks after the IU men's basketball team lost the NCAA Basketball championship game to the University of Maryland Terrapins.

[ 18 ] Rioters caused extensive damage to university buildings and city businesses, and at least 45 people were arrested during the riot.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Sexual harassment and assault investigations [ edit ] In March 2014, the U.S. Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights initiated a federal investigation of Indiana University's Title IX compliance, encompassing more than 450 sexual harassment and violence complaints filed with the university between 2011 and 2015. The complaints involved both students and university staff or faculty. The investigation revealed concerns with timeliness of response, lack of documentation, not preventing retaliation, and the creation of sexually hostile environments at the campus. The investigation further criticized the lack of mandatory sexual harassment, misconduct, and awareness training for staff, as well as the lack of institutional support for its Title IX Coordinator to oversee compliance by the university.

[ 22 ] In February 2016, the university's Associate Dean of Students, Director of Student Ethics, and Title IX Deputy Director, Jason Casares, abruptly resigned his position after sexual assault allegations were made against him by Association for Student Conduct Administration president-elect, and New York University Assistant Director of Global Community Standards, Jill Creighton, during a conference in Fort Worth, Texas in December 2015.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The Fort Worth Police Department declined to press charges.

[ 26 ] In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights initiated another Title IX investigation into Indiana University for failing to hold a university student accountable for an off-campus rape of another student and failing to follow proper Title IX procedures subsequent to the reporting of the incident.  The university also charged the victim a dorm-relocation fee after the suspected rapist continued to harass the victim around her dormitory, which also went without intervention by the university. The victim's case was also handled by former Title IX Director, Jason Casares prior to his resignation amidst sexual harassment and misconduct allegations as the university's student ethics director and Title IX deputy director.

[ 27 ] Gaza war protests [ edit ] In 2023, IU's Palestine Solidarity Committee held several protests against the Gaza war . IU's Student Government treasurer and co-director of DEI resigned after accusing other student government leadership members of antisemitism and failure to represent the whole student body. The accused student body president responded by reaffirming the student government's commitment to fighting antisemitism and islamophobia and called the resignations part of "a historical pattern of undue criticism faced by Black women in positions of power." After learning of the controversy, U.S. Representative Jim Banks sent a letter to university president Pamela Whitten demanding information about pro-Palestinian protests and alleged antisemitism on campus, identifying it as a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act . Banks threatened the continued federal funding for the university if the conduct was tolerated by the university administration.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Also in November 2023 the university barred a faculty member from teaching after alleging that he improperly assisted the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a student group, by reserving a room for them on campus.

[ 30 ] Shortly thereafter, the university's administrators also cancelled a planned art exhibition by Samia Halaby , a Palestinian-American artist.

[ 31 ] Critics viewed these actions as unjust attempts to deliver results in response to congressional scrutiny. In the spring of 2024, the university's faculty voted no confidence in the Indiana University system president, the Bloomington campus's provost and vice provost, saying that they were "encroaching on both academic freedom and shared governance." [ 32 ] Over 50 people were arrested while protesting in Dunn Meadow, the designated free speech area on campus.

[ 33 ] In February 2024, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights again initiated a federal investigation of the university in response to a complaint of the violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The complaint alleged lack of response and complacency by the university administration to an increasing number of anti-Semitic incidents at the campus.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The ACLU of Indiana also sued IU, alleging that it had violated the First Amendment rights of people banned from campus after taking part in pro-Palestinian protests.

[ 33 ] In April 2024, IU students and faculty joined other campuses across the US in protesting against the Gaza war and the accused genocide of Palestinians .

[ 37 ] IU president Pamela Whitten made allegations of 'antisemitic episodes'.

[ 38 ] National Guard and police in riot gear broke up the student encampment and multiple arrests were made.

[ 39 ] The following academic year, after the administration brought in new policies to stop protests and limit "expressive activities", students and faculty held vigils for free speech and the Palestinian cause.

[ 40 ] In April 2025, an IU professor was investigated under Indiana's "intellectual diversity" law after an anonymous complaint that he had discussed his arrest during a civil disobedience action at the Israeli consulate . His tenure was threatened after an administrator escalated the complaint.
