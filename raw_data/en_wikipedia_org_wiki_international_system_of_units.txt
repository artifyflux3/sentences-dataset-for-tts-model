The **International System of Units**, internationally known by the abbreviation **SI** (from French _Système international d'unités_), is the modern form of the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system") and the world's most widely used [system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement "System of units of measurement"). It is the only system of measurement with official status in nearly every country in the world, employed in science, technology, industry, and everyday commerce. The SI system is coordinated by the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures"), which is abbreviated BIPM from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _Bureau international des poids et mesures_.

The SI comprises a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement) "Coherence (units of measurement)") system of [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement") starting with seven [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit"), which are the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") (symbol s, the unit of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time")), [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") (m, [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length")), [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") (kg, [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")), [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") (A, [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")), [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (K, [thermodynamic temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature "Thermodynamic temperature")), [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)") (mol, [amount of substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance "Amount of substance")), and [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela") (cd, [luminous intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_intensity "Luminous intensity")). The system can accommodate coherent units for an unlimited number of additional quantities. These are called coherent [derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit"), which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units. Twenty-two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.

The seven base units and the 22 coherent derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other coherent derived units. Since the sizes of coherent units will be convenient for only some applications and not for others, the SI provides twenty-four [prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix "Metric prefix") which, when added to the name and symbol of a coherent unit produce twenty-four additional (non-coherent) SI units for the same quantity; these non-coherent units are always decimal (i.e. power-of-ten) multiples and sub-multiples of the coherent unit.

The current way of defining the SI is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the [realisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realisation_(metrology) "Realisation (metrology)") of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit. One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology.

The original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [centimetre–gram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units "Centimetre–gram–second system of units") (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [electrostatic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_units "Electrostatic units") and [electromagnetic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_units "Electromagnetic units")) and the lack of coordination between the various [disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(academia) "Discipline (academia)") that used them. The General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: _\_Conférence générale des poids et mesures\__ – CGPM), which was established by the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention") of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948, and is based on the [metre–kilogram–second system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units "MKS system of units") (MKS) combined with ideas from the development of the CGS system.

The International System of Units consists of a set of seven defining constants with seven corresponding base units, derived units, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 125

### SI defining constants

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: SI defining constants")]

| Δ _ν_ Cs | [hyperfine transition frequency of 133 Cs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard") | 9 192 631 770 Hz |
| c | [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") | 299 792 458 m/s |
| h | [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") | 6.626 070 15×10−34 J⋅s |
| e | [elementary charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge") | 1.602 176 634×10−19 C |
| k | [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant") | 1.380 649×10−23 J/K |
| _N_ A | [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant") | 6.022 140 76×10 23 mol−1 |
| _K_ cd | [luminous efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy "Luminous efficacy") of 540 THz radiation | 683 lm/W |

The seven defining constants are the most fundamental feature of the definition of the system of units.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 125  The magnitudes of all SI units are defined by declaring that seven constants have certain exact numerical values when expressed in terms of their SI units. These defining constants are the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in vacuum _c_, the [hyperfine transition frequency of caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard")Δ _ν_ Cs, the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant")_h_, the [elementary charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge")_e_, the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant")_k_, the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant")_N_ A, and the [luminous efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy "Luminous efficacy")_K_ cd. The nature of the defining constants ranges from fundamental constants of nature such as _c_ to the purely technical constant _K_ cd. The values assigned to these constants were fixed to ensure continuity with previous definitions of the base units.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 128

The SI selects seven units to serve as [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit"), corresponding to seven base physical quantities. They are the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), with the symbol s, which is the SI unit of the physical quantity of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"); the [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), symbol m, the SI unit of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"); [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") (kg, the unit of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")); [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") (A, [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")); [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (K, [thermodynamic temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature "Thermodynamic temperature")); [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)") (mol, [amount of substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance "Amount of substance")); and [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela "Candela") (cd, [luminous intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_intensity "Luminous intensity")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1) The base units are defined in terms of the defining constants. For example, the kilogram is defined by taking the Planck constant _h_ to be 6.626 070 15×10−34 J⋅s, giving the expression in terms of the defining constants[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 131

1 kg = ⁠(299 792 458)2/(6.626 070 15×10−34)(9 192 631 770)⁠⁠_h_ Δ _ν_ Cs/_c_ 2⁠.
All units in the SI can be expressed in terms of the base units, and the base units serve as a preferred set for expressing or analysing the relationships between units. The choice of which and even how many quantities to use as base quantities is not fundamental or even unique – it is a matter of convention.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 126

| Notes 1. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_ref-2 "Jump up")**Despite the prefix "kilo-", the kilogram is the coherent base unit of mass, and is used in the definitions of derived units. Nonetheless, prefixes for the unit of mass are determined as if the gram were the base unit. 2. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_ref-4 "Jump up")**When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"), [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), other particles, or specified groups of such particles. |

The system allows for an unlimited number of additional units, called _[derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI\_derived\_unit "SI derived unit")_, which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units, possibly with a nontrivial numeric multiplier. When that multiplier is one, the unit is called a _[coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence\_(units\_of\_measurement) "Coherence (units of measurement)")_ derived unit. For example, the coherent derived SI unit of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") is the [metre per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second "Metre per second"), with the symbol m/s.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 139  The base and coherent derived units of the SI together form a coherent system of units (_the set of coherent SI units_). A useful property of a coherent system is that when the numerical values of physical quantities are expressed in terms of the units of the system, then the equations between the numerical values have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the physical quantities.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-ISO80000-1-5): 6

Twenty-two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols as shown in the table below. The radian and steradian have no base units but are treated as derived units for historical reasons.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 137

The derived units in the SI are formed by powers, products, or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 138 [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9): 14, 16

Arrangement of the principal measurements in physics based on the mathematical manipulation of length, time, and mass

[Derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_unit "Derived unit") apply to some [derived quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_quantity "Derived quantity"), which may by definition be expressed in terms of [base quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_quantity "Base quantity"), and thus are not independent; for example, [electrical conductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductance "Electrical conductance") is the inverse of [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance"), with the consequence that the siemens is the inverse of the ohm, and similarly, the ohm and siemens can be replaced with a ratio of an ampere and a volt, because those quantities bear a defined relationship to each other.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-10) Other useful derived quantities can be specified in terms of the SI base and derived units that have no named units in the SI, such as acceleration, which has the SI unit m/s 2.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 139

A combination of base and derived units may be used to express a derived unit. For example, the SI unit of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") is the [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") (N), the SI unit of [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") is the [pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (Pa) – and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m 2).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-11)

Like all metric systems, the SI uses [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix "Metric prefix") to systematically construct, for the same physical quantity, a set of units that are decimal multiples of each other over a wide range. For example, driving distances are normally given in [kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre") (symbol km) rather than in metres. Here the metric prefix '[kilo-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo- "Kilo-")' (symbol 'k') stands for a factor of 1000; thus, 1 km = 1000 m.

The SI provides twenty-four metric prefixes that signify decimal powers ranging from 10−30 to 10 30, the most recent being adopted in 2022.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 143–144 [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-12)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-13)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-14) Most prefixes correspond to integer powers of 1000; the only ones that do not are those for 10, 1/10, 100, and 1/100. The conversion between different SI units for one and the same physical quantity is always through a power of ten. This is why the SI (and metric systems more generally) are called _decimal systems of measurement units_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-DecimalSystem-15)

The grouping formed by a prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol (e.g. 'km', 'cm') constitutes a new inseparable unit symbol. This new symbol can be raised to a positive or negative power. It can also be combined with other unit symbols to form _compound unit_ symbols.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 143  For example, g/cm 3 is an SI unit of [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), where cm 3 is to be interpreted as (cm)3.

Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiples and [submultiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submultiple "Submultiple") of the original unit. All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, _kilo-_ denotes a multiple of a thousand and _milli-_ denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a _micrometre_, not a _millimillimetre_. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a _milligram_, not a _microkilogram_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 122 [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST811-17): 14

The BIPM specifies 24 prefixes for the International System of Units (SI):

### Coherent and non-coherent SI units

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Coherent and non-coherent SI units")]

The base units and the derived units formed as the product of powers of the base units with a numerical factor of one form a [coherent system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_system_of_units "Coherent system of units"). Every physical quantity has exactly one coherent SI unit. For example, 1 m/s = (1 m) / (1 s) is the coherent derived unit for velocity.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 139  With the exception of the kilogram (for which the prefix kilo- is required for a coherent unit), when prefixes are used with the coherent SI units, the resulting units are no longer coherent, because the prefix introduces a numerical factor other than one.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 137  For example, the metre, kilometre, centimetre, nanometre, etc. are all SI units of length, though only the metre is a _coherent_ SI unit. The complete set of SI units consists of both the coherent set and the multiples and sub-multiples of coherent units formed by using the SI prefixes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 138

The kilogram is the only coherent SI unit whose name and symbol include a prefix. For historical reasons, the names and symbols for multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed as if the [gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram") were the base unit. Prefix names and symbols are attached to the unit name _gram_ and the unit symbol g respectively. For example, 10−6 kg is written _milligram_ and mg, not _microkilogram_ and μkg.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 144

Several different quantities may share the same coherent SI unit. For example, the joule per kelvin (symbol J/K) is the coherent SI unit for two distinct quantities: [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity "Heat capacity") and [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy"); another example is the ampere, which is the coherent SI unit for both [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") and [magnetomotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetomotive_force "Magnetomotive force"). This illustrates why it is important not to use the unit alone to specify the quantity. As the _SI Brochure_ states,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 140  "this applies not only to technical texts, but also, for example, to measuring instruments (i.e. the instrument read-out needs to indicate both the unit and the quantity measured)".

Furthermore, the same coherent SI unit may be a base unit in one context, but a coherent derived unit in another. For example, the ampere is a base unit when it is a unit of electric current, but a coherent derived unit when it is a unit of magnetomotive force.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 140

Lexicographic conventions
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lexicographic conventions")]

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/981ms2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:981ms2.png)

Example of lexical conventions. In the expression of acceleration due to gravity, a space separates the value and the units, both the 'm' and the 's' are lowercase because neither the metre nor the second are named after people, and exponentiation is represented with a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript") '2'.

According to the SI Brochure,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 148  unit names should be treated as [common nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_noun "Common noun") of the context language. This means that they should be typeset in the same character set as other common nouns (e.g. [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") in English, [Cyrillic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script "Cyrillic script") in Russian, etc.), following the usual grammatical and [orthographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") rules of the context language. For example, in English and French, even when the unit is named after a person and its symbol begins with a capital letter, the unit name in running text should start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal) and is [capitalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalised "Capitalised") only at the beginning of a sentence and in [headings and publication titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_capitalization "Title capitalization"). As a nontrivial application of this rule, the SI Brochure notes[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 148  that the name of the unit with the symbol °C is correctly spelled as 'degree [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius")': the first letter of the name of the unit, 'd', is in lowercase, while the modifier 'Celsius' is capitalised because it is a proper name.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 148

The English spelling and even names for certain SI units, prefixes and non-SI units depend on the variety of English used. [US English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_English "US English") uses the spelling _deka-_, _meter_, and _liter_, and [International English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_English "International English") uses _deca-_, _metre_, and _litre_. The name of the unit whose symbol is t and which is defined by 1 t = 10 3 kg is 'metric ton' in US English and 'tonne' in International English.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9): iii

### Unit symbols and the values of quantities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Unit symbols and the values of quantities")]

Symbols of SI units are intended to be unique and universal, independent of the context language.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 130–135  The SI Brochure has specific rules for writing them.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 130–135

In addition, the SI Brochure provides style conventions for among other aspects of displaying quantities units: the quantity symbols, formatting of numbers and the decimal marker, expressing measurement uncertainty, multiplication and division of quantity symbols, and the use of pure numbers and various angles.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 147

In the United States, the guideline produced by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST811-17): 37  clarifies language-specific details for American English that were left unclear by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NISTInterprepation-21) For example, since 1979, the [litre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre "Litre") may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase"L" or a lowercase"l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter"l" to the numeral"1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. NIST recommends that within the United States, "L" be used rather than"l".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST811-17)

Realisation of units
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Realisation of units")]

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Silicon_sphere_for_Avogadro_project.jpg/250px-Silicon_sphere_for_Avogadro_project.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Silicon_sphere_for_Avogadro_project.jpg)

Silicon sphere for the [Avogadro project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_project "Avogadro project") used for measuring the Avogadro constant to a relative [standard uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_uncertainty "Standard uncertainty") of 2×10−8 or less, held by [Achim Leistner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achim_Leistner "Achim Leistner")[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-22)

Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation. The SI units are defined by declaring that seven _defining constants_[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 125–129  have certain exact numerical values when expressed in terms of their SI units. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 135

For each base unit the BIPM publishes a _mises en pratique_, ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") for 'putting into practice; implementation',[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST_mise_en_pratique-23)) describing the current best practical realisations of the unit.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-MisesEnPratique-24) The separation of the defining constants from the definitions of units means that improved measurements can be developed leading to changes in the _mises en pratique_ as science and technology develop, without having to revise the definitions.

The published _mise en pratique_ is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 111  Various consultative committees of the [CIPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIPM "CIPM") decided in 2016 that more than one _mise en pratique_ would be developed for determining the value of each unit.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-25) These methods include the following:

*   At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative [standard uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_uncertainty "Standard uncertainty") in the determination of the [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") of no more than 5×10−8 and at least one of these values should be better than 2×10−8. Both the [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance "Kibble balance") and the [Avogadro project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_project "Avogadro project") should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-26)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-27)
*   The definition of the [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") measured with a relative uncertainty of the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant") derived from two fundamentally different methods such as acoustic gas [thermometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometry "Thermometry") and dielectric constant gas thermometry be better than one part in 10−6 and that these values be corroborated by other measurements.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-28)

Organisational status

Countries using the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system") (SI), [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units "Imperial units"), and [US customary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_customary "US customary") systems as of 2019

The International System of Units, or SI,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 123 is a [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal") and [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system")[system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units "System of units") established in 1960 and periodically updated since then. The SI has an [official status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication "Metrication") in most countries, including [the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States "Metrication in the United States"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_Canada "Metrication in Canada"), and [the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom "Metrication in the United Kingdom"), although these three countries are among the handful of nations that, to various degrees, also continue to use their customary systems. Nevertheless, with this nearly universal level of acceptance, the SI "has been used around the world as the preferred system of units, the basic language for science, technology, industry, and trade."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 123, 126

The only other types of measurement system that still have widespread use across the world are the [imperial and US customary measurement systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems "Imperial and US customary measurement systems"). The [international yard and pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_yard_and_pound "International yard and pound") are defined in terms of the SI.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-Standards1959-29)

### International System of Quantities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: International System of Quantities")]

The quantities and equations that provide the context in which the SI units are defined are now referred to as the _[International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_System\_of\_Quantities "International System of Quantities")_ (ISQ). The ISQ is based on the [quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity#Quantity_in_physical_science "Quantity") underlying each of the [seven base units of the SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_units "SI base units"). Other quantities, such as [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), and [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance"), are derived from these base quantities by clear, non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-30) The ISQ is formalised, in part, in the international standard [ISO/IEC 80000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000 "ISO/IEC 80000"), which was completed in 2009 with the publication of [ISO 80000-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_80000-1 "ISO 80000-1"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-31) and has largely been revised in 2019–2020.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-32)

### Controlling authority

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Controlling authority")]

The SI is regulated and continually developed by three international organisations that were established in 1875 under the terms of the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention"). They are the [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") (CGPM[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-French_CGPM-33)),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-FR_Interpretation_of_the_SI-34) the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-French_CIPM-35)), and the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-BIPM_from_French-36)). All the decisions and recommendations concerning units are collected in a brochure called _The International System of Units (SI)_,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1) which is published in French and English by the BIPM and periodically updated. The writing and maintenance of the brochure is carried out by one of the committees of the CIPM. The definitions of the terms "quantity", "unit", "dimension", etc. that are used in the _SI Brochure_ are those given in the [international vocabulary of metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_vocabulary_of_metrology "International vocabulary of metrology").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-37) The brochure leaves some scope for local variations, particularly regarding unit names and terms in different languages. For example, the United States' [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330), which clarifies usage for English-language publications that use [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9)

### CGS and MKS systems

The concept of a system of units emerged a hundred years before the SI. In the 1860s, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") (later Lord Kelvin), and others working under the auspices of the [British Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "British Association for the Advancement of Science"), building on previous work of [Carl Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gauss "Carl Gauss"), developed the [centimetre–gram–second system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units "Centimetre–gram–second system of units") or cgs system in 1874. The systems formalised the concept of a collection of related units called a _coherent_ system of units. In a coherent system, _base units_ combine to define _derived units_ without extra factors.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9): 2  For example, using metre per second is coherent in a system that uses metre for length and second for time, but kilometre per hour is not coherent. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the CGS, including the [erg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg "Erg") for [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), the [dyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyne "Dyne") for [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), the [barye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barye "Barye") for [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), the [poise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poise_(unit) "Poise (unit)") for [dynamic viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_viscosity "Dynamic viscosity") and the [stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_(unit) "Stokes (unit)") for [kinematic viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_viscosity "Kinematic viscosity").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-BIPMCentenary-39)

A French-inspired initiative for international cooperation in [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology "Metrology") led to the signing in 1875 of the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention"), also called Treaty of the Metre, by 17 nations.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-40)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-Alder-41): 353–354  The [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") (French: _Conférence générale des poids et mesures_ – CGPM), which was established by the Metre Convention,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-BIPMCentenary-39) brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-Giunta-42): 37 [[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-43) Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram. This became the foundation of the MKS system of units.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9): 2

### Giovanni Giorgi and the problem of electrical units

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Giovanni Giorgi and the problem of electrical units")]

At the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements: a [CGS-based system for electrostatic units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS-based_system_for_electrostatic_units "CGS-based system for electrostatic units"), also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a [CGS-based system for electromechanical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS-based_system_for_electromechanical_units "CGS-based system for electromechanical units") (EMU), and an International system based on units defined by the Metre Convention[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-44) for electrical distribution systems. Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time using [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") was beset with difficulties – the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-Maxwell2-45) This anomaly was resolved in 1901 when [Giovanni Giorgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Giorgi "Giovanni Giorgi") published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"), [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage"), or [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-IECGiorgi-46)

Electric current with named unit 'ampere' was chosen as the base unit, and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics. When combined with the MKS the new system, known as MKSA, was approved in 1946.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9)

### 9th CGPM, the precursor to SI

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: 9th CGPM, the precursor to SI")]

In 1948, the 9th CGPM commissioned a study to assess the measurement needs of the scientific, technical, and educational communities and "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention".[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-47) This working document was _Practical system of units of measurement_. Based on this study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 defined an international system derived six base units: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.

The 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-48) These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used, and how the values of quantities should be expressed.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 104, 130

The 10th CGPM in 1954 resolved to create an international system of units[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-Giunta-42): 41  and in 1960, the 11th CGPM adopted the _International System of Units_, abbreviated SI from the French name _Le Système international d'unités_, which included a specification for units of measurement.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 110

The [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM) has described SI as "the modern form of metric system".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16): 95  In 1971 the [mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)") became the seventh base unit of the SI.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NIST330-9): 2

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg/250px-Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Unit_relations_in_the_new_SI.svg)

Reverse dependencies of the SI base units on seven [physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant "Physical constant"), which are assigned exact numerical values in the [2019 redefinition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI"). Unlike in the previous definitions, the base units are all derived exclusively from constants of nature. Here, ![Image 25: {\displaystyle a\rightarrow b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/390afdb0d8e933dbc4eee8022d8c91b2015f0522) means that ![Image 26: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) is used to define ![Image 27: {\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3).

After the [metre was redefined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre "History of the metre") in 1960, the [International Prototype of the Kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram "International Prototype of the Kilogram") (IPK) was the only physical artefact upon which base units (directly the kilogram and indirectly the ampere, mole and candela) depended for their definition, making these units subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-NPL_kg-49) During the 2nd and 3rd Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram, a significant divergence had occurred between the mass of the IPK and all of its official copies stored around the world: the copies had all noticeably increased in mass with respect to the IPK. During _extraordinary verifications_ carried out in 2014 preparatory to redefinition of metric standards, continuing divergence was not confirmed. Nonetheless, the residual and irreducible instability of a physical IPK undermined the reliability of the entire metric system to precision measurement from small (atomic) to large (astrophysical) scales.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-50) By avoiding the use of an artefact to define units, all issues with the loss, damage, and change of the artefact are avoided.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 125

A proposal was made that:[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-51)

*   In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature – the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), an [elementary charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge "Elementary charge"), the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"), and the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant "Avogadro constant") – be defined to have exact values
*   The [International Prototype of the Kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram "International Prototype of the Kilogram") be retired
*   The current definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole be revised
*   The wording of base unit definitions should change emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions.

The new definitions were adopted at the 26th CGPM on 16 November 2018, and came into effect on 20 May 2019.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-52) The change was adopted by the European Union through Directive (EU) 2019/1258.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-53)

Prior to its redefinition in 2019, the SI was defined through the seven base units from which the derived units were constructed as products of powers of the base units. After the redefinition, the SI is defined by fixing the numerical values of seven defining constants. This has the effect that the distinction between the base units and derived units is, in principle, not needed, since all units, base as well as derived, may be constructed directly from the defining constants. Nevertheless, the distinction is retained because "it is useful and historically well established", and also because the [ISO/IEC 80000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000 "ISO/IEC 80000") series of standards, which define the [International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities "International System of Quantities") (ISQ), specifies base and derived quantities that necessarily have the corresponding SI units.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-1): 129

### Non-SI units accepted for use with SI

While not an SI-unit, the litre may be used with SI units. It is equivalent to (10 cm)3 = (1 dm)3 = 10−3 m 3.

Many non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature. Some units are deeply embedded in history and culture, and their use has not been entirely replaced by their SI alternatives. The CIPM recognised and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of non-SI units accepted for use with SI,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16) including the hour, minute, degree of angle, litre, and decibel.

This is a list of units that are not defined as part of the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) ([SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI")) but are otherwise mentioned in the SI Brochure,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-bipm-54) listed as being accepted for use alongside SI units, or for explanatory purposes.

The SI prefixes can be used with several of these units, but not, for example, with the non-SI units of time. Others, in order to be converted to the corresponding SI unit, require conversion factors that are not powers of ten. Some common examples of such units are the customary units of time, namely the minute (conversion factor of 60 s/min, since 1 min = 60 s), the hour (3600 s), and the day (86 400 s); the degree (for measuring plane angles, 1° = (π /180)rad); and the [electronvolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt") (a unit of energy, 1 eV = 1.602 176 634×10−19 J).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-bipm-54)

### Metric units not recognised by SI

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_System_of_Units&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Metric units not recognised by SI")]

Although the term _metric system_ is often used as an informal alternative name for the International System of Units,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-MetricSystemAsNameForSI-58) other metric systems exist, some of which were in widespread use in the past or are even still used in particular areas. There are also individual [metric units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_units "Metric units") such as the [sverdrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdrup "Sverdrup") and the [darcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_(unit) "Darcy (unit)") that exist outside of any system of units. Most of the units of the other metric systems are not recognised by the SI.

Sometimes, SI unit name variations are introduced, mixing information about the corresponding physical quantity or the conditions of its measurement; however, this practice is unacceptable with the SI. "Unacceptability of mixing information with units: When one gives the value of a quantity, any information concerning the quantity or its conditions of measurement must be presented in such a way as not to be associated with the unit."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#cite_note-SIBrochure-16) Instances include: "[watt-peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt-peak "Watt-peak")" and "[watt RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_RMS "Watt RMS")"; "[geopotential metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopotential_metre "Geopotential metre")" and "[vertical metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_metre "Vertical metre")"; "[standard cubic metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_cubic_metre "Standard cubic metre")"; "[atomic second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_second "Atomic second")", "[ephemeris second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_second "Ephemeris second")", and "[sidereal second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_second "Sidereal second")".
