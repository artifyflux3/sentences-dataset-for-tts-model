It states: If U {\displaystyle U} is an open subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and f : U → → R n {\displaystyle f:U\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is an injective continuous map , then V := f ( U ) {\displaystyle V:=f(U)} is open in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and f {\displaystyle f} is a homeomorphism between U {\displaystyle U} and V {\displaystyle V} .

The theorem and its proof are due to L. E. J. Brouwer , published in 1912.

[ 1 ] The proof uses tools of algebraic topology , notably the Brouwer fixed point theorem .

Notes [ edit ] The conclusion of the theorem can equivalently be formulated as: " f {\displaystyle f} is an open map ".

Normally, to check that f {\displaystyle f} is a homeomorphism, one would have to verify that both f {\displaystyle f} and its inverse function f − − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} are continuous; 
the theorem says that if the domain is an open subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and the image is also in R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} then continuity of f − − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} is automatic. 
Furthermore, the theorem says that if two subsets U {\displaystyle U} and V {\displaystyle V} of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} are homeomorphic, and U {\displaystyle U} is open, then V {\displaystyle V} must be open as well. 
(Note that V {\displaystyle V} is open as a subset of R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} and not just in the subspace topology. 
Openness of V {\displaystyle V} in the subspace topology is automatic.) 
Both of these statements are not at all obvious and are not generally true if one leaves Euclidean space.

An injective map which is not a homeomorphism onto its image: g : ( − − 1.1 , 1 ) → → R 2 {\displaystyle g:(-1.1,1)\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} with g ( t ) = ( t 2 − − 1 , t 3 − − t ) .

{\displaystyle g(t)=\left(t^{2}-1,t^{3}-t\right).} It is of crucial importance that both domain and image of f {\displaystyle f} are contained in Euclidean space of the same dimension . 
Consider for instance the map f : ( 0 , 1 ) → → R 2 {\displaystyle f:(0,1)\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} defined by f ( t ) = ( t , 0 ) .

{\displaystyle f(t)=(t,0).} This map is injective and continuous, the domain is an open subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , but the image is not open in R 2 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.} A more extreme example is the map g : ( − − 1.1 , 1 ) → → R 2 {\displaystyle g:(-1.1,1)\to \mathbb {R} ^{2}} defined by g ( t ) = ( t 2 − − 1 , t 3 − − t ) {\displaystyle g(t)=\left(t^{2}-1,t^{3}-t\right)} because here g {\displaystyle g} is injective and continuous but does not even yield a homeomorphism onto its image.

The theorem is also not generally true in infinitely many dimensions. Consider for instance the Banach L p space ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} of all bounded real sequences . 
Define f : ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ → → ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle f:\ell ^{\infty }\to \ell ^{\infty }} as the shift f ( x 1 , x 2 , … … ) = ( 0 , x 1 , x 2 , … … ) .

{\displaystyle f\left(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots \right)=\left(0,x_{1},x_{2},\ldots \right).} Then f {\displaystyle f} is injective and continuous, the domain is open in ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} , but the image is not.

Consequences [ edit ] If n > m {\displaystyle n>m} , there exists no continuous injective map f : U → → R m {\displaystyle f:U\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} for a nonempty open set U ⊆ ⊆ R n {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . To see this, suppose there exists such a map f .

{\displaystyle f.} Composing f {\displaystyle f} with the standard inclusion of R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} into R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} would give a continuous injection from R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} to itself, but with an image with empty interior in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .  This would contradict invariance of domain.

In particular, if n ≠ ≠ m {\displaystyle n\neq m} , no nonempty open subset of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} can be homeomorphic to an open subset of R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} .

And R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is not homeomorphic to R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} if n ≠ ≠ m .

{\displaystyle n\neq m.} Generalizations [ edit ] The domain invariance theorem may be generalized to manifolds : if M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} are topological n -manifolds without boundary and f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\to N} is a continuous map which is locally one-to-one (meaning that every point in M {\displaystyle M} has a neighborhood such that f {\displaystyle f} restricted to this neighborhood is injective), then f {\displaystyle f} is an open map (meaning that f ( U ) {\displaystyle f(U)} is open in N {\displaystyle N} whenever U {\displaystyle U} is an open subset of M {\displaystyle M} ) and a local homeomorphism .

There are also generalizations to certain types of continuous maps from a Banach space to itself.
