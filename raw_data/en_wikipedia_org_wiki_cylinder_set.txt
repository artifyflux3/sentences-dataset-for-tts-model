General definition [ edit ] Given a collection S {\displaystyle S} of sets, consider the Cartesian product X = ∏ ∏ Y ∈ ∈ S Y {\textstyle X=\prod _{Y\in S}Y} of all sets in the collection. The canonical projection corresponding to some Y ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle Y\in S} is the function p Y : X → → Y {\displaystyle p_{Y}:X\to Y} that maps every element of the product to its Y {\displaystyle Y} component. A cylinder set is a preimage of a canonical projection or finite intersection of such preimages. Explicitly, it is a set of the form, ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 n p Y i − − 1 ( A i ) = { ( x ) ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ p Y 1 ( x ) ∈ ∈ A 1 , … … , p Y n ( x ) ∈ ∈ A n } {\displaystyle \bigcap _{i=1}^{n}p_{Y_{i}}^{-1}\left(A_{i}\right)=\left\{\left(x\right)\in X\mid p_{Y_{1}}(x)\in A_{1},\dots ,p_{Y_{n}}(x)\in A_{n}\right\}} for any choice of n {\displaystyle n} , finite sequence of sets Y 1 , .

Y n ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle Y_{1},...Y_{n}\in S} and subsets A i ⊆ ⊆ Y i {\displaystyle A_{i}\subseteq Y_{i}} for 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq n} .

Then, when all sets in S {\displaystyle S} are topological spaces , the product topology is generated by cylinder sets corresponding to the components' open sets. That is cylinders of the form ⋂ ⋂ i = 1 n p Y i − − 1 ( U i ) {\textstyle \bigcap _{i=1}^{n}p_{Y_{i}}^{-1}\left(U_{i}\right)} where for each i {\displaystyle i} , U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} is open in Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} . In the same manner, in case of measurable spaces, the cylinder σ-algebra is the one which is generated by cylinder sets corresponding to the components' measurable sets.

The restriction that the cylinder set be the intersection of a finite number of open cylinders is important; allowing infinite intersections generally results in a finer topology. In the latter case, the resulting topology is the box topology ; cylinder sets are never Hilbert cubes .

Cylinder sets in products of discrete sets [ edit ] Let S = { 1 , 2 , … … , n } {\displaystyle S=\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} be a finite set, containing n objects or letters . The collection of all bi-infinite strings in these letters is denoted by S Z = { x = ( … … , x − − 1 , x 0 , x 1 , … … ) : x k ∈ ∈ S ∀ ∀ k ∈ ∈ Z } .

{\displaystyle S^{\mathbb {Z} }=\{x=(\ldots ,x_{-1},x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ):x_{k}\in S\;\forall k\in \mathbb {Z} \}.} The natural topology on S {\displaystyle S} is the discrete topology . Basic open sets in the discrete topology consist of individual letters; thus, the open cylinders of the product topology on S Z {\displaystyle S^{\mathbb {Z} }} are C t [ a ] = { x ∈ ∈ S Z : x t = a } .

{\displaystyle C_{t}[a]=\{x\in S^{\mathbb {Z} }:x_{t}=a\}.} The intersections of a finite number of open cylinders are the cylinder sets C t [ a 0 , … … , a m ] = C t [ a 0 ] ∩ ∩ C t + 1 [ a 1 ] ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ ∩ ∩ C t + m [ a m ] = { x ∈ ∈ S Z : x t = a 0 , … … , x t + m = a m } .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}C_{t}[a_{0},\ldots ,a_{m}]&=C_{t}[a_{0}]\,\cap \,C_{t+1}[a_{1}]\,\cap \cdots \cap \,C_{t+m}[a_{m}]\\&=\{x\in S^{\mathbb {Z} }:x_{t}=a_{0},\ldots ,x_{t+m}=a_{m}\}\end{aligned}}.} Cylinder sets are clopen sets . As elements of the topology, cylinder sets are by definition open sets. The complement of an open set is a closed set, but the complement of a cylinder set is a union of cylinders, and so cylinder sets are also closed, and are thus clopen.

Definition for vector spaces [ edit ] Given a finite or infinite- dimensional vector space V {\displaystyle V} over a field K (such as the real or complex numbers ), the cylinder sets may be defined as C A [ f 1 , … … , f n ] = { x ∈ ∈ V : ( f 1 ( x ) , f 2 ( x ) , … … , f n ( x ) ) ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle C_{A}[f_{1},\ldots ,f_{n}]=\{x\in V:(f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\ldots ,f_{n}(x))\in A\}} where A ⊂ ⊂ K n {\displaystyle A\subset K^{n}} is a Borel set in K n {\displaystyle K^{n}} , and each f j {\displaystyle f_{j}} is a linear functional on V {\displaystyle V} ; that is, f j ∈ ∈ ( V ∗ ∗ ) ⊗ ⊗ n {\displaystyle f_{j}\in (V^{*})^{\otimes n}} , the algebraic dual space to V {\displaystyle V} . When dealing with topological vector spaces , the definition is made instead for elements f j ∈ ∈ ( V ′ ) ⊗ ⊗ n {\displaystyle f_{j}\in (V')^{\otimes n}} , the continuous dual space . That is, the functionals f j {\displaystyle f_{j}} are taken to be continuous linear functionals.

Applications [ edit ] Cylinder sets are often used to define a topology on sets that are subsets of S Z {\displaystyle S^{\mathbb {Z} }} and occur frequently in the study of symbolic dynamics ; see, for example, subshift of finite type . Cylinder sets are often used to define a measure , using the Kolmogorov extension theorem ; for example, the measure of a cylinder set of length m might be given by 1/ m or by 1/2 m .

Cylinder sets may be used to define a metric on the space: for example, one says that two strings are ε-close if a fraction 1−ε of the letters in the strings match.

Since strings in S Z {\displaystyle S^{\mathbb {Z} }} can be considered to be p -adic numbers , some of the theory of p -adic numbers can be applied to cylinder sets, and in particular, the definition of p -adic measures and p -adic metrics apply to cylinder sets. These types of measure spaces appear in the theory of dynamical systems and are called nonsingular odometers . A generalization of these systems is the Markov odometer .

Cylinder sets over topological vector spaces are the core ingredient in the [ citation needed ] definition of abstract Wiener spaces , which provide the formal definition of the Feynman path integral or functional integral of quantum field theory , and the partition function of statistical mechanics .
