Broadly speaking a singular integral is an integral operator T ( f ) ( x ) = ∫ ∫ K ( x , y ) f ( y ) d y , {\displaystyle T(f)(x)=\int K(x,y)f(y)\,dy,} whose kernel function K : R n × R n → R is singular along the diagonal x = y .  Specifically, the singularity is such that | K ( x , y )| is of size | x − y | − n asymptotically as | x − y | → 0. Since such integrals may not in general be absolutely integrable, a rigorous definition must define them as the limit of the integral over | y − x | > ε as ε → 0, but in practice this is a technicality. Usually further assumptions are required to obtain results such as their boundedness on L p ( R n ).

The Hilbert transform [ edit ] Main article: Hilbert transform The archetypal singular integral operator is the Hilbert transform H . It is given by convolution against the kernel K ( x ) = 1/(π x ) for x in R . More precisely, H ( f ) ( x ) = 1 π π lim ε ε → → 0 ∫ ∫ | x − − y | > ε ε 1 x − − y f ( y ) d y .

{\displaystyle H(f)(x)={\frac {1}{\pi }}\lim _{\varepsilon \to 0}\int _{|x-y|>\varepsilon }{\frac {1}{x-y}}f(y)\,dy.} The most straightforward higher dimension analogues of these are the Riesz transforms , which replace K ( x ) = 1/ x with K i ( x ) = x i | x | n + 1 {\displaystyle K_{i}(x)={\frac {x_{i}}{|x|^{n+1}}}} where i = 1, ..., n and x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} is the i -th component of x in R n . All of these operators are bounded on L p and satisfy weak-type (1, 1) estimates.

[ 1 ] Singular integrals of convolution type [ edit ] Main article: Singular integral operators of convolution type A singular integral of convolution type is an operator T defined by convolution with a kernel K that is locally integrable on R n \{0}, in the sense that T ( f ) ( x ) = lim ε ε → → 0 ∫ ∫ | y − − x | > ε ε K ( x − − y ) f ( y ) d y .

{\displaystyle T(f)(x)=\lim _{\varepsilon \to 0}\int _{|y-x|>\varepsilon }K(x-y)f(y)\,dy.} 1 Suppose that the kernel satisfies: The size condition on the Fourier transform of K K ^ ^ ∈ ∈ L ∞ ∞ ( R n ) {\displaystyle {\hat {K}}\in L^{\infty }(\mathbf {R} ^{n})} The smoothness condition: for some C > 0, sup y ≠ ≠ 0 ∫ ∫ | x | > 2 | y | | K ( x − − y ) − − K ( x ) | d x ≤ ≤ C .

{\displaystyle \sup _{y\neq 0}\int _{|x|>2|y|}|K(x-y)-K(x)|\,dx\leq C.} Then it can be shown that T is bounded on L p ( R n ) and satisfies a weak-type (1, 1) estimate.

K [ ϕ ϕ ] = lim ϵ ϵ → → 0 + ∫ ∫ | x | > ϵ ϵ ϕ ϕ ( x ) K ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \operatorname {p.v.} \,\,K[\phi ]=\lim _{\epsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{|x|>\epsilon }\phi (x)K(x)\,dx} is a well-defined Fourier multiplier on L 2 . Neither of the properties 1. or 2. is necessarily easy to verify, and a variety of sufficient conditions exist.  Typically in applications, one also has a cancellation condition ∫ ∫ R 1 < | x | < R 2 K ( x ) d x = 0 , ∀ ∀ R 1 , R 2 > 0 {\displaystyle \int _{R_{1}<|x|<R_{2}}K(x)\,dx=0,\ \forall R_{1},R_{2}>0} which is quite easy to check.  It is automatic, for instance, if K is an odd function .  If, in addition, one assumes 2. and the following size condition sup R > 0 ∫ ∫ R < | x | < 2 R | K ( x ) | d x ≤ ≤ C , {\displaystyle \sup _{R>0}\int _{R<|x|<2R}|K(x)|\,dx\leq C,} then it can be shown that 1. follows.

The smoothness condition 2. is also often difficult to check in principle, the following sufficient condition of a kernel K can be used: K ∈ ∈ C 1 ( R n ∖ ∖ { 0 } ) {\displaystyle K\in C^{1}(\mathbf {R} ^{n}\setminus \{0\})} | ∇ ∇ K ( x ) | ≤ ≤ C | x | n + 1 {\displaystyle |\nabla K(x)|\leq {\frac {C}{|x|^{n+1}}}} Observe that these conditions are satisfied for the Hilbert and Riesz transforms, so this result is an extension of those result.

[ 2 ] Singular integrals of non-convolution type [ edit ] These are even more general operators. However, since our assumptions are so weak, it is not necessarily the case that these operators are bounded on L p .

Calderón–Zygmund kernels [ edit ] A function K : R n × R n → R is said to be a Calderón – Zygmund kernel if it satisfies the following conditions for some constants C > 0 and δ > 0.

[ 2 ] | K ( x , y ) | ≤ ≤ C | x − − y | n {\displaystyle |K(x,y)|\leq {\frac {C}{|x-y|^{n}}}} | K ( x , y ) − − K ( x ′ , y ) | ≤ ≤ C | x − − x ′ | δ δ ( | x − − y | + | x ′ − − y | ) n + δ δ whenever | x − − x ′ | ≤ ≤ 1 2 max ( | x − − y | , | x ′ − − y | ) {\displaystyle |K(x,y)-K(x',y)|\leq {\frac {C|x-x'|^{\delta }}{{\bigl (}|x-y|+|x'-y|{\bigr )}^{n+\delta }}}{\text{ whenever }}|x-x'|\leq {\frac {1}{2}}\max {\bigl (}|x-y|,|x'-y|{\bigr )}} | K ( x , y ) − − K ( x , y ′ ) | ≤ ≤ C | y − − y ′ | δ δ ( | x − − y | + | x − − y ′ | ) n + δ δ whenever | y − − y ′ | ≤ ≤ 1 2 max ( | x − − y ′ | , | x − − y | ) {\displaystyle |K(x,y)-K(x,y')|\leq {\frac {C|y-y'|^{\delta }}{{\bigl (}|x-y|+|x-y'|{\bigr )}^{n+\delta }}}{\text{ whenever }}|y-y'|\leq {\frac {1}{2}}\max {\bigl (}|x-y'|,|x-y|{\bigr )}} Singular integrals of non-convolution type [ edit ] T is said to be a singular integral operator of non-convolution type associated to the Calderón–Zygmund kernel K if ∫ ∫ g ( x ) T ( f ) ( x ) d x = ∬ ∬ g ( x ) K ( x , y ) f ( y ) d y d x , {\displaystyle \int g(x)T(f)(x)\,dx=\iint g(x)K(x,y)f(y)\,dy\,dx,} whenever f and g are smooth and have disjoint support.

[ 2 ] Such operators need not be bounded on L p Calderón–Zygmund operators [ edit ] A singular integral of non-convolution type T associated to a Calderón–Zygmund kernel K is called a Calderón–Zygmund operator when it is bounded on L 2 , that is, there is a C > 0 such that ‖ ‖ T ( f ) ‖ ‖ L 2 ≤ ≤ C ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ L 2 , {\displaystyle \|T(f)\|_{L^{2}}\leq C\|f\|_{L^{2}},} for all smooth compactly supported ƒ.

It can be proved that such operators are, in fact, also bounded on all L p with 1 < p < ∞.

The T ( b ) theorem [ edit ] The T ( b ) theorem provides sufficient conditions for a singular integral operator to be a Calderón–Zygmund operator, that is for a singular integral operator associated to a Calderón–Zygmund kernel to be bounded on L 2 . In order to state the result we must first define some terms.

A normalised bump is a smooth function φ on R n supported in a ball of radius 1 and centred at the origin such that | ∂ α φ ( x )| ≤ 1, for all multi-indices | α | ≤ n + 2. Denote by τ x ( φ )( y ) = φ ( y − x ) and φ r ( x ) = r − n φ ( x / r ) for all x in R n and r > 0. An operator is said to be weakly bounded if there is a constant C such that | ∫ ∫ T ( τ τ x ( φ φ r ) ) ( y ) τ τ x ( ψ ψ r ) ( y ) d y | ≤ ≤ C r − − n {\displaystyle \left|\int T{\bigl (}\tau ^{x}(\varphi _{r}){\bigr )}(y)\tau ^{x}(\psi _{r})(y)\,dy\right|\leq Cr^{-n}} for all normalised bumps φ and ψ . A function is said to be accretive if there is a constant c > 0 such that Re( b )( x ) ≥ c for all x in R . Denote by M b the operator given by multiplication by a function b .

The T ( b ) theorem states that a singular integral operator T associated to a Calderón–Zygmund kernel is bounded on L 2 if it satisfies all of the following three conditions for some bounded accretive functions b 1 and b 2 : [ 3 ] M b 2 T M b 1 {\displaystyle M_{b_{2}}TM_{b_{1}}} is weakly bounded; T ( b 1 ) {\displaystyle T(b_{1})} is in BMO ; T t ( b 2 ) , {\displaystyle T^{t}(b_{2}),} is in BMO , where T t is the transpose operator of T .
