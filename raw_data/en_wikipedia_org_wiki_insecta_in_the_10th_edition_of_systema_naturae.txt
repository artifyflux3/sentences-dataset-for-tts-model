He described the Insecta as: [ 1 ] A very numerous and various class consisting of small animals, breathing through lateral spiracles, armed on all sides with a bony skin, or covered with hair; furnished with many feet, and moveable antennae (or horns), which project from the head, and are the probable instruments of sensation.

Linnaean Characteristics [ 1 ] Heart : 1 auricle, 0 ventricles. Cold, pus-like blood.

Spiracles : lateral pores Jaw : lateral Penis : penetrates Organs of Sense : tongue, eyes, antennae on head, no brain, no ears, no nostrils Covering : a bony coat of mail Supports : feet, and in some, wings. Skips on dry ground and buzzes Orders [ edit ] Scarabaeus hercules (now Dynastes hercules ) was the first species in Linnaeus' class "Insecta".

Linnaeus divided the class Insecta into seven orders, based chiefly on the form of the wings . He also provided a key to the orders: [ 2 ] 4 wings pairs dissimilar forewings fully hardened: Coleoptera forewings partly hardened: Hemiptera pairs similar wings covered with flat scales: Lepidoptera wings membranous Tail unarmed: Neuroptera Tail bearing a sting: Hymenoptera 2 wings: Diptera 0 wings: Aptera Despite this key, however, Linnaeus grouped insects together that shared other affinities. His genus Coccus , containing the scale insects , he placed among the 4-winged Hemiptera, along with aphids and other plant-attacking insects, even though females have no wings, and males have two wings.

[ 2 ] Similarly, the sheep ked Hippobosca ovina (now Melophagus ovinus ) was correctly placed among the Diptera, despite being wingless.
