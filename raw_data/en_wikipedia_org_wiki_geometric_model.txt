The shapes studied in geometric modeling are mostly two- or three- dimensional ( solid figures ), although many of its tools and principles can be applied to sets of any finite dimension.  Today most geometric modeling is done with computers and for computer-based applications.

Two-dimensional models are important in computer typography and technical drawing .

Three-dimensional models are central to computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and widely used in many applied technical fields such as civil and mechanical engineering , architecture , geology and medical image processing .

[ 1 ] Geometric models are usually distinguished from procedural and object-oriented models , which define the shape implicitly by an opaque algorithm that generates its appearance.

[ citation needed ] They are also contrasted with digital images and volumetric models which represent the shape as a subset of a fine regular partition of space; and with fractal models that give an infinitely recursive definition of the shape.   However, these distinctions are often blurred: for instance, a digital image can be interpreted as a collection of colored squares ; and geometric shapes such as circles are defined by implicit mathematical equations.  Also, a fractal model yields a parametric or implicit model when its recursive definition is truncated to a finite depth.

Notable awards of the area are the John A. Gregory Memorial Award [ 2 ] and the Bézier award.
