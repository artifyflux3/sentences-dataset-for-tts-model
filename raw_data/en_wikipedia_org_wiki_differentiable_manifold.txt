A nondifferentiable atlas of charts for the globe. The results of calculus may not be compatible between charts if the atlas is not differentiable. In the center and right charts, the [Tropic of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer "Tropic of Cancer") is a smooth curve, whereas in the left chart it has a sharp corner. The notion of a differentiable manifold refines that of a manifold by requiring the functions that transform between charts to be differentiable.

In mathematics, a **differentiable manifold** (also **differential manifold**) is a type of [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") that is locally similar enough to a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") to allow one to apply [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). Any [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") can be described by a collection of charts ([atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)")). One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a vector space to which the usual rules of calculus apply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function")), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart.

In formal terms, a **differentiable manifold** is a [topological manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold") with a globally defined [differential structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure "Differential structure"). Any topological manifold can be given a differential structure locally by using the [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") in its atlas and the standard differential structure on a vector space. To induce a global differential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the homeomorphisms, their [compositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") on chart intersections in the atlas must be differentiable functions on the corresponding vector space. In other words, where the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are required to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every chart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various charts to one another are called _[transition maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition\_map "Transition map")._

The ability to define such a local differential structure on an abstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to spaces without global coordinate systems. A locally differential structure allows one to define the globally differentiable [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"), differentiable functions, and differentiable [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") and [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") fields.

Differentiable manifolds are very important in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). Special kinds of differentiable manifolds form the basis for physical theories such as [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), and [Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory"). It is possible to develop a calculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical machinery as the [exterior calculus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") The study of calculus on differentiable manifolds is known as [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry").

"Differentiability" of a manifold has been given several meanings, including: [continuously differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_differentiable "Continuously differentiable"), _k_-times differentiable, [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") (which itself has many meanings), and [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function").

The emergence of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") as a distinct discipline is generally credited to [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") and [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"). Riemann first described manifolds in his famous [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation "Habilitation") lecture before the faculty at [Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-1) He motivated the idea of a manifold by an intuitive process of varying a given object in a new direction, and presciently described the role of coordinate systems and charts in subsequent formal developments:

_Having constructed the notion of a manifoldness of n dimensions, and found that its true character consists in the property that the determination of position in it may be reduced to n determinations of magnitude, ..._ – B. Riemann
The works of physicists such as [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-2) and mathematicians [Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro "Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro") and [Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-3) led to the development of [tensor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_analysis "Tensor analysis") and the notion of [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_covariance "General covariance"), which identifies an intrinsic geometric property as one that is invariant with respect to [coordinate transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_transformation "Coordinate transformation"). These ideas found a key application in [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and its underlying [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle"). A modern definition of a 2-dimensional manifold was given by [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") in his 1913 book on [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-4) The widely accepted general definition of a manifold in terms of an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mathematics) "Atlas (mathematics)") is due to [Hassler Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassler_Whitney "Hassler Whitney").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-5)

Let M be a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"). A **chart**(_U_, _φ_) on M consists of an open subset U of M, and a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism")_φ_ from U to an open subset of some [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**_n_. Somewhat informally, one may refer to a chart _φ_: _U_ → **R**_n_, meaning that the image of φ is an open subset of **R**_n_, and that φ is a homeomorphism onto its image; in the usage of some authors, this may instead mean that _φ_: _U_ → **R**_n_ is itself a homeomorphism.

The presence of a chart suggests the possibility of doing [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus") on M; for instance, if given a function _u_: _M_ → **R** and a chart (_U_, _φ_) on M, one could consider the composition _u_ ∘ _φ_−1, which is a real-valued function whose domain is an open subset of a Euclidean space; as such, if it happens to be differentiable, one could consider its [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative").

This situation is not fully satisfactory for the following reason. Consider a second chart (_V_, _ψ_) on M, and suppose that U and V contain some points in common. The two corresponding functions _u_ ∘ _φ_−1 and _u_ ∘ _ψ_−1 are linked in the sense that they can be reparametrized into one another: ![Image 2: {\displaystyle u\circ \varphi ^{-1}={\big (}u\circ \psi ^{-1}{\big )}\circ {\big (}\psi \circ \varphi ^{-1}{\big )},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b8bdad9dff9be58fb7f0d66953aaa00fbe73f8e) the natural domain of the right-hand side being _φ_(_U_ ∩ _V_). Since φ and _ψ_ are homeomorphisms, it follows that _ψ_ ∘ _φ_−1 is a homeomorphism from _φ_(_U_ ∩ _V_) to _ψ_(_U_ ∩ _V_). Consequently it's just a bicontinuous function, thus even if both functions _u_ ∘ _φ_−1 and _u_ ∘ _ψ_−1 are differentiable, their differential properties will not necessarily be strongly linked to one another, as _ψ_ ∘ _φ_−1 is not guaranteed to be sufficiently differentiable for being able to compute the partial derivatives of the LHS applying the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule "Chain rule") to the RHS. The same problem is found if one considers instead functions _c_: **R** → _M_; one is led to the reparametrization formula ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \varphi \circ c={\big (}\varphi \circ \psi ^{-1}{\big )}\circ {\big (}\psi \circ c{\big )},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba6481344801df7c25d874aa85a627911234fe3c) at which point one can make the same observation as before.

This is resolved by the introduction of a "differentiable atlas" of charts, which specifies a collection of charts on M for which the [transition maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_map "Transition map")_ψ_ ∘ _φ_−1 are all differentiable. This makes the situation quite clean: if _u_ ∘ _φ_−1 is differentiable, then due to the first reparametrization formula listed above, the map _u_ ∘ _ψ_−1 is also differentiable on the region _ψ_(_U_ ∩ _V_), and vice versa. Moreover, the derivatives of these two maps are linked to one another by the chain rule. Relative to the given atlas, this facilitates a notion of differentiable mappings whose domain or range is M, as well as a notion of the derivative of such maps.

Formally, the word "differentiable" is somewhat ambiguous, as it is taken to mean different things by different authors; sometimes it means the existence of first derivatives, sometimes the existence of continuous first derivatives, and sometimes the existence of infinitely many derivatives. The following gives a formal definition of various (nonambiguous) meanings of "differentiable atlas". Generally, "differentiable" will be used as a catch-all term including all of these possibilities, provided _k_ ≥ 1.

Since every real-analytic map is smooth, and every smooth map is _C_ _k_ for any k, one can see that any analytic atlas can also be viewed as a smooth atlas, and every smooth atlas can be viewed as a _C_ _k_ atlas. This chain can be extended to include holomorphic atlases, with the understanding that any holomorphic map between open subsets of **C**_n_ can be viewed as a real-analytic map between open subsets of **R**2 _n_.

Given a differentiable atlas on a topological space, one says that a chart is **differentiably compatible** with the atlas, or **differentiable** relative to the given atlas, if the inclusion of the chart into the collection of charts comprising the given differentiable atlas results in a differentiable atlas. A differentiable atlas determines a **maximal differentiable atlas**, consisting of all charts which are differentiably compatible with the given atlas. A maximal atlas is always very large. For instance, given any chart in a maximal atlas, its restriction to an arbitrary open subset of its domain will also be contained in the maximal atlas. A maximal smooth atlas is also known as a [smooth structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_structure "Smooth structure"); a maximal holomorphic atlas is also known as a [complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold").

An alternative but equivalent definition, avoiding the direct use of maximal atlases, is to consider equivalence classes of differentiable atlases, in which two differentiable atlases are considered equivalent if every chart of one atlas is differentiably compatible with the other atlas. Informally, what this means is that in dealing with a smooth manifold, one can work with a single differentiable atlas, consisting of only a few charts, with the implicit understanding that many other charts and differentiable atlases are equally legitimate.

According to the [invariance of domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariance_of_domain "Invariance of domain"), each connected component of a topological space which has a differentiable atlas has a well-defined dimension n. This causes a small ambiguity in the case of a holomorphic atlas, since the corresponding dimension will be one-half of the value of its dimension when considered as an analytic, smooth, or _C_ _k_ atlas. For this reason, one refers separately to the "real" and "complex" dimension of a topological space with a holomorphic atlas.

A **differentiable manifold** is a [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") and [second countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_countable "Second countable") topological space M, together with a maximal differentiable atlas on M. Much of the basic theory can be developed without the need for the Hausdorff and second countability conditions, although they are vital for much of the advanced theory. They are essentially equivalent to the general existence of [bump functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_function "Bump function") and [partitions of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_unity "Partition of unity"), both of which are used ubiquitously.

The notion of a _C_ 0 manifold is identical to that of a [topological manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold"). However, there is a notable distinction to be made. Given a topological space, it is meaningful to ask whether or not it is a topological manifold. By contrast, it is not meaningful to ask whether or not a given topological space is (for instance) a smooth manifold, since the notion of a smooth manifold requires the specification of a smooth atlas, which is an additional structure. It could, however, be meaningful to say that a certain topological space cannot be given the structure of a smooth manifold. It is possible to reformulate the definitions so that this sort of imbalance is not present; one can start with a set M (rather than a topological space M), using the natural analogue of a smooth atlas in this setting to define the structure of a topological space on M.

### Patching together Euclidean pieces to form a manifold

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Patching together Euclidean pieces to form a manifold")]

One can reverse-engineer the above definitions to obtain one perspective on the construction of manifolds. The idea is to start with the images of the charts and the transition maps, and to construct the manifold purely from this data. As in the above discussion, we use the "smooth" context but everything works just as well in other settings.

Given an indexing set ![Image 18: {\displaystyle A,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2746026864cc5896e3e52443a1c917be2df9d8ea) let ![Image 19: {\displaystyle V_{\alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/582d40a9ff663187250948b07bb66456162c2042) be a collection of open subsets of ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) and for each ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta \in A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f9a2e5019ee66d78e0032ef67d732a91a2b2aa5) let ![Image 22: {\displaystyle V_{\alpha \beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95c4e19bfbd9d037dfd97c0c0df8e67c25c0550d) be an open (possibly empty) subset of ![Image 23: {\displaystyle V_{\beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66668ae9c071f388d25da00071eb3b1297c6ec60) and let ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \beta }:V_{\alpha \beta }\to V_{\beta \alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71c75672aa39e6d8db48351a33f5ffc15675236b) be a smooth map. Suppose that ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1c60e4200d97edd678e54eee8582620d8f12091) is the identity map, that ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \beta }\circ \phi _{\beta \alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd42f3505be9b484a7a1ae2aa95b308616784b9d) is the identity map, and that ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \beta }\circ \phi _{\beta \gamma }\circ \phi _{\gamma \alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/96dde5581d07b1faa77488f6fc6ed1ecf88e7c4b) is the identity map. Then define an equivalence relation on the disjoint union ![Image 28: {\textstyle \bigsqcup _{\alpha \in A}V_{\alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fadb5254d1968266857bbfa9216b89f0c61b69b9) by declaring ![Image 29: {\displaystyle p\in V_{\alpha \beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c8f69647c362a6c0117c31525258a8b310457b8) to be equivalent to ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha \beta }(p)\in V_{\beta \alpha }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c5910816e183dccec1c679d77c81d6a5609700a) With some technical work, one can show that the set of equivalence classes can naturally be given a topological structure, and that the charts used in doing so form a smooth atlas. For the patching together the analytic structures(subset), see [analytic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_varieties "Analytic varieties").

Differentiable functions
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Differentiable functions")]

A real valued function _f_ on an _n_-dimensional differentiable manifold _M_ is called **differentiable** at a point _p_ ∈ _M_ if it is differentiable in any coordinate chart defined around _p_. In more precise terms, if ![Image 31: {\displaystyle (U,\phi )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0be3491c45cdc56c113de78c13f5cb0b70d4c6d4) is a differentiable chart where ![Image 32: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) is an open set in ![Image 33: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) containing _p_ and ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \phi :U\to {\mathbf {R} }^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59c115f4934bee5ec7e5244ab207d23291e292a2) is the map defining the chart, then _f_ is differentiable at _p_[if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if")![Image 35: {\displaystyle f\circ \phi ^{-1}\colon \phi (U)\subset {\mathbf {R} }^{n}\to {\mathbf {R} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51ab364a0d4eaccd70a09f38df3a9572523bc4e7) is differentiable at ![Image 36: {\displaystyle \phi (p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/772d7fe1c5a3439845a87f55d45af038956b3f12), that is ![Image 37: {\displaystyle f\circ \phi ^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5aa227c8abb67f2401820a4c4f4931173448dee5) is a differentiable function from the open set ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \phi (U)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01d0afd506728742ba3cdc66abc637c8ab349d62), considered as a subset of ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {R} }^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f96fef157cdfd6a7bb01b79ea8467bcbb6c3d78b), to ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5de85fcc2a00d8ba14aae84aeef812d7fef4b3d5). In general, there will be many available charts; however, the definition of differentiability does not depend on the choice of chart at _p_. It follows from the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule "Chain rule") applied to the transition functions between one chart and another that if _f_ is differentiable in any particular chart at _p_, then it is differentiable in all charts at _p_. Analogous considerations apply to defining _C k_ functions, smooth functions, and analytic functions.

### Differentiation of functions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Differentiation of functions")]

There are various ways to define the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of a function on a differentiable manifold, the most fundamental of which is the [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative"). The definition of the directional derivative is complicated by the fact that a manifold will lack a suitable [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") structure with which to define [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)"). Therefore, the directional derivative looks at curves in the manifold instead of vectors.

#### Directional differentiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Directional differentiation")]

Given a real valued function _f_ on an _n_ dimensional differentiable manifold _M_, the directional derivative of _f_ at a point _p_ in _M_ is defined as follows. Suppose that γ(_t_) is a curve in _M_ with _γ_(0) = _p_, which is _differentiable_ in the sense that its composition with any chart is a [differentiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_curve "Differentiable curve") in **R**_n_. Then the **directional derivative** of _f_ at _p_ along γ is

![Image 41: {\displaystyle \left.{\frac {d}{dt}}f(\gamma (t))\right|_{t=0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ddd6a9ded54a2cbd15a13c1f406426888fe1ad7d)

If _γ_ 1 and _γ_ 2 are two curves such that _γ_ 1(0) = _γ_ 2(0) = _p_, and in any coordinate chart ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4),

![Image 43: {\displaystyle \left.{\frac {d}{dt}}\phi \circ \gamma _{1}(t)\right|_{t=0}=\left.{\frac {d}{dt}}\phi \circ \gamma _{2}(t)\right|_{t=0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa18b65975fc76e637ee2c95721a563607b16839)

then, by the chain rule, _f_ has the same directional derivative at _p_ along _γ_ 1 as along _γ_ 2. This means that the directional derivative depends only on the [tangent vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector "Tangent vector") of the curve at _p_. Thus, the more abstract definition of directional differentiation adapted to the case of differentiable manifolds ultimately captures the intuitive features of directional differentiation in an affine space.

#### Tangent vector and the differential

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Tangent vector and the differential")]

A **tangent vector** at _p_ ∈ _M_ is an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of differentiable curves _γ_ with _γ_(0) = _p_, modulo the equivalence relation of first-order [contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(mathematics) "Contact (mathematics)") between the curves. Therefore,

![Image 44: {\displaystyle \gamma _{1}\equiv \gamma _{2}\iff \left.{\frac {d}{dt}}\phi \circ \gamma _{1}(t)\right|_{t=0}=\left.{\frac {d}{dt}}\phi \circ \gamma _{2}(t)\right|_{t=0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d3b94a6c925b08000317ef416843c9bd6f155f0)

in every coordinate chart ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4). Therefore, the equivalence classes are curves through _p_ with a prescribed [velocity vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_vector "Velocity vector") at _p_. The collection of all tangent vectors at _p_ forms a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"): the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") to _M_ at _p_, denoted _T_ _p_ _M_.

If _X_ is a tangent vector at _p_ and _f_ a differentiable function defined near _p_, then differentiating _f_ along any curve in the equivalence class defining _X_ gives a well-defined directional derivative along _X_: ![Image 46: {\displaystyle Xf(p):=\left.{\frac {d}{dt}}f(\gamma (t))\right|_{t=0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5343a1dad5b17723429b1b98adc91d3bb5d3066) Once again, the chain rule establishes that this is independent of the freedom in selecting γ from the equivalence class, since any curve with the same first order contact will yield the same directional derivative.

If the function _f_ is fixed, then the mapping ![Image 47: {\displaystyle X\mapsto Xf(p)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01fa2c7b44e242158a5b5847b79621ac55853839) is a [linear functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional "Linear functional") on the tangent space. This linear functional is often denoted by _df_(_p_) and is called the **differential** of _f_ at _p_: ![Image 48: {\displaystyle df(p)\colon T_{p}M\to {\mathbf {R} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91704cc64a1016499ffbdd262275c773a1840e62)

One can check that ![Image 67: {\displaystyle T_{p}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71b20e0304a65ead2cafb33412a383b34fe527ca) naturally has the structure of a ![Image 68: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional real vector space, and that with this structure, ![Image 69: {\displaystyle df_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1142d069553f6a55274e87055720127c02d3ec02) is a linear map. The key observation is that, due to the constraint appearing in the definition of a tangent vector, the value of ![Image 70: {\displaystyle v_{\beta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ff50695dd0048523c0558c20e434114f2871719) for a single element ![Image 71: {\displaystyle \beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8) of ![Image 72: {\displaystyle A_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1ea46c20042fba4142a87ecd1f7c29776a6ce46) automatically determines ![Image 73: {\displaystyle v_{\alpha }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81e8acf871998209aa082e10fb1a5738cf721193) for all ![Image 74: {\displaystyle \alpha \in A.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a833dd21d115a96c1c5b55a7136fadf84ce3a262)

The above formal definitions correspond precisely to a more informal notation which appears often in textbooks, specifically

![Image 75: {\displaystyle v^{i}={\widetilde {v}}^{j}{\frac {\partial x^{i}}{\partial {\widetilde {x}}^{j}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31d20542fe976ddcaf5b4904a52df086e099190a) and ![Image 76: {\displaystyle df_{p}(v)={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x^{i}}}v^{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77b0688761b02706ee8a6a5f93e5aec9330a46ac)
With the idea of the formal definitions understood, this shorthand notation is, for most purposes, much easier to work with.

### Partitions of unity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Partitions of unity")]

One of the topological features of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is that it admits [partitions of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_unity "Partition of unity"). This distinguishes the differential structure on a manifold from stronger structures (such as analytic and holomorphic structures) that in general fail to have partitions of unity.

Suppose that _M_ is a manifold of class _C k_, where 0 ≤ _k_ ≤ ∞. Let {_U_ _α_} be an open covering of _M_. Then a **partition of unity** subordinate to the cover {_U_ _α_} is a collection of real-valued _C k_ functions _φ_ _i_ on _M_ satisfying the following conditions:

*   The [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics) "Support (mathematics)") of the _φ_ _i_ are [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") and [locally finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_finite_collection "Locally finite collection");
*   The support of _φ_ _i_ is completely contained in _U_ _α_ for some _α_;
*   The _φ_ _i_ sum to one at each point of _M_: ![Image 77: {\displaystyle \sum _{i}\phi _{i}(x)=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/277f015657c1b5d837ae0e985b4be9fc52b1a170)

(Note that this last condition is actually a finite sum at each point because of the local finiteness of the supports of the _φ_ _i_.)

Every open covering of a _C k_ manifold _M_ has a _C k_ partition of unity. This allows for certain constructions from the topology of _C k_ functions on **R**_n_ to be carried over to the category of differentiable manifolds. In particular, it is possible to discuss integration by choosing a partition of unity subordinate to a particular coordinate atlas, and carrying out the integration in each chart of **R**_n_. Partitions of unity therefore allow for certain other kinds of [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") to be considered: for instance [L _p_ spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space "Lp space"), [Sobolev spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_spaces "Sobolev spaces"), and other kinds of spaces that require integration.

### Differentiability of mappings between manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Differentiability of mappings between manifolds")]

Suppose _M_ and _N_ are two differentiable manifolds with dimensions _m_ and _n_, respectively, and _f_ is a function from _M_ to _N_. Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces we know what it means for _f_ to be continuous. But what does "_f_ is _C k_(_M_, _N_)" mean for _k_ ≥ 1? We know what that means when _f_ is a function between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose _f_ with a chart of _M_ and a chart of _N_ such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to _M_ to _N_ to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be _C k_(**R**_m_, **R**_n_). We define "_f_ is _C k_(_M_, _N_)" to mean that all such compositions of _f_ with charts are _C k_(**R**_m_, **R**_n_). Once again, the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on _M_ and _N_ are selected. However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. If _M_ or _N_ is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one.

The [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") of a point consists of the possible directional derivatives at that point, and has the same [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")_n_ as does the manifold. For a set of (non-singular) coordinates _x k_ local to the point, the coordinate derivatives ![Image 78: {\displaystyle \partial _{k}={\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{k}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6403bbe5dd2d0d034e9c9eb79880b7a061d56fd) define a [holonomic basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_basis "Holonomic basis") of the tangent space. The collection of tangent spaces at all points can in turn be made into a manifold, the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle"), whose dimension is 2 _n_. The tangent bundle is where [tangent vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") lie, and is itself a differentiable manifold. The [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_system "Lagrangian system") is a function on the tangent bundle. One can also define the tangent bundle as the bundle of 1-[jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics) "Jet (mathematics)") from **R** (the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line")) to _M_.

One may construct an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on _U_ _α_ × **R**_n_, where _U_ _α_ denotes one of the charts in the atlas for _M_. Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts _U_ _α_. The transition maps on this atlas are defined from the transition maps on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class.

The [dual space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space") of a vector space is the set of real valued linear functions on the vector space. The [cotangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_space "Cotangent space") at a point is the dual of the tangent space at that point and the elements are referred to as cotangent vectors; the [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") is the collection of all cotangent vectors, along with the natural differentiable manifold structure.

Like the tangent bundle, the cotangent bundle is again a differentiable manifold. The [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") is a scalar on the cotangent bundle. The [total space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_space "Total space") of a cotangent bundle has the structure of a [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"). Cotangent vectors are sometimes called _[covectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covector "Covector")_. One can also define the cotangent bundle as the bundle of 1-[jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics) "Jet (mathematics)") of functions from _M_ to **R**.

Elements of the cotangent space can be thought of as [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") displacements: if _f_ is a differentiable function we can define at each point _p_ a cotangent vector _df p_, which sends a tangent vector _X p_ to the derivative of _f_ associated with _X p_. However, not every covector field can be expressed this way. Those that can are referred to as [exact differentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_differential "Exact differential"). For a given set of local coordinates _x k,_ the differentials _dx_ _k_

_p_ form a basis of the cotangent space at _p_.

The tensor bundle is the [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum_of_vector_bundles "Direct sum of vector bundles") of all [tensor products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product") of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Each element of the bundle is a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field"), which can act as a [multilinear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_operator "Multilinear operator") on vector fields, or on other tensor fields.

The tensor bundle is not a differentiable manifold in the traditional sense, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_(ring_theory) "Algebra (ring theory)") over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks are referred to as _[covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance")_ and _[contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance\_and\_contravariance\_of\_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors")_ ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively.

A frame (or, in more precise terms, a tangent frame), is an ordered basis of particular tangent space. Likewise, a tangent frame is a linear isomorphism of **R**_n_ to this tangent space. A moving tangent frame is an ordered list of vector fields that give a basis at every point of their domain. One may also regard a moving frame as a section of the frame bundle F(_M_), a [GL(_n_, **R**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")[principal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle") made up of the set of all frames over _M_. The frame bundle is useful because tensor fields on _M_ can be regarded as [equivariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant "Equivariant") vector-valued functions on F(_M_).

On a manifold that is sufficiently smooth, various kinds of jet bundles can also be considered. The (first-order) tangent bundle of a manifold is the collection of curves in the manifold modulo the equivalence relation of first-order [contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(mathematics) "Contact (mathematics)"). By analogy, the _k_-th order tangent bundle is the collection of curves modulo the relation of _k_-th order contact. Likewise, the cotangent bundle is the bundle of 1-jets of functions on the manifold: the _k_-jet bundle is the bundle of their _k_-jets. These and other examples of the general idea of jet bundles play a significant role in the study of [differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator") on manifolds.

The notion of a frame also generalizes to the case of higher-order jets. Define a _k_-th order frame to be the _k_-jet of a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") from **R**_n_ to _M_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-6) The collection of all _k_-th order frames, _F k_(_M_), is a principal _G k_ bundle over _M_, where _G k_ is the [group of _k_-jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_group "Jet group"); i.e., the group made up of [_k_-jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics) "Jet (mathematics)") of diffeomorphisms of **R**_n_ that fix the origin. Note that GL(_n_, **R**) is naturally isomorphic to _G_ 1, and a subgroup of every _G k_, _k_ ≥ 2. In particular, a section of _F_ 2(_M_) gives the frame components of a [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)") on _M_. Thus, the quotient bundle _F_ 2(_M_) / GL(_n_, **R**) is the bundle of _symmetric_ linear connections over _M_.

Calculus on manifolds
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Calculus on manifolds")]

Many of the techniques from [multivariate calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_calculus "Multivariate calculus") also apply, _[mutatis mutandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis\_mutandis "Mutatis mutandis")_, to differentiable manifolds. One can define the directional derivative of a differentiable function along a tangent vector to the manifold, for instance, and this leads to a means of generalizing the [total derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivative "Total derivative") of a function: the differential. From the perspective of calculus, the derivative of a function on a manifold behaves in much the same way as the ordinary derivative of a function defined on a Euclidean space, at least [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property"). For example, there are versions of the [implicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function "Implicit function") and [inverse function theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem "Inverse function theorem") for such functions.

There are, however, important differences in the calculus of vector fields (and tensor fields in general). In brief, the directional derivative of a vector field is not well-defined, or at least not defined in a straightforward manner. Several generalizations of the derivative of a vector field (or tensor field) do exist, and capture certain formal features of differentiation in Euclidean spaces. The chief among these are:

*   The [Lie derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative "Lie derivative"), which is uniquely defined by the differential structure, but fails to satisfy some of the usual features of directional differentiation.
*   An [affine connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection "Affine connection"), which is not uniquely defined, but generalizes in a more complete manner the features of ordinary directional differentiation. Because an affine connection is not unique, it is an additional piece of data that must be specified on the manifold.

Ideas from [integral calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus "Integral calculus") also carry over to differential manifolds. These are naturally expressed in the language of [exterior calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_calculus "Exterior calculus") and [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"). The fundamental theorems of integral calculus in several variables—namely [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem "Green's theorem"), the [divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem"), and [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem")—generalize to a theorem (also called Stokes' theorem) relating the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") and integration over [submanifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold").

### Differential calculus of functions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Differential calculus of functions")]

Differentiable functions between two manifolds are needed in order to formulate suitable notions of [submanifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold"), and other related concepts. If _f_: _M_ → _N_ is a differentiable function from a differentiable manifold _M_ of dimension _m_ to another differentiable manifold _N_ of dimension _n_, then the [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_(differential) "Pushforward (differential)") of _f_ is a mapping _df_: T _M_ → T _N_. It is also denoted by _Tf_ and called the **tangent map**. At each point of _M_, this is a linear transformation from one tangent space to another: ![Image 79: {\displaystyle df(p)\colon T_{p}M\to T_{f(p)}N.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/901667ae950847c9878fef1fcf30acfe5c5ec250) The **rank** of _f_ at _p_ is the [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_matrix "Rank of a matrix") of this linear transformation.

Usually the rank of a function is a pointwise property. However, if the function has maximal rank, then the rank will remain constant in a neighborhood of a point. A differentiable function "usually" has maximal rank, in a precise sense given by [Sard's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sard%27s_theorem "Sard's theorem"). Functions of maximal rank at a point are called [immersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)") and [submersions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submersion_(mathematics) "Submersion (mathematics)"):

*   If _m_ ≤ _n_, and _f_: _M_ → _N_ has rank _m_ at _p_ ∈ _M_, then _f_ is called an **immersion** at _p_. If _f_ is an immersion at all points of _M_ and is a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") onto its image, then _f_ is an **[embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding")**. Embeddings formalize the notion of _M_ being a [submanifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold") of _N_. In general, an embedding is an immersion without self-intersections and other sorts of non-local topological irregularities.
*   If _m_ ≥ _n_, and _f_: _M_ → _N_ has rank _n_ at _p_ ∈ _M_, then _f_ is called a **submersion** at _p_. The implicit function theorem states that if _f_ is a submersion at _p_, then _M_ is locally a product of _N_ and **R**_m_−_n_ near _p_. In formal terms, there exist coordinates (_y_ 1, ..., _y n_) in a neighborhood of _f_(_p_) in _N_, and _m_ − _n_ functions _x_ 1, ..., _x_ _m_−_n_ defined in a neighborhood of _p_ in _M_ such that ![Image 80: {\displaystyle (y_{1}\circ f,\dotsc ,y_{n}\circ f,x_{1},\dotsc ,x_{m-n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0c6c6765ea72310463f45e7ae6735d2f556fdcf) is a system of local coordinates of _M_ in a neighborhood of _p_. Submersions form the foundation of the theory of [fibrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibration "Fibration") and [fibre bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_bundle "Fibre bundle").

A [Lie derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative "Lie derivative"), named after [Sophus Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie "Sophus Lie"), is a [derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(abstract_algebra) "Derivation (abstract algebra)") on the [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field") of [tensor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") over a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")_M_. The [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") of all Lie derivatives on _M_ forms an infinite dimensional [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") with respect to the [Lie bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields "Lie bracket of vector fields") defined by

![Image 81: {\displaystyle [A,B]:={\mathcal {L}}_{A}B=-{\mathcal {L}}_{B}A.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a52a85bba0a0a65aec00893b1af31acff9b2b32e)

The Lie derivatives are represented by [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), as [infinitesimal generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_to_a_Lie_group "Lie group") of flows ([active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transformation "Active transformation")[diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism")) on _M_. Looking at it the other way around, the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of diffeomorphisms of _M_ has the associated Lie algebra structure, of Lie derivatives, in a way directly analogous to the [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") theory.

The exterior calculus allows for a generalization of the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") and [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)") operators.

The bundle of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"), at each point, consists of all totally [antisymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_tensor "Antisymmetric tensor")[multilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_map "Multilinear map") maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into _n_-forms for each _n_ at most equal to the dimension of the manifold; an _n_-form is an _n_-variable form, also called a form of degree _n_. The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an _n_-form is a tensor with cotangent rank _n_ and tangent rank 0. But not every such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric.

#### Exterior derivative

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Exterior derivative")]

The _exterior derivative_ is a linear operator on the [graded vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_vector_space "Graded vector space") of all smooth differential forms on a smooth manifold ![Image 82: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd). It is usually denoted by ![Image 83: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab). More precisely, if ![Image 84: {\displaystyle n=\dim(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f129dc2cc6749381d8d5a34d490651436968fde2), for ![Image 85: {\displaystyle 0\leq k\leq n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b429c3c44b3dc10332285272eee6f754dbf985) the operator ![Image 86: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) maps the space ![Image 87: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30e527515b7c9de608cccd789454806924363647) of ![Image 88: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)-forms on ![Image 89: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) into the space ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k+1}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d92e1a9eb6d032924f3099d4c4072fa0f3793b67) of ![Image 91: {\displaystyle (k+1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f9f13644a6be482d7ddb19a6e0c706564773085)-forms (if ![Image 92: {\displaystyle k>n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66e81682bf174c978e9008ffb557ba4da2cf7478) there are no non-zero ![Image 93: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)-forms on ![Image 94: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) so the map ![Image 95: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) is identically zero on ![Image 96: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-forms).

For example, the exterior differential of a smooth function ![Image 97: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) is given in local coordinates ![Image 98: {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/737e02a5fbf8bc31d443c91025339f9fd1de1065), with associated local co-frame ![Image 99: {\displaystyle dx_{1},\ldots ,dx_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb0b10be2d458f01860db3b84cdcc0f7da7c2b8d) by the formula: ![Image 100: {\displaystyle df=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}}dx_{i}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f8d245f1aa1f450c7586dfad6475fe5d48eeb09)

The exterior differential satisfies the following identity, similar to a [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule") with respect to the wedge product of forms: ![Image 101: {\displaystyle d(\omega \wedge \eta )=d\omega \wedge \eta +(-1)^{\deg \omega }\omega \wedge d\eta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff9071a74dd65ed0e7fd39102a89378d62719467)

The exterior derivative also satisfies the identity ![Image 102: {\displaystyle d\circ d=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b28b25c1eefce2c0374e96c1638eae720af6041). That is, if ![Image 103: {\displaystyle \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8) is a ![Image 104: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)-form then the ![Image 105: {\displaystyle (k+2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8af963731a6f9664ee81b251d48c96d92f5582a)-form ![Image 106: {\displaystyle d(df)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c17343e94c583a288b4cd430df8256e0c6b24c9) is identically vanishing. A form ![Image 107: {\displaystyle \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8) such that ![Image 108: {\displaystyle d\omega =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f36675fed06f4f9cab60ae8e9479020cf17f3244) is called _closed_, while a form ![Image 109: {\displaystyle \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8) such that ![Image 110: {\displaystyle \omega =d\eta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/335b4226d5a601d08618fd580221cefd1861f6ad) for some other form ![Image 111: {\displaystyle \eta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4d701857cf5fbec133eebaf94deadf722537f64) is called _exact_. Another formulation of the identity ![Image 112: {\displaystyle d\circ d=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b28b25c1eefce2c0374e96c1638eae720af6041) is that an exact form is closed. This allows one to define [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology") of the manifold ![Image 113: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd), where the ![Image 114: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)th cohomology group is the [quotient group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group "Quotient group") of the closed forms on ![Image 115: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) by the exact forms on ![Image 116: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd).

Topology of differentiable manifolds
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Topology of differentiable manifolds")]

### Relationship with topological manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Relationship with topological manifolds")]

Suppose that ![Image 117: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) is a topological ![Image 118: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-manifold.

If given any smooth atlas ![Image 119: {\displaystyle \{(U_{\alpha },\phi _{\alpha })\}_{\alpha \in A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f39f90fa6b69ece1e5a2c8bbcace4842442fa5e), it is easy to find a smooth atlas which defines a different smooth manifold structure on ![Image 120: {\displaystyle M;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/775a47d0e02fa0a7a5a7a9687176fd3907cbe2ce) consider a homeomorphism ![Image 121: {\displaystyle \Phi :M\to M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6962920b8756d2e8aee1bb074fd596e1a77366b9) which is not smooth relative to the given atlas; for instance, one can modify the identity map using a localized non-smooth bump. Then consider the new atlas ![Image 122: {\displaystyle \{(\Phi ^{-1}(U_{\alpha }),\phi _{\alpha }\circ \Phi )\}_{\alpha \in A},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba22d4ad00ab0cbd70763bce088e3e36c51d912b) which is easily verified as a smooth atlas. However, the charts in the new atlas are not smoothly compatible with the charts in the old atlas, since this would require that ![Image 123: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha }\circ \Phi \circ \phi _{\beta }^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/856a7b6ea24c9637aa695c6087ac5cc80f8970f1) and ![Image 124: {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha }\circ \Phi ^{-1}\circ \phi _{\beta }^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98d73ebb682c36cacc9b788d5ed790bc0428f11c) are smooth for any ![Image 125: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) and ![Image 126: {\displaystyle \beta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59ab677d974cccb0132cac08bd67fc8ac765627e) with these conditions being exactly the definition that both ![Image 127: {\displaystyle \Phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24) and ![Image 128: {\displaystyle \Phi ^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab22c7cf7f1a54d85993e0257a93f28eae546df8) are smooth, in contradiction to how ![Image 129: {\displaystyle \Phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24) was selected.

With this observation as motivation, one can define an equivalence relation on the space of smooth atlases on ![Image 130: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) by declaring that smooth atlases ![Image 131: {\displaystyle \{(U_{\alpha },\phi _{\alpha })\}_{\alpha \in A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f39f90fa6b69ece1e5a2c8bbcace4842442fa5e) and ![Image 132: {\displaystyle \{(V_{\beta },\psi _{\beta })\}_{\beta \in B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/006cf33791ed84b806c232b9a99c3b05bf0f011a) are equivalent if there is a homeomorphism ![Image 133: {\displaystyle \Phi :M\to M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6962920b8756d2e8aee1bb074fd596e1a77366b9) such that ![Image 134: {\displaystyle \{(\Phi ^{-1}(U_{\alpha }),\phi _{\alpha }\circ \Phi )\}_{\alpha \in A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf83b92e8b35af77e28445a73e8136bc525b9927) is smoothly compatible with ![Image 135: {\displaystyle \{(V_{\beta },\psi _{\beta })\}_{\beta \in B},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8275d25ea2c3fff6a54997b004267368ff44c162) and such that ![Image 136: {\displaystyle \{(\Phi (V_{\beta }),\psi _{\beta }\circ \Phi ^{-1})\}_{\beta \in B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45f2db10dd99abc650399354e9a6f36373b42401) is smoothly compatible with ![Image 137: {\displaystyle \{(U_{\alpha },\phi _{\alpha })\}_{\alpha \in A}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b37d6859a1d93e54910e827321b46b5d9d57c10)

More briefly, one could say that two smooth atlases are equivalent if there exists a diffeomorphism ![Image 138: {\displaystyle M\to M,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76674b85f00a3e422f62743faa3b0325f1723060) in which one smooth atlas is taken for the domain and the other smooth atlas is taken for the range.

Note that this equivalence relation is a refinement of the equivalence relation which defines a smooth manifold structure, as any two smoothly compatible atlases are also compatible in the present sense; one can take ![Image 139: {\displaystyle \Phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aed80a2011a3912b028ba32a52dfa57165455f24) to be the identity map.

If the dimension of ![Image 140: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) is 1, 2, or 3, then there exists a smooth structure on ![Image 141: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd), and all distinct smooth structures are equivalent in the above sense. The situation is more complicated in higher dimensions, although it isn't fully understood.

*   Some topological manifolds admit no smooth structures, as was originally shown with a [ten-dimensional example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kervaire_manifold "Kervaire manifold") by [Kervaire (1960)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#CITEREFKervaire1960). A [major application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donaldson%27s_theorem "Donaldson's theorem") of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations") in differential geometry due to [Simon Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Donaldson "Simon Donaldson"), in combination with results of [Michael Freedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Freedman "Michael Freedman"), shows that many simply-connected compact topological 4-manifolds do not admit smooth structures. A well-known particular example is the [E 8 manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_manifold "E8 manifold").
*   Some topological manifolds admit many smooth structures which are not equivalent in the sense given above. This was originally discovered by [John Milnor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor "John Milnor") in the form of the [exotic 7-spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere "Exotic sphere").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-7)

Every one-dimensional connected smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to either ![Image 142: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) or ![Image 143: {\displaystyle S^{1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe8d5f879619008f9a2851aa290f438c32e9232a) each with their standard smooth structures.

For a classification of smooth 2-manifolds, see [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)"). A particular result is that every two-dimensional connected compact smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to one of the following: ![Image 144: {\displaystyle S^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce2790d16fc095fefd35493399f92b5557ced3b0) or ![Image 145: {\displaystyle (S^{1}\times S^{1})\sharp \cdots \sharp (S^{1}\times S^{1}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0028114e9f26e4f8a7261491455039a6ef60d1d3) or ![Image 146: {\displaystyle \mathbb {RP} ^{2}\sharp \cdots \sharp \mathbb {RP} ^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a20a495114ffa87d5c55a3f724ab14764e7dec80) The situation is [more nontrivial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichm%C3%BCller_space "Teichmüller space") if one considers complex-differentiable structure instead of smooth structure.

The situation in three dimensions is quite a bit more complicated, and known results are more indirect. A remarkable result, proved in 2002 by methods of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations"), is the [geometrization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston%27s_geometrization_conjecture "Thurston's geometrization conjecture"), stating loosely that any compact smooth 3-manifold can be split up into different parts, each of which admits Riemannian metrics which possess many symmetries. There are also various "recognition results" for geometrizable 3-manifolds, such as [Mostow rigidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostow_rigidity "Mostow rigidity") and Sela's algorithm for the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-8)

The classification of _n_-manifolds for _n_ greater than three is known to be impossible, even up to [homotopy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_equivalence "Homotopy equivalence"). Given any finitely [presented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group "Presentation of a group") group, one can construct a closed 4-manifold having that group as fundamental group. Since there is no algorithm to [decide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem") the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups, there is no algorithm to decide whether two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. Since the previously described construction results in a class of 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic if and only if their groups are isomorphic, the homeomorphism problem for 4-manifolds is [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem"). In addition, since even recognizing the trivial group is undecidable, it is not even possible in general to decide whether a manifold has trivial fundamental group, i.e. is [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected").

Simply connected [4-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold "4-manifold") have been classified up to homeomorphism by [Freedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Freedman "Michael Freedman") using the [intersection form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_theory "Intersection theory") and [Kirby–Siebenmann invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%E2%80%93Siebenmann_invariant "Kirby–Siebenmann invariant"). Smooth 4-manifold theory is known to be much more complicated, as the [exotic smooth structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_R4 "Exotic R4") on **R**4 demonstrate.

However, the situation becomes more tractable for simply connected smooth manifolds of dimension ≥ 5, where the [h-cobordism theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-cobordism_theorem "H-cobordism theorem") can be used to reduce the classification to a classification up to homotopy equivalence, and [surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory") can be applied.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-9) This has been carried out to provide an explicit classification of simply connected [5-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-manifold "5-manifold") by Dennis Barden.

### (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds")]

A [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") consists of a smooth manifold together with a positive-definite [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space") on each of the individual tangent spaces. This collection of inner products is called the [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric"), and is naturally a symmetric 2-tensor field. This "metric" identifies a natural vector space isomorphism ![Image 147: {\displaystyle T_{p}M\to T_{p}^{\ast }M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa1ed6f8241397485e8f050862002438d6a011d4) for each ![Image 148: {\displaystyle p\in M.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c41366ebf5222955ca9977172cd6dd4e2d8aed3e) On a Riemannian manifold one can define notions of length, volume, and angle. Any smooth manifold can be given many different Riemannian metrics.

A [pseudo-Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold") (also called a semi-Riemannian manifold) is a generalization of the notion of [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") where the inner products are allowed to have an [indefinite signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature "Metric signature"), as opposed to being [positive-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_bilinear_form "Definite bilinear form"); they are still required to be non-degenerate. Every smooth pseudo-Riemannian and Riemmannian manifold defines a number of associated tensor fields, such as the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"). [Lorentzian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifolds "Lorentzian manifolds") are pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature ![Image 149: {\displaystyle (n-1,1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/158f4d6958e3923de0db80edec6c5f90a97d3493); the case ![Image 150: {\displaystyle n=4}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d928ec15aeef83aade867992ee473933adb6139d) is fundamental in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Not every smooth manifold can be given a non-Riemannian pseudo-Riemannian structure; there are topological restrictions on doing so.

A [Finsler manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finsler_manifold "Finsler manifold") is a different generalization of a Riemannian manifold, in which the inner product is replaced with a [vector norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_norm "Vector norm"); as such, this allows the definition of length, but not angle.

### Symplectic manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Symplectic manifolds")]

A [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold") is a manifold equipped with a [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_form_(calculus) "Closed form (calculus)"), [nondegenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondegenerate_form "Nondegenerate form")[2-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-form "2-form"). This condition forces symplectic manifolds to be even-dimensional, due to the fact that skew-symmetric ![Image 151: {\displaystyle (2n+1)\times (2n+1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7dc0b190d5d6bc6f60fad9cdb429ef500675b50b) matrices all have zero determinant. There are two basic examples:

A [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") consists of a _C_∞ manifold ![Image 152: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) together with a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") structure on ![Image 153: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) such that the product and inversion maps ![Image 154: {\displaystyle m:G\times G\to G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/513b3d99d2a660a1552a8ae4bd19bd82e78ad871) and ![Image 155: {\displaystyle i:G\to G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/413e0936c524dbc4d440b73ac947d32ebd0215b1) are smooth as maps of manifolds. These objects often arise naturally in describing (continuous) symmetries, and they form an important source of examples of smooth manifolds.

Many otherwise familiar examples of smooth manifolds, however, cannot be given a Lie group structure, since given a Lie group ![Image 156: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) and any ![Image 157: {\displaystyle g\in G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1be73903416a0dd94b8cbc2268ce480810c0e62), one could consider the map ![Image 158: {\displaystyle m(g,\cdot ):G\to G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/689244b229cb62b97de38ed8f0e153e8edad516f) which sends the identity element ![Image 159: {\displaystyle e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467) to ![Image 160: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) and hence, by considering the differential ![Image 161: {\displaystyle T_{e}G\to T_{g}G,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/facc6176eae2b6184437ca53cb57b059cb2c5cb8) gives a natural identification between any two tangent spaces of a Lie group. In particular, by considering an arbitrary nonzero vector in ![Image 162: {\displaystyle T_{e}G,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/729522289c49c40b6bf4ad1908c79e795f5db20c) one can use these identifications to give a smooth non-vanishing vector field on ![Image 163: {\displaystyle G.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc645a5b7e8a2022ad70fc42dbda04c008a33a9a) This shows, for instance, that no [even-dimensional sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem "Hairy ball theorem") can support a Lie group structure. The same argument shows, more generally, that every Lie group must be [parallelizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelizable_manifold "Parallelizable manifold").

Alternative definitions
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Alternative definitions")]

The notion of a [pseudogroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogroup "Pseudogroup")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-10) provides a flexible generalization of atlases in order to allow a variety of different structures to be defined on manifolds in a uniform way. A _pseudogroup_ consists of a topological space _S_ and a collection Γ consisting of homeomorphisms from open subsets of _S_ to other open subsets of _S_ such that

1.   If _f_ ∈ Γ, and _U_ is an open subset of the domain of _f_, then the restriction _f_|_U_ is also in Γ.
2.   If _f_ is a homeomorphism from a union of open subsets of _S_, ![Image 164: {\displaystyle \cup _{i}\,U_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9cc0b4be858829765a46a821b21068d98d3ad37), to an open subset of _S_, then _f_ ∈ Γ provided ![Image 165: {\displaystyle f|_{U_{i}}\in \Gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36d29126f5183147095dc135e57721dbe87bf4ee) for every _i_.
3.   For every open _U_ ⊂ _S_, the identity transformation of _U_ is in Γ.
4.   If _f_ ∈ Γ, then _f_−1 ∈ Γ.
5.   The composition of two elements of Γ is in Γ.

These last three conditions are analogous to the definition of a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"). Note that Γ need not be a group, however, since the functions are not globally defined on _S_. For example, the collection of all local _C k_[diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphisms "Diffeomorphisms") on **R**_n_ form a pseudogroup. All [biholomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biholomorphism "Biholomorphism") between open sets in **C**_n_ form a pseudogroup. More examples include: orientation preserving maps of **R**_n_, [symplectomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectomorphism "Symplectomorphism"), [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation"), [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation"), and so on. Thus, a wide variety of function classes determine pseudogroups.

An atlas (_U i_, _φ_ _i_) of homeomorphisms _φ_ _i_ from _U i_ ⊂ _M_ to open subsets of a topological space _S_ is said to be _compatible_ with a pseudogroup Γ provided that the transition functions _φ_ _j_ ∘ _φ_ _i_−1: _φ_ _i_(_U i_ ∩ _U j_) → _φ_ _j_(_U i_ ∩ _U j_) are all in Γ.

A differentiable manifold is then an atlas compatible with the pseudogroup of _C_ _k_ functions on **R**_n_. A complex manifold is an atlas compatible with the biholomorphic functions on open sets in **C**_n_. And so forth. Thus, pseudogroups provide a single framework in which to describe many structures on manifolds of importance to differential geometry and topology.

Sometimes, it can be useful to use an alternative approach to endow a manifold with a _C k_-structure. Here _k_ = 1, 2, ..., ∞, or ω for real analytic manifolds. Instead of considering coordinate charts, it is possible to start with functions defined on the manifold itself. The [structure sheaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)") of _M_, denoted **C**_k_, is a sort of [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor") that defines, for each open set _U_ ⊂ _M_, an algebra **C**_k_(_U_) of continuous functions _U_ → **R**. A structure sheaf **C**_k_ is said to give _M_ the structure of a _C_ _k_ manifold of dimension _n_ provided that, for any _p_ ∈ _M_, there exists a neighborhood _U_ of _p_ and _n_ functions _x_ 1, ..., _x_ _n_ ∈ **C**_k_(_U_) such that the map _f_ = (_x_ 1, ..., _x n_): _U_ → **R**_n_ is a homeomorphism onto an open set in **R**_n_, and such that **C**_k_|_U_ is the [pullback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback "Pullback") of the sheaf of _k_-times continuously differentiable functions on **R**_n_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-11)

In particular, this latter condition means that any function _h_ in **C**_k_(_V_), for _V_, can be written uniquely as _h_(_x_) = _H_(_x_ 1(_x_), ..., _x_ _n_(_x_)), where _H_ is a _k_-times differentiable function on _f_(_V_) (an open set in **R**_n_). Thus, the sheaf-theoretic viewpoint is that the functions on a differentiable manifold can be expressed in local coordinates as differentiable functions on **R**_n_, and [_a fortiori_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori_argument "A fortiori argument") this is sufficient to characterize the differential structure on the manifold.

#### Sheaves of local rings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Sheaves of local rings")]

A similar, but more technical, approach to defining differentiable manifolds can be formulated using the notion of a [ringed space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringed_space "Ringed space"). This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)") in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), but uses [local rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring "Local ring") of the [germs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_(mathematics) "Germ (mathematics)") of differentiable functions. It is especially popular in the context of _complex_ manifolds.

We begin by describing the basic structure sheaf on **R**_n_. If _U_ is an open set in **R**_n_, let

**O**(_U_) = _C_ _k_(_U_, **R**)
consist of all real-valued _k_-times continuously differentiable functions on _U_. As _U_ varies, this determines a sheaf of rings on **R**n. The stalk **O**_p_ for _p_ ∈ **R**_n_ consists of [germs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_(mathematics) "Germ (mathematics)") of functions near _p_, and is an algebra over **R**. In particular, this is a [local ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring "Local ring") whose unique [maximal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_ideal "Maximal ideal") consists of those functions that vanish at _p_. The pair (**R**_n_, **O**) is an example of a [locally ringed space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_ringed_space "Locally ringed space"): it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf whose stalks are each local rings.

A differentiable manifold (of class _C k_) consists of a pair (_M_, **O**_M_) where _M_ is a [second countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_countable "Second countable")[Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space"), and **O**_M_ is a sheaf of local **R**-algebras defined on _M_, such that the locally ringed space (_M_, **O**_M_) is locally isomorphic to (**R**_n_, **O**). In this way, differentiable manifolds can be thought of as [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)") modeled on **R**_n_. This means that [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold#cite_note-12) for each point _p_ ∈ _M_, there is a neighborhood _U_ of _p_, and a pair of functions (_f_, _f_#), where

1.   _f_: _U_ → _f_(_U_) ⊂ **R**_n_ is a homeomorphism onto an open set in **R**_n_.
2.   _f_#: **O**|_f_(_U_) → _f_∗ (**O**_M_|_U_) is an isomorphism of sheaves.
3.   The localization of _f_# is an isomorphism of local rings

_f_#_f_(_p_): **O**_f_(_p_) → **O**_M_,_p_.
There are a number of important motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. First, there is no _a priori_ reason that the model space needs to be **R**n. For example, (in particular in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry")), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers **C**_n_ equipped with the sheaf of [holomorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function") (thus arriving at the spaces of [complex analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analytic_geometry "Complex analytic geometry")), or the sheaf of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex _algebraic_ geometry). In broader terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see [topos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos "Topos")). Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. The analog of a coordinate system is the pair (_f_, _f_#), but these merely quantify the idea of _local isomorphism_ rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). Third, the sheaf **O**_M_ is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions as a _consequence_ of the construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). Hence, it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see [synthetic differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_differential_geometry "Synthetic differential geometry")).

A final advantage of this approach is that it allows for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.

*   The [cotangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_space "Cotangent space") at a point is _I p_/_I p_ 2, where _I p_ is the maximal ideal of the stalk **O**_M_,_p_.
*   In general, the entire [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") can be obtained by a related technique (see [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") for details).
*   [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series") (and [jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(mathematics) "Jet (mathematics)")) can be approached in a coordinate-independent manner using the [_I_ _p_-adic filtration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completion_(algebra)#Krull_topology "Completion (algebra)") on **O**_M_,_p_.
*   The [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") (or more precisely its sheaf of sections) can be identified with the sheaf of morphisms of **O**_M_ into the ring of [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_numbers "Dual numbers").

The [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory") of smooth manifolds with smooth maps lacks certain desirable properties, and people have tried to generalize smooth manifolds in order to rectify this. [Diffeological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeological_space "Diffeological space") use a different notion of chart known as a "plot". [Frölicher spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%B6licher_space "Frölicher space") and [orbifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold "Orbifold") are other attempts.

A [rectifiable set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifiable_set "Rectifiable set") generalizes the idea of a piece-wise smooth or [rectifiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifiable_curve "Rectifiable curve") to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.

[Banach manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_manifold "Banach manifold") and [Fréchet manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_manifold "Fréchet manifold"), in particular [manifolds of mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenient_vector_space#Application:_Manifolds_of_mappings_between_finite_dimensional_manifolds "Convenient vector space") are infinite dimensional differentiable manifolds.

### Non-commutative geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Non-commutative geometry")]

[![Image 166: [icon]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiable_manifold&action=edit&section=). _(June 2008)_

For a _C k_ manifold _M_, the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of real-valued _C k_ functions on the manifold forms an [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field") under pointwise addition and multiplication, called the _algebra of scalar fields_ or simply the _algebra of scalars_. This algebra has the constant function 1 as the multiplicative identity, and is a differentiable analog of the ring of [regular functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_function "Regular function") in algebraic geometry.

It is possible to reconstruct a manifold from its algebra of scalars, first as a set, but also as a topological space – this is an application of the [Banach–Stone theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Stone_theorem "Banach–Stone theorem"), and is more formally known as the [spectrum of a C*-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_C*-algebra "Spectrum of a C*-algebra"). First, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of _M_ and the algebra homomorphisms _φ_: _C k_(_M_) → **R**, as such a homomorphism _φ_ corresponds to a codimension one ideal in _C k_(_M_) (namely the kernel of _φ_), which is necessarily a maximal ideal. On the converse, every maximal ideal in this algebra is an ideal of functions vanishing at a single point, which demonstrates that MSpec (the Max Spec) of _C k_(_M_) recovers _M_ as a point set, though in fact it recovers _M_ as a topological space.

One can define various geometric structures algebraically in terms of the algebra of scalars, and these definitions often generalize to algebraic geometry (interpreting rings geometrically) and [operator theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory "Operator theory") (interpreting Banach spaces geometrically). For example, the tangent bundle to _M_ can be defined as the derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on _M_.

This "algebraization" of a manifold (replacing a geometric object with an algebra) leads to the notion of a [C*-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra "C*-algebra") – a commutative C*-algebra being precisely the ring of scalars of a manifold, by Banach–Stone, and allows one to consider _non_ commutative C*-algebras as non-commutative generalizations of manifolds. This is the basis of the field of [noncommutative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry "Noncommutative geometry").
