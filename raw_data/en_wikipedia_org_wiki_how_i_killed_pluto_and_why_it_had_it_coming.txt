Brown How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming Author Michael E. Brown Language English Publication date 2010 Publication place United States ISBN 0-385-53108-7 How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming is the 2010 memoir by Mike Brown , the American astronomer most responsible for the reclassification of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Summary [ edit ] The memoir is an account of the events surrounding the redefinition of the term planet that eventually changed the status of Pluto. It chronicles the discovery of Eris , a dwarf planet then mistakenly thought to be larger than Pluto, located within the scattered disc , beyond Neptune's orbit. The replaying of events includes the adversarial challenging of long-held scientific beliefs between some of the world's leading astronomers and the eventual 2006 International Astronomical Union 's vote that removed Pluto from the list of Solar System planets.

[ 1 ] Reviews [ edit ] Reviews of the book have been generally positive, with James Kennedy of The Wall Street Journal calling the book a "brisk" and "enjoyable ... chronicle" of the tale of the search for new planets and the eventual demotion of Pluto from planetary status.

[ 3 ] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it a "short, eager-to-please research memoir".
