[ 1 ] To give a more recent figure, Canadian floricultural farm cash receipts in 2013 totalled $1.09 billion CAD.

[ 2 ] In 2011, there were 2,278 floricultural farms in Canada.

[ 3 ] Of the provinces, Ontario has the greatest share in this industry—nearly 45% in 2004.

[ 4 ] Correspondingly Ontario dominates in exports to the U.S.

[ 5 ] 9,500 people of mainly Dutch and Danish background were employed by Ontario's floriculture industry in 2004.

[ 4 ] Southern Ontario 's strategic location within 12 hours by road of half of the U.S. urban population is cited as one of the major sources of its success in floriculture.
