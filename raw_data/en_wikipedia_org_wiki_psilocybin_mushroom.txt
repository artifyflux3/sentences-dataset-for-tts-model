Psilocybe semilanceata Psilocybin mushrooms , or psilocybin-containing mushrooms , commonly known as magic mushrooms or as shrooms , [ 1 ] are a type of hallucinogenic mushroom and a polyphyletic informal group of fungi that contain the prodrug psilocybin , which turns into the psychedelic psilocin upon ingestion.

[ 2 ] The most potent species are members of genus Psilocybe , such as P. azurescens , P. semilanceata , and P. cyanescens , but psilocybin has also been isolated from approximately a dozen other genera, including Panaeolus (including Copelandia ), Inocybe , Pluteus , Gymnopilus , and Pholiotina .

[ 2 ] Amongst other cultural applications, psilocybin mushrooms are used as recreational drugs .

[ 2 ] They may be depicted in Stone Age rock art in Africa and Europe, but are more certainly represented in pre-Columbian sculptures and glyphs seen throughout the Americas.

Indoor cultivation [ edit ] Indoor cultivation of Psilocybe cubensis Psilocybe cubensis (also known as P. cubensis) grows naturally in tropical and subtropical conditions , often near cattle due to the ideal conditions they provide for the growth of the fungus. The cow usually consumes grains or grass covered with the spores of P. cubensis and the fungus will begin to germinate within the dung.

Natural occurrence [ edit ] Main article: Psilocybin § Natural occurrence See also: List of psilocybin mushroom species Non- Psilocybe species of psilocybin mushroom include Pluteus salicinus (left), Gymnopilus luteoviridis (center), and Panaeolus cinctulus , formerly called Panaeolus subbalteatus (right) In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of psilocybin mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these distributed among the following genera : Psilocybe (116 species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Pluteus (6) Inocybe (6), Pholiotina (4) and Galerina (1).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Guzmán increased his estimate of the number of psilocybin-containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review.

Global distribution of 100+ psychoactive species of genus Psilocybe mushrooms [ 5 ] Many of them are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed throughout Canada and the US (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19).

[ 6 ] Generally, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods in the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris.

[ 7 ] Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests .

[ 3 ] P. cubensis is the most common Psilocybe in tropical areas.

P. semilanceata , considered the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom, [ 8 ] is found in temperate parts of Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, although it is absent from Mexico.

[ 6 ] In 2024, two new Psilocybe species (Hymenogastraceae), P. ingeli and P. maluti , were described from southern Africa.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Some bolete mushrooms, which are not closely related to any known psilocybin-containing mushroom species, have been reported to be hallucinogenic mushrooms , for instance in the Yunnan province in China .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The exact species as well specific active compounds in these mushrooms are not known, although unidentified indolic compounds were detected by Albert Hofmann in some boletes such as Boletus manicus .

Refs: [ 2 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Magic mushroom composition varies from genus to genus and species to species.

[ 16 ] Its principal component is psilocybin, [ 17 ] which is converted into psilocin to produce psychoactive effects.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Besides psilocin, norpsilocin , baeocystin , norbaeocystin , and aeruginascin may also be present, which might result in an entourage effect and modify the effects of magic mushrooms.

[ 2 ] [ 16 ] Animal studies suggest that the effects of pure psilocybin or psilocin and psilocybin mushrooms may be different and support the possibility of such an entourage effect with psilocybin mushrooms.

[ 2 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Panaeolus subbalteatus , one species of magic mushroom, had the highest amount of psilocybin compared to the rest of the fruiting body.

[ 16 ] Certain mushrooms are found to produce β-carbolines , such as harmine , harmane , tetrahydroharmine (THH), and harmaline , which inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that breaks down tryptamine alkaloids, and have other actions.

[ 22 ] [ 2 ] They occur in different genera , such as Psilocybe , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Cyclocybe , [ 24 ] and Hygrophorus .

[ 25 ] Harmine, harmane, norharmane , and a range of other β-carbolines were discovered in Psilocybe species.

[ 22 ] β-Carbolines in psilocybin mushrooms may inhibit the metabolism of psilocybin and other constituents and thereby potentiate their effects.

[ 22 ] Uses [ edit ] Psilocybin-containing mushrooms may be used in whole form, for example consumption of dried or fresh mushrooms, or may be turned into extracts or food products such as mushroom edibles or mushroom tea . Psilocybin-containing mushrooms and products, as well as products containing related compounds like 4-AcO-DMT , may be purchased at smart shops like psychedelic mushroom stores in some jurisdictions. Another related psilocybin-containing fungus is magic truffles , which are not technically mushrooms themselves but are the sclerotia or mycelium of psilocybin-containing mushrooms.

Dosage [ edit ] See also: Psilocybin § Dosage , and Psychedelic drug § Dosage A bag of 1.5 grams of dried psilocybe cubensis mushrooms The dosage of psilocybin-containing mushrooms depends on the psilocybin and psilocin content, which can vary significantly between and within the same species.

[ 26 ] [ 2 ] [ 27 ] Psilocybin content is typically around 0.5% to 1% of the dried weight of the mushroom, with a range of 0.03% to 1.78%.

[ 2 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Psilocin is also often present in the mushrooms, with a range of 0% to 0.59%, and can be on par with or an order of magnitude lower than psilocybin levels.

[ 28 ] [ 2 ] Psilocybe cubensis , the most popular species, has been reported to contain 0.63% psilocybin and 0.6% psilocin, or about 1.2% of psilocybin and psilocin combined.

[ 28 ] However, there is significant variation in different P. cubensis strains.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] The 'Penis Envy' strain of P. cubensis is considered to be more potent than other strains.

[ 32 ] Psilocybin levels appear to be highest in P. cyanescens and/or P. azurescens .

[ 2 ] [ 28 ] [ 34 ] Recreational doses of psilocybin mushrooms are typically between 1.0 and 3.5–5.0 g of dry mushrooms and 10 to 50 g of fresh mushrooms.

[ 26 ] [ 29 ] This corresponds to a dosage of psilocybin of about 10 to 50 mg.

[ 29 ] Usual doses of the common species P. cubensis range around 1.0 to 2.5 g, while about 2.5 to 5.0 g dried mushroom material is considered a strong dose and above 5.0 g is considered a heavy dose.

[ 35 ] A 5.0 g dose of dried mushroom is often referred to as a "heroic dose".

[ 36 ] In terms of psilocybin dosing, subthreshold or microdoses are <2.5 mg, low doses are 5 to 10 mg, the intermediate or "good effect" dose is 20 mg, and high or ego-dissolution doses are 30 to 40 mg.

[ 37 ] [ 26 ] A 20 mg dose of psilocybin is equivalent to about 100 μg LSD or about 500 mg mescaline .

[ 37 ] With regard to psilocybin and psilocin equivalence, psilocin is about 1.4-fold more potent than psilocybin (i.e., 1.4 mg psilocybin equals about 1.0 mg psilocin), which is the same difference as the molecular weights of the two compounds.

[ 28 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Microdosing has become a popular technique for many users, which involves taking <1.0 g of dried mushrooms for an experience that is not as intense or powerful, but recreationally enjoyable, or fully non-hallucinogenic, and potentially alleviating for symptoms of depression .

[ 40 ] A microdose of psilocybin mushrooms is about 10% of a recreational dose, and may be 0.1 to 0.3 g of dry mushrooms, taken up to three times per week.

[ 41 ] Effects [ edit ] Main articles: Psilocybin § Effects , and Psilocybin § Pharmacology Table from the 2010 DrugScience study ranking various drugs (legal and illegal) based on statements by drug-harm experts. This study rated "mushroom" the least harmful drug overall and for users, and the only drug that did not get any scores for harm on others.

[ 42 ] The effects of psilocybin mushrooms come from psilocybin and psilocin. When psilocybin is ingested, it is broken down by the liver in a process called dephosphorylation . The resulting compound is called psilocin, responsible for the psychedelic effects.

[ 43 ] Psilocybin and psilocin create short-term increases in tolerance of users, thus making it difficult to misuse them because the more often they are taken within a short period, the weaker the resultant effects are.

[ 44 ] Psilocybin mushrooms have not been known to cause physical or psychological dependence (addiction).

[ 45 ] The psychedelic effects appear around 20 minutes after ingestion and can last up to 6 hours. Physical effects may occur, including nausea, vomiting, euphoria, muscle weakness or relaxation, drowsiness, and lack of coordination.

As with many psychedelic substances, the effects of psychedelic mushrooms are subjective and can vary considerably among individual users. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms typically last from three to eight hours, depending on dosage, preparation method, and personal metabolism. The first 3–4 hours after ingestion are typically referred to as the 'peak'—in which the user experiences more vivid visuals and distortions in reality. The effects can seem to last much longer for the user because of psilocybin's ability to alter time perception.

[ 46 ] Sensory effects [ edit ] Sensory effects include visual and auditory hallucinations followed by emotional changes and altered perception of time and space.

[ 47 ] Noticeable changes to the auditory, visual, and tactile senses may become apparent around 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion, although effects may take up to two hours to take place. These shifts in perception visually include enhancement and contrasting of colors, strange light phenomena (such as auras or "halos" around light sources), increased visual acuity, surfaces that seem to ripple, shimmer, or breathe; complex open and closed eye visuals of form constants or images, objects that warp, morph, or change solid colors; a sense of melting into the environment, and trails behind moving objects . Sounds may seem to have increased clarity—music, for example, can take on a profound sense of cadence and depth.

[ 47 ] Some users experience synesthesia , wherein they perceive, for example, a visualization of color upon hearing a particular sound.

[ 48 ] Emotional effects [ edit ] As with other psychedelics such as LSD , the experience, or 'trip,' is strongly dependent upon set and setting .

[ 47 ] Hilarity, lack of concentration, and muscular relaxation (including dilated pupils ) are all normal effects, sometimes in the same trip.

[ 47 ] A negative environment could contribute to a bad trip , whereas a comfortable and familiar environment would set the stage for a pleasant experience. Psychedelics make experiences more intense, so if a person enters a trip in an anxious state of mind, they will likely experience heightened anxiety on their trip. Many users find it preferable to ingest the mushrooms with friends or people familiar with 'tripping.' [ 49 ] The psychological consequences of psilocybin use include hallucinations and an inability to discern fantasy from reality. Panic reactions and psychosis also may occur, particularly if a user ingests a large dose.

[ 50 ] Interactions [ edit ] See also: Psilocybin § Interactions , Psychedelic drug § Interactions , and Trip killer § Serotonergic psychedelic antidotes Toxicity [ edit ] See also: Psilocybin § Overdose The species within the most commonly foraged and ingested genus of psilocybin mushrooms, the psilocybe , contains two primary hallucinogenic toxins; psilocybin and psilocin .

[ 51 ] The median lethal dose , also known as "LD50", of psilocybin is 280 mg/kg.

[ 52 ] From a toxicological profile, it would be incredibly difficult to overdose on psilocybin mushrooms, given their primary toxin compounds. To consume such massive amounts of psilocybin, one must ingest more than 1.2 kg of dried Psilocybe cubensis given 1-2% of the dried mushroom contains psilocybin.

[ 30 ] Posing a more realistic threat than a lethal overdose, significantly elevated levels of psilocin can overstimulate the 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, causing acute serotonin syndrome .

[ 53 ] A 2015 study observed that a dose of 200 mg/kg psilocin induced symptoms of acute serotonin poisoning in mice.

[ 54 ] Neurotoxicity -induced fatal events are uncommon with psilocybin mushroom overdose, as most patients admitted to critical care are released from the department only requiring moderate treatment.

[ 53 ] However, fatal events related to emotional distress and trip-induced psychosis can occur as a result of over-consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. In 2003, a 27-year-old man was found dead in an irrigation canal due to hypothermia. In his bedroom was found two cultivation pots of psilocybin mushrooms, but no report of toxicology was made.

[ 55 ] History [ edit ] Main article: Psilocybin § History Psilocybin mushrooms have been [ when?

] and continue to be used in Mexican and Central American cultures in religious, divinatory , or spiritual contexts.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Early [ edit ] Pre-Columbian mushroom stones Rock art from c.

9000–7000 BCE from Tassili , Algeria , is believed to depict psychedelic mushrooms and the transformation of the user under their influence.

[ 58 ] Prehistoric rock art near Villar del Humo in Spain suggests that Psilocybe hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago.

[ 59 ] The hallucinogenic [ 60 ] species of the Psilocybe genus have a history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day.

[ 61 ] Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala .

[ 62 ] A statuette dating from c.

200 CE depicting a mushroom strongly resembling Psilocybe mexicana was found in the west Mexican state of Colima in a shaft and chamber tomb . A Psilocybe species known to the Aztecs as teōnanācatl (literally "divine mushroom": the agglutinative form of teōtl (god, sacred) and nanācatl (mushroom) in Nahuatl language ) was reportedly served at the coronation of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in 1502. Aztecs and Mazatecs referred to psilocybin mushrooms as genius mushrooms, divinatory mushrooms, and wondrous mushrooms when translated into English.

[ 63 ] Bernardino de Sahagún reported the ritualistic use of teonanácatl by the Aztecs when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hernán Cortés .

[ 64 ] After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned against the cultural tradition of the Aztecs, dismissing the Aztecs as idolaters, and the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, together with other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed.

[ 62 ] The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed the Aztecs and others to communicate with demons. Despite this history, the use of teonanácatl has persisted in some remote areas.

[ 56 ] Modern [ edit ] Psilocybe allenii The first mention of hallucinogenic mushrooms in European medicinal literature was in the London Medical and Physical Journal in 1799: A man served Psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms he had picked for breakfast in London's Green Park to his family. The apothecary who treated them later described how the youngest child "was attacked with fits of immoderate laughter, nor could the threats of his father or mother refrain him." [ 65 ] Psilocybe mexicana In 1955, Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson became the first known European Americans to actively participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony. The Wassons did much to publicize their experience, even publishing an article on their experiences in Life on May 13, 1957.

[ 66 ] In 1956, Roger Heim identified the psychoactive mushroom the Wassons brought back from Mexico as Psilocybe , [ 67 ] and in 1958, Albert Hofmann first identified psilocybin and psilocin as the active compounds in these mushrooms.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Inspired by the Wassons' Life article, Timothy Leary traveled to Mexico to experience psilocybin mushrooms himself. When he returned to Harvard in 1960, he and Richard Alpert started the Harvard Psilocybin Project , promoting psychological and religious studies of psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs . Alpert and Leary sought to conduct research with psilocybin on prisoners in the 1960s, testing its effects on recidivism .

[ 70 ] This experiment reviewed the subjects six months later, and found that the recidivism rate had decreased beyond their expectation, below 40%. This, and another experiment administering psilocybin to graduate divinity students, showed controversy. Shortly after Leary and Alpert were dismissed from their jobs by Harvard in 1963, they turned their attention toward promoting the psychedelic experience to the nascent hippie counterculture .

[ 71 ] The popularization of entheogens by the Wassons, Leary, Terence McKenna , Robert Anton Wilson , and many others led to an explosion in the use of psilocybin mushrooms throughout the world. By the early 1970s, many psilocybin mushroom species were described from temperate North America, Europe, and Asia and were widely collected. Books describing methods of cultivating large quantities of Psilocybe cubensis were also published. The availability of psilocybin mushrooms from wild and cultivated sources has made them one of the most widely used psychedelic drugs.

At present, psilocybin mushroom use has been reported among some groups spanning from central Mexico to Oaxaca , including groups of Nahua , Mixtecs , Mixe , Mazatecs , Zapotecs , and others.

[ 56 ] An important figure of mushroom usage in Mexico was María Sabina , [ 72 ] who used native mushrooms, such as Psilocybe mexicana in her practice.

Society and culture [ edit ] Legal status [ edit ] Main article: Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms See also: Psilocybin § Legal status , and Psilocybin decriminalization in the United States The legality of the cultivation, possession, and sale of psilocybin mushrooms and psilocybin and psilocin varies from country to country.

After Oregon Measure 109, in 2020, Oregon became the first US state to decriminalize psilocybin and legalize it for therapeutic use. However, selling psilocybin without being licensed may still attract fines or imprisonment.

[ 73 ] In 2022 Colorado legalized consumption, growing, and sharing for personal use, [ 74 ] though sales are prohibited while regulations are being drafted.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Other jurisdictions in the United States where psilocybin mushrooms are decriminalized include Ann Arbor and Detroit, Michigan; Oakland and Santa Cruz, California; Easthampton, Somerville, Northampton, and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, DC.

Furthermore, buying spores of mushroom species containing psilocybin online in the United States is legal in all states except Georgia, Idaho and California.

[ 77 ] This is because only fruiting mushrooms and mycelium contain psilocybin, a federally banned substance.

[ 78 ] A technical caveat to consider, however, is that the distributed spores must not be intended to be used for cultivation, but allowed for microscopy purposes.

[ 79 ] United Nations [ edit ] Main article: Convention on Psychotropic Substances Article 32 makes an exception for psilocybin mushroom and other wild psychotropic plants, to protect use in religious rituals in case such plants themselves were in the future added to Schedule I.

Internationally, mescaline , DMT , and psilocin , are Schedule I drugs under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances . The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing them are not subject to international control: [ 80 ] The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention... Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, mescaline , DMT , and psilocin .

Clinical research [ edit ] See also: Psilocybin § Research Due partly to restrictions of the Controlled Substances Act , research in the United States was limited until the early 21st century when psilocybin mushrooms were tested for their potential to treat drug dependence , anxiety and mood disorders .

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] In 2018–19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for studies of psilocybin in depressive disorders.

On a dry weight basis, psilocybin content within the basidiocarp ranges from 0.03% to 1.6% across various Psilocybe species (Anastos et al., 2006; Beug and Bigwood, 1982; Fricke et al., 2019; Gartz et al., 1994; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 1997). However, newly developed lineages with higher average amounts of psilocybin are continuously being produced. A recent survey of 14 Psilocybe species sourced from around the world established that tryptamine content including psilocybin is greatest in P. cyanescens, whereas Psilocybe fus cofulva contains no psilocybin (Gotvaldova ´ et al., 2022). Tryptamines can also vary across varieties of a species, and their individual collec tions as is the case for Psilocybe serbica varieties 'arcana', bohemica' and 'moravica' (Boroviˇcka et al., 2015; Gotvaldova ´ et al., 2022; Reynolds et al., 2018). Psilocybin levels can be on par to an order of magnitude greater than psilocin levels (Borner and Brenneisen, 1987; Gartz et al., 1994; Gotvaldov´ a et al., 2022). [...] With respect to other tryptamines, baeocystin content is absent in some psilocybin-containing species but as high as 0.45% on a dry weight basis in certain species (Christiansen and Rasmussen, 1982; Gartz et al., 1994; Gotvaldova ´ et al., 2022; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 1997). [...] Apart from the abovementioned tryptamines, β-carbolines such as harmane and har mine are also known to occur in Psilocybe, albeit at 0.1% or less of psilocybin levels in these same mushrooms (Blei et al., 2020). [...] Additionally, various compounds can collectively contribute to what is known as "the entourage effect", which describes the synergistic interaction of a variety of different metabolites that enhance the activity of the primary active components (Russo, 2019). Tryptamine concentrations and profiles across different Psilocybe species are highly variable. Thus, the diversity of Psilocybe species results in differential production of an assortment of tryptamines in different concentrations (Glatfelter et al., 2022), which is likely responsible for variable psychoactive effects of various mushrooms.

Magic mushrooms show a large variation in potency; their potency depends on the species or variety that is used, their origin, growing conditions and age. P. cubensis and Psilocybe semilanceata or 'Psilocybe', commonly known as liberty caps, contain 10 mg of psylocybin per gram of dried mushroom weight (1% w/w). Some other species (e.g. Psilocybe azurenscens and Psilocybe bohemica) contain slightly more psylocybin. The averaged dose of psilocybin that induces hallucinogenic effects is 4–10 mg (Beck et al., 1998) or 50–300 μg/kg body weight (Hasler et al., 2004), and therefore the minimum amount of mushrooms needed to get the desired recreational effect is about 1 g of dried magic mushrooms or 10 g of fresh magic mushrooms. The dose 'recommended' for recreational use is reported to be somewhat higher: between 1 and 3.5–5 g of dried mushrooms or 10–50 g for fresh mushrooms (Erowid, 2006). These dose ranges should be interpreted with caution, because it is difficult to estimate the dose of the active or hallucinogenic substance (e.g. psilocybin) into mushrooms (weight or number), as the concentration may vary. Furthermore, in addition to psilocybin and psilocin usually other pharmacologically active substance like indoles, phenylethylamines and baeocystin are present in magic mushrooms. However, as short-term tolerance may develop rapidly to both physical and psychological effect, dosages may have to be increased to obtain the desired effect.

The content of psilocybin and psilocin in hallucinogenic mushrooms varies in the range from 0.2% to 1% of dry weight (Table 2.). [...] Table 2 Content of psilocybin and psilocin in the dry state of selected representatives of psychoactive mushrooms, x=content is not known. [...] An equimolar dose to 1 mol of psilocin is 1.4 mol of psilocybin (Wolbach et al., 1962).

Even though there is interest in the extraction of psilocybin from naturally growing or cultivated mushrooms, the psilocybin yield obtained (0.1–0.2% of dry weight) is not economically viable for drug research and development [...] Recreationally, users typically ingest anywhere between 10–50 g of fresh mushrooms (1–5 g of dried mushrooms), which corresponds to a dosage of about 10–50 mg psilocybin [233].

Total psilocybin and psilocin levels in species known to be used recreationally varied from 0.1% to nearly 2% by dry weight [8]. The medium oral dose of psilocybin is 4–8 mg, which elicits the same symptoms as the consumption of about 2 g of dried Psilocybe Mexicana [9].

Prior to detailing specific strains, it is important to acknowledge that the following examples are predominantly sourced from non-academic, community-based reports. This is due, in part, to legislative restrictions on psilocybin, which have limited formal academic research on Psilocybe species. The following descriptions provide a nuanced understanding of the variety within P. cubensis strains. Among the most prominent strains, 'Golden Teacher' is renowned for its vigorous growth and substantial psychotropic effects, garnering substantial preference among both novices and experienced mycologists. The 'B+' strain is lauded for its resilience and consistent productivity under diverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 'Penis Envy' strain is noted for its exceptional potency and distinct morphological characteristics, which have contributed to its recognition and prominence within the community.

A method for clinical potency determination of psilocybin and psilocin in hallucinogenic mushroom species Psilocybe cubensis was developed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Five strains of dried, intact mushrooms were obtained and analyzed: Blue Meanie, Creeper, B-Plus, Texas Yellow, and Thai Cubensis. [...] From most to least potent, the study found that the average total psilocybin and psilocin concentrations for the Creeper, Blue Meanie, B+, Texas Yellow, and Thai Cubensis strains were 1.36, 1.221, 1.134, 1.103, and 0.879 % (w/w), respectively.

One dosing method of psychedelics is the use of so called "microdoses"—very low concentrations of various psychedelics that do not reach the threshold of perceivable behavioral effects. This is usually 10% of active recreational doses (e.g., 10–15 µg of LSD, or 0.1–0.3 g of dry "magic mushrooms") taken up to three times per week.
