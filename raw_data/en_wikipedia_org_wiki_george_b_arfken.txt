**George Brown Arfken** (November 20, 1922 – October 8, 2020) was an American [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physicist "Theoretical physicist") and the author of several [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") texts.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-1) He was a physics professor at [Miami University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_University "Miami University") from 1952 to 1983 and the chair of the Miami University physics department 1956–1972.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-MUN-2) He was an [emeritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeritus "Emeritus") professor at Miami University.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-3) Arfken was also an authority on [Canadian philately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_Canada "Postage stamps and postal history of Canada").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-4)

Arfken graduated from Montclair High School. He received a [Bachelor of Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering "Bachelor of Engineering") degree in chemical engineering from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University") in 1943. He earned a [master's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree "Master's degree") in physics in 1948 and a [doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate "Doctorate") in 1950, both at Yale.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-MUN-2)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-:0-5)

George was born November 20, 1922, to George, Sr. and Ann (nee Hill) Arfken in Jersey City, NJ. He received a Bachelor of Engineering from Yale in 1943. Enlisting in the [U.S. Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"), he served as a [lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant "Lieutenant") (junior grade) in the Amphibious Forces in the Western Pacific. He returned to Yale in September 1946 and graduated with a Ph.D. in physics in 1950.

Arfken married Carolyn Dines, a graduate of [Westminster College of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_College_(Pennsylvania) "Westminster College (Pennsylvania)"), in 1949, and they raised three children together. She died in 1997. In 1998, Arfken endowed a scholar-in-residence program in her name at [Miami University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_University "Miami University").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-MUN-2)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-:0-5) George married Mary Seet in 1999.

In retirement Arfken played a major role in developing the postal history of Canada for the 60-year period 1851–1911, following the pioneering work of Allan Steinhart. This was primarily a study of the postal rates, the routes the mail followed, and the postal markings on the envelopes and postcards. Arfken wrote one book on the United States' first postage-due stamps and then, with coauthors, nine books on the early Canadian postage and registration stamps. In addition there were over 250 articles in [philatelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philatelic "Philatelic") journals. George was inducted into the Order of the Beaver, the Fellowship of [BNAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BNAPS&action=edit&redlink=1 "BNAPS (page does not exist)"), in 1996, and named a Fellow of the [Royal Philatelic Society of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Philatelic_Society_of_Canada "Royal Philatelic Society of Canada") in 2001. He also received the Royal Philatelic Society of Canada’s Geldert Medal for best article in 1989. For BNAPEX convention exhibits between 1984 and 1996, he received four Gold medals and one Reserve Grand award.

He died in October 2020 at the age of 97.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_B._Arfken#cite_note-7)
