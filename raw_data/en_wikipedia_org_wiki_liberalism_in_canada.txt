Federalism Liberalism Office-holders Political culture Provinces and territories Regions Republicanism Canada portal Politics portal Other countries Category v t e Overview of liberalism in Canada Liberalism ( French : Libéralisme ) has been a major trend in Canadian politics since the late 18th century. Canada has the same features of other liberal democracies in the Western democratic political tradition. This article gives an overview of liberalism in Canada. It includes a brief history of liberal parties with substantial representation in parliament.

Liberal parties [ edit ] Liberal parties developed in both the French and English speaking parts of Canada; these developments led to the formation of the Liberal Party of Canada. Liberal parties exist on a provincial level; however, while they mostly share similar ideologies, not all provincial parties are officially affiliated with the federal party.

In Canada, a "capital-L" Liberal refers to the policies and ideas of the Liberal Party of Canada / Parti Libéral du Canada ( LI member), the most frequent governing party of Canada for the last century and one of the largest liberal parties around the world. The Quebec Liberal Party ( Parti libéral du Québec ) combines liberalism with more conservative ideas. Only federal parties are included in the following timeline. For inclusion in this scheme, it is not necessary for parties to have explicitly labelled themselves as a liberal party.

In 2023, The Saskatchewan Liberal Party changed its name to the Saskatchewan Progress Party , in the same year the British Columbia Liberal Party changed its name to BC United .
