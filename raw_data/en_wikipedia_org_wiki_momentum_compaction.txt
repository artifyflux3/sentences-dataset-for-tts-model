It is used in the calculation of particle paths in circular particle accelerators (like synchrotrons ), and for astronomical objects that are bound by gravitation .

For a perturbed orbit , the momentum compaction factor is defined as the derivative of normalized path length difference to normalized momentum [ 1 ] [ 2 ] α α p = d L / L d p / p = p L d L d p = 1 L ∮ ∮ D x ( s ) ρ ρ ( s ) d s {\displaystyle \alpha _{p}={\frac {\mathrm {d} L/L}{\mathrm {d} p/p}}={\frac {p}{L}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} L}{\mathrm {d} p}}={\frac {1}{L}}\oint {\frac {D_{x}(s)}{\rho (s)}}\mathrm {d} s} .

Furthermore, the momentum compaction is closely connected to the so-called slip-factor [ 3 ] η η {\displaystyle \eta } with the horizontal dispersion D x {\displaystyle D_{x}} and the gyroradius ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } α α p = 1 γ γ 2 + η η {\displaystyle \alpha _{p}={\frac {1}{\gamma ^{2}}}+\eta } wherein γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is the Lorentz factor .
