Two-quadrant analogue of a Jones diagram showing the relationship between a camera's [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length "Focal length"), [crop factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor "Crop factor") and [angles of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view "Angle of view") for two [aspect ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio "Aspect ratio") via its effective focal length – for example, the yellow line shows that 18 mm on 3:2 APS-C is equivalent to 27 mm [full-frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_format "35 mm format") and yields a vertical angle of 48°, and so on

A **Jones diagram** is a type of [Cartesian graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") developed by [Loyd A. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_A._Jones "Loyd A. Jones") in the 1940s, where each axis represents a different [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"). In a Jones diagram opposite directions of an axis represent different quantities, unlike in a Cartesian graph where they represent positive or negative [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") of the same quantity. The Jones diagram therefore represents four variables. Each quadrant shares the vertical axis with its horizontal neighbor, and the horizontal axis with the vertical neighbor. For example, the top left quadrant shares its vertical axis with the top right quadrant, and the horizontal axis with the bottom left quadrant. The overall system response is in [quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry) "Quadrant (plane geometry)") I; the variables that contribute to it are in quadrants II through IV.

A common application of Jones diagrams is in [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography "Photography"), specifically in displaying sensitivity to light with what are also called "[tone reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_reproduction "Tone reproduction") diagrams". These diagrams are used in the design of photographic systems ([film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film "Photographic film"), [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_paper "Photographic paper"), etc.) to determine the relationship between the light a viewer would see at the time a photo was taken to the light that a viewer would see looking at the finished photograph.

The Jones diagram concept can be used for variables that depend successively on each other. Jones's original diagram used eleven quadrants[_[how?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] to show all the elements of his photographic system.
