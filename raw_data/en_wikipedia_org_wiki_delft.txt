Delft ( Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdɛl(ə)ft] ⓘ ) is a city and municipality in the province of South Holland , Netherlands. It is located between Rotterdam , to the southeast, and The Hague , to the northwest. Together with them, it is a part of both the Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area and the Randstad .

Delft is a popular tourist destination in the Netherlands, famous for its historical connections with the reigning House of Orange-Nassau , for its blue pottery , for being home to the painter Jan Vermeer , and for hosting Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). Historically, Delft played a highly influential role in the Dutch Golden Age .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In terms of science and technology, thanks to the pioneering contributions of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and Martinus Beijerinck , [ 11 ] Delft can be considered to be the birthplace of microbiology .

History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Delft Early history [ edit ] The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church, Delft, Summer by Cornelis Springer , 1877 A map of Delft in 1649, by Joan Blaeu The city of Delft came into being beside a canal, the 'Delf', which comes from the word delven , meaning to delve or dig, and this led to the name Delft. At the elevated place where this 'Delf' crossed the creek wall of the silted up river Gantel, a Count established his manor , probably around 1075. Partly because of this, Delft became an important market town, the evidence for which can be seen in the size of its central market square.

Having been a rural village in the early Middle Ages, Delft developed into a city, and on 15 April 1246, Count Willem II granted Delft its city charter . Trade and industry flourished. In 1389 the Delfshavensche Schie canal was dug through to the river Maas , where the port of Delfshaven was built, connecting Delft to the sea.

Until the 17th century, Delft was one of the major cities of the then county (and later province) of Holland . In 1400, for example, the city had 6,500 inhabitants, making it the third largest city after Dordrecht (8,000) and Haarlem (7,000). In 1560, Amsterdam, with 28,000 inhabitants, had become the largest city, followed by Delft, Leiden and Haarlem, which each had around 14,000 inhabitants.

In 1536, a large part of the city was destroyed by the great fire of Delft.

The town's association with the House of Orange started when William of Orange (Willem van Oranje), nicknamed William the Silent (Willem de Zwijger), took up residence in 1572 in the former Saint-Agatha convent (subsequently called the Prinsenhof). At the time he was the leader of growing national Dutch resistance against Spanish occupation, known as the Eighty Years' War . By then Delft was one of the leading cities of Holland and was equipped with the necessary city walls to serve as a headquarters. In October 1573, an attack by Spanish forces was repelled in the Battle of Delft .

After the Act of Abjuration was proclaimed in 1581, Delft became the de facto capital of the newly independent Dutch Republic, as the seat of the Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange .

When William was shot dead on 10 July 1584 by Balthazar Gerards in the hall of the Prinsenhof (now the Prinsenhof Museum ), the family's traditional burial place in Breda was still in the hands of the Spanish. Therefore, he was buried in the Delft Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), starting a tradition for the House of Orange that has continued to the present day.

Around this time, Delft also occupied a prominent position in the field of printing.

A number of Italian glazed earthenware makers settled in the city and introduced a new style. The tapestry industry also flourished when famous manufacturer François Spierincx moved to the city. In the 17th century, Delft experienced a new heyday, thanks to the presence of an office of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) (opened in 1602) and the manufacture of Delft Blue china .

The population in 1848 was estimated at 15,000 inhabitants.

[ 12 ] A number of notable artists based themselves in the city, including Leonard Bramer , Carel Fabritius , Pieter de Hoogh , Gerard Houckgeest , Emanuel de Witte , Jan Steen , and Johannes Vermeer .

Reinier de Graaf and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek received international attention for their scientific research.

Explosion [ edit ] Egbert van der Poel : A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654 The "new" gunpowder store "Kruithuis", built in 1660 on the water of the Delftse Schie for public safety, today in use as a clubhouse The Delft Explosion, also known in history as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred on 12 October 1654 [ 13 ] when a gunpowder store exploded, destroying much of the city. More than 100 were killed and thousands were injured.

[ 14 ] About 30 t (29.5 long tons ; 33.1 short tons ) of gunpowder were stored in barrels in a magazine in a former Clarist convent in the Doelenkwartier district, where the Paardenmarkt is now located. Cornelis Soetens, the keeper of the magazine, opened the store to check a sample of the powder and a huge explosion followed. Fortunately, many citizens were away, visiting a market in Schiedam or a fair in The Hague .

Today, the explosion is primarily remembered for killing Rembrandt 's most promising pupil, Carel Fabritius , and destroying nearly all his works.

Delft artist Egbert van der Poel painted several pictures of Delft showing the devastation.

The gunpowder store (Dutch: Kruithuis) was subsequently re-housed, a 'cannonball's distance away', outside the city, in a new building designed by architect Pieter Post .

[ 15 ] Sights [ edit ] View of Delft by Johannes Vermeer , 1660–1661 View of the horse market in Delft by Pieter Wouwerman , 1665 The city centre retains a large number of monumental buildings, while in many streets there are canals of which the banks are connected by typical bridges, altogether making this city a notable tourist destination.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Delft City Hall Eastern Gate ( Oostpoort ) The Old Church tower Oude Langendijk Culture [ edit ] Delft blue is most famous but there are other kinds of Delftware, like this plate faience in rose Delft is well known for the Delft pottery ceramic products [ 16 ] which were styled on the imported Chinese porcelain of the 17th century. The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the Dutch East India Company . It can still be seen at the pottery factories De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (or Royal Delft) and De Delftse Pauw , while new ceramics and ceramic art can be found at the Gallery Terra Delft .

[ 22 ] The painter Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675) was born in Delft. Vermeer used Delft streets and home interiors as the subject or background in his paintings.

[ 16 ] Several other famous painters lived and worked in Delft at that time, such as Pieter de Hoogh , Carel Fabritius , Nicolaes Maes , Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet. They were all members of the Delft School . The Delft School is known for its images of domestic life and views of households, church interiors, courtyards, squares and the streets of Delft. The painters also produced pictures showing historic events, flowers, portraits for patrons and the court as well as decorative pieces of art.

Delft supports creative arts' companies. From 2001 the Bacinol [ nl ] , a building that had been disused since 1951, began to house small companies in the creative arts sector.

[ 23 ] Its demolition started in December 2009, making way for the new railway tunnel in Delft. The occupants of the building, as well as the name 'Bacinol', moved to another building in the city. The name Bacinol relates to Dutch penicillin research during WWII .

Education [ edit ] TU Delft buildings Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is one of four universities of technology in the Netherlands.

[ 24 ] It was founded as an academy for civil engineering in 1842 by King William II . As of 2022, well over 27,000 students are enrolled.

During his first years at the Technical University of Delft , Beijerinck resumed the research on tobacco mosaic disease that he had started while working with Mayer . Even then, he had appreciated that the affliction was microbial in nature, although he felt that the actual agents had yet to be discovered. Beijerinck's investigations at Delft proved fruitful; he not only confirmed the infectivity of the contagium vivum fluidum —soluble living germ—despite filtration, but he importantly demonstrated that unlike bacteria, the culprit of tobacco disease of plants was incapable of independent growth, requiring the presence of living, dividing host cells in order to replicate." ^ The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge (First ed.).
