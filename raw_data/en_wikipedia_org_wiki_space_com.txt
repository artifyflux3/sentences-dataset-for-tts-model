**Space.com** is an online publication focused on [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") exploration, [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), skywatching and entertainment, with editorial teams based in the United States and United Kingdom. Launched on July 20, 1999,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:2-3) the website offers live coverage of space missions, astronomical discoveries and reviews about skywatching telescopes, binoculars and sci-fi entertainment gear.

It is owned by [Future plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc "Future plc") headquartered in the city of [Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset "Bath, Somerset"), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:2-3) Its stories are often syndicated to other [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media") outlets, including [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN "CNN"), [MSNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC "MSNBC"), [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!"), and _[USA Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA\_Today "USA Today")_.

Space.com was founded on July 20, 1999, on the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, by former CNN anchor [Lou Dobbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs "Lou Dobbs") and Rich Zahradnik in New York City. Dobbs was CEO and Zahradnik the company's first president. Former astronauts [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") and [Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride "Sally Ride") sat on the board of directors.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:1-4)[PaineWebber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paine_Webber "Paine Webber"), [Venrock Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venrock "Venrock"), and SpaceVest were early investors.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:0-5)

The company struggled to turn a profit in its early days and when the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Dot-com bubble") burst in 2000, many felt that it would collapse. Co-founder Rich Zahradnik left his position as president less than two months after the start of the company, former [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut")[Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride "Sally Ride") took his place but then stepped down in September 2000.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-6) Despite some growth, Space.com was not able to achieve what Dobbs had hoped. On May 14, 2001, he returned to CNN.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-7)

After Dobbs exited, the company's backers continued to invest capital.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:0-5) As it expanded, Space.com acquired Explorezone.com in November 1999[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-8) and Starport.com in June 2000.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-9) In October, Space.com also acquired [SpaceNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceNews "SpaceNews"), spacenews.com, and [Florida Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Today "Florida Today")’s Space Online websites from [Gannett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett "Gannett") for an equity stake in the company.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-10) It acquired Sienna Software, the company that produced the Starry Night software.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-:0-5)

In 2018, Space.com—along with other Purch consumer brands—were sold to [Future plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc "Future plc").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com#cite_note-folio20180719-21) Under Future, Space.com has expanded its news and reviews team across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
