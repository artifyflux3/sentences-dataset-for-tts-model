They could be counted as a subcategory of supernova imposters . They have sometimes misleadingly been called unnovae .

[ 1 ] [ failed verification ] Overview [ edit ] Failed supernovae are thought to create stellar black holes by the collapsing of a red supergiant star in the early stages of a supernova. When the star can no longer support itself, the core collapses completely, forming a stellar-mass black hole , and consuming the nascent supernova without having the massive explosion. For a distant observer, the red supergiant star will seem to wink out of existence with little or no flare-up. The observed instances of these disappearances seem to involve supergiant stars with masses above 17 solar masses .

Failed supernovae are one of several events that theoretically signal the advent of a black hole born from an extremely massive star, others including hypernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts .

Structure and process [ edit ] Theoretically, a red supergiant star may be too massive to explode into a supernova , and collapse directly into being a black hole , without the bright flash. They would however generate a burst of gravitational waves . This process would occur in the higher mass red supergiants, explaining the absence of observed supernovae with such progenitors .
