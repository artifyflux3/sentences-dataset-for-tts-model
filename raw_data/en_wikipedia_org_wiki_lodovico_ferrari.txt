Biography [ edit ] Born in Bologna , Lodovico's grandfather, Bartolomeo Ferrari, was forced out of Milan to Bologna. Lodovico settled in Bologna, and he began his career as the servant of Gerolamo Cardano . He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics. Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for quartic equations and cubic equations , and was mainly responsible for the solution of quartic equations that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him. Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy.

[ 1 ] : 300 He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white arsenic poisoning, according to a legend, by his sister.

[ 2 ] : 18 Cardano–Tartaglia formula [ edit ] In 1545 a famous dispute erupted between Ferrari and Cardano's contemporary Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia , involving the solution to cubic equations. Widespread stories that Tartaglia devoted the rest of his life to ruining Ferrari's teacher and erstwhile master Cardano, however, appear to be fabricated.

[ 3 ] Mathematical historians now credit both Cardano and Tartaglia with the formula to solve cubic equations, referring to it as the " Cardano–Tartaglia formula ".
