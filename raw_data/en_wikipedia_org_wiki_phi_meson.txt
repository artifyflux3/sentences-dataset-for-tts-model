Quark structure of the phi meson, is a vector meson formed of a strange quark and a strange antiquark.

It was the ϕ meson's unexpected propensity to decay into K 0 and K 0 that led to the discovery of the OZI rule . It has a mass of 1 019 .461 ± 0.020 MeV/ c 2 and a mean lifetime of 1.55±0.01 × 10 −22 s .

Properties [ edit ] The most common decay modes of the ϕ meson are K + K − at 48.9% ± 0.5% , K 0 S + K 0 L at 34.2% ± 0.4% , and various indistinguishable mixed combinations of rho mesons and pions at 15.3% ± 0.3% .

[ 1 ] In all cases, it decays via the strong force . The pion channel would naïvely be the dominant decay channel because the collective mass of the pions is smaller than that of the kaons, making it energetically favorable; however, that decay route is suppressed by the OZI rule.

Technically, the quark composition of the ϕ meson can be thought of as a mix between s s , u u , and d d states, but it is very nearly a pure s s state.

[ 2 ] This can be shown by deconstructing the wave function of the ϕ into its component parts. We see that the ϕ and ω mesons are mixtures of the SU(3) wave functions as follows.

ϕ ϕ = ψ ψ 8 cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ − − ψ ψ 1 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \phi =\psi _{8}\ \cos \theta \ -\ \psi _{1}\ \sin \theta } , ω ω = ψ ψ 8 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + ψ ψ 1 cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \omega =\psi _{8}\ \sin \theta \ +\ \psi _{1}\ \cos \theta } , where θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the nonet mixing angle, ψ ψ 8 = u u ¯ ¯ + d d ¯ ¯ − − 2 s s ¯ ¯ 6 {\displaystyle \psi _{8}={\frac {\ u{\overline {u}}+d{\overline {d}}-2s{\overline {s}}\ }{\sqrt {6\ }}}~} and ψ ψ 1 = u u ¯ ¯ + d d ¯ ¯ + s s ¯ ¯ 3 .

{\displaystyle \psi _{1}={\frac {\ u{\overline {u}}+d{\overline {d}}+s{\overline {s}}\ }{\sqrt {3\ }}}~.} The mixing angle at which the components decouple completely can be calculated to be arctan ⁡ ⁡ 1 2 ≈ ≈ 35.3 ∘ ∘ .

{\textstyle \ \arctan {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\ }}}\approx 35.3^{\circ }~.} The mixing angle of the ϕ and ω states is calculated from the masses of each state to be about 35˚, which is very close to maximum decoupling. Therefore, the ϕ meson is nearly a pure s s state.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The existence of the ϕ meson was first proposed by the Japanese American particle physicist, J. J. Sakurai , in 1962 as a resonance state between the K 0 and the K 0 .

[ 3 ] It was discovered later by Connolly et al. (1963) in a 20 inch hydrogen bubble chamber at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) in Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY while they were studying K − p + collisions at approximately 2.23 GeV/ c .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In essence, the reaction involved a beam of K − s being accelerated to high energies to collide with protons.

The ϕ meson has several possible decay modes. The most energetically favored mode involves the ϕ meson decaying into three pions , which is what would naïvely be expected. However, we instead observe that it decays most frequently into two kaons .

[ 6 ] Between 1963 and 1966, three people, Susumu Okubo , George Zweig , and Jugoro Iizuka, each independently proposed a rule to account for the observed suppression of the three pion decay.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] This rule is now known as the OZI rule and is also the currently accepted explanation for the unusually long lifetimes of the J/ψ and ϒ mesons.

[ 6 ] Namely, on average they last ~ 7 × 10 −21 s and ~ 1.5 × 10 −20 s respectively.

[ 6 ] This is compared to the normal mean lifetime of a meson decaying via the strong force, which is on the order of 10 −23 s .

[ 6 ] In 1999, a ϕ factory named DAFNE (or DA ϕ NE since the F stands for " ϕ Factory") began operation to study the decay of the ϕ meson in Frascati , Italy .

[ 5 ] It produces ϕ mesons via electron - positron collisions. It has numerous detectors, including the KLOE detector which was in operation at the beginning of its operation.
