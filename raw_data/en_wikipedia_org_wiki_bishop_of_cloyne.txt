In the Roman Catholic Church , it is a separate title; but, in the Church of Ireland , it has been united with other bishoprics .

Pre-Reformation bishops [ edit ] The diocese of Cloyne has its origins in the monastic settlement founded by St Colman in the 6th century.

[ 1 ] Cloyne was not one of the dioceses established at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111, but a bishop of Cloyne was ruling the diocese by 1148, which was recognised at the Synod of Kells in March 1152.

[ 2 ] In 1326, Pope John XXII issued a papal bull for the union of the dioceses of Cork and Cloyne to be united on the death of the bishop of either see. But on the death of Philip of Slane, Bishop of Cork in 1327, the two dioceses remained separate. Bishop Payn of Cloyne obtained a confirmation of the union of the two dioceses from Pope Martin V on 21 September 1418. However, the union did not take effect due to opposition by Bishop Milo fitzJohn of Cork. Bishop Payn of Cloyne resigned in 1429 and Jordan Purcell was appointed bishop of the united see of Cork and Cloyne on 15 June 1429.
