They are named after Abraham Adrian Albert , who pioneered the study of non-associative algebras , usually working over the real numbers . Over the real numbers, there are three such Jordan algebras up to isomorphism .

[ 1 ] One of them, which was first mentioned by Pascual Jordan , John von Neumann , and Eugene Wigner ( 1934 ) and studied by Albert (1934) ,  is the set of 3×3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions , equipped with the binary operation x ∘ ∘ y = 1 2 ( x ⋅ ⋅ y + y ⋅ ⋅ x ) , {\displaystyle x\circ y={\frac {1}{2}}(x\cdot y+y\cdot x),} where ⋅ ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } denotes matrix multiplication.  Another is defined the same way, but using split octonions instead of octonions. The final is constructed from the non-split octonions using a different standard involution.

Over any algebraically closed field , there is just one Albert algebra, and its automorphism group G is the simple split group of type F 4 .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] (For example, the complexifications of the three Albert algebras over the real numbers are isomorphic Albert algebras over the complex numbers.)  Because of this, for a general field F , the Albert algebras are classified by the Galois cohomology group H 1 ( F , G ).

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction applied to an Albert algebra gives a form of the E7 Lie algebra . The split Albert algebra is used in a construction of a 56-dimensional structurable algebra whose automorphism group has identity component the simply-connected algebraic group of type E 6 .

[ 7 ] The space of cohomological invariants of Albert algebras a field F (of characteristic not 2) with coefficients in Z /2 Z is a free module over the cohomology ring of F with a basis 1, f 3 , f 5 , of degrees 0, 3, 5.

[ 8 ] The cohomological invariants with 3-torsion coefficients have a basis 1, g 3 of degrees 0, 3.

[ 9 ] The invariants f 3 and g 3 are the primary components of the Rost invariant .
