Isham , is a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London .

Research [ edit ] Isham's main research interests are quantum gravity and foundational studies in quantum theory . He was the inventor of an approach to temporal quantum logic called the HPO formalism , and has worked on loop quantum gravity and quantum geometrodynamics . Together with other physicists, such as John C. Baez , Isham is known as a proponent of the utility of category theory in theoretical physics. In recent years, since at least 1997, he has been working on a new approach to quantum theory based on topos theory.

He is the author of Modern differential geometry for physicists , first published in 1989.

Isham has appeared in several NOVA television programmes as well as a film about Stephen Hawking . Physicist Paul Davies has described Isham as "Britain's greatest quantum gravity expert".

[ 4 ] As a practising Christian , Isham has also written about the relationships among philosophy , theology , and physics .

Awards [ edit ] 2011: Dirac Medal of the Institute of Physics for his works on quantum gravity .
