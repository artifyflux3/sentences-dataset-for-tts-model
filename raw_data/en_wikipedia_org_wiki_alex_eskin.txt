He is the Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago .

[ 2 ] His research focuses on rational billiards and geometric group theory .

Biography [ edit ] Eskin was born in Moscow on May 19, 1965.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is the son of a Russian-Jewish mathematician Gregory I. Eskin (b. 1936, Kiev), a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles . The family emigrated to Israel in 1974 and in 1982 to the United States.

[ citation needed ] Eskin earned his doctorate from Princeton University in 1993, under the supervision of Peter Sarnak .

[ 4 ] Eskin has been a professor at the University of Chicago since 1999.

[ 5 ] Awards [ edit ] Eskin gave invited talks at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin in 1998, [ 6 ] and in Hyderabad in 2010.

[ 7 ] For his contribution to joint work with David Fisher and Kevin Whyte establishing the quasi-isometric rigidity of solvable groups, Eskin was awarded the 2007 Clay Research Award .

[ 8 ] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 9 ] In April 2015, Eskin was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences .

[ 5 ] [ 10 ] Eskin won the 2020 Breakthrough Prize [ 11 ] [ 12 ] in mathematics for his classification of P {\displaystyle P} -invariant and stationary measures for the moduli of translation surfaces, [ 13 ] in joint work with Maryam Mirzakhani .
