Chongqing is one of the four direct-administered municipalities under the Central People's Government , along with Beijing , Shanghai , and Tianjin . It is the only directly administrated municipality located deep inland.

[ 12 ] The municipality covers a large geographical area roughly the size of Austria , [ 13 ] which includes several disjunct urban areas in addition to Chongqing proper. Due to its classification, the municipality of Chongqing is the largest city proper in the world by population, though Chongqing is not the most populous urban area.

The municipality of Chongqing is the only Chinese city with a resident population of over 30 million; [ 14 ] however, this number includes its large rural population.

[ 13 ] In 2020, Chongqing surpassed Shanghai as China's largest municipality by urban population; as of 2023 [update] , it had an urban population of 22.87 million.

[ 14 ] The municipality contains 26 districts, 8 counties , and 4 autonomous counties . The city served as the wartime capital for the Republic of China (ROC) during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). On 14 March 1997, the current municipality was separated from the surrounding province of Sichuan , with the goal of furthering development in the central and western parts of the country.

[ 15 ] Chongqing is one of China's national central cities . It is a connection in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and a base for the country's Belt and Road Initiative .

[ 16 ] Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport is the second-busiest airport in China, and is one of the top 50 busiest airports in the world.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] The city's monorail system is the world's longest and busiest , as well as having the greatest number of stations, with 70.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Chongqing is ranked as a Beta (global second-tier) city.

[ 21 ] It is the headquarters of the Changan Automobile , one of the " Big Four " car manufacturers in China.

[ 22 ] As of 2023 [update] , the city hosts 12 foreign representations, the fifth-most in China behind Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.

[ 23 ] It is one of the top 40 cities globally by scientific research output; [ 24 ] the municipality is home to several notable universities , including Chongqing University , Southwest University , and Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Chongqing Antiquity [ edit ] Chongqing's location is historically associated with the State of Ba . It was named Jiangzhou ( 江州 ) by a Qin general Zhang Yi .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Imperial era [ edit ] Jiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang 's rule during the Qin dynasty , the successor of the Qin State, as well as the rule of Han dynasty emperors.
Jiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture ( 楚州 ), then again in 581 AD ( Sui dynasty ) to Yu Prefecture ( 渝州 ), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture ( 恭州 ).

[ 30 ] The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, as well as for the city's historic center, where the old town once stood; its name is Yuzhong ( 渝中 , Central Yu).

[ 29 ] It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a "double celebration" ( simplified Chinese : 双重喜庆 ; traditional Chinese : 雙重喜慶 ; pinyin : shuāngchóng xǐqìng , or chóngqìng in short). To mark the occasion of his enthronement, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu .

In 1362 (during the Yuan dynasty ), Ming Yuzhen , a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom ( 大夏 ) at Chongqing for a short time.

[ 31 ] In 1621 (during the Ming dynasty ), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang ( 大梁 ) was established by She Chongming ( 奢崇明 ) with Chongqing as its capital.

[ 32 ] In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan , was captured by Zhang Xianzhong , who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty , immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor .

[ 33 ] In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing.

[ 34 ] The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners, with the proviso that foreign ships should not be at liberty to trade there until Chinese-owned steamers had succeeded in ascending the Yangtze river. This restriction was abolished by the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which declared the city open on the same terms as other ports, although it was not until 1907 that a steamship made the journey without the help of manual haulers.

[ 35 ] From 1896 to 1904, the American, German, French, and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing.

1944 During and after the Second Sino-Japanese War , from November 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 's provisional capital. After the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan , it was formally declared the second capital city ( 陪都 ; péidū ; p'ei 2 -tu 1 ) on 6 September 1940.

[ 40 ] After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in Southeast Asia (Southeast Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell , was based in the city.

The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten , the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell.

[ 41 ] From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous massive bombing campaigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army Air Forces ; battles of which were fought entirely by the Chinese Air Force squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery units.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] Many lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the "City of Heroes" due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during the war. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China and ultimately to Chongqing during years of setbacks in the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city.

Chinese Civil War [ edit ] After World War II ended, Chongqing became one of the last refuges of the Nationalist Kuomintang government on the Chinese mainland during the Chinese Civil War . Following the Yangtze River Crossing campaign , the KMT capital of Nanjing was liberated by the Communists in 23 April. The KMT decamped first to Guangzhou , then Chongqing. Chongqing served as the KMT capital until late November 1949, when the Nationalist KMT government withdrew from the city by air.

[ 44 ] Municipality status [ edit ] A sunset view of Jiefangbei CBD and Hongya Cave, taken in 2017 On 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the sub-provincial city with adjacent Fuling , Wanxian , and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996, and grant it independence from Sichuan. The resulting single entity became Chongqing Municipality, [ 45 ] : 74 containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties without intermediate political levels. The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997.

On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the nine National Central Cities , along with Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou. According to Zhou Liqun, a consultant for National Development and Reform Commission of China, Chongqing's status as a National Central City would encourage the development of Western China . Chongqing, which is located in central-western China, would complement the other National Central Cities, all of which are located along China's eastern coastline.

[ 46 ] The same year on 18 June, the Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which was the third state-level new area at the time of its establishment.

Its climate features frequent monsoon conditions, often raining at night in late spring and early summer. The city's "night rain in the Ba Mountains" features in poems throughout Chinese history, including "Written on a Rainy Night—A Letter to the North" by Li Shangyin .

[ 48 ] Its territory is 470 km (290 mi) from east to west at its longest, and 450 km (280 mi) from north to south at its widest.

[ 49 ] It borders Hubei and Hunan to the east, Sichuan and Shaanxi to the north, and Guizhou to the south.

[ 50 ] The Qutang Gorge on the Yangtze Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Gorge in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The area slopes downward from north to south towards the Yangtze valley, and features a large massif of mountains and hills, with steep sloping areas at different heights.

[ 51 ] Karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap ( Chinese : 龙水峡地缝 ), with its Three Natural Bridges , has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges : the Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling gorges.

[ 52 ] Coming from northwest and running through "the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.

[ 53 ] Leaving at dawn the White Emperor crowned with cloud, I've sailed a thousand li through canyons in a day.

With the monkeys' adieus the riverbanks are loud, My skiff has left ten thousand mountains far away.

— Li Bai's Poem of Chongqing's Baidi Cheng The central urban area of Chongqing, called Chongqing proper, is built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers. With its special topography , Chongqing's topography includes mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. The Tang dynasty poet Li Bai was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram .

[ 54 ] The Zhongliang ( 中梁山 ) and Tongluo ( 铜锣山 ) mountains roughly form the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. Several high mountains are situated outside central Chongqing, including the 1,709.4 m (5,608 ft)-high Wugong Ling Mountain in Jiangjin.

[ citation needed ] Climate [ edit ] In the spring and fall, downtown Chongqing is often enshrouded in fog.

Chongqing has a monsoonal humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cwa ), bordering on a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa ) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the " Three Furnaces " of the Yangtze River, along with Wuhan and Nanjing , its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 34 °C (93 °F) in July and August in the urban area.

[ 55 ] Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 983 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 5% in January to 43% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −1.8 °C (29 °F) on 11 January 1955 (unofficial record of −2.5 °C (27 °F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.7 °C (111 °F) on 18 and 19 August 2022 [ 56 ] (unofficial record of 44.0 °C (111 °F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).

[ 57 ] Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, [ 58 ] is known as the "Fog City" ( Chinese : 雾都 ); this is because in the spring and fall, a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army .

Raffles City Chongqing , sitting in the confluence of Yangtze and Jialing River Politics [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Chongqing See also: List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China The Great Hall of the People serves as the venue for major political conferences in Chongqing.

Since 1997, Chongqing has been a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's leader is Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party , which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party , the country's second highest governing council. Under the USSR-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the CCP and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang , Wang Yang , Bo Xilai , Zhang Dejiang , and Sun Zhengcai , the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee , the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.

The municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor , who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.

[ 73 ] The municipality also has a Municipal People's Congress , theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference ( zhengxie ) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.

Military [ edit ] Chongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (i.e., World War II), and from 1937 to 1945, [ 74 ] the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan .

[ 30 ] After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan , General Chiang Kai-shek and the army were forced to use it as their base of resistance from 1938 onwards.

[ 40 ] It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun .

[ 75 ] Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army , one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region , which was reorganized into the Western Theater Command in 2016.

[ citation needed ] Administrative divisions [ edit ] For a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Chongqing and List of township-level divisions of Chongqing .

Chongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin ), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 km 2 (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2018, the total population is 31.02 million. As of 2022, Chongqing is the largest Chinese city by urban population, with a population of 22.80 million.

In 2010, there were 9,056 Muslims in Chongqing.

[ 93 ] The Jade Emperor at the Fengdu Ghost City Buddhist temple in Jiulongpo Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Chongqing Chongqing was a major recipient of China's investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

[ 94 ] : 298 There has been a massive government push to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial center and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.

[ 95 ] Chongqing is facing rapid urbanization . For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 m 2 (1,470,000 sq ft) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space.

[ 96 ] Thus, Chongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right on 14 March 1997 [ 97 ] in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy).

[ 98 ] By the 2000s the city had become an important industrial area in western China.

[ 99 ] As of 2022 [update] , Chongqing's nominal GDP was US$ 433 billion ( CN¥ 2.91 trilion), about 2.41% of the country's GDP and ranked 16th among province-level administrative units ; the municipality's primary, secondary and tertiary industries were worth CN¥201.21 billion (US$29.92 billion), CN¥1.169 trillion (US$173.86 billion) and CN¥1.542 trillion (US$229.3 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$13,479 (CN¥90,663) and ranked 10th in the country.

[ 87 ] Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei , Anshan , Maanshan , Pingdingshan and Shenyang ), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.

[ 100 ] Traditionally, due to its geographic inaccessibility, Chongqing and Sichuan have both been important military bases in weapons research and development.

[ 101 ] Even though Chongqing's industries are diversified, unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its relatively disadvantageous inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics are common.

Chongqing is China's third largest motor vehicle production center and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles.

[ 102 ] Leading makers of cars and motorbikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise , as well as Ford Motor Company , with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing. The municipality is also one of China's nine largest iron and steel producers in China as well as one of its three major aluminum producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company (重庆钢铁股份有限公司) and Southwest Aluminum (西南鋁業), which is Asia's largest aluminum plant.

[ 103 ] Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese . Coal reserves total approximately 4,800,000,000 metric tons (4.7 × 10 9 long tons; 5.3 × 10 9 short tons). Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m 3 – more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. Although the mining sector has been denounced as heavily polluting and unsafe.

[ note 4 ] Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina ) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Myanmar pipelines . The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing [ 104 ] and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ).

[ 105 ] Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.

[ 106 ] The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment.

[ 102 ] [ 107 ] The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port.

[ 108 ] These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford , [ 109 ] Mazda , [ 110 ] HSBC , [ 111 ] Standard Chartered Bank , [ 112 ] Citibank , [ 113 ] Deutsche Bank , [ 114 ] ANZ Bank , [ 115 ] Scotiabank , [ 116 ] Wal-Mart , [ 117 ] Metro AG [ 118 ] and Carrefour , [ 119 ] among other multinational corporations.

Economic and technological development zones [ edit ] The city includes a number of economic and technological development zones: Chongqing Chemical Industrial Park [ 120 ] Chongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone [ 121 ] Chongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone [ 122 ] Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ) [ 123 ] Chongqing Export Processing Zone [ 124 ] Jianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District) [ 125 ] Liangjiang New Area [ 126 ] Liangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China) [ 127 ] Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone , along with Chengdu and Xi'an .

Education and research [ edit ] As of 2022 [update] , Chongqing hosts 70 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), making it the fourth city with the most higher education institutions nationwide and the first city in Western China , which comprises Chongqing, six provinces ( Sichuan , Guizhou , Yunnan , Shaanxi , Gansu , and Qinghai ), and three autonomous regions ( Tibet , Ningxia , and Xinjiang ), with a combination of more than 290 million population.

[ 128 ] Chongqing is one of the top 40 cities in the world by scientific research outputs as tracked by the Nature Index .

With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.

As of October 2014 [update] , the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core.

[ 131 ] Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.

According to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail .

As of 2017 [update] , four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1 , a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3 , a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown.

[ 132 ] Line 6 , runs between Beibei , a district in the city's far north to downtown.

[ 133 ] Line 5 opened in late 2017.

It was planned that by 2020 CRT would consist of 6 lines and 1 loop line, adding 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the 2012 transportation infrastructure, and 93 new metro stations would be added to the 111 stations in place in 2012.

[ 134 ] By 2050 Chongqing would have 18 lines.

[ 135 ] [ full citation needed ] Aerial tramway [ edit ] An aerial tramway across the Yangtze River in Chongqing CBD Chongqing is the only Chinese city that has kept public aerial tramways . There were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway, of which the Yangtze River Tramway is the only one still operating, now considered a Class 4A tourist attraction. The 1,160-meter (3,810 ft)-long tramway connects the southern and northern banks of the Yangtze River, carrying about 10,000 passengers a day.

Rail [ edit ] Chongqing North railway station Major stations in Chongqing: Chongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 ( Lianglukou Metro station ), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the Jiefangbei CBD in the city center. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North railway station.

Chongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.

Chongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities, completed in 2018.

Shapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Shapingba metro station on Lines 1, 9 and the Loop line. It handles many local and regional train services. It was completed in 2018.

Chongqing East railway station was expected to be completed in 2025.

Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.

Chongqing is a major rail hub regionally.

Chengdu–Chongqing railway (to Chengdu , Sichuan Province) Sichuan–Guizhou railway (to Guiyang , Guizhou Province) Xiangyang–Chongqing railway (to Hubei Province) Chongqing–Huaihua railway (to Hunan Province) Suining–Chongqing railway (to Sichuan Province) Chongqing–Lichuan railway (to Hubei Province) Lanzhou–Chongqing railway (to Gansu Province) River port [ edit ] Hydrofoil on the Yangtze in the outer reaches of the municipality Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang , Wuhan , Nanjing or even Shanghai.

[ citation needed ] In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam . This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.

[ 136 ] Highways [ edit ] Traditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District . In other places, such as Jiangbei , large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning; thus, several ring roads have also been constructed. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. The construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to its neighbors. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.

[ 137 ] Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing's Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a manufacturing center for these types of vehicles.
