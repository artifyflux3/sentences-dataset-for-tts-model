_**Scientific American**_, informally abbreviated _**SciAm**_ or sometimes _**SA**_, is an American [popular science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science "Popular science") magazine. Many scientists, including [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") and [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla"), have contributed articles to it, with more than 150 [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize")-winners having been featured since its inception.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-2)

In print since 1845, it is the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States. _Scientific American_ is owned by [Springer Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Nature "Springer Nature"), which is a subsidiary of [Holtzbrinck Publishing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holtzbrinck_Publishing_Group "Holtzbrinck Publishing Group").

The _[Scientific American building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum\_of\_the\_Peaceful\_Arts "Museum of the Peaceful Arts")_ at 24-26 West 40th Street, commissioned by [Munn and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Ely_Beach#Munn_&_Co. "Alfred Ely Beach") in 1924[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-On_the_Move-3)

_Scientific American_ was founded by inventor and publisher [Rufus Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Porter_(painter) "Rufus Porter (painter)") in 1845[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-scientificamerican1-4) as a four-page weekly newspaper. The first issue of the large-format New York City newspaper was released on August 28, 1845.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-scientificamerican2022-5)

Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the [U.S. Patent Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office "United States Patent and Trademark Office"). It also reported on a broad range of inventions including [perpetual motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion "Perpetual motion") machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln "Abraham Lincoln"), and the [universal joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_joint "Universal joint"), which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a "this date in history" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology. It started as a weekly publication in August 1845 before turning into a monthly in November 1921.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-6)

Porter sold the publication to [Alfred Ely Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Ely_Beach "Alfred Ely Beach"), son of media magnate [Moses Yale Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Yale_Beach "Moses Yale Beach"), and [Orson Desaix Munn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Desaix_Munn "Orson Desaix Munn"), a mere ten months after founding it. Editors and co-owners from the [Yale family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_(surname) "Yale (surname)") included [Frederick C. Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Converse_Beach "Frederick Converse Beach") and his son, [Stanley Yale Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Yale_Beach "Stanley Yale Beach"), and from the Munn family, [Charles Allen Munn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Allen_Munn "Charles Allen Munn") and his nephew, [Orson Desaix Munn II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Desaix_Munn_II "Orson Desaix Munn II").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-7) Until 1948, it remained owned by the families under [Munn & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Ely_Beach#Munn_&_Co. "Alfred Ely Beach").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-scientificamerican1-4) Under Orson Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a "workbench" publication, similar to the 20th-century incarnation of _[Popular Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular\_Science\_(magazine) "Popular Science (magazine)")_.

In the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called _The Sciences_, purchased the assets of the old _Scientific American_ instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partners—publisher [Gerard Piel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Piel "Gerard Piel"), editor Dennis Flanagan, and general manager Donald H. Miller Jr. essentially created a new magazine.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-8) Miller retired in 1979, Flanagan and Piel in 1984, when Gerard Piel's son Jonathan became president and editor; circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948. In 1986, it was sold to the [Holtzbrinck Publishing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holtzbrinck_Publishing_Group "Holtzbrinck Publishing Group") of Germany, which has owned it until the [Springer-Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Nature "Springer Nature") merger. In the fall of 2008, _Scientific American_ was put under the control of Holtzbrinck's [Nature Publishing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Research "Nature Research") division.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-FOLIO-9)

Donald Miller died in December 1998,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-10) Gerard Piel in September 2004 and Dennis Flanagan in January 2005. [Mariette DiChristina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariette_DiChristina "Mariette DiChristina") became editor-in-chief after [John Rennie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rennie_(editor) "John Rennie (editor)") stepped down in June 2009,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-FOLIO-9) and stepped down herself in September 2019. In April 2020, [Laura Helmuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Helmuth "Laura Helmuth") assumed the role of [editor-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief "Editor-in-chief").

The magazine is the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-12)

In 2009, the publisher notified collegiate libraries that yearly subscription prices for the magazine would increase by nearly 500% for print and 50% for online access to $1,500 yearly.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-13)

Offices of the _Scientific American_ have included 37 [Park Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Row_(Manhattan) "Park Row (Manhattan)") in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan") and the [Woolworth Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworth_Building "Woolworth Building") in 1915 when it was just finished two years earlier in 1913.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-On_the_Move-3) The Woolworth Building was at the time one of the first skyscrapers in the city and the tallest one in the world.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-On_the_Move-3)

International editions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_American&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: International editions")]

_Scientific American_ published its first foreign-language edition in 1890 in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), titled _La América Científica é Industrial_, but ended sometime in the early 1900s.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-14) In 1968, the Italian-language edition _, [Le Scienze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le\_Scienze "Le Scienze")_,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-15) was launched followed by the Japanese edition, _日経サイエンス_ (transliteration: _Nikkei Science_) in 1971.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-16)

Subsequent international editions included the Spanish-language revival for [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), _Inveestigación y Ciencia_ ("Investigation and Science") in 1976, the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_Pour la Science_ ("For Science") in 1977, the [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language")_Spektrum der Wissenschaft_ ("Spectrum of Science") in 1978, as well as the [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")_V Mire Nauki_ ([Russian:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") В мире науки; "In the world of science").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-International_Editions-17)

The [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language") edition, published by Prószyński Media, began in 1991 under the name _Świat Nauki_ ("World of Science").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-International_Editions-17)

In 2002, the [Taiwanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") edition, _Scientist_ ([traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 科學人), was established in [Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei "Taipei").That same year, the German-language edition, _Spektrum der Wissenschaft_, introduced _Gehirn & Geist_ ("Brain & Mind"), focusing on psychology and neuroscience.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-International_Editions-17)

In Italy, _Mente & Cervello_ ("Mind & Brain") launched in 2003, complementing the older _Le Scienze_. The [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") edition debuted in 2003, published by Cascade in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp "Antwerp").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-International_Editions-17)

### Editorial controversy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_American&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Editorial controversy")]

In 2013, [Danielle N. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_N._Lee "Danielle N. Lee"), a female scientist who blogged at _Scientific American_, was called a "whore" in an email by an editor at the science website _Biology Online_ after refusing to write professional content without compensation.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-24) Lee wrote a response to the email and posted it on the _Scientific American_ blog.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-25) Then editor-in-chief Mariette DiChristina removed Lee's post, citing legal reasons for removing the blog.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-26) The editor at _Biology Online_ was fired after the incident.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-27)

The controversy widened in the ensuing days. The magazine's blog editor, Bora Zivkovic, was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment by another blogger, Monica Byrne.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-creep-29) Although the alleged incident had occurred about a year earlier, editor Mariette DiChristina informed readers that the incident had been investigated and resolved to Byrne's satisfaction.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-30) However, the incident involving Lee had prompted Byrne to reveal the identity of Zivkovic, following the latter's support of Lee. Zivkovic admitted the incident with Byrne had taken place.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-Zivkovic-31) He apologized to Byrne, and referred to the incident as "singular", stating that his behavior was not "engaged in before or since."[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-Zivkovic-31)

Zivkovic resigned from the board of [Science Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Online "Science Online"), the popular science blogging conference that he co-founded with Anton Zuiker.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-32) Following Zivkovic's admission, several female bloggers, including other bloggers for the magazine, wrote their own accounts, alleging additional incidents of sexual harassment, although none of these accounts were independently investigated.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-35) A day after these new revelations, Zivkovic resigned from his position at _Scientific American_.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-37)

Special _Navy Supplement_, 1898

Scientific American has published numerous special editions over the years, focusing on various scientific topics.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-38) These editions are typically released quarterly and cover themes such as [space settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_settlement "Space settlement") by humans, [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"). For example, the March 2024, (volume 33, issue 1s), included articles with themes about space exploration as well as human [sexual division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_division_of_labour "Sexual division of labour") and [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_differentiation_in_humans "Sexual differentiation in humans") among early-human [hunter-gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer").”[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-39) Similarly, the June 2024 edition, (volume 33, issue 2s), featured pieces on analyzing the "[cosmic nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy) "Void (astronomy)")" and issues in physics raised often by the [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-40)

These special editions are available to subscribers and can be accessed through Scientific American’s archives. The magazine’s archive provides a comprehensive list of past issues, including special editions, dating back to its inception in 1845.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-41)

Scientific American 50 award
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_American&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Scientific American 50 award")]

The **Scientific American 50** award was started in 2002 to recognize contributions to science and technology during the magazine's previous year. The magazine's 50 awards cover many categories including agriculture, communications, defense, environment, and medical diagnostics.

Scientific and political debate
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_American&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Scientific and political debate")]

In April 1950, the U.S. [Atomic Energy Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission "United States Atomic Energy Commission") ordered _Scientific American_ to cease publication of an issue containing an article by [Hans Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe") that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear [hydrogen bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb "Hydrogen bomb"). Subsequent review of the material determined that the AEC had overreacted. The incident was important for the "new" _Scientific American_'s history, as the AEC's decision to burn 3,000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be "[book burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning "Book burning") in a free society" when publisher Gerard Piel leaked the incident to the press.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-48)

In the October 2020 issue of the magazine, it endorsed [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden") for the [2020 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election "2020 United States presidential election"), citing [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")'s rejection of scientific evidence, especially during the [COVID-19 pandemic in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-50) In the column reporting the endorsement, the magazine's editors said, "_Scientific American_ has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-51) In September 2024 and for the second time in its history, for the same reason, _Scientific American_ endorsed [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") for the [2024 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election "2024 United States presidential election").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-52)

In November 2024, editor-in-chief [Laura Helmuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Helmuth "Laura Helmuth") resigned from Scientific American following an apology for a social media post in which she characterized some supporting Trump as fascists.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-Helmuth_resigns-23) Throughout her tenure, many critics (including some of Scientific American's former writers[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-53)) objected to what they viewed as the magazine's shift towards social justice politics at the expense of its scientific credibility.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-55)

*   2012: [Science in Society Journalism Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_Society_Journalism_Awards "Science in Society Journalism Awards"), for the editorial board's piece titled "Ban Chimp Testing."[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-56)
*   2013, the National Association of Science Writers awarded freelancer Douglas Fox in the science reporting category for his article “Witness to an Antarctic Meltdown,” published in _Scientific American_.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-57)
*   2024, Scientific American received seven Telly Awards, which honor excellence in video and television content across all screens. The magazine’s visual compositions on various scientific topics were selected from over 13,000 submissions.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_note-58)

28.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American#cite_ref-28)**Byrne, Monica. Zivkovic said of the meeting, "within five minutes, it was clear that SciAm wasn't a good match for her professional goals. [He] stayed for the coffee out of politeness, but found her offputting and uninteresting as a person. So much emphasis has been put on the subject matter of their conversation, but for [Zivkovic] this was no different than talking to an entomologist about insects: all the writing samples she sent were related to sex and relationships. I was mortified to hear that she understood the conversation as inappropriate, and I did apologize, but not for harassment (there was none), for causing her any discomfort. As a naturalized American, I wasn't raised with all the subtleties that the American madonna/whore culture exposes. And I didn't understand how she could write and talk so freely about sex and yet be offended by our conversation, which was mild in comparison. My interest in her, sexually or otherwise, was zero."
