In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **analytic geometry**, also known as **coordinate geometry** or **Cartesian geometry**, is the study of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") using a [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"). This contrasts with [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry").

Analytic geometry is used in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), and also in [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation"), [rocketry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), [space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science"), and [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"). It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry "Discrete geometry") and [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry").

Usually the Cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and circles, often in two and sometimes three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (two dimensions) and Euclidean space. As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometric shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the [Cantor–Dedekind axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%E2%80%93Dedekind_axiom "Cantor–Dedekind axiom").

The [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") mathematician [Menaechmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menaechmus "Menaechmus") solved problems and proved theorems by using a method that had a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates and it has sometimes been maintained that he had introduced analytic geometry.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-1)

[Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga"), in _[On Determinate Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius\_of\_Perga#De\_Sectione\_Determinata "Apollonius of Perga")_, dealt with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-2) Apollonius in the _Conics_ further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations (expressed in words) of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve _a posteriori_ instead of _a priori_. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-3)

The 11th-century Persian mathematician [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam "Omar Khayyam") saw a strong relationship between geometry and algebra and was moving in the right direction when he helped close the gap between numerical and [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Boyer_Omar_Khayyam_positive_roots-4) with his geometric solution of the general [cubic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-5) but the decisive step came later with Descartes.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Boyer_Omar_Khayyam_positive_roots-4) Omar Khayyam is credited with identifying the foundations of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), and his book _Treatise on Demonstrations of Problems of Algebra_ (1070), which laid down the principles of analytic geometry, is part of the body of Persian mathematics that was eventually transmitted to Europe.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-6) Because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered a precursor to Descartes in the invention of analytic geometry.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Cooper-7): 248

Analytic geometry was independently invented by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") and [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-9) although Descartes is sometimes given sole credit.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-11)_Cartesian geometry_, the alternative term used for analytic geometry, is named after Descartes.

Descartes made significant progress with the methods in an essay titled _[La Géométrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La\_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie "La Géométrie") (Geometry)_, one of the three accompanying essays (appendices) published in 1637 together with his _Discourse on the Method for Rightly Directing One's Reason and Searching for Truth in the Sciences_, commonly referred to as _[Discourse on Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse\_on\_Method "Discourse on Method")_. _La Geometrie_, written in his native [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") tongue, and its philosophical principles, provided a foundation for [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") in Europe. Initially the work was not well received, due, in part, to the many gaps in arguments and complicated equations. Only after the translation into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and the addition of commentary by [van Schooten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_van_Schooten "Frans van Schooten") in 1649 (and further work thereafter) did Descartes's masterpiece receive due recognition.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Katz_1998_loc=pg._442-12)

[Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat") also pioneered the development of analytic geometry. Although not published in his lifetime, a manuscript form of _Ad locos planos et solidos isagoge_ (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci) was circulating in Paris in 1637, just prior to the publication of Descartes' _Discourse_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-15) Clearly written and well received, the _Introduction_ also laid the groundwork for analytical geometry. The key difference between Fermat's and Descartes' treatments is a matter of viewpoint: Fermat always started with an algebraic equation and then described the geometric curve that satisfied it, whereas Descartes started with geometric curves and produced their equations as one of several properties of the curves.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Katz_1998_loc=pg._442-12) As a consequence of this approach, Descartes had to deal with more complicated equations and he had to develop the methods to work with polynomial equations of higher degree. It was [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") who first applied the coordinate method in a systematic study of space curves and surfaces.

Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane. Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: (2,3) in green, (−3,1) in red, (−1.5,−2.5) in blue, and the origin (0,0) in purple.

In analytic geometry, the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") is given a coordinate system, by which every [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") has a pair of [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") coordinates. Similarly, [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is given coordinates where every point has three coordinates. The value of the coordinates depends on the choice of the initial point of origin. There are a variety of coordinate systems used, but the most common are the following:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-stewart-16)

### Cartesian coordinates (in a plane or space)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Cartesian coordinates (in a plane or space)")]

The most common coordinate system to use is the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), where each point has an _x_-coordinate representing its horizontal position, and a _y_-coordinate representing its vertical position. These are typically written as an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") (_x_,_y_). This system can also be used for three-dimensional geometry, where every point in [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is represented by an [ordered triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of coordinates (_x_,_y_,_z_).

### Polar coordinates (in a plane)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Polar coordinates (in a plane)")]

In [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates"), every point of the plane is represented by its distance _r_ from the origin and its [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle")_θ_, with _θ_ normally measured counterclockwise from the positive _x_-axis. Using this notation, points are typically written as an ordered pair (_r_, _θ_). One may transform back and forth between two-dimensional Cartesian and polar coordinates by using these formulae: ![Image 2: {\displaystyle x=r\,\cos \theta ,\,y=r\,\sin \theta ;\,r={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}},\,\theta =\arctan(y/x).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1595272bdc4455a4d82768d81e4b0b663ded6575) This system may be generalized to three-dimensional space through the use of [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinates "Cylindrical coordinates") or [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinates "Spherical coordinates") coordinates.

### Cylindrical coordinates (in a space)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Cylindrical coordinates (in a space)")]

In [cylindrical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinates "Cylindrical coordinates"), every point of space is represented by its height _z_, its [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius")_r_ from the _z_-axis and the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle")_θ_ its projection on the _xy_-plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis.

### Spherical coordinates (in a space)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Spherical coordinates (in a space)")]

In spherical coordinates, every point in space is represented by its distance _ρ_ from the origin, the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle")_θ_ its projection on the _xy_-plane makes with respect to the horizontal axis, and the angle _φ_ that it makes with respect to the _z_-axis. The names of the angles are often reversed in physics.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-stewart-16)

Equations and curves
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Equations and curves")]

In analytic geometry, any [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") involving the coordinates specifies a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of the plane, namely the [solution set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") for the equation, or [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)"). For example, the equation _y_=_x_ corresponds to the set of all the points on the plane whose _x_-coordinate and _y_-coordinate are equal. These points form a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), and _y_=_x_ is said to be the equation for this line. In general, linear equations involving _x_ and _y_ specify lines, [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation") specify [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-intro-17)

Usually, a single equation corresponds to a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") on the plane. This is not always the case: the trivial equation _x_=_x_ specifies the entire plane, and the equation _x_ 2+_y_ 2=0 specifies only the single point (0,0). In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)"), and a curve must be specified as the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of [parametric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-18) The equation _x_ 2+_y_ 2=_r_ 2 is the equation for any circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of r.

Lines in a [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane "Cartesian plane"), or more generally, in [affine coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_coordinates "Affine coordinates"), can be described algebraically by _linear_ equations. In two dimensions, the equation for non-vertical lines is often given in the _[slope-intercept form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope-intercept\_form "Slope-intercept form")_: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle y=mx+b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25e966621217067985694be3afd6801d7d51c5d8) where:

*   _m_ is the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") or [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the line.
*   _b_ is the [y-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept "Y-intercept") of the line.
*   _x_ is the [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable") of the function _y_ = _f_(_x_).

In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector")) to indicate its "inclination".

Specifically, let ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dbe39f0fedae3334af5c4ffaedf25c9778363400) be the position vector of some point ![Image 5: {\displaystyle P_{0}=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2728b2a274122fbaf50539fa2dd9c885afca413), and let ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} =(a,b,c)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/047a3d0e2bfbb1489bd35b5893f621af81df22b0) be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by this point and vector consists of those points ![Image 7: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a), with position vector ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1), such that the vector drawn from ![Image 9: {\displaystyle P_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/671bd891701e0d6cfa6da0114a5dd64233b58709) to ![Image 10: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is perpendicular to ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a720c341f39f52fd96028dab83edd34d400be46). Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1) such that ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} \cdot (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{0})=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6fe639e69965d0feab5bf0e226a8dc40605ae8c) (The dot here means a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"), not scalar multiplication.) Expanded this becomes ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0})=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ce29c22f2cf09d96eeda97a3557f54467b662e7)which is the _point-normal_ form of the equation of a plane.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This is just a [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation"): ![Image 15: {\displaystyle ax+by+cz+d=0,{\text{ where }}d=-(ax_{0}+by_{0}+cz_{0}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18d2d0849a0e8385adf5a444e67557caed73b7f7) Conversely, it is easily shown that if _a_, _b_, _c_ and _d_ are constants and _a_, _b_, and _c_ are not all zero, then the graph of the equation ![Image 16: {\displaystyle ax+by+cz+d=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e85b2d4c03909f8388d6424de28d27870977972)is a plane having the vector ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} =(a,b,c)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/047a3d0e2bfbb1489bd35b5893f621af81df22b0) as a normal.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This familiar equation for a plane is called the _general form_ of the equation of the plane.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-19)

In three dimensions, lines can _not_ be described by a single linear equation, so they are frequently described by [parametric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation"): ![Image 18: {\displaystyle x=x_{0}+at}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bcfb26d76c105816039f492d6578c29e6f82fe33)![Image 19: {\displaystyle y=y_{0}+bt}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01dae44f5a1171d2cfb0e91291e487be09769a2d)![Image 20: {\displaystyle z=z_{0}+ct}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c5b03d36b0aceab492c9df2603f7889233d009b) where:

*   _x_, _y_, and _z_ are all functions of the independent variable _t_ which ranges over the real numbers.
*   (_x_ 0, _y_ 0, _z_ 0) is any point on the line.
*   _a_, _b_, and _c_ are related to the slope of the line, such that the [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") (_a_, _b_, _c_) is parallel to the line.

In the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation") in two variables is always a conic section – though it may be degenerate, and all conic sections arise in this way. The equation will be of the form ![Image 22: {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bxy+Cy^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0{\text{ with }}A,B,C{\text{ not all zero.}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6231e2bf86a2b0c665b6d32d488508b27cef0188) As scaling all six constants yields the same locus of zeros, one can consider conics as points in the five-dimensional [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space")![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{5}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94feef8025176bac59911a46614a019047da614d)

A **quadric**, or **quadric surface**, is a _2_-dimensional [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") in 3-dimensional space defined as the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of a [quadratic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_polynomial "Quadratic polynomial"). In coordinates _x_ 1, _x_ 2,_x_ 3, the general quadric is defined by the [algebraic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equation "Algebraic equation")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-geom-21)

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Distance_Formula.svg/250px-Distance_Formula.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distance_Formula.svg)

The distance formula on the plane follows from the Pythagorean theorem.

In analytic geometry, geometric notions such as [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") and [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") measure are defined using [formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula "Formula"). These definitions are designed to be consistent with the underlying [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"). For example, using [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") on the plane, the distance between two points (_x_ 1,_y_ 1) and (_x_ 2,_y_ 2) is defined by the formula ![Image 27: {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19aef2be1999c1ceca4603c056b96741cafe40ba) which can be viewed as a version of the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). Similarly, the angle that a line makes with the horizontal can be defined by the formula ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \theta =\arctan(m),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdce65e09b4c227955138a3f18579c637e70dce4) where _m_ is the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the line.

In three dimensions, distance is given by the generalization of the Pythagorean theorem: ![Image 29: {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1d6cd0e23208033c817be89edb353f500eb8d04) while the angle between two vectors is given by the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"). The dot product of two Euclidean vectors **A** and **B** is defined by[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-Spiegel2009-22)![Image 30: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} \cdot \mathbf {B} {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\left\|\mathbf {A} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {B} \right\|\cos \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84b1b94234fad93b74741c69f5f16381768aad91) where _θ_ is the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") between **A** and **B**.

Transformations are applied to a parent function to turn it into a new function with similar characteristics.

The graph of ![Image 32: {\displaystyle R(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a45f0bb548f5fe8470b7257809f044c967628eb1) is changed by standard transformations as follows:

There are other standard transformation not typically studied in elementary analytic geometry because the transformations change the shape of objects in ways not usually considered. Skewing is an example of a transformation not usually considered. For more information, consult the Wikipedia article on [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformations "Affine transformations").

For example, the parent function ![Image 33: {\displaystyle y=1/x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1bdbfe1a617026ade72035dc95488195b293590) has a horizontal and a vertical asymptote, and occupies the first and third quadrant, and all of its transformed forms have one horizontal and vertical asymptote, and occupies either the 1st and 3rd or 2nd and 4th quadrant. In general, if ![Image 34: {\displaystyle y=f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2311a6a75c54b0ea085a381ba472c31d59321514), then it can be transformed into ![Image 35: {\displaystyle y=af(b(x-k))+h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/019d183a2d41a81d0b9ec0a6e6a72f1132db6644). In the new transformed function, ![Image 36: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) is the factor that vertically stretches the function if it is greater than 1 or vertically compresses the function if it is less than 1, and for negative ![Image 37: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) values, the function is reflected in the ![Image 38: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)-axis. The ![Image 39: {\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) value compresses the graph of the function horizontally if greater than 1 and stretches the function horizontally if less than 1, and like ![Image 40: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc), reflects the function in the ![Image 41: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)-axis when it is negative. The ![Image 42: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40) and ![Image 43: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a) values introduce translations, ![Image 44: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a), vertical, and ![Image 45: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40) horizontal. Positive ![Image 46: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a) and ![Image 47: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40) values mean the function is translated to the positive end of its axis and negative meaning translation towards the negative end.

Transformations can be applied to any geometric equation whether or not the equation represents a function. Transformations can be considered as individual transactions or in combinations.

Suppose that ![Image 48: {\displaystyle R(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a45f0bb548f5fe8470b7257809f044c967628eb1) is a relation in the ![Image 49: {\displaystyle xy}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c72eb345e496513fb8b2fa4aa8c4d89b855f9a01) plane. For example, ![Image 50: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee594b8851d760d0e2d44aba714907aca657b8f) is the relation that describes the unit circle.

For two geometric objects P and Q represented by the relations ![Image 51: {\displaystyle P(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d5b3d8f37f5458c22b61eaf26e5af0523acb63e2) and ![Image 52: {\displaystyle Q(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97a151e980598f776e01ae247354ba03cf8e8143) the intersection is the collection of all points ![Image 53: {\displaystyle (x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41cf50e4a314ca8e2c30964baa8d26e5be7a9386) which are in both relations.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#cite_note-23)

For example, ![Image 54: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) might be the circle with radius 1 and center ![Image 55: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a): ![Image 56: {\displaystyle P=\{(x,y)|x^{2}+y^{2}=1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f728f570bc8836b5a7b46b6b2fa5f425a4b8bd6) and ![Image 57: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) might be the circle with radius 1 and center ![Image 58: {\displaystyle (1,0):Q=\{(x,y)|(x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/318f4b8728580a51457d964c5395282a1fe8c9f1). The intersection of these two circles is the collection of points which make both equations true. Does the point ![Image 59: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a) make both equations true? Using ![Image 60: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a) for ![Image 61: {\displaystyle (x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41cf50e4a314ca8e2c30964baa8d26e5be7a9386), the equation for ![Image 62: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) becomes ![Image 63: {\displaystyle (0-1)^{2}+0^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/217332fa27d026505a414163c44fce37d76d0809) or ![Image 64: {\displaystyle (-1)^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b0dc632f669ba5bebd0626878471178e3e981c2) which is true, so ![Image 65: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a) is in the relation ![Image 66: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed). On the other hand, still using ![Image 67: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a) for ![Image 68: {\displaystyle (x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41cf50e4a314ca8e2c30964baa8d26e5be7a9386) the equation for ![Image 69: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) becomes ![Image 70: {\displaystyle 0^{2}+0^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d0a40cc97f857828100faa05acccf92eadaad97) or ![Image 71: {\displaystyle 0=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2bb1a7bcdbd7e274b7b8581e4357f09dbeee7fa) which is false. ![Image 72: {\displaystyle (0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d630d3e781a53b0a3559ae7e5b45f9479a3141a) is not in ![Image 73: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) so it is not in the intersection.

The intersection of ![Image 74: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) and ![Image 75: {\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) can be found by solving the simultaneous equations:

![Image 76: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec84b90236512e8d27ff1a8f7707b60b63327de1)![Image 77: {\displaystyle (x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/331c7943db3249a8a312e1b124e722476524bd07)

Traditional methods for finding intersections include substitution and elimination.

**Substitution:** Solve the first equation for ![Image 78: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) in terms of ![Image 79: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and then substitute the expression for ![Image 80: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) into the second equation:

![Image 81: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec84b90236512e8d27ff1a8f7707b60b63327de1)![Image 82: {\displaystyle y^{2}=1-x^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5067b6346afd1b13ce5587a9bb7b96da72cb2ae)

We then substitute this value for ![Image 83: {\displaystyle y^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/888453430f9613fcab7a4ec7a3dfd75260d51427) into the other equation and proceed to solve for ![Image 84: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4): ![Image 85: {\displaystyle (x-1)^{2}+(1-x^{2})=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a164945d50dd1bf898340c7fd6a37eada3b5793)![Image 86: {\displaystyle x^{2}-2x+1+1-x^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e84227e9e2b4964096074f0e6ba80666d7492ae7)![Image 87: {\displaystyle -2x=-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f4fb7bec879eac9c2ca0d90e42b03a2b3538287)![Image 88: {\displaystyle x=1/2.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61a6b977976036ec6d33c07dad1cdcc15e73d9ba)

Next, we place this value of ![Image 89: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) in either of the original equations and solve for ![Image 90: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d):

![Image 91: {\displaystyle (1/2)^{2}+y^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aebe6669ddd4fb369a4b2864b14bb3a50f4cf56b)![Image 92: {\displaystyle y^{2}=3/4}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/580825a4403f3df4e7fe5502af41128b4d37dd58)![Image 93: {\displaystyle y={\frac {\pm {\sqrt {3}}}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/304fcd5fe706b99c13a4f8c2f06208cf596c8570)

So our intersection has two points: ![Image 94: {\displaystyle \left(1/2,{\frac {+{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right)\;\;{\text{and}}\;\;\left(1/2,{\frac {-{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5161e5d5c6ff2ded0e55e36de5765f78921b5e3)

**Elimination**: Add (or subtract) a multiple of one equation to the other equation so that one of the variables is eliminated. For our current example, if we subtract the first equation from the second we get ![Image 95: {\displaystyle (x-1)^{2}-x^{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/21b80830b613e7f6167c6d75ec176444fad80b88). The ![Image 96: {\displaystyle y^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/888453430f9613fcab7a4ec7a3dfd75260d51427) in the first equation is subtracted from the ![Image 97: {\displaystyle y^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/888453430f9613fcab7a4ec7a3dfd75260d51427) in the second equation leaving no ![Image 98: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) term. The variable ![Image 99: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) has been eliminated. We then solve the remaining equation for ![Image 100: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4), in the same way as in the substitution method:

![Image 101: {\displaystyle x^{2}-2x+1-x^{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b14213d430bb40ae4decb48233403e575b119dfc)![Image 102: {\displaystyle -2x=-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f4fb7bec879eac9c2ca0d90e42b03a2b3538287)![Image 103: {\displaystyle x=1/2.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/61a6b977976036ec6d33c07dad1cdcc15e73d9ba)

We then place this value of ![Image 104: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) in either of the original equations and solve for ![Image 105: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d): ![Image 106: {\displaystyle (1/2)^{2}+y^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aebe6669ddd4fb369a4b2864b14bb3a50f4cf56b)![Image 107: {\displaystyle y^{2}=3/4}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/580825a4403f3df4e7fe5502af41128b4d37dd58)![Image 108: {\displaystyle y={\frac {\pm {\sqrt {3}}}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/304fcd5fe706b99c13a4f8c2f06208cf596c8570)

So our intersection has two points: ![Image 109: {\displaystyle \left(1/2,{\frac {+{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right)\;\;{\text{and}}\;\;\left(1/2,{\frac {-{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5161e5d5c6ff2ded0e55e36de5765f78921b5e3)

For conic sections, as many as 4 points might be in the intersection.

One type of intersection which is widely studied is the intersection of a geometric object with the ![Image 110: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 111: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) coordinate axes.

The intersection of a geometric object and the ![Image 112: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)-axis is called the ![Image 113: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)-intercept of the object.

Axis in geometry is the perpendicular line to any line, object or a surface.

Also for this may be used the common language use as a: normal (perpendicular) line, otherwise in engineering as _axial line_.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **normal** is an object such as a line or vector that is [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to a given object. For example, in the two-dimensional case, the **normal line** to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the [tangent line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line "Tangent line") to the curve at the point.

In the three-dimensional case a **surface normal**, or simply **normal**, to a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") at a point _P_ is a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") that is [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to the [tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") to that surface at _P_. The word "normal" is also used as an adjective: a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") normal to a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), the normal component of a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), the **normal vector**, etc. The concept of **normality** generalizes to [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality "Orthogonality").

Spherical and nonlinear planes and their tangents
-------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Spherical and nonlinear planes and their tangents")]

Tangent is the linear approximation of a spherical or other curved or twisted line of a function.

### Tangent lines and planes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analytic_geometry&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Tangent lines and planes")]

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the **tangent line** (or simply **tangent**) to a plane [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") at a given [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") is the [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") that "just touches" the curve at that point. Informally, it is a line through a pair of [infinitely close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve _y_ = _f_(_x_) at a point _x_ = _c_ on the curve if the line passes through the point (_c_, _f_(_c_)) on the curve and has slope _f_'(_c_) where _f_' is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of _f_. A similar definition applies to [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve "Space curve") and curves in _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

As it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the **point of tangency**, the tangent line is "going in the same direction" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.

Similarly, the **tangent plane** to a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") at a given point is the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") that "just touches" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and has been extensively generalized; see [Tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space").

Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic sections and others as well. Since this material has a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintained that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. It was shortcomings in algebraic notations that, more than anything else, operated against the Greek achievement of a full-fledged coordinate geometry.

The Apollonian treatise _On Determinate Section_ dealt with what might be called an analytic geometry of one dimension. It considered the following general problem, using the typical Greek algebraic analysis in geometric form: Given four points A, B, C, D on a straight line, determine a fifth point P on it such that the rectangle on AP and CP is in a given ratio to the rectangle on BP and DP. Here, too, the problem reduces easily to the solution of a quadratic; and, as in other cases, Apollonius treated the question exhaustively, including the limits of possibility and the number of solutions.

The method of Apollonius in the _Conics_ in many respects are so similar to the modern approach that his work sometimes is judged to be an analytic geometry anticipating that of Descartes by 1800 years. The application of references lines in general, and of a diameter and a tangent at its extremity in particular, is, of course, not essentially different from the use of a coordinate frame, whether rectangular or, more generally, oblique. Distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. The Apollonian relationship between these abscissas and the corresponding ordinates are nothing more nor less than rhetorical forms of the equations of the curves. However, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed _a posteriori_ upon a given curve in order to study its properties. There appear to be no cases in ancient geometry in which a coordinate frame of reference was laid down _a priori_ for purposes of graphical representation of an equation or relationship, whether symbolically or rhetorically expressed. Of Greek geometry we may say that equations are determined by curves, but not that curves are determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions derived from a specific geometric situation; [...] That Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry, was probably the result of a poverty of curves rather than of thought. General methods are not necessary when problems concern always one of a limited number of particular cases.

Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050–1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an _Algebra_ that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved."
