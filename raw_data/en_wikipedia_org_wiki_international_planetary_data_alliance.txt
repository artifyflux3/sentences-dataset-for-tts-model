Specific tasks include promoting the international exchange of high-quality scientific data, organized by a set of standards to facilitate data management.

NASA 's Planetary Data System is the de facto standard for archiving planetary data. Member organizations participate in both its Board and on specific projects related to building standards and interoperable systems.

In 2008, a Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) resolution made the IPDA an official body to set standards around the world regarding the archiving of planetary data.
