[ 1 ] It is dedicated to research involving earth observation data taken from satellites, among other specialised activities. The establishment currently hosts the European Space Agency's development team for the Vega launcher .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] ESLAR, a laboratory for advanced research was created in 1966 mainly to break the political deadlock over the location of ESLAB . Later renamed ESRIN, an acronym for European Space Research Institute, ESLAR was based in Frascati (Italy).

[ 3 ] The ESRO Convention describes ESRINs' role in the following manner: ...to undertake laboratory and theoretical research in the basic physics and chemistry necessary to the understanding of past and the planning of future experiments in space.

— ESRO Convention [ 3 ] The facility began acquiring data from environmental satellites within Earthnet programme in the 1970s.
