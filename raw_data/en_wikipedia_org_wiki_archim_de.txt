Not to be confused with Archimedes (disambiguation) .

Archimède in 1961, on launch History France Name Archimède Namesake Archimedes Builder Arsenal de Toulon ( DCAN ) Commissioned 27 July 1961 Decommissioned 1978 Status Preserved at the Cité de la Mer museum General characteristics Type Bathyscaphe Displacement 61 tons The bathyscaphe Archimède is a deep diving research submersible of the French Navy . It used 42,000 US gallons (160,000 L) of hexane as the gasoline buoyancy of its float.

[ 1 ] It was designed by Pierre Willm and Georges Houot .

[ 2 ] In 1964, Archimède descended into "what was then thought to be the deepest part of the Puerto Rico Trench ", [ 3 ] which the NY Times reported as 27,500 feet (8,400 m).

[ 4 ] Archimède was christened on 27 July 1961, at the French Navy base of Toulon . It was designed to go beyond 30,000 feet (9,100 m), [ 5 ] and displaced 61 tons.

[ 6 ] In October 1961, Archimède passed its first dive tests, diving to 5,000 feet (1,500 m) unmanned.

[ 7 ] On 27 November 1961, Archimède achieved a speed of 3 knots (5.6 km/h; 3.5 mph), over a distance of 4.5 miles (7.2 km) at a depth of 7,870 feet (2,400 m) in the Mediterranean Sea.

[ 8 ] On 23 May 1962, Archimède descended to 15,744 feet (4,799 m) off Honshu, Japan , in the Pacific, at the Japan Deep .

[ 9 ] On 15 July 1962, Archimède descended to 31,350 feet (9,560 m) into the Kurile-Kamchatcha Trench , making it the second deepest dive ever, at that point in time, second only to the Bathyscaphe Trieste dive on the Challenger Deep .

[ 10 ] On 12 August 1962, Archimède descended to 30,511 feet (9,300 m) in the Japan Deep south of Tokyo .

[ 11 ] Archimède explored the Mid-Atlantic Ridge jointly with the submarine Cyana and submersible DSV Alvin , in Project FAMOUS (French-American Mid-Ocean Undersea Study) in 1974.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Archimède operated until the 1970s.

[ 16 ] It was placed on reserve in 1975, and decommissioned in 1978.

[ 17 ] Since 2001, Archimède is on display [ 18 ] at the Cité de la Mer museum in Cherbourg.

Archimède was honoured with a stamp in Palau .
