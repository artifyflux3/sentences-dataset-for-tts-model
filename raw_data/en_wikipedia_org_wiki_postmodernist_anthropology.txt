Anthropologists working in this vein of inquiry seek to dissect, interpret and write cultural critiques.

One issue discussed by PM anthropologists is about subjectivity; because ethnographies are influenced by the disposition of the author, should their opinions be considered scientific?

Clifford Geertz , considered a founding member of postmodernist anthropology, [ 1 ] advocates that, “anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third order ones to boot” [ 2 ] In the 21st century, some anthropologists use a form of standpoint theory ; a person's perspective in writing and cultural interpretation of others is guided by their own background and experiences.

Other major tenets of postmodernist anthropology are: an emphasis on including the opinions and perspectives of the people being studied, cultural relativism as a method of inquiry [ 3 ] skepticism towards the claims of science to producing objective and universally valid knowledge [ 4 ] the rejection of grand, universal schemes or theories which explain other cultures (Barrett 1996).

A critique to anthropologists has been to question whether anthropologists may speak/write on behalf of cultural others, a point made by James Clifford in his book Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography (1986).

Margery Wolf states that, “it would be as great a loss to have first-world anthropologists confine their research to the first world as it is (currently) to have third-world anthropologists confine theirs to the third world”.

[ 5 ] In the 21st century, the question has been resolved by pointing out that all cultural descriptions are of cultural others. All ethnographic writing is done by a person from one standpoint writing about others living in a different standpoint. Thus, the notion of anthropologists as 'culture brokers' (see Richard Kurin) has been adopted to explain why anthropologists from any given country write about cultural others.
