For the measure in cycling, see Arthur Eddington § Eddington number for cycling .

Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882–1944) In astrophysics , the Eddington number , N Edd , is the number of protons in the observable universe . Eddington originally calculated it as about 1.57 × 10 79 ; current estimates make it approximately 10 80 .

[ 1 ] The term is named for British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington , who in 1940 was the first to propose a value of N Edd and to explain why this number might be important for physical cosmology and the foundations of physics .

History [ edit ] Eddington argued that the value of the fine-structure constant , α , could be obtained by pure deduction. He related α to the Eddington number, which was his estimate of the number of protons in the universe.

[ 2 ] This led him in 1929 to conjecture that α was exactly 1/136.

[ 3 ] He devised a "proof" that N Edd = 136 × 2 256 , or about 1.57 × 10 79 . Other physicists did not adopt this conjecture and did not accept his argument. It even led to a major journal publishing a joke article making fun of the idea.

[ 4 ] During a course of lectures that he delivered in 1938 as Tarner Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge , Eddington averred that: I believe there are 15 747 724 136 275 002 577 605 653 961 181 555 468 044 717 914 527 116 709 366 231 425 076 185 631 031 296 protons in the universe and the same number of electrons .

[ 5 ] This large number was soon named the "Eddington number".

Shortly thereafter, improved measurements of α yielded values closer to 1/137, whereupon Eddington changed his "proof" to show that α had to be exactly 1/137.

[ 6 ] Current estimates of N Edd point to a value of about 10 80 .

[ 1 ] These estimates assume that all matter can be taken to be hydrogen and require assumed values for the number and size of galaxies and stars in the universe.

[ 7 ] Recent theory [ edit ] The modern CODATA recommended value of α −1 is 137.035 999 177 (21) .

[ 8 ] Consequently, no reliable source maintains any longer that α is the reciprocal of an integer, nor does anyone take seriously a mathematical relationship between α and N Edd .
