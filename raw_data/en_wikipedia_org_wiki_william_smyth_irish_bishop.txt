[ 1 ] He was the ancestor of the prominent landowning family of Barbavilla Manor, Collinstown , County Westmeath .

[ 2 ] Smyth (1644–1699) was born in County Antrim , son of Captain Ralph Smyth(b. 1615 Rosedale Abbey, Yorkshire, d.1689 Lisburn), who had settled in Ireland c.1630 and acquired lands in Antrim and County Down . He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin .

[ 3 ] He was appointed Treasurer of Armagh in 1667; [ 4 ] and a prebendary of Derry in 1670.

[ 5 ] He was Dean of Dromore from 1673 to 1681.

[ 6 ] He became Bishop of Killala and Achonry in 1681 [ 7 ] but translated to Raphoe a year later.

[ 8 ] He spent 12 years at Raphoe before being translated again to Kilmore .

[ 9 ] He was summoned to attend the short-lived Patriot Parliament called by James II of England in 1689. He died on 24 February 1699 and was buried at St Peter, Dublin .

[ 10 ] He married Mary Povey at Saint Michan, Dublin on 29 May 1672, [ 11 ] daughter of Sir John Povey , Lord Chief Justice of Ireland , and Elizabeth Folliott. They had three sons and four daughters.

[ 12 ] He acquired large estates in County Westmeath.

Another son, James , was Archdeacon of Meath . The family home, Barbavilla Manor, belonged to the Smyth family for two centuries.
