Few people live along the shores of the gulf, but there are a few towns and communities, including Sachs Harbour , Ulukhaktok , and Paulatuk . Heading north in the gulf one would find the Prince of Wales Strait . Heading southeast and east, the gulf leads through the Dolphin and Union Strait , past Simpson Bay and into the Coronation Gulf . From there one would go through the Dease Strait and into the Queen Maud Gulf , and eventually head northeast into the Victoria Strait . Heading west and northwest a traveller would first enter the Beaufort Sea and then the Arctic Ocean .
The entire gulf is in the Arctic tundra climate region , characterized by extremely cold winters. In late winter the Amundsen Gulf is covered in sea ice. Most of the ice breaks up in July during a normal year, with some areas in the far eastern and northern part of the gulf only breaking up in August.

Beluga whales , seals, Arctic char , cod , and even salmon use the waters of the gulf.

Sockeye and pink salmon appeared for the first time in nearby waters between 1999 and 2001.
