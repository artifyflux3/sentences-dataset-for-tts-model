Scorpius X-1 was the first extrasolar X-ray source discovered, and, aside from the Sun , it is the strongest apparent non-transient source of X-rays in the sky .

[ 4 ] Discovery and early study [ edit ] The possible existence of cosmic soft X-rays was first proposed by Bruno Rossi , MIT professor and board chairman of American Science and Engineering in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Martin Annis, president of AS&E. Following his urging, the company obtained a contract from the United States Air Force to explore the lunar surface prior to the launch of astronauts to the Moon, and incidentally to perhaps see galactic sources of X-rays.

Subsequently, Scorpius X-1 was discovered in 1962 by a team, under Riccardo Giacconi , who launched an Aerobee 150 sounding rocket carrying a highly sensitive soft X-ray detector designed by Frank Paolini .  The rocket trajectory was slightly off course but still detected a significant emission of soft X-rays that were not coming from the Moon. Thus fortuitously, and as first pointed out by Frank Paolini, Scorpius X-1 became the first X-ray source discovered outside the Solar System . The angular resolution of the detector did not initially allow the position of Scorpius X-1 to be accurately determined. This led to suggestions that the source might be located near the Galactic Center , but it was eventually realized that it lies in the constellation Scorpius.

[ 5 ] As the first discovered X-ray source in Scorpius, it received the designation Scorpius X-1.

The Aerobee 150 rocket launched on June 12, 1962 [ 6 ] or June 19, 1962, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] detected the first X-rays from another celestial source (Scorpius X-1) at J1950 RA 16 h 15 m Dec −15.2°.

[ 6 ] The rocket was designed to observe X-rays from the moon rather than smaller, extrasolar sources, and therefore was unable to accurately retrieve the position and strength of the X-ray signal. The source was estimated to be at J1950 coordinates RA 16 h 15 m Dec −15.2°.

[ 9 ] In 1967, before the discovery of pulsars , Iosif Shklovsky examined X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star accreting matter from a companion.

[ 10 ] Characteristics [ edit ] A broadband optical light curve for V818 Scorpii, adapted from Hynes et al.

(2016) [ 11 ] Its X-ray output is 2.3×10 31 W , about 60,000 times the total luminosity of the Sun.

[ 12 ] Scorpius X-1 shows regular variations of up to 1 magnitude in its intensity, with a period of around 18.9 hours. The source varies irregularly in optical wavelengths as well, but these changes are not correlated with the X-ray variations.

[ 5 ] Scorpius X-1 itself is a neutron star whose intense gravity draws material off its companion into an accretion disk , where it ultimately falls onto the surface, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. As this stellar material accelerates in Scorpius X-1's gravitational field, X-rays are emitted. The measured luminosity for Scorpius X-1 is consistent with a neutron star which is accreting matter at its Eddington limit .

[ 12 ] This system is classified as a low-mass X-ray binary ; the neutron star is roughly 1.4 solar masses , while the donor star is only 0.42 solar masses.

[ 13 ] The origin of the system is a matter of debate. There is evidence that the two stars were not born together; studies based on the reconstruction of the orbit of Sco X-1 suggest that the binary may have been formed by a close encounter inside a globular cluster . However, it is not clear how to reconcile this formation scenario with the circularisation of the binary's orbit.
