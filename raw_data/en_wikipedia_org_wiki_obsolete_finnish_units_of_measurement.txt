Very few of these units are sometimes still used in everyday speech and even when buying and measuring things as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, kappa (sometimes called isokappa ) is still used at markets to measure exactly five liters of potatoes. When ordering firewood, some customers (and even dealers) use syli to refer to a cubic meter, but some old people use the term to refer to various much larger amounts of firewood.

Most Finnish obsolete units of measurement were identical to Swedish units of measurement , including units of length being based on the Swedish "foot" (29.69 cm) that was defined in 1605, since Finland was part of Sweden from the Middle Ages to 1809, but later some Russian units were also used.

The measurements were first standardized by law in 1665 and were revised in 1735. Before this, measurements often varied between towns. The king's bailiff in the town of Porvoo , for example, used two sets of measures: a big one for collecting tax in kind from the populace and a smaller set to remit the assets to the king, keeping the difference for himself.

[ citation needed ] However, nowadays the proverb mitata Porvoon mitalla (to measure in Porvoo units) has a positive meaning of measuring in excess or generously.

Certain units were standardized to the metric system in 1861, and Finland fully converted to the metric system in 1886.

[ 1 ] Length [ edit ] Table of length units Unit Relative value Metric value Imperial value Notes linja 1 ⁄ 144 ~2.06 mm ~0.081 in = Swedish linje ; 1 ⁄ 12 of a tuuma ( tum ), i.e.

1 ⁄ 144 of a jalka ( fot ) tuuma 1 ⁄ 12 ~24.74 mm ~0.97 in = Swedish tum , defined as 1 ⁄ 12 of a jalka ( fot ), nominally the width of a thumb.

Inch translates into tuuma in Finnish.

Metrinen tuuma = 25 mm.

vaaksa 1 ⁄ 2 ~148.44 mm ~5.84 in = Swedish kvarter or kvartdel (both meaning "quarter"); defined as 1 ⁄ 4 of a kyynärä ( aln ) though originally the distance between the tips of little finger and thumb, with fingers fully extended; today defined as 150 mm jalka 1 ~296.9 mm ~11.68 in = Swedish fot , which translates into jalka in Finnish. It is within 1 mm of 296 mm, the commonly accepted length of the Roman foot ( pes ), and was defined in law in 1665 for all of Sweden, which then included Finland, as 1 ⁄ 2 of a kyynärä ( aln ), replacing older regional units of length. And it being very similar to a Roman foot was known, since a proclamation from king Gustavus Adolphus in 1627 referred to the "Roman foot" when ordering the 296.9 mm Swedish fot to be used in the mining areas of central Sweden [ 2 ] kyynärä 2 ~593.8 mm ~1.94 ft = Swedish aln , 2 jalka ( fot ), nominally the distance from the elbow to the fingertips; the unit of length used for measuring everyday lengths, and the base measure that all other units of length, both longer and shorter, were based on. Defined in law in 1605, replacing older regional units of length, based on an aln that had been used in southern Sweden for at least 500 years by then.

Metrinen kyynärä = 500 mm. Cf.

cubit and ell .

syli 6 ~1.78 m ~5.84 ft = Swedish famn , defined as 3 kyynärä ( aln ), though nominally the distance between the fingertips of both hands when the arms are raised horizontally to the sides. In maritime contexts, syli is 1 ⁄ 1,000 of nautical mile (1.852 m). Cf.
