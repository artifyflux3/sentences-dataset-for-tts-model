As with most X-linked disorders, males are more heavily affected than females.

[ 1 ] Females with one affected X chromosome and one normal X chromosome tend to have milder symptoms.

Unlike many other types of intellectual disability, the genetics of these conditions are relatively well understood.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It has been estimated there are ~200 genes involved in this syndrome; of these ~100 have been identified.

[ 4 ] Many of these genes are found on the short 'p' arm of the chromosome, and duplications at Xp11.2 are associated with the syndromic form of the condition.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] X-linked intellectual disability accounts for ~16% of all cases of intellectual disability in males.

[ 7 ] Syndromes [ edit ] Several X-linked syndromes include intellectual disability as part of the presentation. These include: Coffin–Lowry syndrome DDX3X syndrome MASA syndrome MECP2 duplication syndrome Mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia X-linked alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome List of genes [ edit ] Following is a list of genes located on the X chromosome and linked to intellectual disability. There are also several loci that have not been associated with a specific gene.

IQSEC2 : encodes an exchange factor for the Arf family of small GTP binding proteins, involved in the formation of secretory vesicles.

[ 8 ] TM4SF2 : is a member of the 4 transmembrane domains family of proteins ( tetraspanins , see TSPAN7 ). This gene is also associated with neuropsychiatric diseases such as Huntington's chorea .

[ 9 ] AP1S2 : AP-1 complex subunit sigma-2.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Adaptor protein complex 1 is found on the cytoplasmic face of vesicles located at the Golgi complex , where it mediates both the recruitment of clathrin to the membrane and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane receptors.

ACSL4 : Long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase 4 is an enzyme of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family.  It converts free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters , and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation.

[ 12 ] This isozyme preferentially utilizes arachidonate as substrate .

ZNF41 : Zinc finger protein 41  is a likely zinc finger family transcription factor.

[ 13 ] DLG3 : Disks large homolog 3,  also named  neuroendocrine-DLG or synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP-102).

[ 14 ] DLG3 is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) superfamily.

FTSJ1 : Transfert RNA methyltransferase 1 is a member of the S-adenosylmethionine-binding protein family. This nucleolar protein is involved in the processing and modification of tRNA.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] GDI1 : RabGDI alpha makes a complex with geranylgeranylated small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family and keeps them in the cytosol.

MECP2 : methyl CpG binding protein 2  is a transcription regulator, which represses transcription from methylated gene promoters. It appears to be essential for the normal function of nerve cells.

[ 17 ] In contrast to other MBD family members, MECP2 is X-linked and subject to X inactivation .  MECP2 gene mutations are the cause of most cases of Rett syndrome , a progressive neurologic developmental disorder and one of the most common causes of intellectual disability in women.

ARX : Aristaless related homeobox, is a protein associated with intellectual disability and lissencephaly . This gene is a homeobox-containing gene expressed during development. The expressed protein contains two conserved domains, a C-peptide (or aristaless domain) and the prd-like class homeobox domain. It is a member of the group-II aristaless-related protein family whose members are expressed primarily in the central and/or peripheral nervous system. This gene is involved in CNS and pancreas development. Mutations in this gene cause X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy.

[ 18 ] KDM5C : Lysine-specific demethylase 5C is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KDM5C gene a member of the SMCY homolog family and encodes a protein with one ARID domain , one JmjC domain, one JmjN domain and two PHD-type zinc fingers . The DNA-binding motifs suggest this protein is involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling.

[ 19 ] PHF8 : PHD finger protein 8  belongs to the family of ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases , [ 20 ] and is a histone lysine demethylase with selectivity for the di-and monomethyl states.

[ 21 ] FMR2 : Fragile mental retardation 2  (FMR2: synonym AFF2), [ 22 ] the protein belongs to the AFF family which currently has four members: AFF1 /AF4, AFF2/FMR2, AFF3 /LAF4 and AFF4 /AF5q31.

[ 23 ] All AFF proteins are localized in the nucleus and have a role as transcriptional activators with a positive action on RNA elongation. AFF2/FMR2, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31 localize in nuclear speckles (subnuclear structures considered to be storage/modification sites of pre-mRNA splicing factors) and are able to bind RNA with a high apparent affinity for the G-quadruplex structure. They appear to modulate alternative splicing via the interaction with the G-quadruplex RNA-forming structure.

Slc6a8 : Creatine transporter is a protein that is required for creatine to enter the cell.  Creatine is essential for maintaining ATP levels in cells with a high energy demand.
