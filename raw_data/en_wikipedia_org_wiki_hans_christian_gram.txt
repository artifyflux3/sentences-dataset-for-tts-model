Early life and education [ edit ] Gram was the son of Frederik Terkel Julius Gram, a professor of jurisprudence , and Louise Christiane Roulund.

He studied at the University of Copenhagen , and was an assistant for botany to the zoologist Japetus Steenstrup . His study of plants introduced him to the basics of pharmacology and the use of the microscope .

Gram began medical school in 1878 and graduated in 1883. He traveled throughout Europe between 1878 and 1885.

Career [ edit ] Gram stain [ edit ] Main article: Gram staining In Berlin , in 1884, Gram developed a method for distinguishing between two major classes of bacteria .

[ 1 ] This technique, known as Gram staining , continues to be a standard procedure of medical microbiology . This work gained Gram an international reputation. The staining method later played a major role in classifying bacteria . Gram was a modest man, and in his initial publication he remarked, "I have therefore published the method, although I am aware that as yet it is very defective and imperfect; but it is hoped that also in the hands of other investigators it will turn out to be useful." A Gram stain is made using a primary stain of crystal violet and a counterstain of safranin . Bacteria that turn purple when stained are termed 'Gram-positive', while those that turn red when counterstained are termed 'Gram-negative'.

Other work [ edit ] Gram's initial work concerned the study of human red blood cells . He was among the first to recognise that macrocytes were characteristic of pernicious anaemia .

During 1891, Gram taught pharmacology , and later that year was appointed professor at the University of Copenhagen . In 1900, he resigned his professorship of pharmacology to become professor of medicine.

[ 2 ] As a professor, he published four volumes of clinical lectures which became used widely in Denmark . He retired from the University of Copenhagen in 1923, and died in 1938.

[ 2 ] Popular recognition [ edit ] On 13 September 2019, Google commemorated the anniversary of his birth with a Doodle for Canada, Peru, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, India and some European countries.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Personal life [ edit ] Gram's great-granddaughter Lone Gram is a microbiologist who works at the Technical University of Denmark.
