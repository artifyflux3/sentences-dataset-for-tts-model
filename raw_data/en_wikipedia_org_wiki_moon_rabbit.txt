Moon rabbit The image of a rabbit and mortar delineated on the Moon's surface Chinese name Chinese 月兔 Literal meaning moon rabbit Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin yuètù Yue: Cantonese Jyutping jyut6 tou3 Alternative Chinese name Chinese 玉兔 Literal meaning jade rabbit Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin yùtù Yue: Cantonese Jyutping juk6 tou3 Vietnamese name Vietnamese alphabet thỏ ngọc Chữ Hán 兔玉 Korean name Hangul 달토끼 Transcriptions Revised Romanization daltokki Japanese name Kanji 月の兎 Transcriptions Romanization tsuki no usagi The Moon rabbit , Moon hare or Jade rabbit is a mythical figure in both East Asian and indigenous American folklore , based on interpretations that identify the dark markings on the near side of the Moon as a rabbit or hare . In East Asian mythology, the rabbit is seen as pounding with a mortar and pestle , but the contents of the mortar differ among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese folklore. In Chinese folklore , the rabbit, Yutu , is often portrayed as a companion of the Moon goddess Chang'e , constantly pounding the elixir of life [ 1 ] for her and some show the making of cakes or rice cakes; but in Japanese and Korean versions, the rabbit is pounding the ingredients for mochi or tteok or some other type of rice cakes ; in the Vietnamese version, the Moon rabbit often appears with Hằng Nga and Chú Cuội, and like the Chinese version, the Vietnamese Moon rabbit also pounding the elixir of immortality in the mortar. In some Chinese versions, the rabbit pounds medicine for the mortals and some include making of mooncakes. Moon folklore from certain Amerindian cultures of North America also has rabbit themes and characters.

History [ edit ] The Chinese mythological white hare making the elixir of immortality on the Moon  embroidered onto an eighteenth-century Imperial Chinese robe An early Chinese source called the Chu Ci , a Western Han anthology of Chinese poems from the Warring States period , notes that along with a toad , there is a hare on the Moon who constantly pounds herbs for the immortals . This notion is supported by later texts, including the Song -era Taiping Imperial Reader . As rabbits were not yet introduced to China during Western Han, the original image was not a rabbit but a hare.

[ 2 ] Han dynasty poets call the hare on the Moon the "Jade Hare" ( 玉兔 ) or the "Gold Hare" ( 金兔 ), and these phrases were used often, in place of the word for the Moon. The famed Tang poet Li Bai , relates how "The rabbit in the moon pounds the medicine in vain" in his poem, "The Old Dust".

[ 3 ] East Asian folklore [ edit ] Sun Wukong fights the Moon Rabbit, a scene in the sixteenth century Chinese novel, Journey to the West , depicted in Yoshitoshi 's One Hundred Aspects of the Moon In the Buddhist Jataka tales , [ 4 ] Tale 316 relates that a monkey , an otter , a jackal , and a rabbit resolved to practice charity on the day of the full moon ( Uposatha ), believing a demonstration of great virtue would earn a great reward. When an old man begged for food from them, the monkey gathered fruits from the trees and the otter collected fish, while the jackal found a lizard and a pot of milk-curd. Knowing only how to gather grass, the rabbit instead offered its own body by throwing itself into a fire the man had prepared. However, the rabbit was not burnt and the old man revealed that he was Śakra . Touched by the rabbit's virtue, he drew the likeness of the rabbit on the Moon for all to see. It is said the lunar image is still draped in the smoke that rose when the rabbit cast itself into the fire. The rabbit is believed to be a Bodhisattva .

A version of this story may be found in the Japanese anthology, Konjaku Monogatarishū , where the rabbit's companions are instead a fox and a monkey.

The Moon rabbit legend is popular and part of local folklore throughout Asia. It may be found in diverse cultures in China, Japan, India, Korea, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] This legend also gave rise to the Mid-Autumn Festivals of China, Tết Trung Thu of Vietnam, Tsukimi of Japan, and Chuseok of Korea, and Sampeah Preah Khae in Cambodia, all of which celebrate the legend of the Moon rabbit. In Vietnamese mythology, the Jade Rabbit on the Moon is often accompanied by the Moon Lady and Cuội , who sits under a magical banyan . The trio has become the personifications of the holiday, when they descend to the mortal world and give out cellophane lanterns , mooncakes and gifts to children.

[ 8 ] In Journey to the West , when Tang Sanzang passes through India on his journey, a demoness wants to marry him so that she can absorb his yang essence and increase her powers.

Sun Wukong sees through her disguise and fights with her. Just as Sun Wukong is about to defeat the demoness, accompanied by the fairy Chang'e, Taiyin Xingjun descends on a colored cloud. The Monkey King hastily puts away his iron rod, saying, "Old Taiyin, where are you going? I, Sun Wukong, have been avoiding you." Taiyin replies, "The demon you are facing is the Jade Rabbit, who guards the mystical frost elixir in my Guanghan Palace. She secretly unlocked the jade gate and escaped from the palace, and it has been a year since then. I foresee she is currently in grave danger, so I have come to save her. I hope the Great Sage will spare her for my sake." Sun Wukong reluctantly agrees, and Taiyin Xingjun takes the Jade Rabbit to the Moon and assigns her duties.

Another Mesoamerican legend tells of the brave and noble sacrifice of Nanahuatzin during the creation of the fifth sun. Humble Nanahuatzin sacrificed himself in fire to become the new sun, but the wealthy god Tecciztecatl hesitated four times before he finally set himself alight to become the Moon. Due to Tecciztecatl's cowardice, the deities felt that the Moon should not be so bright as the Sun, so one of the deities threw a rabbit at his face to diminish his light.

When they reached the Moon, the rabbit touched the crane's head with a bleeding paw, leaving the red mark cranes wear to this day. According to the legend, on clear nights, Rabbit still may be seen riding the Moon.
