[ 1 ] The dry-bulb temperature is the temperature that is usually thought of as air temperature , and it is the true thermodynamic temperature . It is directly proportional to the mean kinetic energy of the air molecules. Temperature is usually measured in degrees Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), or degrees Fahrenheit (°F). If expressed in kelvins, then the symbol is T a , if expressed in Celsius or Fahrenheit, then the symbol is t a . When measuring dry-bulb temperature, care should be taken to prevent the sensor from being subjected to radiation from neighbouring heat sources.

[ 1 ] To minimize the effects of radiation on the sensor, one could reduce the sensor's emission factor, or reduce the temperature difference between the sensor and the surrounding surfaces, or add a thin ventilated reflective screen.

[ 1 ] Unlike wet-bulb temperature , dry-bulb temperature does not indicate the amount of moisture in the air ( humidity ). The dry-bulb temperature is one of the main inputs for thermal comfort calculations and it is also used for assessing the heat transfer by convection . The dry-bulb temperature is an important variable in psychrometrics , being the horizontal axis of a psychrometric chart .
