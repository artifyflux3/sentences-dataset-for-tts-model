More generally, the current social sciences and humanities present themselves as knowledge about human beings and their societies and cultures. Still, its theorising mistakes the Western cultural experience for a universal human experience and reduces other cultures to (pale and erring) variants of the West. One of the challenges, then, is to understand Western culture by looking at its descriptions of other cultures. One of the next challenges is to understand the Indian culture. How has this culture understood human beings, societies and cultures?
