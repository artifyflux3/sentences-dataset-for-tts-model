_**Space**_ (also known as _**James A. Michener's Space**_) is a 1985 American [television miniseries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries "Miniseries") starring [James Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner "James Garner") as Sen. Norman Grant. It is based on the 1982 [novel of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(Michener_novel) "Space (Michener novel)") by [James A. Michener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Michener "James A. Michener") that aired on [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS"). Like the novel, the miniseries is a fictionalised history of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")[space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_program "Space program").

_Space_ won an [Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award "Emmy Award"), for film sound mixing. It originally aired from April 14 through 18, 1985, and consisted of five parts running a total of 13 hours. In subsequent showings, it was cut to nine hours.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(miniseries)#cite_note-1)

Norman Grant ([James Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner "James Garner")) is a former war hero turned senator who tirelessly promotes the American space program despite almost insurmountable opposition. Other principal players include John Pope ([Harry Hamlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hamlin "Harry Hamlin")), who, after failing to win his way to Annapolis, matriculates from a Navy recruit to a naval officer, Naval Aviator, test pilot and pioneering astronaut in the company of fellow space-traveler Randy Claggett ([Beau Bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Bridges "Beau Bridges")); Penny Hardesty Pope ([Blair Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Brown "Blair Brown")), an ambitious and beautiful counsel to Senator Grant since his election and wife of John Pope; Leopold Strabismus ([David Dukes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dukes "David Dukes")), a hedonistic wheeler-dealer who hopes to capitalize on the [1947 UFO scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_incident "Roswell incident"); German rocket scientist Dieter Kolff ([Michael York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_York_(actor) "Michael York (actor)")), whose ideals (or lack thereof) are put to the test when he shifts his allegiance from the Nazis to the Americans; and Stanley Mott ([Bruce Dern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dern "Bruce Dern")), an aeronautical engineer whose secret assignment is to make certain that men like Kolff aren't snatched up by the Soviets after the fall of Germany.
