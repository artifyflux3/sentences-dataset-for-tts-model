In mathematics , the composition operator C ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle C_{\phi }} with symbol ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is a linear operator defined by the rule C ϕ ϕ ( f ) = f ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle C_{\phi }(f)=f\circ \phi } where f ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle f\circ \phi } denotes function composition . It is also encountered in composition of permutations in permutations groups.

The study of composition operators is covered by AMS category 47B33 .

In physics [ edit ] In physics , and especially the area of dynamical systems , the composition operator is usually referred to as the Koopman operator , named after Bernard Koopman [ 1 ] [ 2 ] . Its wild surge in popularity [ 3 ] is sometimes jokingly called "Koopmania" [ 4 ] - a popularity that has begun spreading in Machine Learning as well [ 5 ] . It is the left-adjoint of the transfer operator of Frobenius–Perron.

In Borel functional calculus [ edit ] Using the language of category theory , the composition operator is a pull-back on the space of measurable functions ; it is adjoint to the transfer operator in the same way that the pull-back is adjoint to the push-forward ; the composition operator is the inverse image functor .

Since the domain considered here is that of Borel functions , the above describes the Koopman operator as it appears in Borel functional calculus .

In holomorphic functional calculus [ edit ] The domain of a composition operator can be taken more narrowly, as some Banach space , often consisting of holomorphic functions : for example, some Hardy space or Bergman space . In this case, the composition operator lies in the realm of some functional calculus , such as the holomorphic functional calculus .

Interesting questions posed in the study of composition operators often relate to how the spectral properties of the operator depend on the function space .  Other questions include whether C ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle C_{\phi }} is compact or trace-class ; answers typically depend on how the function φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } behaves on the boundary of some domain.

When the transfer operator is a left- shift operator , the Koopman operator, as its adjoint, can be taken to be the right-shift operator. An appropriate basis, explicitly manifesting the shift, can often be found in the orthogonal polynomials . When these are orthogonal on the real number line, the shift is given by the Jacobi operator .

[ 6 ] When the polynomials are orthogonal on some region of the complex plane (viz, in Bergman space ), the Jacobi operator is replaced by a Hessenberg operator .

[ 7 ] Applications [ edit ] In mathematics, composition operators commonly occur in the study of shift operators , for example, in the Beurling–Lax theorem and the Wold decomposition . Shift operators can be studied as one-dimensional spin lattices .  Composition operators appear in the theory of Aleksandrov–Clark measures .

The eigenvalue equation of the composition operator is Schröder's equation , and the principal eigenfunction f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} is often called Schröder's function or Koenigs function .

The composition operator has been used in data-driven techniques for dynamical systems in the context of dynamic mode decomposition algorithms, which approximate the modes and eigenvalues of the composition operator.
