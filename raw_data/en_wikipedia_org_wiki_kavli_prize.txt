Country Norway Presented by Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters The Kavli Foundation Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research Reward(s) A gold medal, a scroll, and a monetary award of US$ 1,000,000 First award 2008 Number of laureates 21 prizes to 54 laureates (as of 2021 [update] ) Website http://www.kavliprize.no The Kavli Prize was established in 2005 as a joint venture of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters , the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research , and the Kavli Foundation . It honors, supports, and recognizes scientists for outstanding work in the fields of astrophysics , nanoscience and neuroscience . Three prizes are awarded every second year. Each of the three Kavli Prizes consists of a gold medal, a scroll, and a cash award of US$1,000,000. The medal has a diameter of 70 millimetres (2.8 in), a thickness of 5 millimetres (0.20 in), and weighs 311 grams (11.0 oz).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The first Kavli Prizes were awarded on 9 September 2008 in Oslo , presented by Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway .
