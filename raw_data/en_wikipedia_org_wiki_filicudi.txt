Geography [ edit ] The Aeolian Islands.

Its total area is 9.5 km 2 (3.7 sq mi). There are several small villages on the island, which include Pecorini Mare and Valdichiesa.  Filicudi's lands are capable of producing wine, olive oil , grain, and vegetables.  In 1997, three-quarters, approximately 7 km 2 (2.7 sq mi) of Filicudi was turned into a Natural Reserve.

The highest point is Monte Fossa Felci at 774 m (2,539 ft).  Other points include Monte Montagnola at 349 m (1,145 ft) and Monte Terrione at 278 m (912 ft).  
At Capo Graziano are the remains of a Bronze Age village dating back to the second millennium BCE.  Off the coast, the volcanic finger-like rock of La Canna rises about 74 metres (243 ft) above the sea.

History [ edit ] View of Alicudi and Filicudi The modern name of "Filicudi" is a corruption of the ancient Greek name for the island, Phoenicusa (Phoenician island).  The island, like the other Aeolian Islands , was settled since the Neolithic Age , around 3000 BCE.  As evidenced by archaeological findings, the island was occupied by a new people during the Bronze Age .  The island was uninhabited for many centuries until occupied by the Greeks .

Roman and Byzantine remains can also be found on the island.

By 1971, the island had 270 residents.  Roughly one-third of them left, however, after 26 May of that year, when Italian police used Filicudi as a place of exile for 18 reputed leaders of the Italian Mafia who were awaiting trial for on charges of organized crime.

[ 2 ] By 31 May, the remaining residents left in protest, with the exception of the exiles and the police guarding them.

[ 3 ] Since the 1970s Filicudi was rediscovered and populated by photographers and artists such as Sergio Libiszewsky, Ettore Sottsass , novelist Roland Zoss , and editor Giulio Einaudi .  Their perceptions brought the island into the focus of modern tourism.
