For example, a glass breaking on the floor is an event; it occurs at a unique place and a unique time.

[ 1 ] Strictly speaking, the notion of an event is an idealization , in the sense that it specifies a definite time and place, whereas any actual event is bound to have a finite extent, both in time and in space.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The spacetime interval between two events: ( interval ) 2 = [ event time separation ] 2 − − [ event space separation ] 2 {\displaystyle ({\text{interval}})^{2}=\left[{\frac {\text{event time}}{\text{separation}}}\right]^{2}-\left[{\frac {\text{event space}}{\text{separation}}}\right]^{2}} is an invariant .

[ 4 ] : 9 An event in the universe is caused by the set of events in its causal past. An event contributes to the occurrence of events in its causal future.

Upon choosing a frame of reference, one can assign coordinates to the event: three spatial coordinates x → → = ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle {\vec {x}}=(x,y,z)} to describe the location and one time coordinate t {\displaystyle t} to specify the moment at which the event occurs. These four coordinates ( x → → , t ) {\displaystyle ({\vec {x}},t)} together form a four-vector associated to the event.

One of the goals of relativity is to specify the possibility of one event influencing another. This is done by means of the metric tensor , which allows for determining the causal structure of spacetime. The difference (or interval) between two events can be classified into spacelike , lightlike and timelike separations. Only if two events are separated by a lightlike or timelike interval can one influence the other.

P. W. Bridgman found the event concept insufficient for operational physics in his book The Logic of Modern Physics .

By "event" we mean an instantaneous occurrence that can be characterized by a point in space and a corresponding moment of time.
