In mathematics , a convex body in n {\displaystyle n} - dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a compact convex set with non- empty interior . Some authors do not require a non-empty interior, merely that the set is non-empty.

A convex body K {\displaystyle K} is called symmetric if it is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin; that is to say, a point x {\displaystyle x} lies in K {\displaystyle K} if and only if its antipode , − − x {\displaystyle -x} also lies in K .

{\displaystyle K.} Symmetric convex bodies are in a one-to-one correspondence with the unit balls of norms on R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Some commonly known examples of convex bodies are the Euclidean ball , the hypercube and the cross-polytope .

Metric space structure [ edit ] Write K n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}^{n}} for the set of convex bodies in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . Then K n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}^{n}} is a complete metric space with metric d ( K , L ) := inf { ϵ ϵ ≥ ≥ 0 : K ⊂ ⊂ L + B n ( ϵ ϵ ) , L ⊂ ⊂ K + B n ( ϵ ϵ ) } {\displaystyle d(K,L):=\inf\{\epsilon \geq 0:K\subset L+B^{n}(\epsilon ),L\subset K+B^{n}(\epsilon )\}} .

[ 1 ] Further, the Blaschke Selection Theorem says that every d -bounded sequence in K n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}^{n}} has a convergent subsequence.

[ 1 ] Polar body [ edit ] If K {\displaystyle K} is a bounded convex body containing the origin O {\displaystyle O} in its interior, the polar body K ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle K^{*}} is { u : ⟨ ⟨ u , v ⟩ ⟩ ≤ ≤ 1 , ∀ ∀ v ∈ ∈ K } {\displaystyle \{u:\langle u,v\rangle \leq 1,\forall v\in K\}} . The polar body has several nice properties including ( K ∗ ∗ ) ∗ ∗ = K {\displaystyle (K^{*})^{*}=K} , K ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle K^{*}} is bounded, and if K 1 ⊂ ⊂ K 2 {\displaystyle K_{1}\subset K_{2}} then K 2 ∗ ∗ ⊂ ⊂ K 1 ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle K_{2}^{*}\subset K_{1}^{*}} . The polar body is a type of duality relation.
