Belief that a species, group, or era is 'extraordinary' Exceptionalism is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is " exceptional " (i.e., unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication, whether or not specified, that the referent is superior in some way.

Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today it is particularly applied with respect to particular nations or regions.

Other uses of the term include medical and genetic exceptionalism.

History [ edit ] Further information: Historic recurrence The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the Volk , comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions.  Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a "national spirit", or "soul of the people" (in German: Volksgeist ).  This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands—especially in ones ruled by élites from somewhere else.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the United States, Australia (especially in South Australia [ 3 ] ), [ 4 ] China, France, Germany, Greece, [ 5 ] Pakistan, Imperial Japan, Iran, Serbia, Israel, North Korea, South Africa, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Spain, the UK, the USSR, Thailand [ 8 ] [ 9 ] and Lebanon.

[ 10 ] Historians have added many other cases, including historic empires such as China, the Ottoman Empire , ancient Rome , and ancient India , along with a wide range of minor kingdoms in history.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Criticism [ edit ] Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to historicism in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons.

[ citation needed ] A group may assert exceptionalism in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications.

[ citation needed ] This can be an example of special pleading , a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons.

[ citation needed ] Exceptionalism is often based on poor historical knowledge.

[ 13 ] Separateness [ edit ] J. Bradford DeLong has used the term "exceptionalism" to describe the economic growth of post- World War II Western Europe .

[ 14 ] Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to historicism in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. Political scientist Noritada Matsuda writes, "[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries." [ 15 ] In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert exceptionalism , with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of special pleading , a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison.

[ citation needed ] The term "exceptionalism" can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the United States government to join various international treaties is sometimes called "exceptionalist".

[ 16 ] Medical exceptionalism [ edit ] Use of the term " HIV exceptionalism " implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions [ 17 ] or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases.
