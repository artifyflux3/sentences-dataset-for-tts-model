**Atomic, molecular, and optical physics** (**AMO**) is the study of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter")–matter and [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light")–matter interactions, at the scale of one or a few [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-nap-1) and energy scales around several [electron volts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_volt "Electron volt").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 1356 [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-chen-3) The three areas are closely interrelated. AMO theory includes [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"), [semi-classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiclassical_physics "Semiclassical physics") and [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics") treatments. Typically, the theory and applications of [emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum"), [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)"), [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering "Scattering") of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") (light) from [excited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state")[atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), analysis of spectroscopy, generation of [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") and [masers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser "Maser"), and the optical properties of matter in general, fall into these categories.

Atomic and molecular physics
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Atomic and molecular physics")]

**Atomic physics** is the subfield of AMO that studies atoms as an isolated system of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and an [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nuclei "Atomic nuclei"), while **molecular physics** is the study of the physical properties of [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"). The term _atomic physics_ is often associated with [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power "Nuclear power") and [nuclear bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_bomb "Nuclear bomb"), due to the [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym "Synonym") use of _atomic_ and _nuclear_ in [standard English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English "Standard English"). However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics"), which considers [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") alone. The important experimental techniques are the various types of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"). [Molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_physics "Molecular physics"), while closely related to [atomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_physics "Atomic physics"), also overlaps greatly with [theoretical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_chemistry "Theoretical chemistry"), [physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry "Physical chemistry") and [chemical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_physics "Chemical physics").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-4)

Both subfields are primarily concerned with [electronic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_structure "Electronic structure") and the dynamical processes by which these arrangements change. Generally this work involves using quantum mechanics. For molecular physics, this approach is known as [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry"). One important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential [atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the [molecular orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital "Molecular orbital") theory.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-5) Molecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is additionally concerned with effects due to the [molecular structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_structure "Molecular structure"). Additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete [energy levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level "Energy level"). The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational [spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum") are in the far [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") region (about 30 - 150 [μm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9Cm "Μm")[wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength")) of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"). [Vibrational spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrational_spectroscopy_of_linear_molecules "Vibrational spectroscopy of linear molecules") are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5 μm) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") regions. From measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-6)

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of _atomic, molecular, and optical physics_. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

**Optical physics** is the study of the generation of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"), the properties of that radiation, and the interaction of that radiation with [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-7) especially its manipulation and control.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-8) It differs from general [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") and [optical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_engineering "Optical engineering") in that it is focused on the discovery and application of new phenomena. There is no strong distinction, however, between optical physics, applied optics, and optical engineering, since the devices of optical engineering and the applications of applied optics are necessary for [basic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research "Basic research") in optical physics, and that research leads to the development of new devices and applications. Often the same people are involved in both the basic research and the applied technology development, for example the experimental demonstration of [electromagnetically induced transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetically_induced_transparency "Electromagnetically induced transparency") by [S. E. Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Harris "S. E. Harris") and of [slow light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_light "Slow light") by Harris and [Lene Vestergaard Hau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lene_Vestergaard_Hau "Lene Vestergaard Hau").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-10)

Researchers in optical physics use and develop light sources that span the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") from [microwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") to [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"). The field includes the generation and detection of light, linear and [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics "Nonlinear optics") optical processes, and [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"). [Lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser") and [laser spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_spectroscopy "Laser spectroscopy") have transformed optical science. Major study in optical physics is also devoted to [quantum optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics "Quantum optics") and [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)"), and to [femtosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond "Femtosecond") optics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-nap-1) In optical physics, support is also provided in areas such as the nonlinear response of isolated atoms to intense, ultra-short electromagnetic fields, the atom-cavity interaction at high fields, and quantum properties of the electromagnetic field.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-11)

Other important areas of research include the development of novel optical techniques for nano-optical measurements, [diffractive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffractive_optics "Diffractive optics"), [low-coherence interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry "Interferometry"), [optical coherence tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography "Optical coherence tomography"), and [near-field microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_scanning_optical_microscope "Near-field scanning optical microscope"). Research in optical physics places an emphasis on ultrafast optical science and technology. The applications of optical physics create advancements in [communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing "Manufacturing"), and even [entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment "Entertainment").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-12)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Bohr_atom_model.svg/250px-Bohr_atom_model.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_model.svg)

The [Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") of the [Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom")

One of the earliest steps towards _atomic physics_ was the recognition that matter was composed of _atoms_, in modern terms the basic unit of a [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). This theory was developed by [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton") in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were - although they could be described and classified by their observable properties in bulk; summarized by the developing [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"), by [John Newlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Reina_Newlands "John Alexander Reina Newlands") and [Dmitri Mendeleyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleyev "Dmitri Mendeleyev") around the mid to late 19th century.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-R.E._Dickerson,_I._Geis_1976-13)

Later, the connection between atomic physics _and_ optical physics became apparent, by the discovery of [spectral lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") and attempts to describe the phenomenon - notably by [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer "Joseph von Fraunhofer"), [Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel "Fresnel"), and others in the 19th century.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-14)

From that time to the 1920s, physicists were seeking to explain [atomic spectra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectra "Atomic spectra") and [blackbody radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody_radiation "Blackbody radiation"). One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the [Bohr atom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_atom_model "Bohr atom model").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-R.E._Dickerson,_I._Geis_1976-13)

Experiments including [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") and matter - such as the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect"), [Compton effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_effect "Compton effect"), and spectra of sunlight the due to the unknown element of [Helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), the limitation of the Bohr model to Hydrogen, and numerous other reasons, lead to an entirely new mathematical model of matter and light: [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-15)

### Classical oscillator model of matter

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Classical oscillator model of matter")]

Early models to explain the origin of the [index of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") treated an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") in an atomic system classically according to the model of [Paul Drude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Drude "Paul Drude") and [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz"). The theory was developed to attempt to provide an origin for the wavelength-dependent refractive index _n_ of a material. In this model, incident [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves") forced an electron bound to an atom to [oscillate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation"). The [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude "Amplitude") of the oscillation would then have a relationship to the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of the incident electromagnetic wave and the [resonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance "Resonance") frequencies of the oscillator. The [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle") of these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead to a wave which moved more slowly.

### Early quantum model of matter and light

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Early quantum model of matter and light")]

[Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") derived a formula to describe the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field") inside a box when in [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium") in 1900.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 8–9  His model consisted of a superposition of [standing waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_waves "Standing waves"). In one dimension, the box has length _L_, and only sinusoidal waves of [wavenumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber "Wavenumber")

![Image 2: {\displaystyle k={\frac {n\pi }{L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/587e5d187030cbcf4199f77390e6edb8c3fafdf2)
can occur in the box, where _n_ is a positive [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") (mathematically denoted by ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \scriptstyle n\in \mathbb {N} _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ac9a62f2975c197acae3bb33aa402c69d99fd7d)). The equation describing these standing waves is given by:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle E=E_{0}\sin \left({\frac {n\pi }{L}}x\right)\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/547f9912ffff3795eb78284379d04064b6a2f9ec).
where _E_ 0 is the magnitude of the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") amplitude, and _E_ is the magnitude of the electric field at position _x_. From this basic, [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law") was derived.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 4–8, 51–52

In 1911, [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") concluded, based on [alpha particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle") scattering, that an atom has a central pointlike proton. He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr"), in 1913, combined the [Rutherford model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model "Rutherford model") of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 9–10

These results, based on a _discrete_ set of specific standing waves, were inconsistent with the _continuous_ classical oscillator model.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 8

Work by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in 1905 on the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") led to the association of a light wave of frequency ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468) with a photon of energy ![Image 6: {\displaystyle h\nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3cc23768f43b26085f80e1882a94b31d24abd653). In 1917 Einstein created an extension to Bohrs model by the introduction of the three processes of [stimulated emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulated_emission "Stimulated emission"), [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission") and [absorption (electromagnetic radiation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 11

The largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation of quantum mechanics with the [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics") approach by [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") and the discovery of the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") by [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 12

There are a variety of semi-classical treatments within AMO. Which aspects of the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classically is dependent on the specific problem at hand. The semi-classical approach is ubiquitous in computational work within AMO, largely due to the large decrease in computational cost and complexity associated with it.

For matter under the action of a laser, a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic or molecular system is combined with the system being under the action of a classical electromagnetic field.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 14  Since the field is treated classically it can not deal with [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Haken-16): 16  This semi-classical treatment is valid for most systems,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 997  particular those under the action of high intensity laser fields.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 724  The distinction between optical physics and quantum optics is the use of semi-classical and fully quantum treatments respectively.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 997

Within collision dynamics and using the semi-classical treatment, the internal degrees of freedom may be treated quantum mechanically, whilst the relative motion of the quantum systems under consideration are treated classically.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 556  When considering medium to high speed collisions, the nuclei can be treated classically while the electron is treated quantum mechanically. In low speed collisions the approximation fails.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 754

Classical Monte-Carlo methods for the dynamics of electrons can be described as semi-classical in that the initial conditions are calculated using a fully quantum treatment, but all further treatment is classical.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics#cite_note-Drake-2): 871

Isolated atoms and molecules
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Isolated atoms and molecules")]

Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons, whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its [molecular hydrogen ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_hydrogen_ion "Molecular hydrogen ion"). It is concerned with processes such as [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization"), [above threshold ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_threshold_ionization "Above threshold ionization") and [excitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers molecules in a [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") or [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") then the time-scales for molecule-molecule interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic and molecular processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual molecules can be treated as if each were in isolation for the vast majority of the time. By this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory in [plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") and [atmospheric physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_physics "Atmospheric physics") even though both deal with huge numbers of molecules.

Electronic configuration
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Electronic configuration")]

Electrons form notional [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell "Electron shell") around the nucleus. These are naturally in a [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ([photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon")), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).

Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [bound state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state"). The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy"). Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") according to the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy"). The atom is said to have undergone the process of [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization").

In the event that the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it may transition to an [excited state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") or to a [virtual state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_state_(physics) "Virtual state (physics)"). After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state via [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission"). The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy. However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the [Auger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auger_effect "Auger effect") may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are strict [selection rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_rules "Selection rules") as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light—however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.
