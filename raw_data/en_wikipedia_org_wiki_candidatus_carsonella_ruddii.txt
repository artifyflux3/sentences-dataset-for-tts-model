C. ruddii Binomial name Candidatus Carsonella ruddii Thao et al. 2000 " Candidatus Carsonella ruddii" is an obligate endosymbiotic Gammaproteobacterium [ 1 ] with  one of the smallest genomes of any characterised bacteria.

[ 2 ] This is the first, and as of February 2022 the only [ 3 ] [ 4 ] species described from the genus Candidatus Carsonella , named after Rachel Carson .

[ 5 ] Endosymbiosis [ edit ] The species is an endosymbiont that is present in all species of phloem sap-feeding insects known as psyllids .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The endosymbionts occurs in a specialised structure known as the bacteriome .

C. ruddii is not completely parasitic in its relationship with its host insect; it supplies the host with some essential amino acids. It is therefore probably in the evolutionary process of becoming an organelle , similar to the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells that also evolved from an endosymbiont.

[ 7 ] Genome [ edit ] In 2006 the genome of Ca.

C. ruddii strain Pv (Carsonella-Pv) of the hackberry petiole gall psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta , was sequenced at RIKEN in Japan and the University of Arizona . It was shown that the genome consists of a circular chromosome of 159,662 base pairs and that it has a high coding density (97%) with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length. The number of predicted genes was 182, also the lowest on record ( NCBI-Genome ). In comparison, Mycoplasma genitalium , which has the smallest genome of any free-living organism, has a genome of 521 genes. Numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing, suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle -like status.

[ 2 ] At the time of its sequencing, C. ruddii was thought to have the smallest genome of any characterized bacterial species.

[ 8 ] Nasuia deltocephalinicola is now considered to have the known smallest bacterial genome (112kb).

[ 9 ] C. ruddii and related species appear to be actively undergoing gene loss .
