Biography [ edit ] Bunbury was the second son of Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet , and the grandson of Henry Bunbury ; his mother was Louisa Emilia Fox, daughter of Henry Edward Fox . He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge .

[ 1 ] He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1841.

In 1847, Bunbury was elected to the House of Commons for Bury St Edmunds , a seat he held until 1852. In 1886, he succeeded his elder brother in the baronetcy.

Bunbury died of pneumonia in March 1895, aged 83.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He never married and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew, Charles .

[ 3 ] Work [ edit ] Bunbury's two-volume history of ancient geography [ 4 ] published in 1879 is the first modern work in English which treats the textual sources with any sophistication.

He was also a contributing author to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854–57), [ 5 ] and to a number of other reference works.

Samuel Sharpe thought Bunbury had plagiarised his work on the Ptolemies.
