He studied chemistry at the Charles University in Prague , where he received his PhD in 1881. In the same year, he became professor at the ETH Zürich , where he worked with Victor Meyer . In 1888, his son Victor Goldschmidt was born; Victor later became a renowned mineralogist and founder of modern geochemistry. After working at the University of Amsterdam with Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff in 1894 and 1895, Heinrich Goldschmidt became a full professor at the ETH. He left the ETH in 1901 for the University of Oslo . He worked there until his retirement in 1929 at the age of 72. As his son Victor became a professor for mineralogy at the University of Göttingen in 1929, he moved with him to Göttingen , but both had to leave there after the Nazis came to power, and father and son returned to Oslo in 1935. Heinrich Jacob Goldschmidt died in Oslo in 1937.
