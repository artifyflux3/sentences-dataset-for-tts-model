( April 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In 1855, he introduced Fick's laws of diffusion , which govern the diffusion of a gas across a fluid membrane. In 1870, he was the first to measure cardiac output , using what is now called the Fick principle .

Fick managed to double-publish his law of diffusion, as it applied equally to physiology and physics. His work led to the development of the direct Fick method for measuring cardiac output .

Anecdotal [ edit ] Fick's nephew, Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick , invented the contact lens .
