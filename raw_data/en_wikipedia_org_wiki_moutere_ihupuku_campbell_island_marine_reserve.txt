[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is administered by the Department of Conservation with assistance from the Royal New Zealand Navy .

[ 3 ] Visitors are allowed on guided tours, but must have a permit and follow rules to keep their impact to a minimum.

[ 1 ] Geography [ edit ] Campbell island is New Zealand's southern-most island, located 660 kilometres south of the South Island . It also includes an area of sea about 100 metres around the island its islets, and an area of territorial sea about 200 metres deep.

[ 1 ] The island consists of the eroded remains of a shield volcano, with large cliffs, boulder beaches and some sandy beaches, with sheltered inlets, exposed rocky reef and deep soft sediment. Underwater surveys have identified pinnacles of basalt , extensive sponge beds , seaweed-encrusted reefs, and boulder fields with an abundance of very large spider crabs .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The reserve was established on 2 March 2014, [ 4 ] on the same day as the Moutere Mahue / Antipodes Island Marine Reserve and Moutere Hauriri / Bounty Islands Marine Reserve .

[ 1 ] The reserve occupies 39% of the territorial sea of the island group.

Bottom trawling , seining and dredging are also banned in the remaining 61% of the territorial seas.

[ 1 ] In 2018, following a review of the marine reserve and consultation with Ngāi Tahu and Te Ohu Kaimoana , the Government opted not to extent the reserve to the remaining 61% of territorial seas.

[ 5 ] Wildlife [ edit ] The marine reserve has the world's largest population of the Southern royal albatross , [ 6 ] and has globally significant breeding grounds for five other albatross and mollyhawk species.

Rockhopper penguins , New Zealand sea lions , Southern elephant seals and New Zealand fur seals also breed around the islands.

[ 1 ] Marine mammals and seabirds often forage close to shore if they have young to feed. Some species forage over thousands of kilometres before returning to land.
