Find sources: "Singular distribution" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2024 ) A singular distribution or singular continuous distribution is a probability distribution concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure zero , for which the probability of each point in that set is zero.

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] Such distributions are not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure .

A singular distribution is not a discrete probability distribution because each discrete point has a zero probability.  On the other hand, neither does it have a probability density function , since the Lebesgue integral of any such function would be zero.

In general, distributions can be described as a discrete distribution (with a probability mass function), an absolutely continuous distribution (with a probability density), a singular distribution (with neither), or can be decomposed into a mixture of these.

[ 1 ] Example [ edit ] An example is the Cantor distribution ; its cumulative distribution function is a devil's staircase . Less curious examples appear in higher dimensions. For example, the upper and lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds are singular distributions in two dimensions.
