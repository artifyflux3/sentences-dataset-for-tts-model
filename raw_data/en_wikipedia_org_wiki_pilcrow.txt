Pilcrow in typefaces: [Neue Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Helvetica "Neue Helvetica"), [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial "Arial"), [Consolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas "Consolas"), Adobe [Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond_(typeface) "Garamond (typeface)") Pro, [Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville_(typeface) "Baskerville (typeface)") Old Face, [Palatino Linotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino_Linotype "Palatino Linotype"), and [Gentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentium "Gentium")

In [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"), the **pilcrow** (**¶**) is a [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") used to identify a [paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph "Paragraph"). In editorial production the _pilcrow_ typographic character is also known as the **paragraph mark**, the **paragraph sign**, the **paragraph symbol**, the **paraph**, and the **blind P**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-style-1)

In writing and editorial practice, authors and editors use the pilcrow glyph to indicate the start of separate [paragraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraphs "Paragraphs"), and to identify a new paragraph within a long block of text without paragraph indentions, as in the book _An Essay on Typography_ (1931), by [Eric Gill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill "Eric Gill").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-2) In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), the practice of [rubrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubrication "Rubrication") (type in red-ink) used a red pilcrow to indicate the beginning of a different [train of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_of_thought "Train of thought") within the author's narrative without paragraphs.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-3)

The letterform of the pilcrow resembles a minuscule q or a mirrored majuscule P, with a usually-doubled backbone reaching from the [descender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender "Descender") to the [ascender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography) "Ascender (typography)") height. The [bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface_anatomy "Typeface anatomy") on the left side can be filled or empty, and occasionally extends far enough downward that the character resembles a mirrored D. The aforementioned backbone is usually straight, but in some fonts curves toward the bowl.

The English word _pilcrow_ derives from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): παράγραφος [[_parágraphos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraphos "Paragraphos")], "written in the side" or "written in the margin". In Old French, _parágraphos_ became the word _paragraphe_ and later _pelagraphe_. The earliest English language reference to the modern pilcrow is in 1440, with the Middle English word _pylcrafte_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-4)

### Use in Ancient Greek

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pilcrow&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Use in Ancient Greek")]

Three short paragraphs on making gunpowder in the manuscript [GNM 3227a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNM_3227a "GNM 3227a") (Germany, c. 1400); the first paragraph is marked with an early form of the pilcrow sign, the two following paragraphs are introduced with _litterae notabiliores_ (enlarged letters).

Possible development from _capitulum_ to modern paragraph symbol.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-General-6)

The first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original παράγραφος [_parágraphos_], which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-7) As the _paragraphos_ became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter [Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma "Gamma") (⟨Γ⟩, ⟨γ⟩) and later into _[litterae notabiliores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial "Initial")_, which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-8)

The above notation soon changed to the letter ⟨K⟩, an abbreviation for the Latin word _[caput](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/caput "wikt:caput")_, which translates as "head", i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-9) Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word _[capitulum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/capitulum "wikt:capitulum")_, which translates as "little head", was used, and the letter ⟨C⟩ came to mark a new section, or chapter,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-10) in 300 BC.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-11)

In the 1100s, ⟨C⟩ had completely replaced ⟨K⟩ as the symbol for a new chapter.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-General-6)[Rubricators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubrication "Rubrication") eventually added one or two [vertical bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar "Vertical bar") to the C to stylize it (as ⸿); the "[bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_(typography) "Bowl (typography)")" of the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow, ¶.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-General-6)

Scribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow rubricators to add a hand-drawn pilcrow in contrasting ink. With the introduction of the printing press from the late medieval period on, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to complete by hand. If it was not practical to complete the rubrication, books might be sold with the spaces before the paragraphs left blank, thus creating the typographical practice of [indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_(typesetting) "Indentation (typesetting)").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-12)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Doves_Press_Bible.jpg/250px-Doves_Press_Bible.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Doves_Press_Bible.jpg)

Opening page of Genesis from the Doves Bible ([Doves Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_Press "Doves Press"), 1902): pilcrow used as a verse marker

The pilcrow remains in use in modern documents in the following ways:

*   In [legal writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing "Legal writing"), it is often used whenever one [cites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_citation "Legal citation") a specific paragraph within [pleadings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleadings "Pleadings"), [law review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_review "Law review") articles, [statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute "Statute"), or other legal documents and materials. It is also used to indicate a paragraph break within quoted text.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-13)
*   In academic writing, it is sometimes[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] used as an in-text referencing tool to make reference to a specific paragraph from a document that does not contain page numbers, allowing the reader to find where that particular idea or statistic was sourced. The pilcrow sign followed by a number indicates the paragraph number from the top of the page. It is rarely used when citing books or journal articles.
*   In [web publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_publishing "Web publishing") style guides, a pilcrow may be used to indicate an [anchor link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#Anchor "Hyperlink").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-14)
*   In [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading"), it indicates an instruction that one paragraph should be split into two or more separate paragraphs. The proofreader inserts the pilcrow at the point where a new paragraph should begin.
*   In some [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church "High-church")[Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican "Anglican") and [Episcopal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States) "Episcopal Church (United States)") churches, it is used in the printed order of service to indicate that instructions follow; these indicate when the [congregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church "Parish church") should stand, sit, and kneel, who participates in various portions of the service, and similar information. [King's College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge "King's College, Cambridge") uses this convention in the service booklet for the [Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Nine_Lessons_and_Carols "Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols"). This is analogous to the writing of these instructions in red in some rubrication conventions.

The pilcrow is also often used in [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processing "Word processing") and [desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing "Desktop publishing") software:

*   As the [toolbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar")[icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing) "Icon (computing)") used to toggle the display of formatting marks, such as tabs and paragraph breaks.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-15)
    *   As the symbol for a paragraph break, shown when display is requested.

The pilcrow may indicate a [footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote") in a convention that uses a set of distinct typographic symbols in turn to distinguish between footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of [footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote") symbols beginning with the [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-style-1) (The modern convention is to use numbers or letters in superscript form.)

The pilcrow [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") was encoded in the 1984 [Multinational Character Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Character_Set "Multinational Character Set") ([Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation")'s extension to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")) at 0xB6 (decimal 182), subsequently adopted by [ISO/IEC 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1 "ISO/IEC 8859-1") ("ISO Latin-1", 1987) at the same [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point"), and thence by [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") as U+00B6¶PILCROW SIGN. In addition, Unicode also defines U+204B⁋REVERSED PILCROW SIGN, U+2761❡CURVED STEM PARAGRAPH SIGN ORNAMENT, and U+2E3F⸿CAPITULUM. The capitulum character is obsolete, being replaced by pilcrow, but is included in Unicode for backward compatibility and historic studies.

The pilcrow symbol was included in the [default hardware codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_hardware_codepage "Default hardware codepage")[437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage_437 "Codepage 437") of [IBM PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC") (and all other 8-bit [OEM codepages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OEM_codepage "OEM codepage") based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), which is an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")[control character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character "Control character").

Paragraph signs in non-Latin writing systems
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pilcrow&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Paragraph signs in non-Latin writing systems")]

In [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") and other [Indian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India "Languages of India"), text blocks are commonly written in stanzas. Two vertical bars, [॥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A5%A5 "॥"), called a "double _daṇḍa_", are the functional equivalent of a pilcrow.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-Ruppel-19)

In [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language "Thai language"), the character [๏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B9%8F "๏") marks the beginning of a stanza and [ฯะ](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%B8%AF%E0%B8%B0&action=edit&redlink=1 "ฯะ (page does not exist)") or [๚ะ](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%B9%9A%E0%B8%B0&action=edit&redlink=1 "๚ะ (page does not exist)") marks the end of a stanza.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow#cite_note-Thai-20)

In [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script#Punctuation "Geʽez script"), the characters [፠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%8D%A0 "፠") and [፨](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%8D%A8 "፨") can mark a section/paragraph.

In China, the [〇](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%80%87 "〇"), which has been used as a [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero") character since the 12th century, has been used to mark paragraphs in older Western-made books such as the [Chinese Union Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Union_Version "Chinese Union Version") of the Bible.
