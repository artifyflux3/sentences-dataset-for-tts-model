The Global East is a region of the world which has varying definitions. It can be narrowly construed as incorporating the Far Eastern [ a ] parts of Asia, or more broadly, it can incorporate much of Eurasia , [ 5 ] including regions such as Eastern Europe , the former Soviet Union , and the Middle East .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Because of the ambiguity in defining the term, sometimes this region is also referred to as the Global Easts .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The term can also refer to the impact of eastern regions of the world on the broader world through diasporic and other relationships.

[ 10 ] The Global East is considered to have features of both the Global North and Global South , being sometimes referred to as a liminal space between the two.

[ 11 ] A major theme in parts of the Global East is postsocialism .

[ 12 ] [ 6 ] See also [ edit ] Old World Eurasianism Eastern world Global Southeast Global Northwest Notes [ edit ] ^ Comprising East and Southeast Asia , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] although sometimes South Asia is included as well.
