The neutron star is usually in a wide highly elliptical orbit around the Be star. The Be stellar wind forms a disk confined to a plane often different from the orbital plane of the neutron star. When the neutron star passes through the Be disk, it accretes a large mass of hot gas in a short time. As the gas falls onto the neutron star, a bright flare in hard X-rays is seen.

[ 2 ] Definition and classification [ edit ] Be/X-ray binaries belong to the high-mass X-ray binary category. The optical companion is a non- supergiant , fast-rotating Be type star with emission lines indicating luminosity class III-V. Most BeXRBs have eccentric orbits and contain a neutron star, confirmed through X-ray pulsations.

[ 2 ] BeXRBs are classified as either transient or persistent. Transient BeXRBs show two outburst types: type I outbursts are regular, periodic events occurring near periastron (the neutron star's closest orbital approach), while type II outbursts are major, unpredictable events reaching Eddington luminosity ( ~10 38 erg/s ) and lasting multiple orbital periods. Persistent BeXRBs display lower X-ray luminosity, more stable light curves with minor variability, slower rotating neutron stars with spin periods exceeding 200 seconds, and typically have wide, low-eccentricity orbits.

[ 2 ] Physical properties [ edit ] Be stars show emission spectral lines (particularly Hα ) and infrared excess from their circumstellar disk . This disk forms from material expelled by the rapidly rotating Be star. Neutron stars in BeXRBs are also fast rotators, with spin periods ranging from a few seconds to several hundred seconds. These systems display a correlation between orbital and spin periods. Neutron stars usually exhibiting pulsations in their X-ray emission due to the strong magnetic field channeling accreted gas toward the magnetic poles.

[ 2 ] The neutron star truncates the Be star's disk through tidal forces . Evidence for this includes correlation between Hα equivalent width and orbital period, higher disk densities than in isolated Be stars, shorter V/R variability periods, and quantized infrared flux states matching resonant truncation radii. During periastron , the neutron star accretes material from the disk, causing X-ray outbursts. The disk formation and dissipation timescales correlate with the system's orbital period.

[ 2 ] BeXRBs exist in both the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds , with the Small Magellanic Cloud hosting many of these systems due to its lower metallicity and higher star formation rate.

[ 2 ] Observations [ edit ] Observationally, identification of BeXRBs relies heavily on their optical and IR signatures, primarily emission-line spectroscopy and IR photometry. A strong correlation exists between the intensity of IR colors and Hα emission lines, suggesting a common origin in the circumstellar disk. These diagnostics assist astronomers in identifying Be star candidates associated with newly discovered X-ray sources. Techniques such as photometric color-color diagrams and narrow-slit spectroscopy are used to accurately identify these optical counterparts.

[ 2 ] Notable BeXRBs [ edit ] X Persei [ edit ] Main article: X Persei X Persei is a binary system containing a γ Cassiopeiae variable and a pulsar . It has a relatively long period and low eccentricity for this type of binary, which means the X-ray emission is persistent and not usually strongly variable. Some strong X-ray flares have been observed, presumably related to changes in the accretion disc, but no correlations have been found with the strong optical variations.

[ 3 ] LSI+61°303 [ edit ] Main article: LS I +61 303 LSI+61°303 is a possible example of a BeXRB. It is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01. It is also a variable radio source characterized by periodic, non-thermal radio outbursts with a period of 26.496 d. The 26.5 d period is attributed to the eccentric orbital motion of a compact object, possibly a neutron star, around a rapidly rotating B0 Ve star. Photometric observations at optical and infrared wavelengths also show a 26.5 d modulation.

[ 4 ] Although the mass of the compact object in the LS I +61 303 system is not known accurately, it is likely that it is too large to be a neutron star and so it is likely a black hole .

[ 5 ] Of the 20 or so members of the Be/X-ray binary class, as of 1996, only X Persei and LSI+61°303 have X-ray outbursts of much higher luminosity and harder spectrum ( kT ≈ 10–20 keV) vs. ( kT ≤ 1 keV).  LSI+61°303 also shows strong radio outbursts, more similar to those of the "standard" short-period high-mass X-ray binaries such as SS 433 , Cyg X-3 and Cir X-1 .

[ 4 ] RX J0209.6-7427 [ edit ] RX J0209.6-7427 is a BeXRB located in the Magellanic Bridge .

[ 6 ] A couple of rare outbursts have been observed from this source hosting a neutron star. The last outburst was detected in 2019 after about 26 years. The accreting neutron star in this system is an ultraluminous X-ray Pulsar (ULXP) making it the second closest ULXP and the first ULXP in our neighbouring galaxy in the Magellanic Clouds .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Swift J010902.6-723710 [ edit ] Swift J010902.6-723710 is a BeXRB detected by the Swift Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Survey (S-CUBED). An X-ray outburst, detected on October 10, 2023, had characteristics of Type I and II outbursts. Proposed orbital period is 60.623 days. Companion star of the system is "B0-0.5 star of spectral class Ve". The system's neutron star has large accretion disk.
