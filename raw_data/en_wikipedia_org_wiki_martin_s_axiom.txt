Martin and Robert M. Solovay , [ 1 ] is a statement that is independent of the usual axioms of ZFC set theory . It is implied by the continuum hypothesis , but it is consistent with ZFC and the negation of the continuum hypothesis. Informally, it says that all cardinals less than the cardinality of the continuum , 𝔠, behave roughly like ℵ 0 . The intuition behind this can be understood by studying the proof of the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma . It is a principle that is used to control certain forcing arguments.

Statement [ edit ] For a cardinal number κ , define the following statement: MA( κ ) For any partial order P satisfying the countable chain condition (hereafter ccc) and any set D = { D i } i ∈ I of dense subsets of P such that |D| ≤ κ , there is a filter F on P such that F ∩ D i is non- empty for every D i ∈ D .

In this context, a set D is called dense if every element of P has a lower bound in D . For application of ccc, an antichain is a subset A of P such that any two distinct members of A are incompatible (two elements are said to be compatible if there exists a common element below both of them in the partial order). This differs from, for example, the notion of antichain in the context of trees .

MA(ℵ 0 ) is provable in ZFC and known as the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma .

MA(2 ℵ 0 ) is false: [0, 1] is a separable compact Hausdorff space , and so ( P , the poset of open subsets under inclusion, is) ccc. But now consider the following two 𝔠-size sets of dense sets in P : no x ∈ [0, 1] is isolated , and so each x defines the dense subset { S | x ∉ S }. And each r ∈ (0, 1], defines the dense subset { S | diam( S ) < r }. The two sets combined are also of size 𝔠, and a filter meeting both must simultaneously avoid all points of [0, 1] while containing sets of arbitrarily small diameter. But a filter F containing sets of arbitrarily small diameter must contain a point in ⋂ F by compactness. (See also § Equivalent forms of MA(κ) .) Martin's axiom is then that MA( κ ) holds for every κ for which it could: Martin's axiom (MA) MA( κ ) holds for every κ < 𝔠.

Equivalent forms of MA( κ ) [ edit ] The following statements are equivalent to MA( κ ): If X is a compact Hausdorff topological space that satisfies the ccc then X is not the union of κ or fewer nowhere dense subsets.

If P is a non-empty upwards ccc poset and Y is a set of cofinal subsets of P with |Y| ≤ κ then there is an upwards-directed set A such that A meets every element of Y .

Let A be a non-zero ccc Boolean algebra and F a set of subsets of A with |F| ≤ κ . Then there is a Boolean homomorphism φ: A → Z /2 Z such that for every X ∈ F , there is either an a ∈ X with φ( a ) = 1 or there is an upper bound b ∈ X with φ( b ) = 0.

Consequences [ edit ] Martin's axiom has a number of other interesting combinatorial , analytic and topological consequences: The union of κ or fewer null sets in an atomless σ-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is null. In particular, the union of κ or fewer subsets of R of Lebesgue measure 0 also has Lebesgue measure 0.

A compact Hausdorff space X with |X| < 2 κ is sequentially compact , i.e., every sequence has a convergent subsequence.

No non-principal ultrafilter on N has a base of cardinality less than κ .

Equivalently for any x ∈ β N \ N we have 𝜒( x ) ≥ κ , where 𝜒 is the character of x , and so 𝜒(β N ) ≥ κ .

MA(ℵ 1 ) implies that a product of ccc topological spaces is ccc (this in turn implies there are no Suslin lines ).

MA + ¬CH implies that there exists a Whitehead group that is not free; Shelah used this to show that the Whitehead problem is independent of ZFC.

Further development [ edit ] Martin's axiom has generalizations called the proper forcing axiom and Martin's maximum .

Sheldon W. Davis has suggested in his book that Martin's axiom is motivated by the Baire category theorem .
