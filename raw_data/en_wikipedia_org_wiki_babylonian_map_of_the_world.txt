Dated to no earlier than the 9th century BC (with a late 8th or 7th century BC date being more likely), it includes a brief and partially lost textual description. The tablet describes the oldest known depiction of the then known world . Ever since its discovery there has been controversy on its general interpretation and specific features.

[ 1 ] Another pictorial fragment, VAT 12772, presents a similar topography from roughly two millennia earlier.

[ 2 ] The map is centered on the Euphrates , flowing from the north (top) to the south (bottom), with its mouth labelled "swamp" and "outflow". The city of Babylon is shown on the Euphrates, in the northern half of the map.

Susa , the capital of Elam , is shown to the south, Urartu to the northeast, and Habban, the capital of the Kassites , is shown (incorrectly) to the northwest. Mesopotamia is surrounded by a circular "bitter river" or Ocean, and seven or eight foreign regions are depicted as triangular sections beyond the Ocean, perhaps imagined as mountains.

[ 3 ] The tablet was excavated by Hormuzd Rassam at Sippar , Baghdad vilayet , [ 4 ] some 60 km north of Babylon on the east bank of the Euphrates River . It was acquired by the British Museum in 1882 (BM 92687); [ 4 ] the text was first translated in 1889.

[ 5 ] The tablet is usually thought to have originated in Borsippa .

[ 6 ] In 1995, a new section of the tablet was discovered, at the point of the upper-most triangle.

[ 7 ] The map is used as the logo of the academic journal Imago Mundi .

[ 8 ] Description of the tablet [ edit ] The tablet consists of three parts: the world map, a text above it, and a text on the reverse side. It is not clear whether all three parts should be read as a single document. Systematic differences between the texts suggest that the tablet may have been compiled from three separate documents.

[ 9 ] The map [ edit ] Babylonian Map of the World. The more vertical lines indicate the banks of Euphrates , where the Anunna worked, Gods of the Atra-Hasis Flood epic. The small circles show cities as Uruk and the triangles mountains at the world's edge, including Ararat , on which 'Noah' Atra-Hasis stranded.

[ 10 ] The belt symbolizes the goddess salt sea serpent Tiamat surrounding earth since its creation. She, the cosmic Abzu and the Flood are probably sources of Leviathan , a human-consuming cosmic sea monster.

The map is circular with two boundary circles.

Cuneiform script labels all locations inside the circular map, as well as a few regions outside. The two circles represent a body of water labelled id maratum "bitter river", the salt sea.

Babylon is marked north of center; parallel lines at the bottom seem to represent the southern marshes , and a curved line coming from the north-northeast appear to represent the Zagros Mountains .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The Sumerian Abzu describes a cosmic freshwater ocean that surrounds our planet (created in its midst) above and below, so the sketch shows the same as Babylon's map, now in sideview. The salt-sea goddess Tiamat , from whose mating with cosmic Abzu the Earth was conceived, is indicated by the green (belt) area. Additionally a bubble of breathable air clings to Earth, the mountains of Lebanon and Zagros can be seen, and a tunnel enables the sun god to rush at night dry-footed from west to east. There, close to sunrise and Siduri's pub, lies Dilmun , the Babylonian Noah's island (cf. Gilgamesh). An important technical detail are the gates built into sky by the gods. Through them, they provided their Garden of Eden with rain, but also unleashed the Flood.

There are seven small interior circles within the perimeter of the circle, appearing to represent seven cities.
Seven or eight triangular sections outside the water circle represent named "regions" ( nagu ).
The descriptions for five of them have survived.

"Great Wall, 6 leagues in between, where the Sun is not seen" ( Akkadian : BÀD.GU.LA 6 bēru ina bi-rit a-šar Šamaš la innammaru ). – The "Great Wall" may be a mountain ridge, the "6 leagues in between" probably refer to the width of the Ocean.

[ 16 ] 19. " nagu , 6 leagues in between" 20. "[ nag ] u [..." (rest of text missing) 21. "[ na ] gu [..." (rest of text missing) 22. " nagu , 8 leagues in between" 23. No description. (a city in Assyria?) 24, 25. No description. (cities in Habban?) Accompanying texts [ edit ] Front side [ edit ] Drawing by B. Meissner in Babylonien und Assyrien, 1925.

The text above the map [ 17 ] (11 lines) seems to describe part of the creation of the world by Marduk , the patron god of Babylon, who parted the primeval salt Ocean (the goddess Tiamat ) and thus created Land and Sea. Of the Sea it says: the ruine[d] gods which he (Marduk) set[tled] inside the Sea [...] are present; the viper, the great sea-serpent inside.

Next, on Land, a series of two mythical creatures ("the Anzu-bird , and scorpi[on-man] ") and at least fifteen land animals are mentioned, "beasts which Marduk created on top of the res[tl]ess Sea" (i.e. on the land, visualized as a kind of giant raft floating in the Sea), among them mountain goat, gazelle, lion, wolf, monkey and female-monkey, ostrich, cat, and chameleon. With the exception of the cat, all these animals were typical of faraway lands.

The last two lines of the text refer to three legendary heroes: [U]tnapištim (the hero of the Flood as described in Gilgamesh's epic), Sargon (ruler of Akkad), and Nur-[D]agan the King of Buršaḫa[nda] (opponent of Sargon).

[ 18 ] Back side [ edit ] The back side [ 19 ] (29 lines) seems to be a description of (at least) eight nagu . After an introduction, possibly explaining how to identify the first nagu , the next seven nagu are each introduced by the clause "To the n -th region [ nagu ], where you travel 7 leagues" (the distance of 7 leagues seems to indicate the width of the Ocean, rather than the distance between subsequent nagu ).

[ 20 ] A short description is given for each of the eight nagu , but those of the first, second, and sixth are too damaged to read. The fifth nagu has the longest description, but this too is damaged and indecipherable. The seventh nagu is more clear: ... where cattle equipped with horns [are ...] they run fast and reach [...] The third nagu may be a barren desert, impassable even for birds: A winged [bi]rd cannot safely comp[lete its journey] In the fourth nagu objects are found of remarkable dimensions: [...] are thick as a parsiktum -measure, 20 fingers [...] Irving Finkel assumes that the bird mentioned could be a reference to the author of the map, namely a man who, thanks to his geographical knowledge, was able to imagine the entire known world from a bird's-eye view, as if in flight .

[ 21 ] He also notes that the parsiktum -measure is known in Babylonian literature exclusively as a specification for Utnapishtim 's ark, suggesting that this nagu marks the legendary resting place of this ark. Further, the nagu is a mountain-like triangle close to the Urartu region inside the Bitter River, perhaps equivalent to Mount Ararat , the Biblical resting place of Noah's ark .

[1] The eighth nagu may refer to a supposed heavenly gate in the east where the Sun enters as it rises in the morning.

[... the p]lace where [...] dawns at its entrance.

Concluding, the description then states that the map is a bird's eye description: of the Four Quadrants of the entire [world?] [...] which no one can compre[hend] [i.e., the nagu extend infinitely far] The last two lines apparently recorded the name of the scribe who wrote the tablet: [...] copied from its old exemplar and colla[ted ...] the son of Iṣṣuru [the descend]ant of Ea-bēl-il[ī].

Later influence [ edit ] Carlo Zaccagnini has argued that the design of the Babylonian map of the world may have lived on in the T and O maps of the European Middle Ages.
