A couple produce a pure rotational motion without any translational form.

Two forces acting on opposite direction with equal magnitude.

Simple couple [ edit ] The simplest kind of couple consists of two equal and opposite forces whose lines of action do not coincide. This is called a "simple couple".

[ 1 ] The forces have a turning effect or moment called a torque about an axis which is normal (perpendicular) to the plane of the forces. The SI unit for the torque of the couple is newton metre .

If the two forces are F and − F , then the magnitude of the torque is given by the following formula: τ τ = F d {\displaystyle \tau =Fd} where τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is the moment of couple F is the magnitude of the force d is the perpendicular distance (moment) between the two parallel forces The magnitude of the torque is equal to F • d , with the direction of the torque given by the unit vector e ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {e}}} , which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two forces and positive being a counter-clockwise couple. When d is taken as a vector between the points of action of the forces, then the torque is the cross product of d and F , i.e.

τ τ = | d × × F | .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } =|\mathbf {d} \times \mathbf {F} |.} Independence of reference point [ edit ] The moment of a force is only defined with respect to a certain point P (it is said to be the "moment about P ") and, in general, when P is changed, the moment changes. However, the moment (torque) of a couple is independent of the reference point P : Any point will give the same moment.

[ 1 ] In other words, a couple, unlike any more general moments, is a "free vector". (This fact is called Varignon 's Second Moment Theorem .) [ 2 ] The proof of this claim is as follows: Suppose there are a set of force vectors F 1 , F 2 , etc. that form a couple, with position vectors (about some origin P ), r 1 , r 2 , etc., respectively. The moment about P is M = r 1 × × F 1 + r 2 × × F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle M=\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {r} _{2}\times \mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots } Now we pick a new reference point P' that differs from P by the vector r . The new moment is M ′ = ( r 1 + r ) × × F 1 + ( r 2 + r ) × × F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle M'=(\mathbf {r} _{1}+\mathbf {r} )\times \mathbf {F} _{1}+(\mathbf {r} _{2}+\mathbf {r} )\times \mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots } Now the distributive property of the cross product implies M ′ = ( r 1 × × F 1 + r 2 × × F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ ) + r × × ( F 1 + F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ ) .

{\displaystyle M'=\left(\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {r} _{2}\times \mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots \right)+\mathbf {r} \times \left(\mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots \right).} However, the definition of a force couple means that F 1 + F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ = 0.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots =0.} Therefore, M ′ = r 1 × × F 1 + r 2 × × F 2 + ⋯ ⋯ = M {\displaystyle M'=\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {r} _{2}\times \mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots =M} This proves that the moment is independent of reference point, which is proof that a couple is a free vector.

Forces and couples [ edit ] A force F applied to a rigid body at a distance d from the center of mass has the same effect as the same force applied directly to the center of mass and a couple Cℓ = Fd . The couple produces an angular acceleration of the rigid body at right angles to the plane of the couple.

[ 3 ] The force at the center of mass accelerates the body in the direction of the force without change in orientation. The general theorems are: [ 3 ] A single force acting at any point O′ of a rigid body can be replaced by an equal and parallel force F acting at any given point O and a couple with forces parallel to F whose moment is M = Fd , d being the separation of O and O′ . Conversely, a couple and a force in the plane of the couple can be replaced by a single force, appropriately located.

Any couple can be replaced by another in the same plane of the same direction and moment, having any desired force or any desired arm.

[ 3 ] Applications [ edit ] Couples are very important in engineering and the physical sciences. A few examples are: The forces exerted by one's hand on a screw-driver The forces exerted by the tip of a screwdriver on the head of a screw Drag forces acting on a spinning propeller Forces on an electric dipole in a uniform electric field The reaction control system on a spacecraft Force exerted by hands on steering wheel 'Rocking couples' are a regular imbalance giving rise to vibration See also [ edit ] Traction (engineering) Torque Moment (physics) Force References [ edit ] ^ a b Dynamics, Theory and Applications by T.R.
