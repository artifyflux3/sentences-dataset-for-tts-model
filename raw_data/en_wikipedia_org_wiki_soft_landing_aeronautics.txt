The average vertical speed in a soft landing should be about 2 meters (6.6 ft) per second or less.

Vertical rocket power using retrorockets , often referred to as VTVL (vertical landing referred to as VTOL , is usually for aircraft landing in a level attitude, rather than rockets) — first achieved on a suborbital trajectory by Bell Rocket Belt and on an orbital trajectory by the Surveyor 1 .

Horizontal landing, most aircraft and some spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle , land this way accompanied with a parachute.

Being caught in midair, as done with Corona spy satellites and followed by some other form of landing .
