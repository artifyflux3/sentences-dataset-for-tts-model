Image of Odd radio circle ORC J2103-6200 by the MeerKAT telescope superimposed on an optical image from the Dark Energy Survey (2022) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] In astronomy, an odd radio circle ( ORC ) is a very large (over 50 times the diameter of our Milky Way ~ 3 million light years) unexplained astronomical object that, at radio wavelengths , is highly circular and brighter along its edges.

[ 3 ] As of 27 April 2021, there have been five such objects (and possibly six more) observed.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The observed ORCs are bright at radio wavelengths, but are not visible at visible , infrared or X-ray wavelengths. This is due to the physical process producing this radiation, which is thought to be synchrotron radiation .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Three of the ORCs contain optical galaxies in their centers, suggesting that the galaxies might have formed these objects.

[ 5 ] [ 10 ] Description [ edit ] Artist’s impression of an odd radio circle exploding from a central galaxy. ORCs can expand past other galaxies.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope array The ORCs were detected in late 2019 after astronomer Anna Kapinska studied a Pilot Survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), based on  the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope array .

[ 11 ] All of the ORCs are about 1 arcminute in diameter, and are some distance from the galactic plane , at high galactic latitudes . The possibility of a spherical shock wave , associated with fast radio bursts , gamma-ray bursts , or neutron star mergers , was considered, but, if related, would have to have taken place in the distant past due to the large angular size of the ORCs, according to the researchers.

[ 7 ] Also, according to the astronomers, "Circular features are well-known in radio astronomical images, and usually represent a spherical object such as a supernova remnant , a planetary nebula , a circumstellar shell , or a face-on disc such as a protoplanetary disc or a star-forming galaxy , ... They may also arise from imaging artefact around bright sources caused by calibration errors or inadequate deconvolution . This class of circular feature in radio images does not seem to correspond to any of these known types of object or artefact, but rather appears to be a new class of astronomical object ."
