[Space Shuttle _Discovery_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")

A **spaceplane** is a vehicle that can [fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight "Flight") and [glide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_flight "Gliding flight") as an [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft") in [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") and function as a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-NYT-20141020-KC-1) To do so, spaceplanes must incorporate features of both aircraft and spacecraft. [Orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight "Orbital spaceflight") spaceplanes tend to be more similar to conventional spacecraft, while [sub-orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital "Sub-orbital") spaceplanes tend to be more similar to [fixed-wing aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft "Fixed-wing aircraft"). All spaceplanes as of 2024 have been [rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine "Rocket engine")-powered for takeoff and climb, but have then landed as unpowered [gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)").

Four examples of spaceplanes have successfully launched to orbit, [reentered Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry"), and [landed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing#Aircraft "Landing"): the U.S. [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), Russian [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)"), U.S. [X-37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37 "Boeing X-37"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-BBC-2) and the Chinese [Shenlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenlong_(spacecraft) "Shenlong (spacecraft)"). Another, [Dream Chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Chaser "Dream Chaser"), is under development in the U.S. As of 2024 all past and current orbital spaceplanes [launch vertically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTHL "VTHL"); some are carried as a payload in a conventional fairing, while the Space Shuttle used its own engines with the assistance of boosters and an external tank. Orbital [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") takes place at high velocities, with orbital kinetic energies typically greater than suborbital trajectories. This kinetic energy is shed as heat during [re-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry"). Many more spaceplanes [have been proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceplanes "List of spaceplanes").

At least two suborbital [rocket-powered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket-powered_aircraft "Rocket-powered aircraft") have been launched horizontally into sub-orbital spaceflight from an airborne [carrier aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_ship "Mother ship") before rocketing beyond the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line"): the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15") and [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-3)

Principles of operation
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Principles of operation")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Atlantis_is_landing_after_STS-30_mission.jpg/250px-Atlantis_is_landing_after_STS-30_mission.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atlantis_is_landing_after_STS-30_mission.jpg)

Landing of [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle")[_Atlantis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Atlantis "Space Shuttle Atlantis"), a crewed orbital spaceplane

Spaceplanes must operate in space, like traditional [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), but also must be capable of atmospheric flight, like an [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft").

Spaceplanes do not necessarily have to fly by their own propulsion, but instead often glide with their inertia while using aerodynamic surfaces to maneuver in the atmosphere during descent and landing. The U.S. Space Shuttle for instance, could not fly under its own propulsion but used its momentum after de-orbit to glide to the runway destination.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-6)

These requirements drive up the complexity, risk, dry mass, and cost of spaceplane designs. The following sections will draw heavily on the US Space Shuttle as the biggest, most complex, most expensive, most flown, and only crewed orbital spaceplane, but other designs have been successfully flown.

The flight trajectory required to reach orbit results in significant aerodynamic loads, vibrations, and accelerations, all of which have to be withstood by the vehicle structure.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-:0-9)

If the launch vehicle suffers a catastrophic malfunction, a conventional capsule spacecraft is propelled to safety by a [launch escape system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_escape_system "Launch escape system"). The Space Shuttle was far too big and heavy for this approach to be viable, resulting in a [number of abort modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes "Space Shuttle abort modes") that may or may not have been survivable. The [Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster "Space Shuttle Challenger disaster") demonstrated a lack of survivability on ascent.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Once on-orbit, a spaceplane must be supplied with power by [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel "Solar panel") and batteries or [fuel cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell "Fuel cell"), [maneuvered in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver "Orbital maneuver"), kept in thermal equilibrium, [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system "Reaction control system"), and communicated with. On-orbit thermal and radiological environments impose additional stresses. This is in addition to accomplishing the task the spaceplane was launched to complete, such as satellite deployment or science experiments.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The Space Shuttle used [dedicated engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuvering_system "Orbital maneuvering system") to accomplish orbital maneuvers. These engines used toxic [hypergolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic "Hypergolic")[propellants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant "Rocket propellant") that required special handling precautions. Various gases, including [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") for pressurization and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") for life support, were stored under high pressure in [composite overwrapped pressure vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_overwrapped_pressure_vessel "Composite overwrapped pressure vessel").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Atmospheric reentry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Atmospheric reentry")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Buran_rear_view_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29.JPEG/250px-Buran_rear_view_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29.JPEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buran_rear_view_(Le_Bourget_1989).JPEG)

[Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)") spaceplane rear showing rocket engine nozzles, attitude control thrusters, aerodynamic surfaces, and heat shielding

Orbital spacecraft reentering the Earth's atmosphere must shed [significant velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed"), resulting in [extreme heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry"). For example, the [Space Shuttle thermal protection system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_system "Space Shuttle thermal protection system") (TPS) protects the orbiter's interior structure from surface temperatures that reach as high as 1,650°C (3,000°F), well above the melting point of steel.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-10)[Suborbital spaceplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suborbital_spaceplane "Suborbital spaceplane") fly lower energy trajectories that do not put as much stress on the spacecraft thermal protection system.

The [Space Shuttle _Columbia_ disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster") was the direct result of a TPS failure.

### Aerodynamic flight and horizontal landing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Aerodynamic flight and horizontal landing")]

[Aerodynamic control surfaces must be actuated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit#Spacecraft "Auxiliary power unit"). [Landing gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear "Landing gear") must be included at the cost of additional mass.

### Air-breathing orbital spaceplane concept

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Air-breathing orbital spaceplane concept")]

An air-breathing orbital spaceplane would have to fly what is known as a 'depressed trajectory,' which places the vehicle in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere for an extended period of time. This environment induces high dynamic pressure, high temperature, and high heat flow loads particularly upon the [leading edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_edge "Leading edge") surfaces of the spaceplane, requiring exterior surfaces to be constructed from advanced materials and/or use [active cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_cooling "Active cooling").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-:0-9)[Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft) "Skylon (spacecraft)") was a proposed spaceplane that would have used air-breathing engines.

Flown orbital spaceplanes
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Flown orbital spaceplanes")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg/250px-STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg)

_[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")_ lifts off at the start of the [STS-120](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-120 "STS-120") mission.

The [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") is a retired, partially [reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system "Reusable launch system")[low Earth orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit")[spacecraft system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NASA_launch_vehicles "List of NASA launch vehicles") operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration "National Aeronautics and Space Administration") (NASA) as part of the [Space Shuttle program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program"). Its official program name was the [Space Transportation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Transportation_System "Space Transportation System") (STS), taken from the 1969 plan led by U.S. vice president [Spiro Agnew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew "Spiro Agnew") for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Space_Shuttle_dev_space_shuttle-11): 163–166 [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Space_Shuttle_space_task_group_1969-12)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-13)

The first ([STS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1 "STS-1")) of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights ([STS-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-5 "STS-5")) beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011. They launched from the [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center") (KSC) in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"). Operational missions launched numerous [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), [interplanetary probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_probe "Interplanetary probe"), and the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope") (HST), conducted science experiments in orbit, participated in the [Shuttle-_Mir_ program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle%E2%80%93Mir_program "Shuttle–Mir program") with Russia, and participated in the construction and servicing of the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS). The Space Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1,323 days.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Space_Shuttle_ShuttleByNumbers-14)

Space Shuttle components include the [Orbiter Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter") (OV) with three clustered [Rocketdyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne "Rocketdyne")[RS-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25 "RS-25") main engines, a pair of recoverable [solid rocket boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster "Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster") (SRBs), and the expendable [external tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_external_tank "Space Shuttle external tank") (ET) containing [liquid hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen "Liquid hydrogen") and [liquid oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen "Liquid oxygen"). The Space Shuttle was [launched vertically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff_and_landing "Takeoff and landing"), like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter's three [main engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25 "RS-25"), which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, while the main engines continued to operate, and the ET was jettisoned after main engine cutoff and just before [orbit insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_insertion "Orbit insertion"), which used the orbiter's two [Orbital Maneuvering System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Orbital_Maneuvering_System "Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System") (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [reenter the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry "Atmospheric reentry"). The orbiter was protected during reentry by its [thermal protection system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_protection_system "Thermal protection system") tiles, and it [glided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_glider "Rocket glider") as a spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the [Shuttle Landing Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Landing_Facility "Shuttle Landing Facility") at KSC, Florida, or to [Rogers Dry Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Dry_Lake "Rogers Dry Lake") in [Edwards Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base "Edwards Air Force Base"), California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC atop the [Shuttle Carrier Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft "Shuttle Carrier Aircraft") (SCA), a specially modified [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") designed to carry the shuttle above it.

The first orbiter, _[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Enterprise "Space Shuttle Enterprise")_, was built in 1976 and used in [Approach and Landing Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approach_and_Landing_Tests "Approach and Landing Tests") (ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: _[Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia")_, _[Challenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Challenger "Space Shuttle Challenger")_, _[Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")_, and _[Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Atlantis "Space Shuttle Atlantis")_. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [_Challenger_ in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster "Space Shuttle Challenger disaster") and [_Columbia_ in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster"), with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, _[Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Endeavour "Space Shuttle Endeavour")_, was built in 1991 to replace _Challenger_. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following _Atlantis_'s [final flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-135 "STS-135") on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the Russian [Soyuz spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft) "Soyuz (spacecraft)") to transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the launch of the [Crew Dragon Demo-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2 "Crew Dragon Demo-2") mission in May 2020.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-15)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Antonov_An-225_with_Soviet_space_shuttle_Buran_on_top.jpeg/250px-Antonov_An-225_with_Soviet_space_shuttle_Buran_on_top.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Antonov_An-225_with_Soviet_space_shuttle_Buran_on_top.jpeg)

The [Antonov An-225 Mriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya "Antonov An-225 Mriya") carrying a _Buran_ orbiter in 1989.

The [_Buran_ programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_programme "Buran programme") ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): Буран, IPA:[[bʊˈran]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Russian "Help:IPA/Russian"), "Snowstorm", "Blizzard"), also known as the "VKK Space Orbiter programme" ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): ВКК «Воздушно-Космический Корабль», [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'Air and Space Ship'),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-16) was a [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and later Russian reusable [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") project that began in 1974 at the [Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Aerohydrodynamic_Institute "Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute") in [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") and was formally suspended in 1993.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Buran_programme_harvey-17) In addition to being the designation for the whole Soviet/Russian reusable spacecraft project, _Buran_ was also the name given to [orbiter 1K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)"), which completed one uncrewed spaceflight in 1988 and was the only Soviet reusable spacecraft to be launched into space. The Buran-class orbiters used the expendable [Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket) "Energia (rocket)") rocket as a [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle").

The Buran programme was started by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") as a response to the United States [Space Shuttle program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program")[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-18) and benefited from extensive espionage undertaken by the [KGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB") of the unclassified US Space Shuttle program,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Buran_programme_NBC_News-19) resulting in many superficial and functional similarities between American and Soviet Shuttle designs.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Buran_programme_Discover_Magazine-20) Although the Buran class was similar in appearance to [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Space Shuttle orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter "Space Shuttle orbiter"), and could similarly operate as a [re-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-entry "Re-entry") spaceplane, its final internal and functional design was different. For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft. Smaller rocket engines on the craft's body provided propulsion in orbit and de-orbital burns, similar to the Space Shuttle's [OMS pods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Orbital_Maneuvering_System "Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System"). Unlike the Space Shuttle whose [first orbital spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1 "STS-1") was accomplished in April 1981, Buran, whose [first and only spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buran_missions "List of Buran missions") occurred in November 1988, had a capability of flying uncrewed missions, as well as performing fully automated landings.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-21) The project was the largest and the most expensive in the history of Soviet [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Buran_programme_harvey-17)

The [Boeing X-37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37 "Boeing X-37"), also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is a reusable [robotic spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_spacecraft "Robotic spacecraft"). It is boosted into space by a [launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle"), re-enters Earth's atmosphere, and lands as a spaceplane. The X-37 is operated by the [Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Air_Force_Rapid_Capabilities_Office "Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office"), in collaboration with the [United States Space Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force "United States Space Force"),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Boeing_X-37_7th_X-37B_mission-22) for orbital [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight#Launch "Spaceflight") missions intended to demonstrate [reusable space technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system "Reusable launch system"). It is a 120-percent-scaled derivative of the earlier [Boeing X-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-40 "Boeing X-40"). The X-37 began as a [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") project in 1999, before being transferred to the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") in 2004. Until 2019, the program was managed by [Air Force Space Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Space_Command "Air Force Space Command").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Boeing_X-37_Pentagon-X37B-20200818-23)

An X-37 first flew during a drop test in 2006; its first orbital mission was launched in April 2010 on an [Atlas V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V "Atlas V") rocket, and returned to Earth in December 2010. Subsequent flights gradually extended the mission duration, reaching 780 days in orbit for the fifth mission, the first to launch on a [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") rocket. The sixth mission launched on an Atlas V on 17 May 2020 and concluded on 12 November 2022, reaching 908 days in orbit.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Boeing_X-37_ussf-20221112-24) The seventh mission launched on 28 December 2023 on a [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy "Falcon Heavy") rocket, entering a [highly elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit")[high Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit "High Earth orbit"), landing in March 2025 after 434 days in orbit.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Boeing_X-37_arstech-heavy-25)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Boeing_X-37_:0-26)

### Reusable experimental spacecraft

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Reusable experimental spacecraft")]

The [Chinese reusable experimental spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft "Chinese reusable experimental spacecraft") ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): 可重复使用试验航天器; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _Kěchóngfùshǐyòng shìyàn hángtiānqì_; lit. 'Reusable Experimental Spacecraft') is the first [reusable spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft "Reusable spacecraft") produced by China. It embarked upon its initial orbital mission on 4 September 2020.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft_xinhuanet2020-09-04-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-28)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft_Seradata20200906-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft_Gunter-30) According to media reports, the spacecraft is launched into Earth orbit in a vertical configuration while enclosed within the payload fairings of a rocket like a traditional satellite, but it returns to Earth via autonomous runway landing. In the absence of any official descriptions of the spacecraft or photographic depictions thereof, some observers have speculated that the spacecraft may resemble the [X-37B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37 "Boeing X-37") spaceplane of the United States in both form and function.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft_space04Sept2020-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Chinese_reusable_experimental_spacecraft_reuters06Sept2020-32)

An X-15 in flight

Two piloted suborbital rocket-powered aircraft have reached space: the [North American X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15") and [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne "SpaceShipOne"); a third, [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo"), has crossed the US-defined boundary of space but has _not_ reached the higher internationally recognised boundary. None of these crafts were capable of entering orbit, and all were first lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft.

On 7 December 2009, [Scaled Composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites "Scaled Composites") and [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic") unveiled [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo"), along with its atmospheric [mothership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhiteKnightTwo "WhiteKnightTwo") "Eve". On 13 December 2018, [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo "SpaceShipTwo")[VSS Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Unity "VSS Unity") successfully crossed the US-defined boundary of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Boundary "Outer space") (although it has not reached space using the internationally recognised definition of this boundary, which lies at a higher altitude than the US boundary). [SpaceShipThree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipThree "SpaceShipThree") is the new spacecraft of [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic"), launched on 30 March 2021. It is also known as [VSS Imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Imagine "VSS Imagine").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-verge20181213-33) On 11 July 2021 [VSS Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Unity "VSS Unity") completed its first fully crewed mission including Sir [Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson "Richard Branson").

The [Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105 "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105") was an atmospheric prototype of an intended orbital spaceplane, with the suborbital [BOR-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOR-4 "BOR-4") subscale heat shield test vehicle successfully [reentering the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry") before program cancellation.

[HYFLEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYFLEX "HYFLEX") was a miniaturized suborbital demonstrator launched in 1996, flying to 110 km altitude, achieving [hypersonic flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_flight "Hypersonic flight"), and successfully reentering the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-34)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-35)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Spaceplanes in development")]

Shenlong ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 神龙; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _shén lóng_; lit. 'divine dragon') is a Chinese robotic spaceplane that may be similar to the [Boeing X-37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37 "Boeing X-37").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-36) Only a few images have been released since late 2007.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-StrategyCenter-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Shenlong_Space_Plane-38)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Space_Politics-39)

Haolong is a reusable uncrewed spaceplane with a 1.8 ton cargo capacity in development by the Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute for resupplying the [Chinese space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_space_station "Chinese space station"). It will be 10 meters long and 8 meters wide and will use folding wings.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-40)

The experience from the [IXV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_eXperimental_Vehicle "Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle") project is being used in the [PRIDE programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_Reusable_In-orbit_Demonstrator_in_Europe "Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe") to develop the uncrewed reusable spaceplane [Space Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Rider "Space Rider").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-auto-41)

The [German Space Agency (DLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Aerospace_Center "German Aerospace Center") is developing the Reusable Flight Experiment (ReFEx) as a demonstrator for a winged reusable rocket first stage. It will be carried by a sounding rocket to [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee") of approximately 130 km.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-47) Its first flight is expected in 2026.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-48)

The German company POLARIS Spaceplanes, in cooperation with [DLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Aerospace_Center "German Aerospace Center"), is developing a multipurpose suborbital spaceplane Aurora that can be used for launching payloads into orbit when combined with an expendable upper stage.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-49)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-50)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-51)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-:1-52)

[Dassault Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Aviation "Dassault Aviation") is developing an orbital spaceplane called VORTEX (Véhicule Orbital Réutilisable de Transport et d’EXploration) for both civilian and military orbital missions. The company first presented this project at the 2025 [Paris Air Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Air_Show "Paris Air Show").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-54)[ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") expressed an interest to cooperate on a scaled down suborbital technology demonstrator version of VORTEX.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-55)

French company AndroMach, founded in 2023, is developing small suborbital (ENVOL) and orbital (ÉTOILE) spaceplanes with financial support by [CNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNES "CNES").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-56)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-:1-52)

As of 2012, the [Indian Space Research Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation "Indian Space Research Organisation") is developing a launch system named the [Reusable Launch Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLV_Technology_Demonstration_Programme "RLV Technology Demonstration Programme") (RLV). It is India's first step towards realizing a [two-stage-to-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit "Two-stage-to-orbit")[reusable launch system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system "Reusable launch system"). A space plane serves as the second stage. The plane is expected to have air-breathing [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet "Scramjet") engines as well as rocket engines. Tests with miniature spaceplanes and a working scramjet have been conducted by ISRO in 2016.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-57) In April 2023, India successfully conducted an [autonomous landing mission of a scaled-down prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLV-LEX "RLV-LEX") of the spaceplane.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-58) The RLV prototype was dropped from a [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_helicopter "Chinook helicopter") helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 km and was made to autonomously glide down to a purpose-built runway at the [Chitradurga Aeronautical Test Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitradurga_Aeronautical_Test_Range "Chitradurga Aeronautical Test Range"), Karnataka.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-59)

As of 2018, Japan is developing the [Winged Reusable Sounding rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Reusable_Sounding_rocket "Winged Reusable Sounding rocket") (WIRES), which if successful, may be used as a recoverable first-stage or as a crewed sub-orbital spaceplane.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-WIRES_March_2018-60)

Dream Chaser flight test vehicle in 2013

[Dream Chaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Chaser "Dream Chaser") is an American [reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft "Reusable spacecraft")[lifting-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting-body "Lifting-body") spaceplane developed by [Sierra Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Space "Sierra Space"). Initially conceived as a [crewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") vehicle, it is currently being developed in a cargo configuration known as the Dream Chaser Cargo System for missions to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS) under NASA's [Commercial Resupply Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services "Commercial Resupply Services") program.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-61)

Development of Dream Chaser began in 2004 as a project of [SpaceDev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceDev "SpaceDev"), which was acquired by [Sierra Nevada Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_Corporation "Sierra Nevada Corporation") (SNC) in 2008.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Dream_Chaser_AWST-19910715-26-62) In 2021, the program was transferred to Sierra Space, a subsidiary spun off from SNC as an independent company.

Dream Chaser is designed for [vertical takeoff and horizontal landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTHL "VTHL"), launching atop a [Vulcan Centaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_Centaur "Vulcan Centaur") rocket and landing on conventional runways.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Dream_Chaser_Vulcan-Selection-63)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Dream_Chaser_subNAS-64) It is capable of carrying both pressurized and unpressurized cargo. A proposed variant for the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") would launch aboard an [Ariane 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6 "Ariane 6") rocket. The first flight of Dream Chaser was originally scheduled for the second flight of Vulcan Centaur but was not ready in time. As of August 2025, the spacecraft's propulsion system and software had not yet been certified by NASA, contributing to continued delays in its first flight.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-65)

The Dream Chaser’s design is derived from NASA's [HL-20 Personnel Launch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL-20_Personnel_Launch_System "HL-20 Personnel Launch System"), a lifting-body concept studied in the 1980s and 1990s.

The Dawn Mk-II Aurora is a suborbital spaceplane being developed by [Dawn Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Aerospace "Dawn Aerospace") to demonstrate multiple suborbital flights per day. Dawn is based in the Netherlands and New Zealand, and is working closely with the American CAA. On 9 December 2020, the [Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_New_Zealand "Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand"), working alongside the [New Zealand Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Space_Agency "New Zealand Space Agency"), issued a license allowing the vehicle to fly from a conventional airport.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-66) On 25 August 2021, the first test-flight campaign of five successful flights using surrogate jet engines was announced.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-67) As of 15 August 2022, 35 test flights have been complete, validating the vehicles aerodynamics, avionics, rapid deployment and various piloting modes.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-68) A qualified 2.5 kN.s pump-fed HTP/kerosene engine is being installed for high-performance high-altitude flights. Dawn Aerospace previously demonstrated multiple low-altitude rocket-powered flights per day on their Mk-I vehicle.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-69)

Unflown spaceplane concepts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spaceplane&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Unflown spaceplane concepts")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Gemini_paraglider.JPG/250px-Gemini_paraglider.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gemini_paraglider.JPG)

United States [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_A "Gemini A") tested the use of a Rogallo wing rather than a parachute. August 1964.

Various types of spaceplanes have been suggested since the early twentieth century. Notable early designs include a spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent, and the [Silbervogel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbervogel "Silbervogel")[bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_aircraft "Bomber aircraft") concept. [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") Germany and [the postwar US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip "Operation Paperclip") considered winged versions of the [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2 "V-2") rocket, and in the 1950s and '60s winged rocket designs inspired [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") artists, filmmakers, and the general public.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-70)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-71)

The [U.S. Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Air_Force "U.S. Air Force") invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their [Aerospaceplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospaceplane "Aerospaceplane") efforts of the late 1950s, but later reduced the scope of the project. The result, the [Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar "Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar"), was to have been the first orbital spaceplane, but was canceled in the early 1960s[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-72)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-73) in lieu of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Project Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") and the U.S. Air Force's [crewed spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory "Manned Orbiting Laboratory") program.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1961, NASA originally planned to have the [Gemini spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_A "Gemini A") land on a [runway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway "Runway")[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1977xvi%E2%80%93xvii-74) with a [Rogallo wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogallo_wing "Rogallo wing")[airfoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil "Airfoil"), rather than an [ocean landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown "Splashdown") under [parachutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute "Parachute").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The test vehicle became known as the [Paraglider Research Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Paresev "NASA Paresev"). Development work on both parachutes and the paraglider began in 1963.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1977145%E2%80%93148-75) By December 1963, the parachute was ready to undergo full-scale deployment testing, while the paraglider had run into technical difficulties.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1977145%E2%80%93148-75) Though attempts to revive the paraglider concept persisted within NASA and [North American Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aviation "North American Aviation"), in 1964 development was definitively discontinued due to the expense of overcoming the technical hurdles.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHackerGrimwood1977171%E2%80%93173-76)

Illustration of [NASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_X-30 "Rockwell X-30") taking off

The [Rockwell X-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_X-30 "Rockwell X-30") National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), begun in the 1980s, was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle. Introduced to the public in 1986, the concept was intended to reach Mach 25, enabling flights between Dulles Airport to Tokyo in two hours, while also being capable of low Earth orbit.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FAS-77) Six critical technologies were identified, three relating to the propulsion system, which would consist of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FAS-77)

The NASP program became the Hypersonic Systems Technology Program (HySTP) in late 1994. HySTP was designed to transfer the accomplishments made in hypersonic flight into a technology development program. On 27 January 1995 the Air Force terminated participation in (HySTP).[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-FAS-77)

In 1994, a USAF captain proposed an [F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-16 "F-16") sized [single-stage-to-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit "Single-stage-to-orbit") peroxide/kerosene spaceplane called "[Black Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Horse_(spaceplane) "Black Horse (spaceplane)")".[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-78) It was to take off almost empty and undergo [aerial refueling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling "Aerial refueling") before rocketing to orbit.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-zubrin-79)

The [Lockheed Martin X-33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-33 "Lockheed Martin X-33") was a 1/3 scale prototype made as part of an attempt by NASA to build a SSTO hydrogen-fuelled spaceplane [VentureStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureStar "VentureStar") that failed when the hydrogen tank design could not be constructed as intended.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

On 5 March 2006, [Aviation Week & Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Week_%26_Space_Technology "Aviation Week & Space Technology") published a story purporting to be the "outing" of a highly classified U.S. military [two-stage-to-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit "Two-stage-to-orbit") spaceplane system with the code name [Blackstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstar_(spaceplane) "Blackstar (spaceplane)").[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-avweek_20060305-80)

In 2011, Boeing proposed the X-37C, a 165 to 180 percent scale [X-37B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37 "Boeing X-37") built to carry up to six passengers to [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). The spaceplane was also intended to carry cargo, with both [upmass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upmass "Upmass") and [downmass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downmass "Downmass") capacity.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-sdc20111007-81)

The Soviet reusable spacecraft programme has its roots in the late 1950s, at the very beginning of the space age. The idea of Soviet reusable space flight is very old, though it was neither continuous nor consistently organized. Before Buran, no project of the programme reached operational status.

The first step toward a reusable Soviet spacecraft was the 1954 [Burya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burya "Burya"), a high-altitude prototype jet aircraft/cruise missile. Several test flights were made before it was cancelled by order of the [Central Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee "Central Committee"). The [Burya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burya "Burya") had the goal of delivering a nuclear payload, presumably to the United States, and then returning to base. The Burya programme was cancelled by the USSR in favor of a decision to develop [ICBMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICBM "ICBM") instead. The next iteration of a reusable spacecraft was the [Zvezda](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zvezda_(spacecraft)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Zvezda (spacecraft) (page does not exist)") design, which also reached a prototype stage. Decades later, [another project with the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda_(ISS_module) "Zvezda (ISS module)") would be used as a service module for the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"). After Zvezda, there was a hiatus in reusable projects until Buran.

The Buran orbital vehicle programme was developed in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program, which raised considerable concerns among the Soviet military and especially Defense Minister [Dmitry Ustinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Ustinov "Dmitry Ustinov"). An authoritative chronicler of the Soviet and later Russian space programme, the academic [Boris Chertok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Chertok "Boris Chertok"), recounts how the programme came into being.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Buran_programme_rockets_and_people_3-82) According to Chertok, after the U.S. developed its Space Shuttle program, the Soviet military became suspicious that it could be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. Officially, the Buran orbital vehicle was designed for the delivery to orbit and return to Earth of spacecraft, cosmonauts, and supplies. Both Chertok and [Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleb_Lozino-Lozinskiy "Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy") (General Designer and General Director of [NPO Molniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPO_Molniya "NPO Molniya")) suggest that from the beginning, the programme was military in nature; however, the exact military capabilities, or intended capabilities, of the Buran programme remain classified.

Like its American counterpart, the Buran orbital vehicle, when in transit from its landing sites back to the launch complex, was transported on the back of a large jet aeroplane – the [Antonov An-225 Mriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya "Antonov An-225 Mriya") transport aircraft, which was designed in part for this task and was the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-83) Before the _Mriya_ was ready (after the Buran had flown), the [Myasishchev VM-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasishchev_VM-T "Myasishchev VM-T")_Atlant_, a variant on the Soviet [Myasishchev M-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasishchev_M-4 "Myasishchev M-4")_Molot_ (Hammer) bomber (NATO code: Bison), fulfilled the same role.

The [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") first considered a preliminary design of rocket-launch small spaceplane Lapotok in early 1960s. The [Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105#Uragan "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105") airspace system with small orbital spaceplane and rocket as second stage was developed in the 1960s–1980s.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105 "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105") was a crewed test vehicle to explore low-speed handling and landing.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-84)

In the early 2000s the orbital 'cosmoplane' ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): космоплан) was proposed by Russia's Institute of Applied Mechanics as a passenger transport. According to researchers, it could take about 20 minutes to fly from [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") to [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), using hydrogen and oxygen-fueled engines.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-85)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-86)

The [Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_Mustard "BAC Mustard") (MUSTARD) was a concept explored by the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") Aircraft Corporation (BAC) around 1968 for launching payloads weighing as much as 2,300 kg (5,000 lb) into orbit. It was never constructed.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-87)

In the 1980s, [British Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aerospace "British Aerospace") began development of [HOTOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTOL "HOTOL"), an SSTO spaceplane powered by a revolutionary [SABRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines_SABRE "Reaction Engines SABRE") air-breathing rocket engine, but the project was canceled due to technical and financial uncertainties.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-88) The inventor of SABRE set up [Reaction Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines "Reaction Engines") to develop SABRE and proposed a twin-engined SSTO spaceplane called [Skylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_Engines_Skylon "Reaction Engines Skylon").[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-Skylon_FAQ-89) One NASA analysis showed possible issues with the hot rocket exhaust plumes causing heating of the tail structure at high Mach numbers.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-90) although the CEO of Skylon Enterprises Ltd has claimed that reviews by NASA were "quite positive".[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-91)

[Bristol Spaceplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Spaceplanes "Bristol Spaceplanes") has undertaken design and prototyping of three potential spaceplanes since its founding by David Ashford in 1991. The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") has endorsed these designs on several occasions.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-BSPcompanyinfo-92)

[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") worked on the [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_(spaceplane) "Hermes (spaceplane)") crewed spaceplane launched by [Ariane rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_rocket "Ariane rocket") in the late 20th century, and proposed in January 1985 to go through with Hermes development under the auspices of the ESA.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane#cite_note-93)

In the 1980s, West Germany funded design work on the [MBB Sänger II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saenger_(spacecraft) "Saenger (spacecraft)") with the Hypersonic Technology Program. Development continued on MBB/Deutsche Aerospace Sänger II/HORUS until the late 1980s when it was canceled. Germany went on to participate in the Ariane rocket, Columbus space station and Hermes spaceplane of [ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA "ESA"), [Spacelab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacelab "Spacelab") of ESA-NASA and _Deutschland_ missions (non-U.S. funded Space Shuttle flights with Spacelab).
