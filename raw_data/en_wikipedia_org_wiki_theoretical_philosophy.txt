[ 3 ] The one has theory for its object, and the other practice .

[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] In Denmark , [ 4 ] Finland , [ 5 ] Germany , [ 6 ] the Netherlands , [ 7 ] Sweden , [ 8 ] and the United States , [ 9 ] courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some Scottish universities, for example, divide philosophy into logic , metaphysics , and ethics —but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as Södertörns Högskola .

Theoretical philosophy is sometimes confused with analytic philosophy , but the latter is a philosophical movement, embracing certain ideas and methods but dealing with all philosophical subject matters, while the former is a way of sorting philosophical questions into two different categories in the context of a curriculum .
