It represented one of the earliest methods for constructing tangents to curves.  The method hinges on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.  With this in mind Descartes would construct a circle that was tangent to a given curve.  He could then use the radius at the point of intersection to find the slope of a normal line, and from this one can easily find the slope of a tangent line.

This was discovered about the same time as Fermat 's method of adequality .  While Fermat's method had more in common with the infinitesimal techniques that were to be used later, Descartes' method was more influential in the early history of calculus. ( Katz 2008 ) One reason Descartes' method fell from favor was the algebraic complexity it involved.  On the other hand, this method can be used to rigorously define the derivative for a wide class of functions using neither infinitesimal nor limit techniques.  It is also related to a completely general definition of differentiability given by Carathéodory ( Range 2011 ).
