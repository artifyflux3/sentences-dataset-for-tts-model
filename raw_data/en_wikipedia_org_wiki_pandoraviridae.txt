Family: Pandoraviridae Genera Pandoravirus Pandoraviridae is a proposed family of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect amoebae . There is only one genus in this family: Pandoravirus . Several species in this genus have been described, including Pandoravirus dulcis , Pandoravirus salinus and Pandoravirus yedoma .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] The viruses were discovered in 2013.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Description [ edit ] The viruses in this family are the second largest known virus (~1 micrometer ) in capsid length, after Pithovirus (1.5 micrometer ).

[ 3 ] Pandoravirus has the largest viral genome known, containing double-stranded DNA of 1.9 to 2.5 megabase pairs.

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] Evolution [ edit ] These viruses appear to be related to the phycodnaviruses .
