QR codes ) covering a specific topic or theme such as history, [ 1 ] geology or forestry.  An academic discipline or school subject can define a theme . A walk can consist of one or more themes. Whilst themed walks are often designed to encourage walking , educational paths and nature trail tend to be aimed more at educating or training.

Themes [ edit ] For nature-based themes, paths may be several kilometres long and may be used both for educational purposes and recreation . They may connect places, buildings or natural features that have a  particular theme in common by a signed route, but may also have specifically positioned exhibits .

For science themes, informal learning provides ways to engage in diverse settings.

[ 2 ] For themes related to the nature, [ 3 ] features of nature (e.g.

raised bogs or biotopes ) or of geology may be laid out as special educational paths .

For themes related to mathematics [ 4 ] or physics , these walks provide objective interpretation of physical objects encountered en route.

Management [ edit ] Municipal authorities or local societies may be responsible for their establishment and maintenance. Other walks are managed by individuals who are highly knowledgeable in a theme, and host theme-based tours.

[ 5 ] Examples [ edit ] In Austria there are more than 300 themed walks. These paths are intended to give summer tourism in the Alps a new impulse, but are also helping to improve the network of footpaths.
