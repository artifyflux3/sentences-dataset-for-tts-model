∫ Integral symbol In Unicode U+222B ∫ INTEGRAL ( &int;, &Integral; ) Graphical variants ∫ ∫ {\displaystyle \displaystyle \int } Different from Different from U+017F ſ LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S U+0283 ʃ LATIN SMALL LETTER ESH The integral symbol ( see below ) is used to denote integrals and antiderivatives in mathematics , especially in calculus .

∫ ( Unicode ), ∫ ∫ {\displaystyle \displaystyle \int } ( LaTeX ) History [ edit ] Main article: Leibniz's notation The notation was introduced by the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675 in his private writings; [ 1 ] [ 2 ] it first appeared publicly in the article " De Geometria Recondita et analysi indivisibilium atque infinitorum " (On a hidden geometry and analysis of indivisibles and infinites), published in Acta Eruditorum in June 1686.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The symbol was based on the ſ ( long s ) character and was chosen because Leibniz thought of the integral as an infinite sum of infinitesimal summands .

Typography in Unicode and LaTeX [ edit ] Fundamental symbol [ edit ] Main article: Integral calculus The integral symbol is U+222B ∫ INTEGRAL in Unicode [ 5 ] and \int in LaTeX . In HTML , it is written as &#x222b; ( hexadecimal ), &#8747; ( decimal ) and &int; ( named entity ).

The original IBM PC code page 437 character set included a couple of characters ⌠,⎮ and ⌡ (codes 244 and 245 respectively) to build the integral symbol. These were deprecated in subsequent MS-DOS code pages , but they still remain in Unicode ( U+2320 and U+2321 respectively) for compatibility.

The ∫ symbol is very similar to, but not to be confused with, the letter ʃ (" esh ").

While the English integral symbol leans to the right, the German symbol (used throughout Central Europe ) is upright, and the Russian variant leans slightly to the left to occupy less horizontal space.

[ 7 ] Another difference is in the placement of limits for definite integrals . Generally, in English-language books, limits go to the right of the integral symbol: ∫ ∫ 0 5 f ( t ) d t , ∫ ∫ g ( t ) = a g ( t ) = b f ( t ) d t .

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{5}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t,\quad \int _{g(t)=a}^{g(t)=b}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t.} By contrast, in German and Russian texts, the limits are placed above and below the integral symbol, and, as a result, the notation requires larger line spacing but is more compact horizontally, especially when using longer expressions in the limits: ∫ ∫ 0 T f ( t ) d t , ∫ ∫ g ( t ) = a g ( t ) = b f ( t ) d t .

{\displaystyle \int \limits _{0}^{T}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t,\quad \int \limits _{\!\!\!\!\!g(t)=a\!\!\!\!\!}^{\!\!\!\!\!g(t)=b\!\!\!\!\!}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t.} See also [ edit ] Capital sigma notation Capital pi notation Notes [ edit ] ^ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe, Reihe VII: Mathematische Schriften, vol. 5: Infinitesimalmathematik 1674–1676 , Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2008, pp.
