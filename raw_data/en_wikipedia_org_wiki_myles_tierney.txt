Tierney obtained his B.A.

from Brown University in 1959 and his Ph.D.

from Columbia University in 1965. His dissertation, On the classifying spaces for K-Theory mod p , was written under the supervision of Samuel Eilenberg .  Following positions at Rice University (1965–66) and ETH Zurich (1966–68), he became an associate professor at Rutgers in 1968.

Tierney was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society .
