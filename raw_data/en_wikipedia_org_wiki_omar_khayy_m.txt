**Ghiyāth al-Dīn Abū al-Fatḥ ʿUmar ibn Ibrāhīm Nīshābūrī**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Britannica-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-3) (18 May 1048 – 4 December 1131) ([Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"): غیاث‌الدین ابوالفتح عمر بن ابراهیم خیام نیشابورﻯ), commonly known as **Omar Khayyam** (عمر خیّام),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-4) was a Persian poet and polymath, known for his contributions to [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam "Mathematics in medieval Islam"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_philosophy "Iranian philosophy"), and [Persian literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_literature "Persian literature").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-5): 94  He was born in [Nishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur "Nishapur"), Iran and lived during the [Seljuk era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire "Seljuk Empire"), around the time of the [First Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade "First Crusade").

As a mathematician, he is most notable for his work on the classification and solution of [cubic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation"), where he provided a geometric formulation based on the intersection of [conics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic "Conic").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-mactutor-6) He also contributed to a deeper understanding of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s [parallel axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axiom "Parallel axiom").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 284  As an astronomer, he calculated the duration of the solar year with remarkable precision and accuracy, and designed the [Jalali calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar "Jalali calendar"), a [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") with a very precise 33-year [intercalation cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) "Intercalation (timekeeping)")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 659 [[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-10) which provided the basis for the [Persian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_calendar "Persian calendar") that is still in use after nearly a millennium.

There is a tradition of attributing [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_poetry "Persian poetry") to Omar Khayyam, written in the form of [quatrains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain "Quatrain") (_[rubāʿiyāt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruba%CA%BFi "Rubaʿi")_ رباعیات). This poetry became widely known to the English-reading world in a translation by [Edward FitzGerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_FitzGerald_(poet) "Edward FitzGerald (poet)") (_[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat\_of\_Omar\_Khayyam "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam")_, 1859), which enjoyed great success in the [Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism "Orientalism") of the _[fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin\_de\_si%C3%A8cle "Fin de siècle")_.

Omar Khayyam was born in [Nishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur "Nishapur")—a metropolis in [Khorasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan "Greater Khorasan") province, of [Seljuk Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire "Seljuk Empire"), of [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples "Iranian peoples") stock, in 1048.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-11)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Al-Khalili-12)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EI2-Khayyam-13)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-14) In medieval Persian texts he is usually simply called _Omar Khayyam_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 658 [[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-PersianName-17) Although open to doubt, it has often been assumed that his forebears followed the trade of tent-making, since _Khayyam_ means 'tent-maker' in Arabic.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Boyle-18): 30  The historian [Bayhaqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Hasan_Bayhaqi "Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi"), who was personally acquainted with Khayyam, provides the full details of his horoscope: "he was Gemini, the sun and Mercury being in the ascendant[...]".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Earliest_Account_of_Khayyam-19): 471 [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bayhaqi-20): 172–175, no. 66  This was used by modern scholars to establish his date of birth as 18 May 1048.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 658

[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m "Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám") in [Nishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur "Nishapur"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"). Some of his rubáiyáts are used as [calligraphic (taliq script)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliq_script "Taliq script") decoration on the exterior body of his mausoleum.

Khayyam's boyhood was spent in Nishapur,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 659  a leading metropolis in the [Seljuk Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire "Seljuk Empire"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Sarton-21): 15 [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-FitzGerald-22) which had earlier been a major center of the [Zoroastrian religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 68  His full name, as it appears in Arabic sources, was _Abu’l Fath Omar ibn Ibrahim al-Khayyam_.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-ArabicName-23) His gifts were recognized by his early tutors, who sent him to study under Imam Muwaffaq Nishaburi, the greatest teacher of the Khorasan region, who tutored the children of the highest nobility, and Khayyam developed a firm friendship with him through the years.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 20  Khayyam might have met and studied with [Bahmanyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahmanyar "Bahmanyar"), a disciple of [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 20–21  After studying science, philosophy, mathematics and astronomy at Nishapur, about the year 1068 he traveled to the province of [Bukhara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhara "Bukhara"), where he frequented the renowned library of the [Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_Bukhara "Ark of Bukhara"). In about 1070 he moved to [Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand "Samarkand"), where he started to compose his famous _[Treatise on Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar\_Khayy%C3%A1m#Mathematics)_ under the patronage of Abu Tahir Abd al-Rahman ibn ʿAlaq, the governor and [chief judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadi "Qadi") of the city.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Rosenfeld-24): 4330b  Khayyam was kindly received by the Karakhanid ruler [Shams al-Mulk Nasr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate#Monarchs "Kara-Khanid Khanate"), who according to Bayhaqi, would "show him the greatest honour, so much so that he would seat [Khayyam] beside him on his [throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divan "Divan")".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Boyle-18): 34 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 47

In 1073–4 peace was concluded with [Sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan")[Malik-Shah I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik-Shah_I "Malik-Shah I"), who had made incursions into Karakhanid dominions. Khayyam entered the service of Malik-Shah in 1074 when he was invited by the [Grand Vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier "Vizier")[Nizam al-Mulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_al-Mulk "Nizam al-Mulk") to meet Malik-Shah in the city of [Marv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv "Merv"). Khayyam was subsequently commissioned to set up an observatory in [Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan "Isfahan") and lead a group of scientists in carrying out precise astronomical observations aimed at the revision of the Persian calendar. The undertaking probably began with the opening of the observatory in 1074 and ended in 1079,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 28–29  when Omar Khayyam and his colleagues concluded their measurements of the length of the year, reporting it as 365.24219858156 days.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-mactutor-6) Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison, the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.

After the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (murdered, it is thought, by the [Ismaili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismaili "Ismaili")[order of Assassins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Assassins "Order of Assassins")), Khayyam fell from favor at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his [pilgrimage to Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj"). A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by [Al-Qifti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qifti "Al-Qifti"), was a public demonstration of his faith with a view to allaying suspicions of skepticism and confuting the allegations of unorthodoxy (including possible sympathy or adherence to Zoroastrianism) levelled at him by a hostile clergy.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 29 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 29 [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-25) He was then invited by the new [Sultan Sanjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Sanjar "Sultan Sanjar") to Marv, possibly to work as a court [astrologer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologer "Astrologer").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Britannica-1) He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health. Upon his return, he seems to have lived the life of a recluse.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Great_Muslim_Mathematicians-26): 99

Omar Khayyam died at the age of 83 in his hometown of Nishapur on 4 December 1131, and he is buried in what is now the [Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m "Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám"). One of his disciples [Nizami Aruzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizami_Aruzi "Nizami Aruzi") relates the story that sometime during 1112–3 Khayyam was in [Balkh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkh "Balkh") in the company of [Isfizari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Isfizari "Al-Isfizari") (one of the scientists who had collaborated with him on the Jalali calendar) when he made a prophecy that "my tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Boyle-18): 36 [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-FitzGerald-22) Four years after his death, Aruzi located his tomb in a cemetery in a then large and well-known quarter of Nishapur on the road to Marv. As it had been foreseen by Khayyam, Aruzi found the tomb situated at the foot of a garden-wall over which pear trees and apricot trees had thrust their heads and dropped their flowers so that his tombstone was hidden beneath them.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Boyle-18): 37

Khayyam was famous during his life as a [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Mathematics in the medieval Islamic world"). His surviving mathematical works include

### Theory of parallels

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omar_Khayyam&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Theory of parallels")]

Part of Khayyam's _Commentary on the Difficulties Concerning the Postulates of Euclid's Elements_ deals with the [parallel axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axiom "Parallel axiom").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 282  The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on [petitio principii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petitio_principii "Petitio principii"), but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to _prove_ the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EIr-KhayyamMath-28): § 1 [[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-DSB-Khayyam-29): 326b–327b [[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-30): 75  Drawing upon [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-31): 64–65 [[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Katz-1998-32): 270 [[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Katz-1998-33) Unsatisfied with the failure of mathematicians to prove Euclid's statement from his other postulates, Khayyam tried to connect the axiom with the Fourth Postulate, which states that all right angles are equal to one another.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 282

Khayyam was the first to consider the three distinct cases of acute, obtuse, and right angle for the summit angles of a [Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccheri_quadrilateral "Saccheri quadrilateral").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 283  After proving a number of theorems about them, he showed that Postulate V follows from the right angle hypothesis, and refuted the obtuse and acute cases as self-contradictory.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Katz-1998-32): 270 [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EHAS-34): 133  His elaborate attempt to prove the parallel postulate was significant for the further development of geometry, as it clearly shows the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries. The hypotheses of acute, obtuse, and right angles are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"), and to [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-35)

[Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi")'s commentaries on Khayyam's treatment of parallels made their way to Europe. [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis"), professor of geometry at [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford"), translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometer [Girolamo Saccheri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Saccheri "Girolamo Saccheri"), whose work (_euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus_, 1733) is generally considered the first step in the eventual development of [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics [David Eugene Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eugene_Smith "David Eugene Smith") mentions that Saccheri "used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose". He further says that "Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer."[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 195 [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Great_Muslim_Mathematicians-26): 104 [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-36)

#### Real number concept

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omar_Khayyam&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Real number concept")]

This treatise on Euclid contains another contribution dealing with the [theory of proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") and with the compounding of ratios. Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-37) Displeased with Euclid's definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continued fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. [Youschkevitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_P._Yushkevich "Adolph P. Yushkevich") and Rosenfeld argue that "by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-DSB-Khayyam-29): 327b  Likewise, it was noted by [D. J. Struik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Jan_Struik "Dirk Jan Struik") that Omar was "on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 284

Omar Khayyam's construction of a solution to the [cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation")_x_ 3+2 _x_= 2 _x_ 2+2. The intersection point produced by the circle and the hyperbola determine the desired segment.

Rashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes") in the invention of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Cooper-38): 248  In the _Treatise on the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle_ Khayyam applied algebra to geometry. In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Cooper-38): 248

#### Solution of cubic equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omar_Khayyam&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Solution of cubic equations")]

Khayyam seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-mactutor-6)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-MacTutor-Quote-39) and the first to geometrically solve every type of cubic equation, so far as positive roots are concerned.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-40) The _Treatise on Algebra_ contains his work on [cubic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-41): 9  It is divided into three parts: (i) equations which can be solved with [compass and straight edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler_and_compass "Ruler and compass"), (ii) equations which can be solved by means of [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), and (iii) equations which involve the [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of the unknown.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EIr-KhayyamMath-28): § 3

Khayyam produced an exhaustive list of all possible equations involving lines, squares, and cubes.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-42): 43  He considered three binomial equations, nine trinomial equations, and seven tetranomial equations.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 281  For the first and second degree polynomials, he provided numerical solutions by geometric construction. He concluded that there are fourteen different types of cubics that cannot be reduced to an equation of a lesser degree.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EI2-Khayyam-13): 831b [[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-DSB-Khayyam-29): 328a [[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-43): 49  For these he could not accomplish the construction of his unknown segment with compass and straight edge. He proceeded to present geometric solutions to all types of cubic equations using the properties of conic sections.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 281 [[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Kent&Muraki-44): 157  The prerequisite lemmas for Khayyam's geometrical proof include [Euclid VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), Prop 13, and [Apollonius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga#Book_II "Apollonius of Perga"), Prop 12.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Kent&Muraki-44): 155  The positive root of a cubic equation was determined as the [abscissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscissa "Abscissa") of a point of intersection of two conics, for instance, the intersection of two [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), or the intersection of a parabola and a circle, [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_cetera "Et cetera")[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Evelyn_Kennedy-45): 141  However, he acknowledged that the arithmetic problem of these cubics was still unsolved, adding that "possibly someone else will come to know it after us".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Kent&Muraki-44): 158  This task remained open until the sixteenth century, where an algebraic solution of the cubic equation was found in its generality by [Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano "Gerolamo Cardano"), [Del Ferro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipione_del_Ferro "Scipione del Ferro"), and [Tartaglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccolo_Fontana_Tartaglia "Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia") in [Renaissance Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Italy "Renaissance Italy").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 282

> Whoever thinks [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_algebra "History of algebra") is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geometry "History of geometry") are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved by propositions five and six of Book two of [Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements").

—Omar Khayyam[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-amirmoez-46)

In effect, Khayyam's work is an effort to unify algebra and geometry.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Kasir_review-47): 241  This particular geometric solution of cubic equations was further investigated by [M. Hachtroudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohsen_Hashtroodi "Mohsen Hashtroodi") and extended to solving fourth-degree equations.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-48) Although similar methods had appeared sporadically since [Menaechmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menaechmus "Menaechmus"), and further developed by the 10th-century mathematician [Abu al-Jud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Jud "Abu al-Jud"),[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-49): 29 [[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-50): 110  Khayyam's work can be considered the first systematic study and the first exact method of solving cubic equations.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-51): 92  The mathematician [Woepcke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Woepcke "Franz Woepcke") (1851) who offered translations of Khayyam's algebra into French praised him for his "power of generalization and his rigorously systematic procedure."[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Whinfield-52): 10

### Binomial theorem and extraction of roots

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Omar_Khayyam&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Binomial theorem and extraction of roots")]

> From the [Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics "Indian mathematics") one has methods for obtaining [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root "Square root") and [cube roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root "Cube root"), methods based on knowledge of individual cases– namely the knowledge of the squares of the nine digits 1 2, 2 2, 3 2 (etc.) and their respective products, i.e. 2 × 3 etc. We have written a treatise on the proof of the validity of those methods and that they satisfy the conditions. In addition we have increased their types, namely in the form of the determination of the fourth, fifth, sixth roots up to any desired degree. No one preceded us in this and those proofs are purely arithmetic, founded on the arithmetic of _[The Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_.

—Omar Khayyam, _Treatise on Algebra_[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-53)

In his algebraic treatise, Khayyam alludes to a book he had written on the extraction of the ![Image 5: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)th root of natural numbers using a law he had discovered which did not depend on geometric figures.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Evelyn_Kennedy-45) This book was most likely titled the _Difficulties of Arithmetic_ (_Mushkilāt al-Ḥisāb_),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EI2-Khayyam-13): 832a [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-EIr-KhayyamMath-28): § 4  and is not extant.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-DSB-Khayyam-29): 325b  Based on the context, some historians of mathematics such as D. J. Struik, believe that Omar must have known the formula for the expansion of the binomial ![Image 6: {\displaystyle (a+b)^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bdfac89abdc81ad9084425d7401403b48d41e7f), where _n_ is a positive integer.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Struik-7): 282  The case of power 2 is explicitly stated in Euclid's elements and the case of at most power 3 had been established by Indian mathematicians. Khayyam was the [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem. The argument supporting the claim that Khayyam had a general binomial theorem is based on his ability to extract roots.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-54) One of Khayyam's predecessors, [al-Karaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Karaji "Al-Karaji"), had already discovered the triangular arrangement of the coefficients of binomial expansions that Europeans later came to know as [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Pascal's triangle");[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-55): 60  Khayyam popularized this [triangular array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_array "Triangular array") in Iran, so that it is now known as Omar Khayyam's triangle.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Evelyn_Kennedy-45)

Representation of the intercalation scheme of the Jalali calendar

In 1074–5, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an [observatory at Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan_Observatory "Isfahan Observatory") and reform the [Persian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar "Iranian calendar"). There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Evelyn_Kennedy-45): 141  Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun's center across [vernal equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox"). This marks the beginning of spring or [Nowrūz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowr%C5%ABz "Nowrūz"), a day in which the Sun enters the first degree of [Aries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_(constellation) "Aries (constellation)") before noon.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-56): 10–11 [[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-57) The resultant calendar was named in Malik-Shah's honor as the [Jalālī calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar "Jalali calendar"), and was inaugurated on 15 March 1079.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-58): 269  The [observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory "Observatory") itself was disused after the death of Malik-Shah in 1092.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 659

The Jalālī calendar was a true [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the [Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac "Zodiac"). The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year [intercalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) "Intercalation (timekeeping)") cycle. As indicated by the works of [Khazini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khazini "Al-Khazini"), Khayyam's group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_years "Leap years"). Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-59): 13  The calendar remained in use across [Greater Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran "Greater Iran") from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911, the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of [Qajar Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty "Qajar dynasty"). In 1925, this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernised, resulting in the [modern Iranian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars#Modern_calendar:_Solar_Hijri_(SH) "Iranian calendars"). The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") of 1582,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 659  with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 200 [Moritz Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Cantor "Moritz Cantor") considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Great_Muslim_Mathematicians-26): 101

One of his pupils, [Nizami Aruzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizami_Aruzi "Nizami Aruzi"), relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: "I did not observe that he (_scil._ Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief."[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Whinfield-52): 11  While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 30 [George Saliba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Saliba "George Saliba") explains that the term _‘ilm al-nujūm_, used in various sources in which references to Khayyam's life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: "from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to [Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farabi "Farabi")'s _Enumeration of the Sciences_, that this science, _‘ilm al-nujūm_, was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy."[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-60): 224

Khayyam has a short treatise devoted to [Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle "Archimedes' principle") (in full title, _On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two_). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by [Eilhard Wiedemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilhard_Wiedemann "Eilhard Wiedemann") who believed that Khayyam's solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of [Khazini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khazini "Al-Khazini") and [Al-Nayrizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nayrizi "Al-Nayrizi") who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 198

Another short treatise is concerned with [music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory "Music theory") in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam's contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and [tetrachords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachords "Tetrachords").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 198

Rendition of a _ruba'i_ from the Bodleian manuscript, rendered in [Shekasteh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekasteh "Shekasteh") calligraphy.

The earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam's poetry is from the historian [Imad al-Din al-Isfahani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imad_al-Din_al-Isfahani "Imad al-Din al-Isfahani"), a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist (_Kharidat al-qasr_, 1174).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 49 [[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Dashti-61): 35  One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from [Fakhr al-Din al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi "Fakhr al-Din al-Razi"). In his work _al-Tanbih ‘ala ba‘d asrar al-maw‘dat fi’l-Qur’an_ (c. 1160), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). [Daya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najm_al-Din_Razi "Najm al-Din Razi") in his writings (_Mirṣād al-‘Ibad_, c. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian [Juvayni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ata-Malik_Juvayni "Ata-Malik Juvayni") (_[Tarikh-i Jahangushay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarikh-i\_Jahangushay "Tarikh-i Jahangushay")_, c. 1226–1283).[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Dashti-61): 36–37 [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 92  In 1340 [Jajarmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jajarmi "Jajarmi") includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets (_Mu’nis al-ahrār_), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Ross_1927-62): 434  A comparatively late manuscript is the [Bodleian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodleian_Library "Bodleian Library") MS. Ouseley 140, written in [Shiraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz "Shiraz") in 1460, which contains 158 quatrains on 47 folia. The manuscript belonged to [William Ouseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ouseley "William Ouseley") (1767–1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.

There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Khayyam in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [pseudepigraphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigraphic "Pseudepigraphic").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Dashti-61): 11 [Hans Heinrich Schaeder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Heinrich_Schaeder "Hans Heinrich Schaeder") in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature" due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him. De Blois presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder's time.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Blois-63)[:307](https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA307)

Five of the quatrains later attributed to Omar Khayyam are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in _[Sindbad-Nameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindbad-Nameh "Sindbad-Nameh")_. While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar's time or shortly later, it does not imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Blois-63)[:305](https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA305)[Edward Granville Browne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Granville_Browne "Edward Granville Browne") (1906) notes the difficulty of disentangling authentic from spurious quatrains: "while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 663

In addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, [Shahrazuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shahrazuri "Al-Shahrazuri") (_Nuzhat al-Arwah_, c. 1201–1211), Qifti (_Tārikh al-hukamā_, 1255), and [Hamdallah Mustawfi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdallah_Mustawfi "Hamdallah Mustawfi") (_[Tarikh-i guzida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarikh-i\_guzida "Tarikh-i guzida")_, 1339).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 39

[Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Andrew_Boyle "John Andrew Boyle") emphasized that there are a number of other [Persian scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_scholar "Persian scholar") who occasionally wrote quatrains, including [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna"), [Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali "Al-Ghazali"), and [Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi"). They conclude that it is also possible that for Khayyam poetry was an amusement of his leisure hours: "these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 662

The poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by [Edward FitzGerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_FitzGerald_(poet) "Edward FitzGerald (poet)") (1859). FitzGerald's _[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat\_of\_Omar\_Khayyam "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam")_ contains loose translations of quatrains from the Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the [fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle "Fin de siècle") period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions,[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-64) and many more have been published since.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Blois-63)[:312](https://books.google.com/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA312)

Khayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-NasrRazavi-2): 474  According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna's _[the Book of Healing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Book\_of\_Healing "The Book of Healing")_ before he died.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 661  There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam. One of them, _On existence_ (_Fi’l-wujūd_), was written originally in Persian and deals with the subject of existence and its relationship to universals. Another paper, titled _The necessity of contradiction in the world, determinism and subsistence_ (_Darurat al-tadād fi’l-‘ālam wa’l-jabr wa’l-baqā’_), is written in Arabic and deals with [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will "Free will") and [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-NasrRazavi-2): 475  The titles of his other works are _On being and necessity_ (_Risālah fī’l-kawn wa’l-taklīf_), _The Treatise on Transcendence in Existence_ (_al-Risālah al-ulā fi’l-wujūd_), _On the knowledge of the universal principles of existence_ (_Risālah dar ‘ilm kulliyāt-i wujūd_), and _Abridgement concerning natural phenomena_ (_Mukhtasar fi’l-Tabi‘iyyāt_).

Khayyam himself once said:[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-65): 431

> We are the victims of an age when men of science are discredited, and only a few remain who are capable of engaging in scientific research. Our philosophers spend all their time in mixing true with false and are interested in nothing but outward show; such little learning as they have they extend on material ends. When they see a man sincere and unremitting in his search for the truth, one who will have nothing to do with falsehood and pretence, they mock and despise him.

A literal reading of Khayyam's quatrains leads to the interpretation of his philosophic attitude toward life as a combination of [pessimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_pessimism "Philosophical pessimism"), [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism "Nihilism"), [Epicureanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism "Epicureanism"), [fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism "Fatalism"), and [agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism "Agnosticism").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 6 [[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-66) This view is taken by [Iranologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_studies#List_of_Iranologists "Iranian studies") such as [Arthur Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Christensen "Arthur Christensen"), [Hans Heinrich Schaeder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Heinrich_Schaeder "Hans Heinrich Schaeder"), [John Andrew Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Andrew_Boyle "John Andrew Boyle"), [Edward Denison Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Denison_Ross "Edward Denison Ross"),[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 365 [Edward Henry Whinfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Henry_Whinfield "Edward Henry Whinfield")[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Whinfield-52): 40  and [George Sarton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sarton "George Sarton").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Sarton-21): 18  Conversely, the Khayyamic quatrains have also been described as mystical [Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi "Sufi") poetry.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy-68) In addition to his Persian quatrains, J. C. E. Bowen mentions that Khayyam's Arabic poems also "express a pessimistic viewpoint which is entirely consonant with the outlook of the deeply thoughtful rationalist philosopher that Khayyam is known historically to have been."[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bowen-69): 69 [Edward FitzGerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_FitzGerald_(poet) "Edward FitzGerald (poet)") emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Khayyam.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-70) In his preface to the _Rubáiyát_ he claimed that he "was hated and dreaded by the Sufis",[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-71) and denied any pretense at divine allegory: "his Wine is the veritable Juice of the Grape: his Tavern, where it was to be had: his _Saki_, the Flesh and Blood that poured it out for him."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-72): 62 [Sadegh Hedayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadegh_Hedayat "Sadegh Hedayat") is one of the most notable proponents of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism, and according to [Jan Rypka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Rypka "Jan Rypka") (1934), he even considered Khayyam an [atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist "Atheist").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-73) Hedayat (1923) states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine."[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-74): 138  Omar Khayyam's poetry has been cited in the context of [New Atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism "New Atheism"), such as in _[The Portable Atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Portable\_Atheist "The Portable Atheist")_ by [Christopher Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens "Christopher Hitchens").[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-75): 7

[Al-Qifti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qifti "Al-Qifti") (c. 1172–1248) appears to confirm this view of Khayyam's philosophy.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 663  In his work _The History of Learned Men_ he reports that Khayyam's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 365  He also mentions that he was at one point indicted for impiety, but went on a pilgrimage to prove he was pious.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 29  The report has it that upon returning to his native city he concealed his deepest convictions and practised a strictly religious life, going morning and evening to the place of worship.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 355  Khayyam on the Koran (quote 84):[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Khayyam2017-76)

> The Koran! well, come put me to the test, Lovely old book in hideous error drest, Believe me, I can quote the Koran too, The unbeliever knows his Koran best. And do you think that unto such as you, A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew, God gave the Secret, and denied it me? Well, well, what matters it! believe that too.

> Look not above, there is no answer there; Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer; Near is as near to God as any Far, And Here is just the same deceit as There.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Khayyam2017-76)

> Men talk of heaven,—there is no heaven but here; Men talk of hell,—there is no hell but here; Men of hereafters talk, and future lives, O love, there is no other life—but here.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Khayyam2017-76)

An account of him, written in the thirteenth century, shows him as "versed in all the wisdom of the Greeks," and as wont to insist on the necessity of studying science on Greek lines. Of his prose works, two, which were stand authority, dealt respectively with precious stones and climatology. Beyond question the poet-astronomer was undevout; and his astronomy doubtless helped to make him so. One contemporary writes: "I did not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions; nor have I seen or heard of any of the great (scientists) who had such belief. He gave his adherence to no religious sect. Agnosticism, not faith, is the keynote of his works. Among the sects he saw everywhere strife and hatred in which he could have no part...."[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-77): 263, vol. 1

Persian novelist [Sadegh Hedayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadegh_Hedayat "Sadegh Hedayat") says Khayyám from "his youth to his death remained a materialist, pessimist, agnostic. Khayyam looked at all religions questions with a skeptical eye", continues Hedayat, "and hated the fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, and the spirit of vengeance of the mullas, the so-called religious scholars."[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-78): 13

In the context of a piece entitled _On the Knowledge of the Principles of Existence_, Khayyam endorses the Sufi path.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 8  Csillik suggests the possibility that Omar Khayyam could see in Sufism an ally against orthodox religiosity.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Csillik-79): 75  Other commentators do not accept that Khayyam's poetry has an anti-religious agenda and interpret his references to wine and drunkenness in the conventional metaphorical sense common in Sufism. The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Khayyam's constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be regarded rather in the light of Sufi thought where rapturous intoxication by "wine" is to be understood as a metaphor for the enlightened state or divine rapture of _[baqaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baqaa "Baqaa")_.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-80) The view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-81): 3 [Idries Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idries_Shah "Idries Shah"),[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-82): 165–166  and Dougan who attributes the reputation of hedonism to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that Khayyam's poetry is to be understood as "deeply esoteric".[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-83) On the other hand, Iranian experts such as [Mohammad Ali Foroughi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Foroughi "Mohammad Ali Foroughi") and [Mojtaba Minovi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojtaba_Minovi "Mojtaba Minovi") rejected the hypothesis that Omar Khayyam was a Sufi.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bowen-69): 72  Foroughi stated that Khayyam's ideas may have been consistent with that of Sufis at times but there is no evidence that he was formally a [Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_philosophy "Sufi philosophy"). Aminrazavi states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his _Rubāʿīyyāt_ extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine.".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 128  Furthermore, Boyle emphasizes that Khayyam was intensely disliked by a number of celebrated Sufi mystics who belonged to the same century. This includes [Shams Tabrizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shams_Tabrizi "Shams Tabrizi") (spiritual guide of [Rumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi "Rumi")),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 58 [Najm al-Din Daya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najm_al-Din_Razi "Najm al-Din Razi") who described Omar Khayyam as "an unhappy philosopher, atheist, and materialist",[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bowen-69): 71  and [Attar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attar_of_Nishapur "Attar of Nishapur") who regarded him not as a fellow-mystic but a free-thinking scientist who awaited punishments hereafter.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 663–664

[Seyyed Hossein Nasr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyyed_Hossein_Nasr "Seyyed Hossein Nasr") argues that it is "reductive" to use a literal interpretation of his verses (many of which are of uncertain authenticity to begin with) to establish Omar Khayyam's philosophy. Instead, he adduces Khayyam's interpretive translation of [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna")'s treatise _Discourse on Unity_ (_al-Khutbat al-Tawhīd_), where he expresses orthodox views on [Divine Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawhid "Tawhid") in agreement with the author.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-nasrkhayyamphil-84): Ch. 9, 165–183  The prose works believed to be Khayyam's are written in the [Peripatetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripatetic_school "Peripatetic school") style and are explicitly theistic, dealing with subjects such as [the existence of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_existence_of_God "The existence of God") and [theodicy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy "Theodicy").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 160  As noted by Bowen these works indicate his involvement in the problems of metaphysics rather than in the subtleties of Sufism.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bowen-69): 71  As evidence of Khayyam's faith and/or conformity to Islamic customs, Aminrazavi mentions that in his treatises he offers salutations and prayers, praising God and [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad"). In most biographical extracts, he is referred to with religious [honorifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_name#Laqab "Arabic name") such as _[Imām](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im%C4%81m "Imām")_, _The Patron of Faith_ (_Ghīyāth al-Dīn_), and _The Evidence of Truth_ (_Hujjat al-Haqq_).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9) He also notes that biographers who praise his religiosity generally avoid making reference to his poetry, while the ones who mention his poetry often do not praise his religious character.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 48  For instance, Al-Bayhaqi's account, which antedates by some years other biographical notices, speaks of Omar as a very pious man who professed orthodox views down to his last hour.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bayhaqi-20): 174

On the basis of all the existing textual and biographical evidence, the question remains somewhat open,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Wine_of_Wisdom-9): 11  and as a result Khayyam has received sharply conflicting appreciations and criticisms.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 350

The various biographical extracts referring to Omar Khayyam describe him as unequalled in scientific knowledge and achievement during his time. Many called him by the epithet _King of the Wise_ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): ملك الحکماء, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"):_Malik al-Ḥukamā_).[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Ross_1927-62): 436 [[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Evelyn_Kennedy-45): 141 [Shahrazuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahrazuri "Shahrazuri") (d. 1300) esteems him highly as a mathematician, and claims that he may be regarded as "the successor of [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") in the various branches of philosophic learning".[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 352 [Al-Qifti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qifti "Al-Qifti") (d. 1248), even though disagreeing with his views, concedes he was "unrivalled in his knowledge of natural philosophy and astronomy".[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-E.D._Ross-67): 355  Despite being hailed as a poet by a number of biographers, according to [John Andrew Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Andrew_Boyle "John Andrew Boyle") "it is still possible to argue that Khayyam's status as a poet of the first rank is a comparatively late development."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-The_Cambridge_History_of_Iran-8): 663

[Thomas Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hyde "Thomas Hyde") was the first European to call attention to Khayyam and to translate one of his quatrains into Latin (_Historia religionis veterum Persarum eorumque magorum_, 1700).[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-86): 525  Western interest in Persia grew with the [Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism "Orientalism") movement in the 19th century. [Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Hammer-Purgstall "Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall") (1774–1856) translated some of Khayyam's poems into German in 1818, and [Gore Ouseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Ouseley "Gore Ouseley") (1770–1844) into English in 1846, but Khayyam remained relatively unknown in the West until after the publication of [Edward FitzGerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_FitzGerald_(poet) "Edward FitzGerald (poet)")'s _[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat\_of\_Omar\_Khayyam "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam")_ in 1859. FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful but was popularised by [Whitley Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Stokes_(Celtic_scholar) "Whitley Stokes (Celtic scholar)") from 1861 onward, and the work came to be greatly admired by the [Pre-Raphaelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelites "Pre-Raphaelites"). In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent of the formation of numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" and a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat".[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-87): 202  Khayyam's poems have been translated into many languages; many of the more recent ones are more literal than that of FitzGerald.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Reception-88)

FitzGerald's translation was a factor in rekindling interest in Khayyam as a poet even in his native Iran.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Simidchieva-89): 55–72 [Sadegh Hedayat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadegh_Hedayat "Sadegh Hedayat") in his _Songs of Khayyam_ (_Taranehha-ye Khayyam_, 1934) reintroduced Khayyam's poetic legacy to modern Iran. Under the [Pahlavi dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_dynasty "Pahlavi dynasty"), a new [monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Omar_Khayyam "Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam") of white marble, designed by the architect [Houshang Seyhoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houshang_Seyhoun "Houshang Seyhoun"), was erected over his tomb. A statue by [Abolhassan Sadighi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolhassan_Sadighi "Abolhassan Sadighi") was erected in [Laleh Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laleh_Park "Laleh Park"), [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran "Tehran") in the 1960s, and a bust by the same sculptor was placed near Khayyam's mausoleum in Nishapur. In 2009, the state of Iran donated a [pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholars_Pavilion "Scholars Pavilion") to the [United Nations Office in Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_in_Vienna "United Nations Office in Vienna"), inaugurated at [Vienna International Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_International_Center "Vienna International Center").[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-90) In 2016, three statues of Khayyam were unveiled: one at the [University of Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma "University of Oklahoma"), one in Nishapur and one in Florence, Italy.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-91) Over 150 [composers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer") have used the _Rubaiyat_ as their source of inspiration. The earliest such composer was [Liza Lehmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Lehmann "Liza Lehmann").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-92)

FitzGerald rendered Khayyam's name as "Tentmaker", and the anglicized name of "Omar the Tentmaker" resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [Nathan Haskell Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Haskell_Dole "Nathan Haskell Dole") published a novel called _Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia_ in 1898. _Omar the Tentmaker of [Naishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur "Nishapur")_ is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. "Omar the Tentmaker" is also the title of a 1914 play by [Richard Walton Tully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Walton_Tully "Richard Walton Tully") in an oriental setting, adapted as a [silent film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_the_Tentmaker_(film) "Omar the Tentmaker (film)") in 1922. US General [Omar Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Bradley "Omar Bradley") was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-93): 13

The diverse talents and intellectual pursuits of Khayyam captivated many [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") and [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") writers throughout history.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-94) Scholars often viewed Khayyam as a means to enhance their own poetic prowess and intellectual depth, drawing inspiration and recognition from his writings.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95) For many Muslim reformers, Khayam's verses provided a counterpoint to the conservative norms prevalent in Islamic societies, allowing room for independent thought and a libertine lifestyle.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95) Figures like [Abdullah Cevdet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Cevdet "Abdullah Cevdet"), [Rıza Tevfik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C4%B1za_Tevfik_B%C3%B6l%C3%BCkba%C5%9F%C4%B1 "Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı"), and [Yahya Kemal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Kemal_Beyatl%C4%B1 "Yahya Kemal Beyatlı") utilized Khayyam's themes to justify their progressive ideologies or to celebrate liberal aspects of their lives, portraying him as a cultural, political, and intellectual role model who demonstrated Islam's compatibility with modern conventions.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95) Similarly, Turkish leftist poets and intellectuals, including [Nâzım Hikmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Hikmet "Nâzım Hikmet"), [Sabahattin Eyüboğlu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabahattin_Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu "Sabahattin Eyüboğlu"), A. Kadir, and Gökçe, appropriated Khayyam to champion their socialist worldview, imbuing his voice with a humanistic tone in the vernacular.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95) Khayyam's resurgence in spoken [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language") since the 1980s has transformed him into a poet of the people, with numerous books and translations revitalizing his historical significance.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95) Conversely, scholars like Dāniş, Tevfik, and [Gölpınarlı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd%C3%BClbaki_G%C3%B6lp%C4%B1narl%C4%B1 "Abdülbaki Gölpınarlı") advocated for source criticism and the identification of authentic quatrains to discern the genuine Khayyam amidst historical perceptions of his sociocultural image.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Bal%C4%B1k%C3%A7%C4%B1o%C4%9Flu1-22-95)

The quatrain by Omar Khayyam known as "The Moving Finger", in the form of its translation by the English poet [Edward Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_FitzGerald_(poet) "Edward FitzGerald (poet)") is one of the most popular quatrains in the [Anglosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere "Anglosphere").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Moving_Finger-96) It reads:

> The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,
> 
> 
> Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
> 
> 
> Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
> 
> 
> Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-97)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-98)

> “We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, ‘Too late.’ There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect. Omar Khayyam is right: ‘The moving finger writes, and having writ moves on.’”

In one of his apologetic speeches about the [Clinton–Lewinsky scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal "Clinton–Lewinsky scandal"), [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton"), the 42nd president of the US, also cites this quatrain.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-Moving_Finger-96)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-100)

Writer [Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts "Alan Watts") also cites this quatrain in episode 15 of a 1959 television series he hosted called "_Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life_."[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m#cite_note-101)
