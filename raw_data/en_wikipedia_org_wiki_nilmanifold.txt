As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a homogeneous space and is diffeomorphic to the quotient space N / H {\displaystyle N/H} , the quotient of a nilpotent Lie group N modulo a closed subgroup H .  This notion was introduced by Anatoly Mal'cev in 1949.

[ 1 ] In the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold.  A Riemannian manifold is called a homogeneous nilmanifold if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it.  The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson [ 2 ] ).

Nilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature, [ 3 ] almost flat spaces arise as quotients of nilmanifolds, [ 4 ] and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow .

[ 5 ] In addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in arithmetic combinatorics (see Green–Tao [ 6 ] ) and ergodic theory (see, e.g., Host–Kra [ 7 ] ).

Compact nilmanifolds [ edit ] A compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact.  One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N and a discrete subgroup Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } .  If the subgroup Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on N , then the quotient manifold N / Γ Γ {\displaystyle N/\Gamma } will be a compact nilmanifold.  As Mal'cev has shown, every compact
nilmanifold is obtained this way.

[ 1 ] Such a subgroup Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } as above is called a lattice in N .  It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational structure constants : this is Mal'cev's criterion .  Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also M. S. Raghunathan .

[ 8 ] A compact Riemannian nilmanifold is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric.  These spaces are constructed as follows.  Let Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N , as above.  Endow N with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric.  Then the subgroup Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } acts by isometries on N via left-multiplication.  Thus the quotient Γ Γ ∖ ∖ N {\displaystyle \Gamma \backslash N} is a compact space locally isometric to N .  Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to N / Γ Γ {\displaystyle N/\Gamma } .

Compact nilmanifolds also arise as principal bundles .  For example, consider a 2-step nilpotent Lie group N which admits a lattice (see above).  Let Z = [ N , N ] {\displaystyle Z=[N,N]} be the commutator subgroup of N .  Denote by p the dimension of Z and by q the codimension of Z ; i.e. the dimension of N is p+q.  It is known (see Raghunathan) that Z ∩ ∩ Γ Γ {\displaystyle Z\cap \Gamma } is a lattice in Z .  Hence, G = Z / ( Z ∩ ∩ Γ Γ ) {\displaystyle G=Z/(Z\cap \Gamma )} is a p -dimensional compact torus.  Since Z is central in N , the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold P = N / Γ Γ {\displaystyle P=N/\Gamma } with quotient space M = P / G {\displaystyle M=P/G} .  This base manifold M is a q -dimensional compact torus.  It has been shown that every principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see.

[ 9 ] More generally, a compact nilmanifold is a torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.

As mentioned above, almost flat manifolds are intimately compact nilmanifolds.  See that article for more information.

Complex nilmanifolds [ edit ] Historically, a complex nilmanifold meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over a cocompact lattice . An example of such a nilmanifold is an Iwasawa manifold . From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.

An almost complex structure on a real Lie algebra g is an endomorphism I : g → → g {\displaystyle I:\;g\rightarrow g} which squares to
−Id g . This operator is called a complex structure if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues ± ± − − 1 {\displaystyle \pm {\sqrt {-1}}} , are subalgebras in g ⊗ ⊗ C {\displaystyle g\otimes {\mathbb {C} }} . In this case, I defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold ( G , I ) is called a complex group manifold .
It is easy to see that every connected complex homogeneous manifold equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.

Let G be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A complex nilmanifold is a quotient of a complex group  manifold ( G , I ), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.

Complex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.

In complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a Kodaira surface .

[ 10 ] Properties [ edit ] Compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never homotopy formal .

[ 11 ] This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot
admit a Kähler structure (see also [ 12 ] ).

Topologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained
as iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by ascending central series .

[ 13 ] Examples [ edit ] Nilpotent Lie groups [ edit ] From the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold.  The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.

For example, the Heisenberg group is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group.  This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient.  The group Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients.  The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional.  One possible fundamental domain is (isomorphic to) [0,1] 3 with the faces identified in a suitable way.  This is because an element ( 1 x z 1 y 1 ) Γ Γ {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&x&z\\&1&y\\&&1\end{pmatrix}}\Gamma } of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element ( 1 { x } { z − − x ⌊ ⌊ y ⌋ ⌋ } 1 { y } 1 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&\{x\}&\{z-x\lfloor y\rfloor \}\\&1&\{y\}\\&&1\end{pmatrix}}} in the fundamental domain.  Here ⌊ ⌊ x ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor x\rfloor } denotes the floor function of x , and { x } {\displaystyle \{x\}} the fractional part .  The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis.

[ 6 ] Abelian Lie groups [ edit ] A simpler example would be any abelian Lie group.  This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group.  For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers.  The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle R / Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} } .  Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.

Generalizations [ edit ] A parallel construction based on solvable Lie groups produces a class of spaces called solvmanifolds . An important example of a solvmanifolds are Inoue surfaces , known in complex geometry .
