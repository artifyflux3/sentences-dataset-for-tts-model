Date and time ( UTC ) Booster Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome Booster landing 1 16 January 2025 07:03 [ 1 ] GS1-SN001 So You're Telling Me There's a Chance [ 2 ] Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 Blue Ring Pathfinder [ 3 ] Unknown MEO Blue Origin Success Failure ( Jacklyn ) Maiden/demonstration flight of New Glenn, carrying a prototype Blue Ring spacecraft. First National Security Space Launch demonstration flight for New Glenn.

[ 4 ] The 13 January launch was scrubbed due to problems with the rocket. The second stage made it to orbit, but the first stage was lost and failed to land.

[ 5 ] Future launches [ edit ] Launches are expected to take place "no earlier than" (NET) the listed date.

Date and time ( UTC ) Booster Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer 29 September 2025 [ 6 ] GS1-SN002 Never Tell Me The Odds [ 7 ] Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 ESCAPADE (2 spacecraft) Unknown Sun-Earth L 2 to Areocentric NASA Second National Security Space Launch demonstration flight for New Glenn. Will carry the ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission for NASA, which aims to investigate Mars' magnetosphere . New Glenn will deploy two spacecraft on a direct interplanetary trajectory. ESCAPADE is part of NASA's low-cost SIMPLEx program. NASA will pay Blue Origin about $20 million for the launch.

[ 8 ] Delayed from 13 October 2024; it was originally intended to be launched on the debut flight of New Glenn.

[ 4 ] Late 2025 [ 6 ] Unknown Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 Elytra Mission 1 and others [ 9 ] Unknown LEO ?

NRO & others NRO Responsive Space Mission, carrying Firefly's Elytra orbital transfer vehicle and Xtenti's FANTM-RiDE payload dispenser. Originally planned to launch on Firefly Alpha from SLC-2W at Vandenberg , but was moved to New Glenn following the failure of "Message in a Booster" in April 2025.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Early 2026 [ 6 ] Unknown Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 Blue Moon Mark 1 Pathfinder Unknown TLI NASA ( CLPS ) Will carry a prototype Blue Moon Mark 1 lander, planned to make a landing on the Moon. During the mission Blue Moon will carry a payload called Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies (SCALPSS), as part of a task order from NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, awarded in July 2024.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Unclear whether this is a rideshare on Elytra-1 or if there is another launch so soon.

Mid 2026 [ 6 ] Unknown Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 KuiperSat × 61 (KN‑01) [ 15 ] Unknown LEO Amazon ( Kuiper Systems ) First launch of KuiperSat satellites on New Glenn to expand Project Kuiper internet constellation. Project Kuiper was also founded by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos; however, the two companies are not directly connected.

2026 [ 16 ] Unknown Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 Blue Moon (Mk1) Unknown TLI Blue Origin Pathfinder Mission 2 2026+ Unknown Cape Canaveral , LC‑36 KuiperSat × 61 (KN-02 to KN-12) [ 15 ] Unknown LEO Amazon ( Kuiper Systems ) Satellite internet constellation .
