For Wikipedia's policy on the use of tertiary sources, see Wikipedia:No original research § Tertiary .

A tertiary source is an index or textual consolidation of already published primary and secondary sources [ 1 ] that does not provide additional interpretations or analysis of the sources.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Some tertiary sources can be used as an aid to find key (seminal) sources, key terms, general common knowledge [ 4 ] and established mainstream science on a topic. The exact definition of tertiary varies by academic field .

Academic research standards generally do not accept tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as citations, [ 4 ] although survey articles are frequently cited rather than the original publication.

Overlap with secondary sources [ edit ] Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a bibliography , dictionary , or encyclopedia as either a tertiary or a secondary source.

[ 1 ] This causes some difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some academic disciplines, the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] In the United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model , a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.

[ 5 ] Types of tertiary sources [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

( May 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, dictionaries, some textbooks , [ 1 ] and compendia attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview without adding analysis and synthesis of new conclusions.

Indexes , bibliographies , concordances , and databases are aggregates of primary and secondary sources and therefore often considered tertiary sources. They may also serve as a point of access to the full or partial text of primary and secondary sources.

Almanacs , travel guides , field guides , and timelines are also examples of tertiary sources.

Wikipedia is a tertiary source.
