A girl making a snow angel in snow A snow angel is a design made in fresh snow by lying on one's back and moving one's arms up and down, and one's legs from side to side to form the shape of an angel .

Technique [ edit ] Creating the snow angel is a simple process. The first step is to find an undisturbed plane of fresh snow. The next step is to lie with arms and legs outstretched on the snow. The limbs are then swept back and forth, creating a trough through the snow. When it is finished, the snow angel should have the appearance of a stylized angel, the movement of the arms having formed wings, and that of the legs having formed a gown. Fresh, light, powdery snow makes the best snow angel rather than heavy, sticky snow.

Current world record [ edit ] On March 28, 2007, Guinness World Records confirmed that North Dakota holds the world record for the most snow angels created simultaneously in one place. The event occurred on February 17, 2007, when 8,962 snow angels were created by people on the state capitol grounds in Bismarck .
