Background and education [ edit ] Born in London , Storr was educated at Winchester College , Christ's College, Cambridge , and Westminster Hospital .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was in the first cohort of medics to train in Jungian analysis at the Society of Analytical Psychology in London.

[ 3 ] Career [ edit ] In 1974, Storr moved from private practice to a teaching appointment at the Warneford Hospital in Oxford , until his retirement in 1984.

[ 1 ] Personal [ edit ] Storr was, as one of his obituarists observed, "no stranger to suffering at formative stages of his life." [ 1 ] He married twice, to Catherine Cole (who became a children's writer under her married name) in 1942 and writer Catherine Peters in 1970 after the first marriage ended in divorce.

[ 4 ] Distinctions [ edit ] Emeritus Fellow of Green College (1984) Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1990) Honorary FRCPsych (1993) [ 2 ] Works [ edit ] In his books, Storr explored the secrets of the dark sides of the human psyche – sexual deviations ( Sexual Deviation , 1964), aggression ( Human Aggression , 1968), and destructiveness ( Human Destructiveness , 1972). At the same time, he saw the possibility of creative use of these spontaneous drives and directing them towards sports, scientific and artistic feats ( The Dynamics of Creation , 1972).

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] In his book Music and the Mind , Storr explores various theories on the origins of music .

[ 5 ] In chapter 3 of the book Storr writes: Although music is sometimes referred to as a universal language, this is an entirely misleading description. The difficulty of appreciating music from different periods of history or from different cultures is a powerful argument in favour of the view that the various types of music are predominantly cultural artefacts rather than based on natural  phenomena.

[ 6 ] In his final book Feet of Clay; Saints, Sinners, and Madmen: The Power and Charisma of Gurus (1996) Storr tracks typical patterns, often involving psychotic disorders that shape the development of the guru .

[ 7 ] He challenges Jesus' mental health by implying that there are psychological similarities between crazy "messiahs" such as Jim Jones , David Koresh , and respected religious leaders, including Jesus .

[ 4 ] His study is an attempt to look at Jesus as one of many gurus.
