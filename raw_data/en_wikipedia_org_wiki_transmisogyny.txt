transphobia and misogyny as experienced by trans women and transfeminine people.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term was coined by Julia Serano in her 2007 book Whipping Girl to describe a particular form of oppression experienced by trans women.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In a 2017 interview with The New York Times , Serano explores the roots of transmisogyny as a critique of feminine gender expressions which are "ridiculed in comparison to masculine interests and gender expression." [ 6 ] Transmisogyny is a central concept in transfeminism and is commonly referenced in intersectional feminist theory . In her definition of transmisogyny, Serano does not limit those affected by transmisogyny to individuals who identify as transgender and includes others, such as cisgender people, and those who identify as drag queens .

[ 7 ] Framework [ edit ] The concept of transmisogyny hinges on two other concepts first described by Serano: traditional sexism and oppositional sexism . The former is the idea that "maleness and masculinity are superior to femaleness and femininity", while the latter holds male and female as "rigid, mutually exclusive categories". Transmisogyny stems from both these concepts.

[ 2 ] In Whipping Girl , Julia Serano writes that the existence of trans women is seen as a threat to a "male-centered gender hierarchy ".

[ 8 ] : 15 Gender theorist Judith Butler echoes this assumption, stating that the murder of transgender women by men is "the most toxic form that masculinity can take", a way for the killer to assert power over the victim in the instant, in response to the idea of the intrinsic nature of his power (i.e., his masculinity) being threatened. Butler states that trans women have relinquished masculinity, showing that it is possible to do so.

[ 9 ] Trans panic is a common legal and social defense strategy that is used to justify violence towards transgender individuals, particularly trans women.

[ 10 ] Similar to Gay Panic , it suggests that the aggressor was provoked into violence due to the victim’s gender presentation being misleading or deceptive.

[ 11 ] In A Short History of Trans Misogyny , Jules Gill-Peterson outlines several moments of trans panic related violence leading back to the 1800s.

[ 12 ] She adds that, “The misgendering of trans-femme individuals as male sexual aggression… allows people to respond to trans femininity with as much preemptive violence as they desire.” [ 13 ] Instances [ edit ] United States [ edit ] See also: Transphobia in the United States Transgender women face harsher levels of discrimination than some other transgender people. A study on workplace experiences following gender reassignment found that trans women, on average, lose almost one third of their salary (see Gender pay gap in the United States ), are respected less, and receive more harassment. At the same time, trans men often experience slight salary raises and greater authority in the workplace.

[ 14 ] According to Laura Kacere (2014), trans people experience a disproportionately large number of hate crimes, with trans women experiencing the majority of these crimes.

[ 15 ] The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (2012) found that police violence is three times higher against transgender people than it is against cisgender people.

[ 16 ] In fact, over half of all anti-LGBTQIA+ homicides were perpetrated against transgender women.

[ 15 ] (See List of people killed for being transgender .) In the United States, the majority of transmisogyny is directed at trans women of color. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation (2018) reports significant overlaps between the gender identity and race of anti-trans violence victims: of the known homicides of transgender people from 2013 to 2018, approximately 92% were trans women, and approximately 70% were black.

[ 17 ] Kacere (2014) also states that 21% of transgender women and 47% of black transgender women have experienced incarceration, rates that are much higher than those for the overall U.S. population.

[ 15 ] Ecuador [ edit ] See also: LGBT rights in Ecuador A study of discrimination directed against lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and intersex women in Ecuador found that transgender women "lack protection against discrimination in both law and practice." As a result, trans women have faced violence, sexual abuse, and discrimination in educational, health and workforce institutions.

[ 18 ] Sexualization and harassment [ edit ] Julia Serano has stated that many trans women experience an additional layer of misogyny in the form of fetishization.

[ 19 ] She notes that, despite public fixation on describing even post- transition trans women as male, they are rarely sexualized as men. In the porn industry , whose target audience is primarily heterosexual men, trans women are largely presented as sexual objects .

[ 8 ] : 256 According to Serano, the sexualisation of trans women is not solely because transgender women, by nature of their relative rarity, are viewed as "exotic": she notes that trans women are sexualized particularly much even compared to other types of "rare" women.

[ 8 ] : 257 In Whipping Girl , Serano writes on what she calls a "predator–prey dichotomy" where "men are invariably viewed as predators and women as prey." [ 8 ] : 255 Because of this view, trans women are perceived to be luring men by transitioning and "turning [themselves] into sexual objects that no red-blooded man can resist." [ 8 ] : 258 Transmisogynistic violence and harassment directed towards trans feminine individuals is often perpetrated by strangers rather than those known by the victim and oftentimes includes catcalling and other forms of verbal abuse .

[ 20 ] Although some states have non-discrimination laws protecting transgender individuals, there is no federal law specifically designed to protect those who identify as transgender.

[ 20 ] Forming coalitions with trans activism is crucial to collectively challenge both ableism and transmisogyny.

[ 21 ] Transmisogyny and ableism often intersect, resulting in unique challenges for trans disabled individuals who face compounded discrimination and marginalization.

[ 22 ] Relation to transphobia [ edit ] Transmisogyny is a distinct category of transphobia in that transmisogyny mainly focuses on trans women and other transgender individuals who demonstrate femininity, whereas transphobia is a more general term, covering a broader spectrum of prejudice and discrimination towards transsexual and transgender individuals.

[ 23 ] Julia Serano states in Whipping Girl that "[w]hen the majority of jokes made at the expense of trans people center on 'men wearing dresses' or 'men who want their penises cut off' that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny. When the majority of violence and sexual assaults committed against trans people is directed at trans women, that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny." [ 8 ] : 14–15 Serano gives an example of the discrimination that trans feminine individuals experience and how it differs from what she assumes is the experience of a trans masculine individual in a New York Times interview, Once in San Francisco I saw a trans woman dressed like an average feminine woman walk past a straight couple on the street. The man turned to the woman and sneered "Did you see all that crap he's wearing?" He was referring to her dress and jewelry and makeup and all that. If a trans man had walked by, they might also have ridiculed him for being transgender. But I doubt very much they would have made fun of his masculine clothing.

[ 24 ] Online stereotypes [ edit ] See also: LGBTQ grooming conspiracy theory The phenomenon described by Serano is particularly evident in online depictions of trans women, mainly in Internet memes wherein trans women are often derogatorily portrayed as masculine men wearing feminine clothing.

[ 25 ] The same transphobic depictions also often attempt to express that trans women suffer from victim mentality , are overreactive and demanding, or are "pretending" to be women with the intention of sexually harassing "real" women and/or children. Such motifs are particularly prominent in discourse surrounding trans bathroom bills .

[ 25 ] Pseudoscience [ edit ] Noteworthy in the discussion surrounding transmisogyny is also the idea of autogynephilia , a hypothetical paraphilia proposed by Ray Blanchard , and defined by him as "a male's propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought of himself as a female." [ 26 ] Although modern scientific knowledge does not completely rule out the existence of autogynephilia as something that may occur in some individuals, it contradicts Blanchard's formulation that it is the basis for the transsexuality of heterosexual trans women.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] The dominant scientific explanation remains the incongruence between gender identity and biological sex , which is responsible for gender dysphoria .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Nevertheless, autogynephilia is often promoted by anti-LGBT hate groups and transphobic writers as an attempt to pathologize trans identity.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] On the topic of autogynephilia, Julia Serano (also being a biologist ), has said: "If proponents of autogynephilia insist that every exception to the model is due to misreporting, then autogynephilia theory must be rejected on the grounds that it is unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific. If, on the other hand, we accept that these exceptions are legitimate, then it is clear that autogynephilia theory's two-subtype taxonomy does not hold true."

From dozens of potential images, I identified three broad categories: "Man in a Dress" memes, which present trans people (or cisgender men in women's clothing) as a threat in public restrooms [...] "Man in a Dress" memes invoke a wide variety of transphobic and transmisogynistic tropes. They feature conventionally masculine-appearing men, sometimes cross-dressing, attempting to use the women's restroom as a ruse to ogle or sexually assault cis women. [...] Another meme literally features the phrase "man wearing a dress." Labeling a crying adult "VICTIM" and a small girl "BIGOT," a cartoon ridicules activists for trans-inclusive bathrooms by having the cis girl (White, and wearing a pink bow in her hair) say "There's a 40-year-old man wearing a dress in the girl's restroom," to which the adult responds, "There's a micro-aggressive White privileged homophobe in my safe space!!" ^ a b Moser MD, Charles (30 June 2010).
