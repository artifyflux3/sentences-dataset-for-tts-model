Charlson is known for his research in atmospheric chemistry, aerosol physics, aerosol/cloud/climate interaction, aerosol and cloud instrumentation.

Background [ edit ] Robert Jay Charlson was born in San Jose, California on September 30, 1936, to Adele and Rolland Charlson. His mother's maiden name was listed as Stucky.

[ 1 ] On March 16, 1964, he married Patricia Allison in Seattle in the University Christian Church in King County, Washington .

[ 2 ] Charlson died on September 28, 2021, at the age of 84.

[ 3 ] Education and career [ edit ] Charlson received BS and MS degrees in chemistry from Stanford University . Harold S. Johnston was his undergraduate advisor.

[ 4 ] His master's thesis was titled: “Techniques for High Speed Flash Photolysis”.

[ 5 ] In 1964, Charlson was awarded a PhD in atmospheric sciences from the University of Washington, Seattle .

[ 6 ] His advisor was Konrad Büttner .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Since 1998, he was professor emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences, chemistry , and geophysics at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington .

[ 9 ] Charlson was one of the lead authors for Chapter 2, "Radiative forcing of climate change" in the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working group report.

[ 10 ] He was also a contributing author to the 1990 and the 2001 IPCC assessment reports.

[ 11 ] In 2007, the IPCC received the Nobel Peace Prize for this work validating the scientific basis of climate change.
