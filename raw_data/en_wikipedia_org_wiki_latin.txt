**Latin** (_lingua Latina_ or _Latinum_[[I]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-IPA-1)) is a [classical language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_language "Classical language") belonging to the [Italic branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_languages "Italic languages") of the [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages"). Latin was originally spoken by the [Latins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latins_(Italic_tribe) "Latins (Italic tribe)") in [Latium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latium "Latium") (now known as [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio "Lazio")), the lower [Tiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber "Tiber") area around [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"), Italy.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-2) Through the expansion of the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"), it became the dominant language in the [Italian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Peninsula "Italian Peninsula") and subsequently throughout the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"). It has greatly influenced many languages, [including English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_influence_in_English "Latin influence in English"), having contributed [many words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_words_with_English_derivatives "List of Latin words with English derivatives") to the English [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon "Lexicon"), particularly after the [Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Anglo-Saxon_England "Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England") and the [Norman Conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest "Norman Conquest"). Latin [roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics) "Root (linguistics)") appear frequently in the technical vocabulary used by fields such as [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), [the sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_and_Greek_words_commonly_used_in_systematic_names "List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_roots,_suffixes_and_prefixes "List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes"), and [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_legal_terms "List of Latin legal terms").

By the late [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"), [Old Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Latin "Old Latin") had evolved into standardized [Classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin"). [Vulgar Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin "Vulgar Latin") refers to the less prestigious [colloquial registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquial_register "Colloquial register"), attested in inscriptions and some literary works such as those of the comic playwrights [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus "Plautus") and [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence "Terence")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-3) and the author [Petronius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronius "Petronius"). While often called a "dead language",[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-4) Latin did not undergo [language death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_death "Language death"). Between the 6th and 9th centuries, natural [language change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change "Language change") in the vernacular Latin of different regions evolved into distinct [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages"). After the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire"), Latin remained the [common language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_language "Common language") of [international communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_communication "International communication"), science, scholarship and [academia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia "Academia") in Europe into the early 19th century, by which time modern languages had supplanted it in common academic and political usage.

[Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin "Late Latin") is the literary form of the language from the 3rd century AD onward. No longer spoken as a native language, [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") was used across Western and Catholic Europe during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") as a working and literary language from the 9th century to the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), which then developed a classicizing form, called [Renaissance Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Latin "Renaissance Latin"). This was the basis for [Neo-Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin "Neo-Latin"), which evolved during the [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period"). Latin was taught to be written and spoken at least until the late seventeenth century, when spoken skills began to erode; [Contemporary Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Latin "Contemporary Latin") is generally studied to be read rather than spoken. [Ecclesiastical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Latin "Ecclesiastical Latin") remains the [official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language "Official language") of the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See") and the [Roman Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rite "Roman Rite") of the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church").

[Latin grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_grammar "Latin grammar") is highly [fusional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language "Fusional language"), with classes of inflections for [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_case "Noun case"), [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number"), [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person"), [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender"), [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_tenses "Latin tenses"), [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood "Grammatical mood"), [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(grammar) "Voice (grammar)"), and [aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect "Grammatical aspect"). The [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") is directly derived from the [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_alphabet "Etruscan alphabet") and [Greek alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet").

A number of phases of the language have been recognized, each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary, usage, spelling, and syntax. There are no hard and fast rules of classification; different scholars emphasize different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names.

In addition to the historical phases, [Ecclesiastical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Latin "Ecclesiastical Latin") refers to the styles used by the writers of the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") from [late antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity "Late Antiquity") onward, as well as by [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") scholars.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Lapis-niger.jpg/250px-Lapis-niger.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lapis-niger.jpg)

The [Lapis Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger "Lapis Niger"), probably the oldest extant Latin inscription, from Rome, c. 600 BC during the semi-legendary [Roman Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom "Roman Kingdom")

The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, also called Archaic or Early Latin, which was spoken from the [Roman Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom "Roman Kingdom"), traditionally founded in 753 BC, through the later part of the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"), up to 75 BC, i.e. before the age of [Classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-5) It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus "Plautus") and [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence "Terence"). The [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") was devised from the [Etruscan alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_alphabet "Etruscan alphabet"). The writing later changed from what was initially either a [right-to-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_script "Right-to-left script") or a [boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon "Boustrophedon")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-6)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-7) script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-8)

During the late republic and into the first years of the empire, from about 75 BC to AD 200, a new [Classical Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin") arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate "Literate") men, who wrote the great works of [classical literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_literature "Classical literature"), which were taught in [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") and [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric") schools. Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such [schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_school "Roman school"), which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-9)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-10)

Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus "Plautus"), which contain fragments of everyday speech, gives evidence of an informal register of the language, Vulgar Latin (termed _sermo vulgi_ 'the speech of the masses', by [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero")). Some linguists, particularly in the nineteenth century, believed this to be a separate language, existing more or less in parallel with the literary or educated Latin, but this is now widely dismissed.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-11)

The term 'Vulgar Latin' remains difficult to define, referring both to informal speech at any time within the history of Latin, and the kind of informal Latin that had begun to move away from the written language significantly in the post-Imperial period, that led ultimately to the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages").

During the Classical period, informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors, inscriptions such as [Curse tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_tablets "Curse tablets") and those found as [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_graffiti "Roman graffiti"). In the [Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin "Late Latin") period, language changes reflecting spoken (non-classical) norms tend to be found in greater quantities in texts.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-12) As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically. On the contrary, Romanised European populations developed their own [dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialects_of_Latin "Dialects of Latin") of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-13)

Late Latin is a kind of written Latin used in the 3rd to 6th centuries. This began to diverge from Classical forms at a faster pace. It is characterised by greater use of prepositions, and word order that is closer to modern Romance languages, for example, while grammatically retaining more or less the same formal rules as Classical Latin.

Ultimately, Latin diverged into a distinct written form, where the commonly spoken form was perceived as a separate language, for instance early French or Italian dialects, that could be transcribed differently. It took some time for these to be viewed as wholly different from Latin however.

After the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire") fell in 476 and [Germanic kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_kingdoms "Barbarian kingdoms") took its place, the [Germanic people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_people "Germanic people") adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-14)

While the written form of Latin was increasingly standardized into a fixed form, the spoken forms began to diverge more greatly. Currently, the five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"), and [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language"). Despite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy have retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") (Roman Catholic) culture.

It was not until the [Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula "Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula") in 711, cutting off communications between the major Romance regions, that the languages began to diverge seriously.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-15) The spoken Latin that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely separated from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire.

Spoken Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest, when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear. They were, throughout the period, confined to everyday speech, as Medieval Latin was used for writing.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-:0-16)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-17)

For many Italians using Latin, though, there was no complete separation between Italian and Latin, even into the beginning of the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"). [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch") for example saw Latin as a literary version of the spoken language.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-18)

Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the post-classical period when no corresponding Latin [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular "Vernacular") existed, that is from around 700 to 1500 AD. The spoken language had developed into the various Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world, Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") and its allies.

Without the institutions of the Roman Empire that had supported its uniformity, Medieval Latin was much more liberal in its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin _sum_ and _eram_ are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses. Medieval Latin might use _fui_ and _fueram_ instead.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-thorley13-15-19) Furthermore, the meanings of many words were changed and new words were introduced, often under influence from the vernacular. Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-thorley13-15-19)

### Renaissance and Neo-Latin

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Latin&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Renaissance and Neo-Latin")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Incunabula_distribution_by_language.png/250px-Incunabula_distribution_by_language.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Incunabula_distribution_by_language.png)

Most 15th-century printed books ([incunabula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabula "Incunabula")) were in Latin, with the [vernacular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_language "Vernacular language") playing only a secondary role.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-ISTC-20)

Renaissance Latin, in use from around 1300 to 1500, and the classicised Latin that followed through to the present are often grouped together as _Neo-Latin_, or New Latin, which have in recent decades become a focus of [renewed study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin_studies "Neo-Latin studies"), given their importance for the development of European culture, religion and science.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-22) The vast majority of written Latin belongs to this period, but its full extent is unknown.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-23)

The [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken and written language by the scholarship by the [Renaissance humanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism "Renaissance Humanism"). [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch") and others began to change their usage of Latin as they explored the texts of the Classical Latin world. Skills of textual criticism evolved to create much more accurate versions of extant texts through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and some important texts were rediscovered. Comprehensive versions of authors' works were published by [Isaac Casaubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Casaubon "Isaac Casaubon"), [Joseph Scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Scaliger "Joseph Scaliger") and others.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-24) Nevertheless, despite the careful work of Petrarch, [Politian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politian "Politian") and others, first the demand for manuscripts, and then the rush to bring works into print, led to the circulation of inaccurate copies for several centuries following.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-25)

Neo-Latin literature was extensive and prolific, but less well known or understood today. Works covered poetry, prose stories and early novels, occasional pieces and collections of letters, to name a few. Famous and well regarded writers included Petrarch, Erasmus, [Salutati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutati "Salutati"), [Celtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Celtes "Conrad Celtes"), [George Buchanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Buchanan "George Buchanan") and [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-26) Non fiction works were long produced in many subjects, including the sciences, law, philosophy, historiography and theology. Famous examples include [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s _[Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_. Latin was also used as a convenient medium for translations of important works first written in a vernacular, such as those of [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes").

Latin education underwent a process of reform to classicise written and spoken Latin. Schooling remained largely Latin medium until approximately 1700. Until the end of the 17th century, the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-27) Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French (a [Romance language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_language "Romance language")) and later native or other languages.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-28) Education methods gradually shifted towards written Latin, and eventually concentrating solely on reading skills. The decline of Latin education took several centuries and proceeded much more slowly than the decline in written Latin output.

Despite having no native speakers, Latin is still used for a variety of purposes in the contemporary world.

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Wallsend_platfom_2_02.jpg/250px-Wallsend_platfom_2_02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wallsend_platfom_2_02.jpg)

The signs at [Wallsend Metro station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallsend_Metro_station "Wallsend Metro station") are in English and Latin, as a tribute to [Wallsend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallsend "Wallsend")'s role as one of the outposts of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), as the eastern end of [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall "Hadrian's Wall") (hence the name) at [Segedunum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segedunum "Segedunum").

The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"). The Catholic Church required that Mass be carried out in Latin until the [Second Vatican Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council "Second Vatican Council") of 1962–1965, which permitted the use of the [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_language "Vernacular language"). Latin remains the language of the [Roman Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rite "Roman Rite"). The [Tridentine Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridentine_Mass "Tridentine Mass") (also known as the Extraordinary Form or Traditional Latin Mass) is celebrated in Latin. Although the [Mass of Paul VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_of_Paul_VI "Mass of Paul VI") (also known as the Ordinary Form or the Novus Ordo) is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See"), the primary language of its [public journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_journal "Public journal"), the _[Acta Apostolicae Sedis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acta\_Apostolicae\_Sedis "Acta Apostolicae Sedis")_, and the working language of the [Roman Rota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rota "Roman Rota"). [Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City") is also home to the world's only [automatic teller machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_teller_machine "Automatic teller machine") that gives instructions in Latin.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-29) In the [pontifical universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_university "Pontifical university") postgraduate courses of [Canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law "Canon law") are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language.

There are a small number of Latin services held in the Anglican church. These include an annual service in Oxford, delivered with a Latin sermon; a relic from the period when Latin was the normal spoken language of the university.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-30)

The polyglot [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") has adopted Latin names in the logos of some of its institutions for the sake of linguistic compromise, an "ecumenical nationalism" common to most of the continent and as a sign of the continent's heritage (such as the [EU Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union "Council of the European Union"): _Consilium_).

#### Use of Latin for mottos

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Latin&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Use of Latin for mottos")]

In the Western world, many organizations, governments and schools use Latin for their mottos due to its association with formality, tradition, and the roots of [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-31)

Canada's motto _[A mari usque ad mare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_mari\_usque\_ad\_mare "A mari usque ad mare")_ ("from sea to sea") and most [provincial mottos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_provincial_and_territorial_symbols "List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols") are also in Latin. The [Canadian Victoria Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross_(Canada) "Victoria Cross (Canada)") is modelled after the British [Victoria Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross "Victoria Cross") which has the inscription "For Valour". Because Canada is officially bilingual, the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin _Pro Valore_.

Spain's motto _[Plus ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus\_ultra "Plus ultra")_ 'even further', or figuratively "Further!", is also Latin in origin.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-32) It is taken from the personal motto of [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor"), Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase _Non terrae plus ultra_ ("No land further beyond", "No further!"). According to legend, this phrase was inscribed as a warning on the [Pillars of Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules "Pillars of Hercules"), the rocks on both sides of the [Strait of Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar "Strait of Gibraltar") and the western end of the known, Mediterranean world. Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence.

In the United States the unofficial national motto until 1956 was _[E pluribus unum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E\_pluribus\_unum "E pluribus unum")_ meaning "Out of many, one". The motto continues to be featured on the [Great Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States "Great Seal of the United States"). It also appears on the flags and seals of both houses of congress and the flags of the states of Michigan, North Dakota, New York, and Wisconsin. The motto's 13 letters symbolically represent the original Thirteen Colonies which revolted from the British Crown. The motto is featured on all presently minted coinage and has been featured in most coinage throughout the nation's history.

Several states of the United States [have Latin mottos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_mottos "List of U.S. state and territory mottos"), such as:

*   [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona")'s _Ditat deus_ ("God enriches");
*   [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut "Connecticut")'s _Qui transtulit sustinet_ ("He who transplanted sustains");
*   [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas "Kansas")'s _[Ad astra per aspera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per\_aspera\_ad\_astra "Per aspera ad astra")_ ("Through hardships, to the stars");
*   [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado")'s _Nil sine numine_ ("Nothing without providence");
*   [Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho "Idaho")'s _[Esto perpetua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esto\_perpetua "Esto perpetua")_ ("Let it be perpetual");
*   [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan "Michigan")'s _Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice_ ("If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you"), is based on that of Sir [Christopher Wren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren "Christopher Wren"), in [St. Paul's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Cathedral "St. Paul's Cathedral");
*   [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri "Missouri")'s _[Salus populi suprema lex esto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus\_populi\_suprema\_lex\_esto "Salus populi suprema lex esto")_ ("The health of the people should be the highest law");
*   [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)")'s _[Excelsior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat\_of\_arms\_of\_New\_York "Coat of arms of New York")_ ("Ever upward");
*   [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina")'s _[Esse Quam Videri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esse\_Quam\_Videri "Esse Quam Videri")_ ("To be rather than to seem");
*   [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina "South Carolina")'s _[Dum spiro spero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum\_spiro\_spero "Dum spiro spero")_ ("While I breathe, I hope");
*   [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia")'s _[Sic semper tyrannis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic\_semper\_tyrannis "Sic semper tyrannis")_ ("Thus always to [tyrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant "Tyrant")"); and
*   [West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia "West Virginia")'s _[Montani Semper Liberi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montani\_Semper\_Liberi "Montani Semper Liberi")_ ("Mountaineers [are] always free").

Many military organizations today have Latin mottos, such as:

*   _[Semper Paratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semper\_Paratus "Semper Paratus")_ ("always ready"), the motto of the [United States Coast Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard "United States Coast Guard");
*   _[Semper Fidelis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semper\_Fidelis "Semper Fidelis")_ ("always faithful"), the motto of the [United States Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps");
*   [_Semper Supra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semper_supra "Semper supra") ("always above"), the motto of the [United States Space Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force "United States Space Force");
*   _[Per ardua ad astra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per\_ardua\_ad\_astra "Per ardua ad astra")_ ("Through adversity/struggle to the stars"), the motto of the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") (RAF); and
*   _Vigilamus pro te_ ("We stand on guard for thee"), the motto of the [Canadian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Armed_Forces "Canadian Armed Forces").

Some law governing bodies in the Philippines have Latin mottos, such as:

*   _Justitiae Pax Opus_ ("The work of Justice is Peace"), the motto of the [Department of Justice (Philippines)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Justice_(Philippines) "Department of Justice (Philippines)");

Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University")'s motto is _[Veritas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas "Veritas")_ ("truth"). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue.

Switzerland has adopted the country's Latin short name _[Helvetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetia "Helvetia")_ on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's [four official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland "Languages of Switzerland"). For a similar reason, it adopted the international vehicle and internet code _CH_, which stands for _Confoederatio Helvetica_, the country's full Latin name.

Some film and television in ancient settings, such as _[Sebastiane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiane "Sebastiane")_, _[The Passion of the Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Passion\_of\_the\_Christ "The Passion of the Christ")_ and _[Barbarians (2020 TV series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarians\_(2020\_TV\_series) "Barbarians (2020 TV series)")_, have been made with dialogue in Latin. Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/television series as _[The Exorcist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Exorcist\_(film) "The Exorcist (film)")_ and _[Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost\_(2004\_TV\_series) "Lost (2004 TV series)")_ ("[Jughead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughead_(Lost) "Jughead (Lost)")"). Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin. There are also [songs written with Latin lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_with_Latin_lyrics "List of songs with Latin lyrics"). The libretto for the opera-oratorio _[Oedipus rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus\_rex\_(opera) "Oedipus rex (opera)")_ by [Igor Stravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky "Igor Stravinsky") is in Latin.

The continued instruction of Latin is seen by some as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education. Latin is taught at many high schools, especially in Europe and the Americas. It is most common in British [public schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom) "Public school (United Kingdom)") and grammar schools, the Italian _[liceo classico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liceo\_classico "Liceo classico")_ and _[liceo scientifico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liceo\_scientifico "Liceo scientifico")_, the German _Humanistisches [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium\_(Germany) "Gymnasium (Germany)")_ and the Dutch _[gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium\_(school) "Gymnasium (school)")_.

QDP Ep 84 – De Ludo "Mysterium": A Latin-language podcast

Occasionally, some media outlets, targeting enthusiasts, broadcast in Latin. Notable examples include [Radio Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Bremen "Radio Bremen") in Germany, [YLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YLE "YLE") radio in Finland (the [Nuntii Latini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuntii_Latini "Nuntii Latini") broadcast from 1989 until it was shut down in June 2019),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-RTE2019-06-24a-33) and Vatican Radio & Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-34)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-35)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-36)

A variety of organisations, as well as informal Latin _circuli_ 'circles', have been founded in more recent times to support the use of spoken Latin.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-37) Moreover, a number of university classics departments have begun incorporating communicative pedagogies in their Latin courses. These include the University of Kentucky, the University of Oxford and also Princeton University.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-38)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-39)

There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts. The [Latin Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Wikipedia "Latin Wikipedia") has more than 140,000 articles.

[Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language"), [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language"), [Romansh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language "Romansh language"), [Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language "Sardinian language") and other [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") are direct descendants of Latin. There are also many Latin [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword") in English and [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language "Albanian language"),[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Sawicka-40) as well as a few in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"), [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"), [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language") and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-41) Latin is still spoken in Vatican City, a city-state situated in Rome that is the seat of the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church").

[Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar")'s _[Commentarii de Bello Gallico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii\_de\_Bello\_Gallico "Commentarii de Bello Gallico")_ is one of the most famous classical Latin texts of the Golden Age of Latin. The unvarnished, journalistic style of this [patrician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_(ancient_Rome) "Patrician (ancient Rome)") general has long been taught as a model of the urbane Latin officially spoken and written in the [floruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floruit "Floruit") of the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic").

The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology"). They are in part the subject matter of the field of [classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics"). Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the [Loeb Classical Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loeb_Classical_Library "Loeb Classical Library"), published by [Harvard University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_Press "Harvard University Press"), or the [Oxford Classical Texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Classical_Texts "Oxford Classical Texts"), published by [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as [Meissner's Latin Phrasebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner%27s_Latin_Phrasebook "Meissner's Latin Phrasebook").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the _[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus\_Inscriptionum\_Latinarum "Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum")_ (CIL). Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance "Provenance") and relevant information. The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of [epigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraphy "Epigraphy"). About 270,000 inscriptions are known.

### Influence on present-day languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Latin&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Influence on present-day languages")]

The [Latin influence in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_influence_in_English "Latin influence in English") has been significant at all stages of its insular development. In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint [Augustine of Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury "Augustine of Canterbury") in the 6th century or indirectly after the [Norman Conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest "Norman Conquest"), through the [Anglo-Norman language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language "Anglo-Norman language"). From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed "[inkhorn terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkhorn_term "Inkhorn term")", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink. Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten, but some useful ones survived, such as _imbibe_ and _extrapolate_. Many of the most common [polysyllabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysyllabic "Polysyllabic") English words are of Latin origin through the medium of [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French"). Romance words make respectively 59%, 20% and 14% of English, German and Dutch vocabularies.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-42)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-43)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Walter-44) Those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included.

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Romance_20c_en_%28cropped%29.png/250px-Romance_20c_en_%28cropped%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Romance_20c_en_(cropped).png)

Range of the Romance languages, the modern descendants of Latin, in Europe

The influence of Roman governance and [Roman technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_technology "Roman technology") on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, [the Linnaean system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy "Linnaean taxonomy") of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by _[Historia Naturalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_History\_(Pliny) "Natural History (Pliny)")_, an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder"). Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen"), established that today's [medical terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_terminology "Medical terminology") would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on [scientific terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_terminology "Scientific terminology") as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long [list of Latin legal terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_legal_terms "List of Latin legal terms").

The [Logudorese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logudorese "Logudorese") dialect of the [Sardinian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language "Sardinian language") and [Standard Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") are the two closest contemporary languages to Latin.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-45)

Throughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles. This also was true in the United States where many of the nation's founders obtained a classically based education in grammar schools or from tutors.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-46) Admission to Harvard in the Colonial era required that the applicant "Can readily make and speak or write true Latin prose and has skill in making verse"[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-47) Latin Study and the classics were emphasized in American secondary schools and colleges well into the Antebellum era.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-48)

[Instruction in Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_in_Latin "Instruction in Latin") is an essential aspect. In today's world, a large number of Latin students in the United States learn from _Wheelock's Latin: The Classic Introductory Latin Course, Based on Ancient Authors_. This book, first published in 1956,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-49) was written by [Frederic M. Wheelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_M._Wheelock "Frederic M. Wheelock"). _Wheelock's Latin_ has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses.

The numbers of people studying Latin varies significantly by country. In the United Kingdom, Latin is available in around 2.3% of state primary schools, representing a significant increase in availability.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-50) In Germany, over 500,000 students study Latin each year, representing a decrease from over 800,000 in 2008. Latin is still required for some University courses, but this has become less frequent.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-51)

The [Living Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Latin "Living Latin") movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available in Vatican City and at some institutions in the US, such as the [University of Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky "University of Kentucky") and [Iowa State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University "Iowa State University"). The British [Cambridge University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press "Cambridge University Press") is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the [Cambridge Latin Course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Latin_Course "Cambridge Latin Course") series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called [Minimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimus "Minimus").

In the United Kingdom, the [Classical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Association "Classical Association") encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants. The [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"),[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-52) the [Open University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University "Open University"),[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-53) a number of independent schools, for example [Eton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College "Eton College"), [Harrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School "Harrow School"), [Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haberdashers%27_Aske%27s_Boys%27_School "Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School"), [Merchant Taylors' School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Taylors%27_School,_Northwood "Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood"), and [Rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_School "Rugby School"), and The Latin Programme/Via Facilis,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-54) a London-based charity, run Latin courses. In the United States and in Canada, the [American Classical League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Classical_League "American Classical League") supports every effort to further the study of classics. Its subsidiaries include the [National Junior Classical League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Junior_Classical_League "National Junior Classical League") (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the [National Senior Classical League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Senior_Classical_League "National Senior Classical League"), which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college. The league also sponsors the [National Latin Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Latin_Exam "National Latin Exam"). Classicist [Mary Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Beard_(classicist) "Mary Beard (classicist)") wrote in _[The Times Literary Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times\_Literary\_Supplement "The Times Literary Supplement")_ in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-timesonline_train_the_brain-55)

Latin was or is the official language of several European states. It had official status in the [Kingdom of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary "Kingdom of Hungary") from the 11th to mid-19th centuries, when [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language") became the exclusive official language in 1844.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-56) The best known Latin language poet of Hungarian origin was [Janus Pannonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Pannonius "Janus Pannonius").

An extensive [Croatian Latin literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Latin_literature "Croatian Latin literature") exists. Latin was used on Croatian coins on even years until 1 January 2023, when Croatia adopted the Euro as its official currency.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-58)

In the [Kingdom of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland "Kingdom of Poland") Latin was officially recognised and widely used[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-60)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-61)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Friedrich-62) between the 10th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szlachta "Szlachta").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Friedrich-62)

The ancient pronunciation of Latin has been reconstructed; among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors, misspellings, puns, ancient etymologies, the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages, and the historical development of Romance languages.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-63)

The consonant [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme") of Classical Latin are as follows:[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-64)

/z/ was not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting c. the 1st century BC, when it was probably pronounced (at least by educated speakers) [z] initially and [doubled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination")[zz] between vowels, in accordance with its pronunciation in [Koine Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek "Koine Greek"). In Classical Latin poetry, the letter ⟨z⟩ between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-65)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Allen_Z-66) The consonant ⟨b⟩ usually sounds as [b]; however, when ⟨t⟩ or ⟨s⟩ follows ⟨b⟩ then it is pronounced as in [pt] or [ps]. In Latin, ⟨q⟩ is always followed by the [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") ⟨u⟩. Together they make a [kʷ] sound.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

In Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between [uppercase and lowercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case "Letter case"), and the letters ⟨J U W⟩ did not exist. In place of ⟨J U⟩, ⟨I V⟩ were used, respectively; ⟨I V⟩ represented both vowels and consonants. Most of the letter forms were similar to modern uppercase, as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article.

The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts, however, normally use ⟨j u⟩ in place of Classical-era ⟨i v⟩. Some systems use ⟨j v⟩ for the consonant sounds /j w/ except in the combinations ⟨gu su qu⟩ for which ⟨v⟩ is never used.

Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below:

In Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination") consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants. Thus the _nn_ in Classical Latin _annus_ 'year' (and in Italian _anno_) is pronounced as a doubled /nn/ as in English _unnamed_. (In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or [morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme"), as in that example.)

Simple vowels[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-70)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-71)|  | Front | Central | Back |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

In Classical Latin, ⟨U⟩ did not exist as a letter distinct from ⟨V⟩; the written form ⟨V⟩ was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. ⟨Y⟩ was adopted to represent [upsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon "Upsilon") in loanwords from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), but it was pronounced like ⟨u⟩ and ⟨i⟩ by some speakers. It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning, such as _sylva_ and ὕλη _hū́lē_.

Classical Latin distinguished between [long and short vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length"). Then, long vowels, except for ⟨i⟩, were frequently marked using the [apex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(diacritic) "Apex (diacritic)"), which was sometimes similar to an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent")⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩. Long /iː/ was written using a taller version of ⟨I⟩, called _i longa_ '[long _I_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_I "Long I")': ⟨ꟾ⟩. In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a [macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)")⟨ā ē ī ō ū⟩, and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a [breve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve "Breve")⟨ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ⟩. However, they would also signify a long vowel by writing the vowel larger than other letters in a word or by repeating the vowel twice in a row.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67) The acute accent, when it is used in modern Latin texts, indicates stress, as in Spanish, rather than length.

Although called long vowels, their exact quality in Classical Latin is different from short vowels. The difference is described in the table below:

This difference in quality is posited by [W. Sidney Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Sidney_Allen "W. Sidney Allen") in his book _Vox Latina_. However, [Andrea Calabrese](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrea_Calabrese&action=edit&redlink=1 "Andrea Calabrese (page does not exist)") has disputed this assertion, based in part upon the observation that in Sardinian and some Lucanian dialects, each long and short vowel pair merged, as opposed to in Italo-Western languages in which short /i/ and /u/ merged with long /eː/ and /o:/ (cf. Latin _siccus_, Italian _secco_, and Sardinian _siccu_).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-72)

A vowel letter followed by ⟨m⟩ at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by ⟨n⟩ before ⟨s⟩ or ⟨f⟩, represented a short [nasal vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_vowel "Nasal vowel"), as in _monstrum_[mõːstrũ].

Classical Latin had several [diphthongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong"). The two most common were ⟨ae au⟩. The former is pronounced like the _i_ in _mine_, and the latter like the _ow_ in _power_. ⟨oe⟩ was fairly rare, and ⟨ui eu ei⟩ were very rare, at least in native Latin words.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-classical_diphthongs-73) There has also been debate over whether ⟨ui⟩ is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin, due to its rarity, absence in works of Roman grammarians, and the roots of Classical Latin words (e.g. _hui ce_ to _huic_, _quoi_ to _cui_) not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if ⟨ui⟩ were to be considered a diphthong.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-74)

The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs. ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in _aēnus_[aˈeː.nʊs] 'bronze' and _coēpit_[kɔˈeː.pɪt] 'began', and ⟨au ui eu ei ou⟩ represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels /j w/, in _cavē_[ˈka.weː] 'beware!', _cuius_[ˈkʊj.jʊs] 'whose', _monuī_[ˈmɔn.ʊ.iː] 'I warned', _solvī_[ˈsɔɫ.wiː] 'I released', _dēlēvī_[deːˈleː.wiː] 'I destroyed', _eius_[ˈɛj.jʊs] 'his', and _novus_[ˈnɔ.wʊs] 'new'.

Old Latin had more diphthongs, but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin. The Old Latin diphthong ⟨ai⟩ and the sequence ⟨āī⟩ became Classical ⟨ae⟩. Old Latin ⟨oi⟩ and ⟨ou⟩ changed to Classical ⟨ū⟩, except in a few words whose ⟨oi⟩ became Classical ⟨oe⟩. These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root: for instance, Classical _poena_ "punishment" and _pūnīre_ "to punish".[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-classical_diphthongs-73) Early Old Latin ⟨ei⟩ usually monophthongized to a later Old Latin ⟨ē⟩, to Classical ⟨ī⟩.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-75)

By the late Roman Empire, ⟨ae oe⟩ had merged with ⟨e ē⟩. During the Classical period this sound change was present in some rural dialects, but deliberately avoided by well-educated speakers.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-classical_diphthongs-73)

Diphthongs classified by beginning sound |  | Front | Back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Close |  | ui /ui̯/ |
| Mid | ei /ei̯/ eu /eu̯/ | oe /oe̯/ ou /ou̯/ |
| Open | ae /ae̯/ au /au̯/ |

[Syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable "Syllable") in Latin are signified by the presence of diphthongs and [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"). The number of syllables is the same as the number of vowel sounds.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

Further, if a consonant separates two vowels, it will go into the syllable of the second vowel. When there are two consonants between vowels, the last consonant will go with the second vowel. An exception occurs when a [phonetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription "Phonetic transcription") stop and liquid come together. In this situation, they are thought to be a single consonant, and as such, they will go into the syllable of the second vowel.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

Syllables in Latin are considered either [long or short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_weight#Basic_definitions "Syllable weight") (less often called "heavy" and "light" respectively). Within a word, a syllable may either be long by nature or long by position.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67) A syllable is long by nature if it has a diphthong or a long vowel. On the other hand, a syllable is long by position if the vowel is followed by more than one consonant.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

There are two rules that define which syllable is [stressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics) "Stress (linguistics)") in Classical Latin.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

1.   In a word with only two syllables, the emphasis will be on the first syllable.
2.   In a word with more than two syllables, there are two cases. 
    *   If the second-to-last syllable is long, that syllable will have stress.
    *   If the second-to-last syllable is not long, the syllable before that one will be stressed instead.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_7th_ed.-67)

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Duenos_inscription.jpg/250px-Duenos_inscription.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Duenos_inscription.jpg)

The [Duenos Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duenos_Inscription "Duenos Inscription"), from the 6th century BC, is one of the earliest known [Old Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Latin "Old Latin") texts. It was found on the [Quirinal Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinal_Hill "Quirinal Hill") in Rome.

Latin was written in the Latin alphabet ([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A "A"), [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B "B"), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C "C"), [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D "D"), [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E "E"), [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F "F"), [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G "G"), [H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H "H"), [I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I "I"), [K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K "K"), [L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L "L"), [M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M "M"), [N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N "N"), [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O "O"), [P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P "P"), [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q "Q"), [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R "R"), [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S "S"), [T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T "T"), [V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V "V"), [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X "X")), derived from the [Etruscan alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_alphabet "Etruscan alphabet"), which was in turn drawn from the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet") and ultimately the [Phoenician alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet").[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-76) This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic and many Slavic languages ([Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language"), [Slovene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language"), [Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language "Croatian language"), [Bosnian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_language "Bosnian language"), [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_language "Serbian language") and [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language")); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"), the [Austronesian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages "Austronesian languages"), many [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages "Turkic languages"), and most languages in [sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa "Sub-Saharan Africa"), the Americas and Oceania, making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system.

The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-77) Later, _G_ was added to represent /ɡ/, which had previously been spelled _C_, and _Z_ ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no [voiced alveolar fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_fricative "Voiced alveolar fricative").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-D538-78) The letters K, _Y,_ and _Z_ were later added to represent Greek letters [kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa "Kappa"), [upsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon "Upsilon"), and [zeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta "Zeta") respectively, in Greek loanwords.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-D538-78)

_W_ was created in the 11th century from _VV_ in some areas and _UU_ in others. It represented /w/ in Germanic languages, not Latin, which still uses _V_ for the purpose. _J_ was distinguished from the original _I_ only during the late Middle Ages, as was the letter _U_ from _V_.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-D538-78) Although some Latin dictionaries use _J_, it is rarely used for Latin text, as it was not used in classical times, but many other languages use it.

Classical Latin did not contain sentence [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"), letter case,[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-79) or [interword spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interword_spacing "Interword spacing"), but [apices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(diacritic) "Apex (diacritic)") were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") was used at times to separate words.

The first line of [Catullus 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_3 "Catullus 3") ("Mourn, O [Venuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology) "Venus (mythology)") and [Cupids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid "Cupid")") was originally written as:

| simply | lv́géteóveneréscupidinésqve |
| --- |
| with [long I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_I "Long I") | lv́géteóveneréscupIdinésqve |
| with interpunct | lv́géte·ó·venerés·cupidinésqve |

It would be rendered in a modern edition as:

| simply | _Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque_ |
| --- |
| with macrons | _Lūgēte, ō Venerēs Cupīdinēsque_ |
| with apices | _Lúgéte, ó Venerés Cupídinésque_ |

A modern Latin text written in the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the [Vindolanda tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets "Vindolanda tablets"), the oldest surviving handwritten documents in Britain. The word _Romani_ 'Romans' is at bottom left.

The [Roman cursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive "Roman cursive") script is commonly found on the many [wax tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_tablet "Wax tablet") excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on [Hadrian's Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall "Hadrian's Wall") in Britain. Most notable is the fact that while most of the [Vindolanda tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets "Vindolanda tablets") show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era.

### Alternative scripts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Latin&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Alternative scripts")]

Occasionally, Latin has been written in other scripts:

*   The [Praeneste fibula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeneste_fibula "Praeneste fibula") is a 7th-century BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script.
*   The rear panel of the early 8th-century [Franks Casket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks_Casket "Franks Casket") has an inscription that switches from [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") in [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes "Anglo-Saxon runes") to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes.

Syntactical structure of the Latin sentence _Iohannes vidit illam puellam_, meaning 'John sees the girl'

Latin is a [synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language "Synthetic language"), [fusional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language "Fusional language") in the terminology of linguistic typology. Words involve an objective semantic element and markers (usually suffixes) specifying the grammatical use of the word, expressing [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender"), [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number"), and [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case "Grammatical case") in [adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective "Adjective"), [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun"), and [pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun "Pronoun") (_[declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension "Declension")_) and verbs to denote [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person"), [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number"), [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense "Grammatical tense"), [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_voice "Grammatical voice"), [mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood "Grammatical mood"), and [aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect "Grammatical aspect") (_[conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical\_conjugation "Grammatical conjugation")_). Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and [interjections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_interjections "Latin interjections").

Latin inflection can result in words with much ambiguity: For example, _amābit_ 'he/she/it will love', is formed from _amā-_, a future tense morpheme _-bi-_ and a third person singular morpheme, _-t_, the last of which _-t_ does not express masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. [Latin word order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_word_order "Latin word order") is relatively free because inflections disambiguate semantic connections, but different word orders can indicate different nuances of meaning.

A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions, a group of nouns with similar inflected forms. The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun.

*   The first declension, with a predominant ending letter of _a_, is signified by the genitive singular ending of _-ae_.
*   The second declension, with a predominant ending letter of _us_, is signified by the genitive singular ending of _-ī_.
*   The third declension, with a predominant ending letter of _i_, is signified by the genitive singular ending of _-is_.

There are seven Latin noun cases, which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections. Thus, [word order in Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_word_order "Latin word order") is not as important as it is in English, which is less inflected. The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary. The cases are as follows:

1.   [Nominative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") – used when the noun is the [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar) "Subject (grammar)") or a [predicate nominative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_nominative "Predicate nominative"). The thing or person acting: the girl ran: _puella cucurrit_, or _cucurrit puella_
2.   [Genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") – used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object: "the horse of the man", or "the man's horse"; in both instances, the word _man_ would be in the [genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") when it is translated into Latin. It also indicates the [partitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive "Partitive"), in which the material is quantified: "a group of people"; "a number of gifts": _people_ and _gifts_ would be in the genitive case. Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives: The cup is full of wine. (_Pōculum plēnum vīnī est._) The master of the slave had beaten him. (_Dominus servī eum verberāverat._)
3.   [Dative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") – used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence, with special verbs, with certain prepositions, and if it is used as agent, reference, or even possessor: The merchant hands the [stola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stola "Stola") to the woman. (_Mercātor fēminae stolam trādit._)
4.   [Accusative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") – used when the noun is the direct object of the subject, as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which, and sometimes to indicate a duration of time: The man killed the boy. (_Vir puerum necāvit._)
5.   [Ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case "Ablative case") – used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source, cause, [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(grammar) "Agent (grammar)") or [instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions, and to indicate a specific place in time.; adverbial: You walked with the boy. (_Cum puerō ambulāvistī._)
6.   [Vocative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case "Vocative case") – used when the noun is used in a direct address. The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative, with the exception of second-declension nouns ending in _-us_. The _-us_ becomes an _-e_ in the vocative singular. If it ends in _-ius_ (such as _fīlius_), the ending is just _-ī_ (_filī_), as distinct from the nominative plural (_filiī_) in the vocative singular: "Master!" shouted the slave. (_"Domine!" clāmāvit servus._)
7.   [Locative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case") – used to indicate a location (corresponding to the English _in_ or _at_. It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns, such as the words _domus_ 'house', _humus_ 'ground', and _rus_ 'country'. In the singular of the first and second declensions, its form coincides with the genitive (_Roma_ becomes _Romae_ 'in Rome'. In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions, it coincides with the ablative (_Athēnae_ becomes _Athēnīs_, 'at Athens'. In the fourth-declension word _domus_, the locative form, _domī_ 'at home' differs from the standard form of all other cases.

Latin lacks both definite and indefinite [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar) "Article (grammar)") so _puer currit_ can mean either 'the boy is running' or 'a boy is running'.

There are two types of regular Latin adjectives: first- and second-declension and third-declension. They are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first- and second-declension and third-declension nouns, respectively. Latin adjectives also have [comparative and superlative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_and_superlative "Comparative and superlative") forms. There are also a number of Latin [participles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participles "Participles").

Latin numbers are sometimes declined as adjectives; see [§Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#Numbers).

_First- and second-declension adjectives_ are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms. For example, for _mortuus, mortua, mortuum_ 'dead', _mortua_ is declined like a regular first-declension noun (such as _puella_ 'girl', _mortuus_ is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as _dominus_ 'lord, master', and _mortuum_ is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as _auxilium_ 'help'.

_Third-declension adjectives_ are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns, with a few exceptions. In the plural nominative neuter, for example, the ending is _-ia_ (_omnia_ 'all, everything', and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative neuter ending is _-a_ or _-ia_ (_capita_ 'heads', _animalia_ 'animals'. They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular.

Latin participles, like English participles, are formed from a verb. There are a few main types of participles: Present Active Participles, Perfect Passive Participles, Future Active Participles, and Future Passive Participles.

Latin sometimes uses prepositions, depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used. Most prepositions are followed by a noun in either the accusative or ablative case: _apud puerum_ 'with the boy', with _puerum_ being the accusative form of _puer_ 'boy', and _sine puero_ 'without the boy'– _puero_ being the ablative form. A few [adpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adposition "Adposition"), however, govern a noun in the genitive, such as _gratia_ and _tenus_.

A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main [conjugations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_conjugation "Latin conjugation"). A conjugation is "a class of verbs with similar inflected forms".[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-80) The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb's present stem. The present stem can be found by omitting the -_re_ (-_rī_ in deponent verbs) ending from the present infinitive form. The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in _-ā-re_ or _-ā-ri_ (active and passive respectively): _amāre_ 'to love', _hortārī_ 'to exhort'; of the second conjugation by _-ē-re_ or _-ē-rī_: _monēre_ 'to warn', _verērī_ 'to fear', of the third conjugation by _-ere_, _-ī_: _dūcere_ 'to lead', _ūtī_ 'to use'; of the fourth by _-ī-re_, _-ī-rī_: _audīre_ 'to hear', _experīrī_ 'to attempt'.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_2011-81) The stem categories descend from [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language") and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages.

[Irregular verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_and_irregular_verbs "Regular and irregular verbs") are verbs that do not follow the regular conjugations in the formation of the inflected form. Irregular verbs in Latin are _esse_ 'to be'; _velle_ 'to want'; _ferre_ 'to carry'; _edere_ 'to eat'; _dare_ 'to give 'ire 'to go'; _posse_ 'to be able'; _fieri_ 'to happen'; and their compounds.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-Wheelock_2011-81)

There are six simple [tenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense "Grammatical tense") in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three [moods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood "Grammatical mood") (indicative, imperative and subjunctive, in addition to the [infinitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitive "Infinitive"), [participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle "Participle"), [gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund "Gerund"), [gerundive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerundive "Gerundive") and [supine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine "Supine")), three [persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person") (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two [voices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_voice "Grammatical voice") (active and passive) and two [aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect "Grammatical aspect") ([perfective and imperfective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfective_and_imperfective "Perfective and imperfective")). Verbs are described by four principal parts:

1.   The first principal part is the first-person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative mood form of the verb. If the verb is impersonal, the first principal part will be in the third-person singular.
2.   The second principal part is the present active infinitive.
3.   The third principal part is the first-person singular, perfect active indicative form. Like the first principal part, if the verb is impersonal, the third principal part will be in the third-person singular.
4.   The fourth principal part is the supine form, or alternatively, the nominative singular of the perfect passive participle form of the verb. The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders (-_us_ for masculine, -_a_ for feminine and -_um_ for neuter) in the nominative singular. The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive. Most modern Latin dictionaries, if they show only one gender, tend to show the masculine; but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter, as it coincides with the supine. The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs, but strictly in Latin, they can be made passive if they are used impersonally, and the supine exists for such verbs.

The six simple [tenses of Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_tenses_(semantics) "Latin tenses (semantics)") are divided into two systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future forms, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect forms. Each simple tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person, number, and voice of the subject. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (_I, we_) and second (_you_) persons except for emphasis.

The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses. For the future tense, the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations, and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations:

| Tense | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | 2nd Person | 3rd Person | 1st Person | 2nd Person | 3rd Person |
| Present | -ō/m | -s | -t | -mus | -tis | -nt |
| Future | -bō, -am | -bis, -ēs | -bit, -et | -bimus, -ēmus | -bitis, -ētis | -bunt, -ent |
| Imperfect | -bam | -bās | -bat | -bāmus | -bātis | -bant |
| Perfect | -ī | -istī | -it | -imus | -istis | -ērunt |
| Future Perfect | -erō | -eris/erīs | -erit | -erimus/-erīmus | -eritis/-erītis | -erint |
| Pluperfect | -eram | -erās | -erat | -erāmus | -erātis | -erant |

Some Latin verbs are [deponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deponent_verb "Deponent verb"), causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: _hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum_ 'to urge'.

As Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral [Proto-Indo-European language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language"). However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language "Etruscan language") words into their language, including _persona_ 'mask' and _histrio_ 'actor'.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-H&S13-82) Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from [Oscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscan_language "Oscan language"), another Italic language.

After the [Fall of Tarentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Taranto "History of Taranto") in 272 BC, the Romans began Hellenising, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as _camera_ 'vaulted roof', _sumbolum_ 'symbol', and _balineum_ 'bath'.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-H&S13-82) This Hellenisation led to the addition of _Y_ and _Z_ to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-83) Subsequently, the Romans transplanted [Greek art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_art "Greek art"), medicine, science and philosophy to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece. Thus, many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words, as _ars_ 'craft' and _tekhne_ 'art'.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-H&S14-84)

Because of the Roman Empire's expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes, the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words, such as _beber_ 'beaver', of Germanic origin, and _bracae_ 'breeches', of Celtic origin.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-H&S14-84) The specific dialects of Latin across Latin-speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions. The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages.

During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-85) Into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") and other [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages").

Over the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by [affixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") or [compounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics) "Compound (linguistics)") meaningful [segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_(linguistics) "Segment (linguistics)").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-86) For example, the compound adjective, _omnipotens_ 'all-powerful', was produced from the adjectives _omnis_ 'all', and _potens_ 'powerful', by dropping the final _s_ of _omnis_ and concatenating. Often, the concatenation changed the part of speech, and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin#cite_note-87)

In ancient times, numbers in Latin were written only with letters. Today, the numbers can be written with the [Arabic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals") as well as with [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals "Roman numerals"). The numbers 1, 2 and 3 and every whole hundred from 200 to 900 are declined as nouns and adjectives, with some differences.

_ūnus, ūna, ūnum_ (masculine, feminine, neuter)I one
_duo, duae, duo_ (m., f., n.)II two
_trēs, tria_ (m./f., n.)III three
_quattuor_ IIII or IV four
_quīnque_ V five
_sex_ VI six
_septem_ VII seven
_octō_ IIX or VIII eight
_novem_ VIIII or IX nine
_decem_ X ten
_quīnquāgintā_ L fifty
_centum_ C one hundred
_quīngentī, quīngentae, quīngenta_ (m., f., n.)D five hundred
_mīlle_ M one thousand

The numbers from 4 to 100 do not change their endings. As in modern descendants such as Spanish, the gender for naming a number in isolation is masculine, so that "1, 2, 3" is counted as _ūnus, duo, trēs_.

_[Commentarii de Bello Gallico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii\_de\_Bello\_Gallico "Commentarii de Bello Gallico")_, also called _De Bello Gallico_ (_The Gallic War_), written by [Gaius Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar"), begins with the following passage:

> Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Hi omnes lingua, institutis, legibus inter se differunt. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae, propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important, proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt. Eorum una pars, quam Gallos obtinere dictum est, initium capit a flumine Rhodano, continetur Garumna flumine, Oceano, finibus Belgarum; attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum; vergit ad septentriones. Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur; pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni; spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem. Aquitania a Garumna flumine ad Pyrenaeos montes et eam partem Oceani quae est ad Hispaniam pertinet; spectat inter occasum solis et septentriones.

The same text may be marked for all long vowels (before any possible elisions at word boundary) with [apices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(diacritic) "Apex (diacritic)") over vowel letters, including customarily before _nf_ and _ns_ where a long vowel is automatically produced:

> Gallia est omnis dívísa in partés trés, quárum únam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquítání, tertiam quí ipsórum linguá Celtae, nostrá Gallí appellantur. Hí omnés linguá, ínstitútís, légibus inter sé differunt. Gallós ab Aquítánís Garumna flúmen, á Belgís Mátrona et Séquana dívidit. Hórum omnium fortissimí sunt Belgae, proptereá quod á cultú atque húmánitáte próvinciae longissimé absunt, miniméque ad eós mercátórés saepe commeant atque ea quae ad efféminandós animós pertinent important, proximíque sunt Germánís, quí tráns Rhénum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Quá dé causá Helvétií quoque reliquós Gallós virtúte praecédunt, quod feré cotídiánís proeliís cum Germánís contendunt, cum aut suís fínibus eós prohibent aut ipsí in eórum fínibus bellum gerunt. Eórum úna pars, quam Gallós obtinére dictum est, initium capit á flúmine Rhodanó, continétur Garumná flúmine, Óceanó, fínibus Belgárum; attingit etiam ab Séquanís et Helvétiís flúmen Rhénum; vergit ad septentriónés. Belgae ab extrémís Galliae fínibus oriuntur; pertinent ad ínferiórem partem flúminis Rhéní; spectant in septentriónem et orientem sólem. Aquítánia á Garumná flúmine ad Pýrénaeós montés et eam partem Óceaní quae est ad Hispániam pertinet; spectat inter occásum sólis et septentriónés.

An example of Late Latin is the Latin Vulgate by Saint Jerome. Below is Psalm One (Psalmum Unum) from the Clementine Vulgate.

> 1 Beatus vir qui non abiit in consilio impiorum, et in via peccatorum non stetit, et in cathedra pestilentiae non sedit; 2 sed in lege Domini voluntas ejus, et in lege ejus meditabitur die ac nocte. 3 Et erit tamquam lignum quod plantatum est secus decursus aquarum, quod fructum suum dabit in tempore suo: et folium ejus non defluet; et omnia quaecumque faciet prosperabuntur. 4 Non sic impii, non sic; sed tamquam pulvis quem projicit ventus a facie terrae. 5 Ideo non resurgent impii in judicio, neque peccatores in concilio justorum,
