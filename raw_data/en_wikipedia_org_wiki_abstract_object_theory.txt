Abstract object theory ( AOT ) is a branch of metaphysics regarding abstract objects .

[ 1 ] Originally devised by metaphysician Edward Zalta in 1981, [ 2 ] the theory was an expansion of mathematical Platonism .

Overview [ edit ] See also: Dual copula strategy Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics (1983) is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.

AOT is a dual predication approach (also known as "dual copula strategy") to abstract objects [ 3 ] influenced by the contributions of Alexius Meinong [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and his student Ernst Mally .

[ 6 ] [ 5 ] On Zalta's account, there are two modes of predication : some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) exemplify properties, while others (abstract objects like numbers, and what others would call " nonexistent objects ", like the round square and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely encode them.

[ 7 ] While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties.

[ 8 ] For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others.

[ 9 ] This allows for a formalized ontology .

A notable feature of AOT is that several notable paradoxes in naive predication theory (namely Romane Clark 's paradox undermining the earliest version of Héctor-Neri Castañeda 's guise theory , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Alan McMichael's paradox, [ 13 ] and Daniel Kirchner's paradox) [ 14 ] do not arise within it.

[ 15 ] AOT employs restricted abstraction schemata to avoid such paradoxes.

[ 16 ] In 2007, Zalta and Branden Fitelson introduced the term computational metaphysics to describe the implementation and investigation of formal, axiomatic metaphysics in an automated reasoning environment.
