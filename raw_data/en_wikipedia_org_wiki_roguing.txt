Rogues are removed from the fields to preserve the quality of the crop being grown. Plants being removed may be diseased, of an unwanted variety, or undesirable for other reasons.

[ 1 ] For example, to ensure that the crop retains its integrity in terms of certain physical attributes, such as color and shape, individual plants that exhibit differing traits may be removed.

[ 2 ] Roguing is particularly important when growing seed crops, to prevent plants with undesirable characteristics from propagating into subsequent generations.
