[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Aesthetics of science is the study of beauty and matters of taste within the scientific endeavour . Aesthetic features like simplicity, elegance and symmetry are sources of wonder and awe for many scientists, thus motivating scientific pursuit.

[ 3 ] Conversely, theories that have been empirically successful may be judged to lack aesthetic merit, which contributes to the desire to find a new theory that subsumes the old.

[ 4 ] The topic has been addressed by several publications discussing how aesthetic values are related to scientific experiments and theories.
