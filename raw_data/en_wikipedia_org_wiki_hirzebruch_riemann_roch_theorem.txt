The result paved the way for the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem proved about three years later.

Statement of Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem [ edit ] The  Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem applies to any holomorphic vector bundle E on a compact complex manifold X , to calculate the holomorphic Euler characteristic of E in sheaf cohomology , namely the alternating sum χ χ ( X , E ) = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n ( − − 1 ) i dim C ⁡ ⁡ H i ( X , E ) {\displaystyle \chi (X,E)=\sum _{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i}\dim _{\mathbb {C} }H^{i}(X,E)} of the dimensions as complex vector spaces, where n is the complex dimension of X .

Hirzebruch's theorem states that χ( X , E ) is computable in terms of the Chern classes c k ( E ) of E , and the Todd classes td j ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {td} _{j}(X)} of the holomorphic tangent bundle of X . These all lie in the cohomology ring of X ; by use of the fundamental class (or, in other words, integration over X ) we can obtain numbers from classes in H 2 n ( X ) .

{\displaystyle H^{2n}(X).} The Hirzebruch formula asserts that χ χ ( X , E ) = ∑ ∑ j = 0 n ch n − − j ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) td j ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) , {\displaystyle \chi (X,E)=\sum _{j=0}^{n}\operatorname {ch} _{n-j}(E)\operatorname {td} _{j}(X),} using the Chern character ch( E ) in cohomology. In other words, the  products are formed in the cohomology ring of all the 'matching' degrees that add up to 2 n . Formulated differently, it gives the equality χ χ ( X , E ) = ∫ ∫ X ch ⁡ ⁡ ( E ) td ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \chi (X,E)=\int _{X}\operatorname {ch} (E)\operatorname {td} (X)} where td ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {td} (X)} is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of X .

Significant special cases are when E is a complex line bundle , and when X is an algebraic surface ( Noether's formula ). Weil's Riemann–Roch theorem for vector bundles on curves, and the Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic surfaces (see below), are included in its scope. The formula also expresses in a precise way the vague notion that the Todd classes are in some sense reciprocals of the Chern Character .

Riemann Roch theorem for curves [ edit ] For curves, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the classical Riemann–Roch theorem . To see this, recall that for each divisor D on a curve there is an invertible sheaf O( D ) (which corresponds to a line bundle) such that the linear system of D is more or less the space of sections of O( D ). For curves the Todd class is 1 + c 1 ( T ( X ) ) / 2 , {\displaystyle 1+c_{1}(T(X))/2,} and the Chern character of a sheaf O( D ) is just 1+ c 1 (O( D )), so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that h 0 ( O ( D ) ) − − h 1 ( O ( D ) ) = c 1 ( O ( D ) ) + c 1 ( T ( X ) ) / 2 {\displaystyle h^{0}({\mathcal {O}}(D))-h^{1}({\mathcal {O}}(D))=c_{1}({\mathcal {O}}(D))+c_{1}(T(X))/2\ \ \ } (integrated over X ).

But h 0 (O( D )) is just l ( D ), the dimension of the linear system of D , and by Serre duality h 1 (O( D )) = h 0 (O( K − D )) = l ( K − D ) where K is the canonical divisor . Moreover, c 1 (O( D )) integrated over X is the degree of D , and c 1 ( T ( X )) integrated over X is the Euler class 2 − 2 g of the curve X , where g is the genus. So we get the classical Riemann Roch theorem ℓ ℓ ( D ) − − ℓ ℓ ( K − − D ) = deg ( D ) + 1 − − g .

{\displaystyle \ell (D)-\ell (K-D)={\text{deg}}(D)+1-g.} For vector bundles V , the Chern character is rank( V ) + c 1 ( V ), so we get Weil's Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles over curves: h 0 ( V ) − − h 1 ( V ) = c 1 ( V ) + rank ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) ( 1 − − g ) .

{\displaystyle h^{0}(V)-h^{1}(V)=c_{1}(V)+\operatorname {rank} (V)(1-g).} Riemann Roch theorem for surfaces [ edit ] Main article: Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces For surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces χ χ ( D ) = χ χ ( O ) + ( ( D .

D ) − − ( D .

K ) ) / 2.

{\displaystyle \chi (D)=\chi ({\mathcal {O}})+((D.D)-(D.K))/2.} combined with the Noether formula.

If we want, we can use Serre duality to express h 2 (O( D )) as h 0 (O( K − D )), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the h 1 (O( D )) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).

Asymptotic Riemann–Roch [ edit ] Let D be an ample Cartier divisor on an irreducible projective variety X of dimension n . Then h 0 ( X , O X ( m D ) ) = ( D n ) n !

m n + O ( m n − − 1 ) .

{\displaystyle h^{0}\left(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}(mD)\right)={\frac {(D^{n})}{n!}}.m^{n}+O(m^{n-1}).} More generally, if F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is any coherent sheaf on X then h 0 ( X , F ⊗ ⊗ O X ( m D ) ) = rank ⁡ ⁡ ( F ) ( D n ) n !
