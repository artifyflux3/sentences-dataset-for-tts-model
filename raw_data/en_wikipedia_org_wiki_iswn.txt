Find sources: "ISWN" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The International Standard Wine Number or ISWN , similar to the ISBN for books, was a coding scheme intended to give a unique identifier for each wine worldwide. The ISWN system had a consistent unique code for each wine producer (ISWN-P), each wine brand or product (ISWN-W), each vintage variant of a wine product (ISWN-V), and the bottle variants (ISWN-B). The ISWN was allocated by the ISWN Organization on the basis of a global reference database of wine producers and wines worldwide.

[ 1 ] The database was improved through wine producers updating their own data with the ISWN Manager module. The ISWN Organization was a Non-profit organization sponsored by the wine industry.
