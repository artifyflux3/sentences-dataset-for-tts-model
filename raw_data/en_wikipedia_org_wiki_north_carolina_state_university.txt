[ 8 ] Founded in 1887 and part of the University of North Carolina system, it is the largest university in the Carolinas .

[ 9 ] The university forms one of the corners of the Research Triangle together with Duke University in Durham and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 10 ] The North Carolina General Assembly established North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts on March 7, 1887, as a land-grant college . The college underwent several name changes and officially became North Carolina State University at Raleigh in 1965. However, by longstanding convention, the "at Raleigh" portion is usually omitted. Today, NC State has an enrollment of more than 35,000 students, making it among the largest in the country. NC State has historical strengths in engineering , statistics , agriculture , life sciences , textiles , and design and offers bachelor's degrees in 106 fields of study. The graduate school offers master's degrees in 104 fields, doctoral degrees in 61 fields, and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.

[ 11 ] NC State athletic teams are known as the Wolfpack . The name was unofficially adopted in 1921 following an unsigned letter to the NC State Alumni News suggesting the moniker "Wolf Pack".

[ 12 ] They compete in NCAA Division I and have won eleven national championships: five NCAA championships, two AIAW championships, and four titles under other sanctioning bodies.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of North Carolina State University First freshman class at North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1889 The North Carolina General Assembly founded NC State on March 7, 1887, as a land-grant college under the name "North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts," or "North Carolina A&M" for short.

[ 13 ] In the segregated system, it was open only to white students. As a land-grant college, North Carolina A&M would provide a liberal and practical education while focusing on military tactics, agriculture, and the mechanical arts without excluding classical studies .

[ 14 ] Since its founding, the university has maintained these objectives while building on them.

[ 9 ] After opening in 1889, North Carolina A&M saw its enrollment fluctuate and its mandate expand. In 1917, it changed its name to "North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering"—or "North Carolina State" for short.

[ 15 ] During the Great Depression , the North Carolina state government, under Governor O. Max Gardner , administratively combined the University of North Carolina , the Woman's College (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro ), and NC State. This conglomeration became the University of North Carolina in 1931.

[ 16 ] In 1937, Blake R. Van Leer joined as Dean and started the graduate program for engineering, among numerous other programs.

[ 17 ] In 1942, Van Leer successfully encouraged NC State's first women to pursue an engineering degree, 4-5 women would enroll and the first women graduated in 1941. One of his students Katharine Stinson became the Federal Aviation Administration 's first female engineer.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Following World War II, the university grew and developed. The G.I. Bill enabled thousands of veterans to attend college, and enrollment shot past the 5,000 mark in 1947.

State College created new academic programs, including the School of Architecture and Landscape Design in 1947 (renamed as the School of Design in 1948), the School of Education in 1948, and the School of Forestry in 1950.

[ 14 ] In the summer of 1956, following the US Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated public education was unconstitutional, North Carolina State College enrolled its first African-American undergraduates, Ed Carson, Manuel Crockett, Irwin Holmes, and Walter Holmes.

[ 9 ] [ 20 ] Panoramic photo of campus taken around 1909 In 1962, State College officials desired to change the institution's name to North Carolina State University. Consolidated university administrators approved a change to the University of North Carolina at Raleigh, frustrating many students and alumni who protested the change with letter writing campaigns. In 1963, State College officially became North Carolina State of the University of North Carolina. Students, faculty, and alumni continued to express dissatisfaction with this name; however, after two additional years of protest, the name was changed to the current official name, North Carolina State University at Raleigh.

[ 14 ] However, by longstanding convention, the "at Raleigh" portion is omitted even in official documents such as diplomas, and in practice the institution's name is simply "North Carolina State University"; "NC State University" is also accepted on first reference in news stories. Indeed, school officials have long discouraged using "at Raleigh" except when absolutely necessary, as the full name implies that there is another branch of the university elsewhere in the state.

[ 21 ] In 1966, single-year enrollment reached 10,000.

[ 9 ] In the 1970s enrollment surpassed 19,000 and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences was added.

Celebrating its centennial in 1987, NC State reorganized its internal structure, renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the College of Engineering ). Also in this year, it gained 700 acres (2.8 km 2 ) of land that was developed as Centennial Campus . Since then, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus. It has invested more than $620 million in facilities and infrastructure at the new campus, with 62 acres (0.3 km 2 ) of space being constructed. Sixty-one private and government agency partners are on Centennial Campus.

[ 22 ] NC State has almost 8,000 employees, nearly 38,000 students, a $1.495 billion annual budget, and a $2.2 billion endowment.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] It is the largest university in the state and one of the anchors of North Carolina's Research Triangle , together with Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .

[ 25 ] In 2009, NCSU canceled a planned appearance by the Dalai Lama to speak on its Raleigh campus, citing concerns about a Chinese backlash and a shortage of time and resources.

[ 26 ] NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center, in D.H. Hill Library , maintains a website devoted to NC State history entitled Historical State .

[ 27 ] In October 2023, Polychlorinated biphenyl was detected in Poe Hall.

[ 28 ] NCSU closed Poe Hall the next month.

[ 29 ] The Campus Community Alliance for Environmental Justice, a student-led coalition, was formed to petition the college to test for environmental contaminants in all campus buildings [ 30 ] and increase transparency surrounding Poe Hall.

[ 31 ] Campuses [ edit ] Main campus [ edit ] Main article: Main Campus of North Carolina State University Holladay Hall, the first building built on NC State's campus in 1889, now houses the Chancellor's Office.

NC State's Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the North Carolina Railroad . Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and Reynolds Coliseum .

[ 32 ] NC State's PULSTAR Reactor is a 1 MW pool-type nuclear research reactor .

Architecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red brick buildings. Brick statues dot the landscape, and the University Plaza , colloquially named "The Brickyard", in North Campus is nicknamed for its paving material; most sidewalks are also made from brick. The Brickyard and sidewalks also contain white brick mosaics of the athletics logo and other patterns.

[ 33 ] College of Humanities and Social Science – NC State The Memorial Belltower , located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Chancellor's Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in World War I. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115 feet (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Belltower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.

[ 34 ] The 1911 building on North Carolina State's Main Campus The Court of North Carolina , just west of the Memorial Belltower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every county in North Carolina ), but damage caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court's former appearance is far from being restored.

[ 35 ] Completed in 1937, the Memorial Belltower was built to honor thirty-four NC State alumni who died in World War I. It stands 115 ft (35 m) tall.

Southwest of the Court of North Carolina is another landmark, the Free Expression Tunnel . The Tunnel functions as one of three pedestrian tunnels underneath the railroad tracks separating North Campus and Central Campus. This particular tunnel is the site of sanctioned graffiti ; anyone may paint there, and it is often the place for political statements, personal messages, and art. This tunnel also serves as a way to advertise events going on around campus.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2008, racist and threatening graffiti in the tunnel directed at then President-elect Barack Obama prompted an investigation from the United States Secret Service . Students held a "Unity Rally" in response to denounce the acts of racism.

[ 38 ] The Wolfline bus service connects points on the campuses with each other. It also provides transportation to collegiate athletic events.

[ 39 ] Centennial [ edit ] Main article: Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University NC State's main campus is augmented by the 1,334-acre (5.4 km 2 ) mixed-use Centennial Campus. Located 1 mi (1.6 km) south of the Memorial Tower, this campus houses university, corporate, and government research, in addition to classrooms and non-student residences. The Wilson College of Textiles has been based on this campus since 1991.

[ 40 ] Beginning in 2002, the College of Engineering began to relocate to Centennial Campus. Six of the nine College of Engineering departments are housed in three Engineering Buildings in an area known as the Engineering Oval. The Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC), part of the College of Engineering, is located adjacent to the Engineering Oval. The offices of ABB , LexisNexis and the National Weather Service are also on the Centennial Campus, as well as Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School .

[ 41 ] Centennial Biomedical Campus [ edit ] Main article: Centennial Biomedical Campus of North Carolina State University The North Carolina State University Centennial Biomedical Campus is located 2.5 mi (4.0 km) west of the NCSU Memorial Tower.

North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine , NC State's professional college and North Carolina's only veterinary medicine program, serves as the anchor of the Biomedical Campus. The 180-acre (0.73 km 2 ) campus consists of 20 buildings including the 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m 2 ) CVM Research Building where biomedical investigations in genomic sciences; vaccine development; cancer immuno-therapy; emerging and infectious zoonotic diseases; and diseases of the lung, respiratory tract , skin, and digestive system are undertaken. The Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with its clinical research and clinical trials, and the Teaching Animal Unit (TAU), which is a working farm, are also campus elements. The 110,000-square-foot Randall B. Terry Jr. Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center, completed in 2011, doubled the size of the veterinary hospital.

[ 42 ] J. C. Raulston Arboretum is an 8-acre (0.03 km 2 ) arboretum and botanical garden operated by NC State, and located just south of West Campus. It is open daily without charge.

[ 43 ] NC Research Campus [ edit ] Main article: North Carolina Research Campus NC State is one of eight universities with a presence at the North Carolina Research Campus, a 340-acre biotechnology hub in Kannapolis , NC The university operates the Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI), a research and education organization devoted to research involving food crops, like fruits and vegetables, and the potential health-promoting properties they convey when consumed.

[ 44 ] NC State's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.

[ 45 ] PHHI has both research and Cooperative Extension components.

Mary Ann Lila is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute.

[ 46 ] As of February 2024, PHHI is home to around 11 faculty and 70 staff at the NC Research Campus.

[ 47 ] NC State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the fledgling biotech hub that would become the NC Research Campus. The university's program was renamed the Plants for Human Health Institute when the NC Research Campus was officially dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order "to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease." [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Sustainability [ edit ] In March 2008, NC State launched the University Sustainability Office in order to address environmental concerns on campus.

[ 50 ] The university has established a commitment to reduce its annual energy consumption per square foot by at least 4% over a 10-year period.

[ 51 ] In addition, the university has surpassed the Executive Order 156 goal of diverting 40 percent of their solid waste stream from the landfill through a variety of campus reuse and recycling programs.

[ 52 ] NC State incorporates locally grown, organic, and free range foods into dining service meals at several events such as Earth Week's EarthFest and the annual All Carolinas Meal with foods local to the Carolinas.

[ 53 ] Examinations of the campus' sustainability practices by the Sustainable Endowments Institute resulted in a "B+" grade for NC State on the College Sustainability Report Card 2011. In 2013 the University Housing department agreed to incorporate a new living and learning community known as "EcoVillage." Members of EcoVillage were originally housed in Bragaw Residence Hall on West Campus. Today, EcoVillage is housed in the adjacent Lee Residence Hall. Members of EcoVillage complete numerous volunteer based sustainability trips every semester and attend various discussions about how to improve and further the university's reach into sustainability.

[ 54 ] Academics [ edit ] Structure [ edit ] NC State is one of 17 institutions that constitute the University of North Carolina system. Each campus has a high degree of independence, but each submits to the policies of the UNC system board of governors. The 32 voting members of the board of governors are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four-year terms. President Peter Hans heads the system.

[ 55 ] The board of trustees of NC State has thirteen members and sets all policies for the university. The UNC system board of governors elects eight of the trustees and the governor of North Carolina appoints four. The student body president serves on the board of trustees as a voting member. The UNC system also elects the chancellor of NC State, currently Kevin Howell .

The board of trustees administers NC State's eleven academic colleges . Each college grants its own degrees with the exception of the First Year College which provides incoming freshmen the opportunity to experience several disciplines before selecting a major. The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is the only college to offer associate degrees and the College of Veterinary Medicine does not grant undergraduate degrees. Each college is composed of numerous departments that focus on a particular discipline or degree program, for example Food Science , Civil Engineering , Genetics or Accounting . There are a total of 66 departments administered by all eleven NC State colleges.

In total, NC State offers nine associate degree programs in agriculture, [ 56 ] bachelor's degrees in 102 areas of study, master's degrees in 108 areas, and doctorate degrees in 60 areas. NC State is known for its programs in agriculture, engineering, textiles, and design. The textile and paper engineering programs are notable, given the uniqueness of the subject area.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Academic divisions [ edit ] As of the 2018–2019 school year [update] , NC State had the following colleges and academic departments: [ 60 ] College of Agriculture and Life Sciences College of Design College of Education College of Engineering College of Humanities and Social Sciences College of Natural Resources Poole College of Management College of Sciences Wilson College of Textiles College of Veterinary Medicine The Graduate School University College Admission [ edit ] Considered a more selective university, NC State accepts about half of those who apply for undergraduate admission. For the class of 2019, 21,104 applied and 10,584, or 50%, were accepted, of whom 4,210 enrolled.

[ 61 ] Members of the class of 2019 had average SAT verbal, math and writing scores of 610, 640 and 587, respectively, for a two-part total (verbal and math) of 1250 (1600-point scale) or a three-part total of 1836 (2400-point scale). The 4,210 students who enrolled had an average high school GPA of 3.44; 40%, or 1,677, ranked in the top 10% of their graduating classes. There were 130 valedictorians and 102 salutatorians in the class.

[ 62 ] Transfer admission is also very competitive. In the fall of 2015, 4,165 students applied to the transfer class; 1,470, or 35%, were admitted.

[ 61 ] NC State requires undergraduate admission candidates to choose a preferred college of study. After determining that an applicant meets the overall university requirements, the individual college must also agree to accept the student. Because of this process, some colleges have significantly higher admission requirements than others.

[ 63 ] The Graduate School reviews all postgraduate education applications. For fall 2015, 14,394 prospective students applied to the Graduate School; 3,460 (24%) were admitted. Of these, 2,982 (80.3%) enrolled.
