Cone A right circular cone with the radius of its base r , its height h , its slant height c and its angle θ .

Type Solid figure Faces 1 circular face and 1 conic surface Euler char.

2 Symmetry group O(2) Surface area π r 2 + π rℓ Volume ( π r 2 h )/3 A right circular cone and an oblique circular cone A double cone, not infinitely extended In geometry , a cone is a three-dimensional figure that tapers smoothly from a flat base (typically a circle ) to a point not contained in the base, called the apex or vertex .

A cone is formed by a set of line segments , half-lines , or lines connecting a common point, the apex, to all of the points on a base.  In the case of line segments, the cone does not extend beyond the base, while in the case of half-lines, it extends infinitely far. In the case of lines, the cone extends infinitely far in both directions from the apex, in which case it is sometimes called a double cone . Each of the two halves of a double cone split at the apex is called a nappe .

Depending on the author, the base may be restricted to a circle, any one-dimensional quadratic form in the plane, any closed one-dimensional figure , or any of the above plus all the enclosed points. If the enclosed points are included in the base, the cone is a solid object ; otherwise it is an open surface , a two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. In the case of a solid object, the boundary formed by these lines or partial lines is called the lateral surface ; if the lateral surface is unbounded , it is a conical surface .

The axis of a cone is the straight line passing through the apex about which the cone has a circular symmetry .

In common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be right circular , i.e., with a circle base perpendicular to the axis.

[ 1 ] If the cone is right circular the intersection of a plane with the lateral surface is a conic section . In general, however, the base may be any shape [ 2 ] and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is usually assumed that the base is bounded and therefore has finite area , and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base). Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones , in which the axis passes through the centre of the base non-perpendicularly.

[ 3 ] Depending on context, cone may refer more narrowly to either a convex cone or projective cone .
Cones can be generalized to higher dimensions .

Further terminology [ edit ] The perimeter of the base of a cone is called the directrix , and each of the line segments between the directrix and apex is a generatrix or generating line of the lateral surface.  (For the connection between this sense of the term directrix and the directrix of a conic section, see Dandelin spheres .) The base radius of a circular cone is the radius of its base; often this is simply called the radius of the cone.

The aperture of a right circular cone is the maximum angle between two generatrix lines; if the generatrix makes an angle θ to the axis, the aperture is 2 θ . In optics , the angle θ is called the half-angle of the cone, to distinguish it from the aperture.

Illustration from Problemata mathematica...

published in Acta Eruditorum , 1734 A cone truncated by an inclined plane A cone with a region including its apex cut off by a plane is called a truncated cone ; if the truncation plane is parallel to the cone's base, it is called a frustum .

[ 1 ] An elliptical cone is a cone with an elliptical base.

[ 1 ] A generalized cone is the surface created by the set of lines passing through a vertex and every point on a boundary (see Visual hull ).

Measurements and equations [ edit ] Volume [ edit ] Proof without words that the volume of a cone is a third of a cylinder of equal diameter and height 1.

A cone and a cylinder have radius r and height h .

2.

The volume ratio is maintained when the height is scaled to h' = r √ π .

3.

Decompose it into thin slices.

4.

Using Cavalieri's principle, reshape each slice into a square of the same area.

5.

The pyramid is replicated twice.

6.

Combining them into a cube shows that the volume ratio is 1:3.

The volume V {\displaystyle V} of any conic solid is one third of the product of the area of the base A B {\displaystyle A_{B}} and the height h {\displaystyle h} [ 4 ] V = 1 3 A B h .

{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}A_{B}h.} In modern mathematics, this formula can easily be computed using calculus — it is, up to scaling, the integral ∫ ∫ x 2 d x = 1 3 x 3 {\displaystyle \int x^{2}\,dx={\tfrac {1}{3}}x^{3}} Without using calculus, the formula can be proven by comparing the cone to a pyramid and applying Cavalieri's principle – specifically, comparing the cone to a (vertically scaled) right square pyramid, which forms one third of a cube. This formula cannot be proven without using such infinitesimal arguments – unlike the 2-dimensional formulae for polyhedral area, though similar to the area of the circle – and hence admitted less rigorous proofs before the advent of calculus, with the ancient Greeks using the method of exhaustion . This is essentially the content of Hilbert's third problem – more precisely, not all polyhedral pyramids are scissors congruent (can be cut apart into finite pieces and rearranged into the other), and thus volume cannot be computed purely by using a decomposition argument.

[ 5 ] Center of mass [ edit ] The center of mass of a conic solid of uniform density lies one-quarter of the way from the center of the base to the vertex, on the straight line joining the two.

Right circular cone [ edit ] Volume [ edit ] For a circular cone with radius r {\displaystyle r} and height h {\displaystyle h} , the base is a circle of area π π r 2 {\displaystyle \pi r^{2}} thus the formula for volume is: [ 6 ] V = 1 3 π π r 2 h {\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}\pi r^{2}h} Slant height [ edit ] The slant height of a right circular cone is the distance from any point on the circle of its base to the apex via a line segment along the surface of the cone. It is given by r 2 + h 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}} , where r {\displaystyle r} is the radius of the base and h {\displaystyle h} is the height. This can be proved by the Pythagorean theorem .

Surface area [ edit ] The lateral surface area of a right circular cone is L S A = π π r ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle LSA=\pi r\ell } where r {\displaystyle r} is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } is the slant height of the cone.

[ 4 ] The surface area of the bottom circle of a cone is the same as for any circle, π π r 2 {\displaystyle \pi r^{2}} .  Thus, the total surface area of a right circular cone can be expressed as each of the following: Radius and height π π r 2 + π π r r 2 + h 2 {\displaystyle \pi r^{2}+\pi r{\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}} (the area of the base plus the area of the lateral surface; the term r 2 + h 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}} is the slant height) π π r ( r + r 2 + h 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi r\left(r+{\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}\right)} where r {\displaystyle r} is the radius and h {\displaystyle h} is the height.

Total surface area of a right circular cone, given radius 𝑟 and slant height ℓ Radius and slant height π π r 2 + π π r ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \pi r^{2}+\pi r\ell } π π r ( r + ℓ ℓ ) {\displaystyle \pi r(r+\ell )} where r {\displaystyle r} is the radius and ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } is the slant height.

Circumference and slant height c 2 4 π π + c ℓ ℓ 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {c^{2}}{4\pi }}+{\frac {c\ell }{2}}} ( c 2 ) ( c 2 π π + ℓ ℓ ) {\displaystyle \left({\frac {c}{2}}\right)\left({\frac {c}{2\pi }}+\ell \right)} where c {\displaystyle c} is the circumference and ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } is the slant height.

Apex angle and height π π h 2 tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 ( tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 + sec ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi h^{2}\tan {\frac {\theta }{2}}\left(\tan {\frac {\theta }{2}}+\sec {\frac {\theta }{2}}\right)} − − π π h 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle -{\frac {\pi h^{2}\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}}{\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}-1}}} where θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the apex angle and h {\displaystyle h} is the height.

Circular sector [ edit ] The circular sector is obtained by unfolding the surface of one nappe of the cone: radius R R = r 2 + h 2 {\displaystyle R={\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}} arc length L L = c = 2 π π r {\displaystyle L=c=2\pi r} central angle φ in radians φ φ = L R = 2 π π r r 2 + h 2 {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {L}{R}}={\frac {2\pi r}{\sqrt {r^{2}+h^{2}}}}} Equation form [ edit ] The surface of a cone can be parameterized as f ( θ θ , h ) = ( h cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , h sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , h ) , {\displaystyle f(\theta ,h)=(h\cos \theta ,h\sin \theta ,h),} where θ θ ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π π ) {\displaystyle \theta \in [0,2\pi )} is the angle "around" the cone, and h ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle h\in \mathbb {R} } is the "height" along the cone.

A right solid circular cone with height h {\displaystyle h} and aperture 2 θ θ {\displaystyle 2\theta } , whose axis is the z {\displaystyle z} coordinate axis and whose apex is the origin, is described parametrically as F ( s , t , u ) = ( u tan ⁡ ⁡ s cos ⁡ ⁡ t , u tan ⁡ ⁡ s sin ⁡ ⁡ t , u ) {\displaystyle F(s,t,u)=\left(u\tan s\cos t,u\tan s\sin t,u\right)} where s , t , u {\displaystyle s,t,u} range over [ 0 , θ θ ) {\displaystyle [0,\theta )} , [ 0 , 2 π π ) {\displaystyle [0,2\pi )} , and [ 0 , h ] {\displaystyle [0,h]} , respectively.

In implicit form, the same solid is defined by the inequalities { F ( x , y , z ) ≤ ≤ 0 , z ≥ ≥ 0 , z ≤ ≤ h } , {\displaystyle \{F(x,y,z)\leq 0,z\geq 0,z\leq h\},} where F ( x , y , z ) = ( x 2 + y 2 ) ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) 2 − − z 2 ( sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) 2 .

{\displaystyle F(x,y,z)=(x^{2}+y^{2})(\cos \theta )^{2}-z^{2}(\sin \theta )^{2}.\,} More generally, a right circular cone with vertex at the origin, axis parallel to the vector d {\displaystyle d} , and aperture 2 θ θ {\displaystyle 2\theta } , is given by the implicit vector equation F ( u ) = 0 {\displaystyle F(u)=0} where F ( u ) = ( u ⋅ ⋅ d ) 2 − − ( d ⋅ ⋅ d ) ( u ⋅ ⋅ u ) ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) 2 {\displaystyle F(u)=(u\cdot d)^{2}-(d\cdot d)(u\cdot u)(\cos \theta )^{2}} F ( u ) = u ⋅ ⋅ d − − | d | | u | cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle F(u)=u\cdot d-|d||u|\cos \theta } where u = ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle u=(x,y,z)} , and u ⋅ ⋅ d {\displaystyle u\cdot d} denotes the dot product .

Projective geometry [ edit ] In projective geometry , a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity, which corresponds visually to a cylinder in perspective appearing to be a cone towards the sky.

In projective geometry , a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity.

[ 7 ] Intuitively, if one keeps the base fixed and takes the limit as the apex goes to infinity, one obtains a cylinder, the angle of the side increasing as arctan , in the limit forming a right angle . This is useful in the definition of degenerate conics , which require considering the cylindrical conics .

According to G. B. Halsted , a cone is generated similarly to a Steiner conic only with a projectivity and axial pencils (not in perspective) rather than the projective ranges used for the Steiner conic: "If two copunctual non-costraight axial pencils are projective but not perspective, the meets of correlated planes form a 'conic surface of the second order', or 'cone'." [ 8 ] Generalizations [ edit ] Further information: Hypercone The definition of a cone may be extended to higher dimensions; see convex cone . In this case, one says that a convex set C in the real vector space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a cone (with apex at the origin) if for every vector x in C and every nonnegative real number a , the vector ax is in C .

[ 2 ] In this context, the analogues of circular cones are not usually special; in fact one is often interested in polyhedral cones .

An even more general concept is the topological cone , which is defined in arbitrary topological spaces.
