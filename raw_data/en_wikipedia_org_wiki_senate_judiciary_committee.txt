Website judiciary.senate.gov Rules Rule XXV.1.(m), Standing Rules of the Senate Rules of Procedure U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary Sonia Sotomayor testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination for the United States Supreme Court The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary , informally known as the Senate Judiciary Committee , is a standing committee of 22 U.S. senators [ 1 ] whose role is to oversee the Department of Justice (DOJ), consider executive and judicial nominations, and review pending legislation.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In addition, the Standing Rules of the Senate confer jurisdiction to the Senate Judiciary Committee in certain areas, such as considering proposed constitutional amendments and legislation related to federal criminal law , human rights law , immigration , intellectual property , antitrust law , and internet privacy .

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Established in 1816 as one of the original standing committees in the United States Senate, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is one of the oldest and most influential committees in Congress. Its broad legislative jurisdiction has assured its primary role as a forum for the public discussion of social and constitutional issues. The committee is also responsible for oversight of key activities of the executive branch, and is responsible for the initial stages of the confirmation process of all judicial nominations for the federal judiciary.

[ 5 ] Nominations [ edit ] See also: Senate Judiciary Committee reviews of nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States The committee considers presidential nominations for positions in the DOJ—including the Attorney-General and the Director of the FBI —, the Office of National Drug Control Policy , the State Justice Institute , and certain positions in the Department of Commerce and DHS. It is also in charge of holding hearings and investigating judicial nominations to the Supreme Court , the U.S. court of appeals , the U.S. district courts , and the Court of International Trade .

[ 2 ] If a majority on the committee votes to advance a nomination, the nominee is reported favorably to the whole Senate, which can vote by simple majority to confirm the nominee.

[ 6 ] Oversight [ edit ] The Judiciary Committee's oversight of the DOJ includes all of the agencies under the DOJ's jurisdiction, such as the FBI . It also has oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
