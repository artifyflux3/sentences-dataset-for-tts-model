[ 4 ] Nikhef is located at the Amsterdam Science Park in Watergraafsmeer in the Netherlands .

[ 5 ] NIKHEF is an acronym for Nationaal Instituut voor Kernfysica en Hoge-Energiefysica (National Institute for Nuclear and High energy physics). This acronym is no longer used and the name was changed to Nationaal instituut voor subatomaire fysica (National Institute for Subatomic Physics). The name Nikhef is preserved to maintain name recognition (now with only the N capitalised).

[ 3 ] [ 1 ] It also was the host of the third website in the world, starting in February 1992.
