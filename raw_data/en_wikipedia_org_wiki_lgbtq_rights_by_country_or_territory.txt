Rights affecting lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer ( LGBTQ ) people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction—encompassing everything from the legal recognition of same-sex marriage to the death penalty for homosexuality .

Laws concerning gender identity-expression by country or territory Legal identity change, surgery not required Legal identity change, surgery required No legal identity change Unknown/Ambiguous Notably, as of January 2025 [update] , 38 countries recognize same-sex marriage .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] By contrast, not counting non-state actors and extrajudicial killings, only two countries are believed to impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts: Iran and Afghanistan .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The death penalty is officially law , but generally not practiced , in Mauritania , Saudi Arabia , Somalia (in the autonomous state of Jubaland ) and the United Arab Emirates .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] LGBTQ people also face extrajudicial killings in the Russian region of Chechnya .

[ 9 ] Sudan rescinded its unenforced death penalty for anal sex (hetero- or homosexual) in 2020. Fifteen countries have stoning on the books as a penalty for adultery , which (in light of the illegality of gay marriage in those countries) would by default include gay sex, but this is enforced by the legal authorities in Iran and Nigeria (in the northern third of the country).

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBTQ rights, following which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including hate crimes , criminalization of homosexual activity , and discrimination . Following the issuance of the report, the United Nations urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBTQ rights.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] A 2022 study found that LGBTQ rights (as measured by ILGA-Europe 's Rainbow Index) were correlated with less HIV/AIDS incidence among gay and bisexual men independently of risky sexual behavior.

[ 17 ] The 2023 Equaldex Equality Index ranks the Nordic countries , Chile , Uruguay , Canada , the Benelux countries, Spain , Andorra , and Malta among the best for LGBTQ rights. The index ranks Nigeria , Yemen , Brunei , Afghanistan , Somalia , Mauritania , Palestine , and Iran among the worst.

[ 18 ] [ better source needed ] Asher & Lyric ranked Canada, Sweden , and the Netherlands as the three safest nations for LGBTQ people in its 2023 index.

[ 19 ] Scope of laws Laws that affect LGBTQ people include, but are not limited to, the following: laws concerning the recognition of same-sex relationships , including same-sex marriage , civil unions , and domestic partnerships laws concerning same-sex parenting , including same-sex adoption anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education, public accommodations anti-bullying legislation to protect LGBTQ children at school hate crime laws imposing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated violence against LGBTQ people bathroom bills affecting access to sex-segregated facilities by transgender people laws related to sexual orientation and military service laws concerning access to assisted reproductive technology sodomy laws that penalize consensual same-sex sexual activity that may or may not target homosexuals, males or males and females, or leave some homosexual acts legal adultery laws that same-sex couples are subject to age of consent laws that may impose higher ages for same-sex sexual activity laws regarding donation of blood, corneas, and other tissues by men who have sex with men laws concerning access to gender-affirming surgery and gender-affirming hormone replacement therapy legal recognition and accommodation of the affirmed gender History of LGBT-related laws See also: LGBTQ history , Timeline of LGBTQ history , LGBTQ movements , History of homosexuality , and Sodomy law § History Ancient India Ayoni or non-vaginal sex of all types is punishable in the Arthashastra . Homosexual acts are, however, treated as a smaller offence punishable by a fine, while unlawful heterosexual sex carries much harsher punishment. The Dharmsastras , especially the later ones, prescribe against non-vaginal sex like the Vashistha Dharmasutra . The Yājñavalkya Smṛti prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men.

Manusmriti prescribes light punishments for such acts.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Vanita states that the verses about punishment for a sex between female and a maiden is due to its strong emphasis on a maiden's sexual purity.

[ 22 ] Ancient Israel The ancient Law of Moses (the Torah ) forbids people from lying with people of the same sex (i.e., from having intercourse ) in Leviticus 18 and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in Genesis 19 , in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah , after which the cities were soon destroyed with "brimstone and fire, from the Lord" [ 23 ] [ 24 ] and the death penalty was prescribed to its inhabitants – and to Lot's wife , who was turned into a pillar of salt because she turned back to watch the cities' destruction.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as "abominable".

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Assyria In Assyrian society, sex crimes were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.

[ 29 ] An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal social class , a cult prostitute, or with someone whose gender roles were not considered solidly masculine.

[ 29 ] Such sexual relations were even seen as good fortune , with an Akkadian tablet , the Šumma ālu , reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was submissive or penetrated , were treated as bad omens .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Middle Assyrian Law Codes dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for homosexuality in the military , which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch ." [ 34 ] [ 35 ] A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a eunuch". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual rape . Any Assyrian male could visit a prostitute or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.

[ 36 ] Ancient Rome In ancient Rome, the bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the Lex Scantinia imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ( stuprum ) against a freeborn male minor .

[ 37 ] Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: slaves , male prostitutes , and the infames , entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

A male citizen who willingly performed oral sex or received anal sex was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men.

[ 38 ] In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of effeminacy and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ( populares ) such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony .

[ 39 ] Roman law addressed the rape of a male citizen as early as the 2nd century BC when it was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.

[ 40 ] A law probably dating to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.

[ 41 ] A male classified as infamis , such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.

[ 42 ] In the Roman army of the Republic, sex among fellow soldiers violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death, [ 43 ] as a violation of military discipline .

[ 44 ] The Greek historian Polybius (2nd century BC) lists deserters , thieves, perjurers , and "...on young men who have abused their persons" as subject to the fustuarium , clubbing to death.

[ 45 ] Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of sexual harassment by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.

[ 46 ] Soldiers were free to have relations with their male slaves ; [ 47 ] the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.

[ 48 ] By the late Republic and throughout the Imperial period , there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.

[ 49 ] Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites .

Juvenal remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.

[ 50 ] The emperor Nero had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a freedman Pythagoras ) and once as the groom. His consort Sporus appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.

[ 51 ] Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by Philip the Arab . By the end of the 4th century, after the Roman Empire had come under Christian rule , passive homosexuality was punishable by burning .

[ 52 ] "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the Theodosian Code .

[ 53 ] Under Justinian , all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners are, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.

[ 54 ] British Empire See also: LGBTQ rights in the Commonwealth of Nations The United Kingdom introduced anti-homosexuality laws throughout its colonies, particularly in the 19th century when the British Empire was at its peak.

[ 55 ] As of 2018, more than half of the 71 countries that criminalised homosexuality were former British colonies or protectorates.

[ 56 ] In 1861, the British Empire introduced Section 377 of the British Colonial Penal Code , outlawing consensual sexual activity between same-sex couples as well as labelling third gender communities such as the apwint people and Hijra as "outlaw tribes". This law was intended to criminalise acts "against the order of nature". Section 377 was used to prosecute people engaging in oral and anal sex along with homosexual activity.

Today, Section 377 still exists in some former British colonies : Bangladesh [ 57 ] Malaysia [ 57 ] Myanmar [ 57 ] Pakistan [ 57 ] Sri Lanka (as Section 365 ) [ 57 ] In addition to Section 377, the United Kingdom also introduced a number of laws targeting gender non-conformity throughout its colonies. In 1861, authorities of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) sought to enact a 'special law' against Hijra people in order to criminalise their identity .

[ 58 ] The Hijra were included in the Criminal Tribes Act (1871) [ 59 ] [ 58 ] and were monitored with the hope of eliminating their culture .

[ 58 ] Due to the passage of the Criminal Tribes Act (1871), Hijra people could not possess children.

[ 58 ] While significant progress has been made to reverse these laws, the majority of the countries of the Commonwealth of Nations , formerly known as the British Commonwealth, still criminalise sexual acts between consenting adults of the same sex and other forms of sexual orientation , gender identity and expression. Homosexual activity remains a criminal offence in 29 of the 56 sovereign states of the Commonwealth; and legal in only 27. In 3 of these states, homosexual activity is punishable by death .

LGBTQ communities still face significant discrimination due to the influence of colonialism in former British colonies, despite these communities being accepted prior to British colonialism . In the Indic cultural sphere , references to a third sex can be found throughout the texts of India's religious traditions like Jainism [ 60 ] and Buddhism [ 61 ] as well as the Kama Sutra .

[ 62 ] The foundational work of Hindu law, the Manu Smriti (c. 200 BC–200 AD) explains humans as belonging to one of three biological sexes , indicating a belief that transsexuality was an inherent trait.

Netherlands In 2001, the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage .

Age of consent was previously equalized for same-sex couples in the following countries or territories before the war: Belluno ( legal in 1890 ), Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol ( legal in 1890 ), Friuli-Venezia Giulia ( legal in 1890 ), [ 65 ] [ 66 ] and Poland ( decriminalized in 1932 ).

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] During World War II Germany did not consistently enforce anti-homosexual laws in all occupied countries.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] All countries and territories listed that were annexed or established into reichskommissariats by Nazi Germany during World War II were restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or after the war and thus re-legalized equal age of consent laws for same-sex couples in those areas.

In 2021 a judgement by the Taipei High Administrative Court [ 457 ] ruled that the executive order above was unconstitutional and therefore the defendant (district household registration office) must allow the plaintiff to change their gender. The judgement was finalized since the defendant did not appeal. However, since rulings in Taiwan are generally not precedential, said judgement only applies to the plaintiff and does not bind other cases nor the executive branch.

Marriage, being a union of a man and a woman, as well as the family, motherhood and parenthood, shall be placed under the protection and care of the Republic of Poland.

^ Judgment of the Supreme Court of 7 July 2004, II KK 176/04 , W dotychczasowym orzecznictwie Sądu Najwyższego, wypracowanym i ugruntowanym zarówno w okresie obowiązywania poprzedniego, jak i obecnego Kodeksu postępowania karnego, a także w doktrynie (por. wypowiedzi W. Woltera, A. Zolla, A. Wąska), pojęcie "wspólne pożycie" odnoszone jest wyłącznie do konkubinatu, a w szczególności do związku osób o różnej płci, odpowiadającego od strony faktycznej stosunkowi małżeństwa (którym w myśl art. 18 Konstytucji jest wyłącznie związek osób różnej płci). Tego rodzaju interpretację Sąd Najwyższy, orzekający w niniejszej sprawie, w pełni podziela i nie znajduje podstaw do uznania za przekonywujące tych wypowiedzi pojawiających się w piśmiennictwie, w których podejmowane są próby kwestionowania takiej interpretacji omawianego pojęcia i sprowadzania go wyłącznie do konkubinatu (M. Płachta, K. Łojewski, A.M. Liberkowski). Rozumiejąc bowiem dążenia do rozszerzającej interpretacji pojęcia "wspólne pożycie", użytego w art. 115 § 11 k.k., należy jednak wskazać na całkowity brak w tym względzie dostatecznie precyzyjnych kryteriów.

^ "Judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of 11 May 2005, K 18/04" .

Polska Konstytucja określa bowiem małżeństwo jako związek wyłącznie kobiety i mężczyzny.

A contrario nie dopuszcza więc związków jednopłciowych. [...] Małżeństwo (jako związek kobiety i mężczyzny) uzyskało w prawie krajowym RP odrębny status konstytucyjny zdeterminowany postanowieniami art. 18 Konstytucji. Zmiana tego statusu byłaby możliwa jedynie przy zachowaniu rygorów trybu zmiany Konstytucji, określonych w art. 235 tego aktu.

^ "Judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of 9 November 2010, SK 10/08" .

W doktrynie prawa konstytucyjnego wskazuje się nadto, że jedyny element normatywny, dający się odkodować z art. 18 Konstytucji, to ustalenie zasady heteroseksualności małżeństwa.

^ "Judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland of 25 October 2016, II GSK 866/15" .

Ustawa o świadczeniach zdrowotnych finansowanych ze środków publicznych nie wyjaśnia, co prawda, kto jest małżonkiem. Pojęcie to zostało jednak dostatecznie i jasno określone we wspomnianym art. 18 Konstytucji RP, w którym jest mowa o małżeństwie jako o związku kobiety i mężczyzny. W piśmiennictwie podkreśla się, że art. 18 Konstytucji ustala zasadę heteroseksualności małżeństwa, będącą nie tyle zasadą ustroju, co normą prawną, która zakazuje ustawodawcy zwykłemu nadawania charakteru małżeństwa związkom pomiędzy osobami jednej płci (vide: L. Garlicki Komentarz do art. 18 Konstytucji, s. 2-3 [w:] Konstytucja Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej. Komentarz, Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, Warszawa 2003). Jest wobec tego oczywiste, że małżeństwem w świetle Konstytucji i co za tym idzie – w świetle polskiego prawa, może być i jest wyłącznie związek heteroseksualny, a więc w związku małżeńskim małżonkami nie mogą być osoby tej samej płci.

^ "Judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland of 28 February 2018, II OSK 1112/16" .

art. 18 Konstytucji RP, który definiuje małżeństwo jako związek kobiety i mężczyzny, a tym samym wynika z niego zasada nakazująca jako małżeństwo traktować w Polsce jedynie związek heteroseksualny.

the drafters of the 1997 Polish Constitution included a legal definition of a marriage as the union of a woman and a man in the text of the constitution in order to ensure that the introduction of same-sex marriage would not be passed without a constitutional amendment.

Z przeprowadzonej powyżej analizy prac nad Konstytucją RP wynika jednoznacznie, że zamieszczenie w art. 18 Konstytucji RP zwrotu definicyjnego "związek kobiety i mężczyzny" stanowiło reakcję na fakt pojawienia się w państwach obcych regulacji poddającej związki osób tej samej płci regulacji zbliżonej lub zbieżnej z instytucją małżeństwa. Uzupełniony tym zwrotem przepis konstytucyjny "miał pełnić rolę instrumentu zapobiegającego wprowadzeniu takiej regulacji do prawa polskiego" (A. Mączyński, Konstytucyjne podstawy prawa rodzinnego, s. 772). Innego motywu jego wprowadzenia do Konstytucji RP nie da się wskazać (szeroko w tym zakresie B. Banaszkiewicz, "Małżeństwo jako związek kobiety i mężczyzny", s. 640 i n.; zob. też Z. Strus, Znaczenie artykułu 18 Konstytucji, s. 236 i n.). Jak zauważa A. Mączyński istotą tej regulacji było normatywne przesądzenie nie tylko o niemożliwości unormowania w prawie polskim "małżeństw pomiędzy osobami tej samej płci", lecz również innych związków, które mimo tego, że nie zostałyby określone jako małżeństwo miałyby spełniać funkcje do niego podobną (A. Mączyński, Konstytucyjne podstawy prawa rodzinnego, s. 772; tenże, Konstytucyjne i międzynarodowe uwarunkowania, s. 91; podobnie L. Garlicki, Artykuł 18, w: Garlicki, Konstytucja, t. 3, uw. 4, s. 2, który zauważa, że w tym zakresie art. 18 nabiera "charakteru normy prawnej").
