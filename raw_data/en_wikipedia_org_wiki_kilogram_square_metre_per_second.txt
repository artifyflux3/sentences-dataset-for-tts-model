 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Unit of action or angular momentum

Not to be confused with [Joules per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joules_per_second "Joules per second").

| Unit of | [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") or [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") |
| Symbol | J⋅s |

The **joule-second** (symbol **J⋅s** or **J s**) is the unit of [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") and of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) equal to the product of an [SI derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit"), the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") (J), and an [SI base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit"), the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") (s).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram_square_metre_per_second#cite_note-1) The joule-second is a unit of [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") or of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"). The joule-second also appears in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") within the definition of the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram_square_metre_per_second#cite_note-2) Angular momentum is the product of an object's [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia"), in units of kg⋅m 2 and its [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") in units of rad⋅s−1. This product of moment of inertia and angular velocity yields kg⋅m 2⋅s−1 or the joule-second. The Planck constant represents the energy of a wave, in units of joule, divided by the frequency of that wave, in units of s−1. This [quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient "Quotient") of energy and frequency also yields the joule-second (J⋅s).

Base units
----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joule-second&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Base units")]

In SI base units the joule-second becomes kilogram-meter squared-per second or kg⋅m 2⋅s−1. [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") of the joule-second yields M L 2 T−1. Note the denominator of seconds (s) in the base units.

Confusion with joules per second
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joule-second&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Confusion with joules per second")]

The joule-second (J⋅s) should not be confused with [joules _per_ second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joules_per_second "Joules per second") (J/s) or watts (W). In physical processes, when the unit of time appears in the denominator of a ratio, the described process occurs at a [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(mathematics) "Rate (mathematics)"). For example, in discussions about speed, an object like a car travels a known distance of kilometers spread over a known number of seconds, and the car's speed is measured in the unit kilometer _per_ hour (km/h). In physics, work _per_ time describes a system's [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)"), with the unit [watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") (W), which is equal to joules per second (J/s).
