Càdlàg functions are important in the study of stochastic processes that admit (or even require) jumps, unlike Brownian motion , which has continuous sample paths. The collection of càdlàg functions on a given domain is known as Skorokhod space .

Two related terms are càglàd , standing for " continue à gauche, limite à droite ", the left-right reversal of càdlàg, and càllàl for " continue à l'un, limite à l’autre " (continuous on one side, limit on the other side), for a function which at each point of the domain is either càdlàg or càglàd.

Definition [ edit ] Cumulative distribution functions are examples of càdlàg functions.

Example of a cumulative distribution function with a countably infinite set of discontinuities Let ( M , d ) {\displaystyle (M,d)} be a metric space , and let E ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle E\subseteq \mathbb {R} } . A function f : E → → M {\displaystyle f:E\to M} is called a càdlàg function if, for every t ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle t\in E} , the left limit f ( t − − ) := lim s → → t − − f ( s ) {\displaystyle f(t-):=\lim _{s\to t^{-}}f(s)} exists; and the right limit f ( t + ) := lim s → → t + f ( s ) {\displaystyle f(t+):=\lim _{s\to t^{+}}f(s)} exists and equals f ( t ) {\displaystyle f(t)} .

That is, f {\displaystyle f} is right-continuous with left limits.

Examples [ edit ] All functions continuous on a subset of the real numbers are càdlàg functions on that subset.

As a consequence of their definition, all cumulative distribution functions are càdlàg functions. For instance the cumulative at point r {\displaystyle r} correspond to the probability of being lower or equal than r {\displaystyle r} , namely P [ X ≤ ≤ r ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} [X\leq r]} . In other words, the semi-open interval of concern for a two-tailed distribution ( − − ∞ ∞ , r ] {\displaystyle (-\infty ,r]} is right-closed.

The right derivative f + ′ ′ {\displaystyle f_{+}^{\prime }} of any convex function f {\displaystyle f} defined on an open interval, is an increasing cadlag function.

Skorokhod space [ edit ] The set of all càdlàg functions from E {\displaystyle E} to M {\displaystyle M} is often denoted by D ( E : M ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} (E:M)} (or simply D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } ) and is called Skorokhod space after the Ukrainian mathematician Anatoliy Skorokhod . Skorokhod space can be assigned a topology that intuitively allows us to "wiggle space and time a bit" (whereas the traditional topology of uniform convergence only allows us to "wiggle space a bit").

[ 1 ] For simplicity, take E = [ 0 , T ] {\displaystyle E=[0,T]} and M = R n {\displaystyle M=\mathbb {R} ^{n}} — see Billingsley [ 2 ] for a more general construction.

We must first define an analogue of the modulus of continuity , ϖ ϖ f ′ ( δ δ ) {\displaystyle \varpi '_{f}(\delta )} . For any F ⊆ ⊆ E {\displaystyle F\subseteq E} , set w f ( F ) := sup s , t ∈ ∈ F | f ( s ) − − f ( t ) | {\displaystyle w_{f}(F):=\sup _{s,t\in F}|f(s)-f(t)|} and, for δ δ > 0 {\displaystyle \delta >0} , define the càdlàg modulus to be ϖ ϖ f ′ ( δ δ ) := inf Π Π max 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ k w f ( [ t i − − 1 , t i ) ) , {\displaystyle \varpi '_{f}(\delta ):=\inf _{\Pi }\max _{1\leq i\leq k}w_{f}([t_{i-1},t_{i})),} where the infimum runs over all partitions Π Π = { 0 = t 0 < t 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < t k = T } , k ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle \Pi =\{0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\dots <t_{k}=T\},\;k\in E} , with min i ( t i − − t i + 1 ) > δ δ {\displaystyle \min _{i}(t_{i}-t_{i+1})>\delta } . This definition makes sense for non-càdlàg f {\displaystyle f} (just as the usual modulus of continuity makes sense for discontinuous functions).

f {\displaystyle f} is càdlàg if and only if lim δ δ → → 0 ϖ ϖ f ′ ( δ δ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{\delta \to 0}\varpi '_{f}(\delta )=0} .

Now let Λ Λ {\displaystyle \Lambda } denote the set of all strictly increasing , continuous bijections from E {\displaystyle E} to itself (these are "wiggles in time"). Let ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ := sup t ∈ ∈ E | f ( t ) | {\displaystyle \|f\|:=\sup _{t\in E}|f(t)|} denote the uniform norm on functions on E {\displaystyle E} . Define the Skorokhod metric σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } on D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } by σ σ ( f , g ) := inf λ λ ∈ ∈ Λ Λ max { ‖ ‖ λ λ − − I ‖ ‖ , ‖ ‖ f − − g ∘ ∘ λ λ ‖ ‖ } , {\displaystyle \sigma (f,g):=\inf _{\lambda \in \Lambda }\max\{\|\lambda -I\|,\|f-g\circ \lambda \|\},} where I : E → → E {\displaystyle I:E\to E} is the identity function. In terms of the "wiggle" intuition, ‖ ‖ λ λ − − I ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\lambda -I\|} measures the size of the "wiggle in time", and ‖ ‖ f − − g ∘ ∘ λ λ ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|f-g\circ \lambda \|} measures the size of the "wiggle in space".

The Skorokhod metric is indeed a metric. The topology Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } generated by σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is called the Skorokhod topology on D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } .

An equivalent metric, d ( f , g ) := inf λ λ ∈ ∈ Λ Λ ( ‖ ‖ λ λ − − I ‖ ‖ + ‖ ‖ f − − g ∘ ∘ λ λ ‖ ‖ ) , {\displaystyle d(f,g):=\inf _{\lambda \in \Lambda }(\|\lambda -I\|+\|f-g\circ \lambda \|),} was introduced independently and utilized in control theory for the analysis of switching systems.

[ 3 ] Properties of Skorokhod space [ edit ] Generalization of the uniform topology [ edit ] The space C {\displaystyle C} of continuous functions on E {\displaystyle E} is a subspace of D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } . The Skorokhod topology relativized to C {\displaystyle C} coincides with the uniform topology there.

Completeness [ edit ] Although D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } is not a complete space with respect to the Skorokhod metric σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } , there is a topologically equivalent metric σ σ 0 {\displaystyle \sigma _{0}} with respect to which D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } is complete.

[ 4 ] Separability [ edit ] With respect to either σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } or σ σ 0 {\displaystyle \sigma _{0}} , D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } is a separable space . Thus, Skorokhod space is a Polish space .

Tightness in Skorokhod space [ edit ] By an application of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem , one can show that a sequence ( μ μ n ) n = 1 , 2 , … … {\displaystyle (\mu _{n})_{n=1,2,\dots }} of probability measures on Skorokhod space D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } is tight if and only if both the following conditions are met: lim a → → ∞ ∞ lim sup n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ n ( { f ∈ ∈ D | ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ ≥ ≥ a } ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{a\to \infty }\limsup _{n\to \infty }\mu _{n}{\big (}\{f\in \mathbb {D} \;|\;\|f\|\geq a\}{\big )}=0,} and lim δ δ → → 0 lim sup n → → ∞ ∞ μ μ n ( { f ∈ ∈ D | ϖ ϖ f ′ ( δ δ ) ≥ ≥ ε ε } ) = 0 for all ε ε > 0.

{\displaystyle \lim _{\delta \to 0}\limsup _{n\to \infty }\mu _{n}{\big (}\{f\in \mathbb {D} \;|\;\varpi '_{f}(\delta )\geq \varepsilon \}{\big )}=0{\text{ for all }}\varepsilon >0.} Algebraic and topological structure [ edit ] Under the Skorokhod topology and pointwise addition of functions, D {\displaystyle \mathbb {D} } is not a topological group, as can be seen by the following example: Let E = [ 0 , 2 ) {\displaystyle E=[0,2)} be a half-open interval and take f n = χ χ [ 1 − − 1 / n , 2 ) ∈ ∈ D {\displaystyle f_{n}=\chi _{[1-1/n,2)}\in \mathbb {D} } to be a sequence of characteristic functions.
Despite the fact that f n → → χ χ [ 1 , 2 ) {\displaystyle f_{n}\rightarrow \chi _{[1,2)}} in the Skorokhod topology, the sequence f n − − χ χ [ 1 , 2 ) {\displaystyle f_{n}-\chi _{[1,2)}} does not converge to 0.
