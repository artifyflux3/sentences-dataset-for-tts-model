Along with Simon Stevin he experimented on the time taken for lead of different weights to fall to the ground to prove Aristotle wrong in the famous Delft tower experiment .

De Groot was born at Kraayenburg near Delft , son of Hugo Cornelisz and of Elselinge Van Heemskerck, and was possibly educated in the newly created University of Leiden . He also went to the University of Douai and studied arts and philosophy and following the high positions held by the Cornets de Groot family of Rotterdam who were a part of the Delft ruling class, [ 1 ] he became alderman in 1589, a councillor and served as a mayor from 1591 to 1595. He became curator of the Leiden University where he also received a degree in law in 1596, and after 1617 became an advisor to the Count of Hohenlohe . He was involved in the construction of windmills and collaborated with Simon Stevin , [ 2 ] and was well read in the works of Euclid , Ibn al-Haytham and other scholars. He also took an interest in mathematics, translating some of the works of Archimedes from Greek to Dutch. He also wrote some poetry.

[ 3 ] De Groot married Alida Borren in 1582 and they had five children including the jurist Hugo Grotius .
