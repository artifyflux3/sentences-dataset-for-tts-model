163567083 Links Journal homepage Anarchist Studies is a biannual academic journal on anarchism . It takes an interdisciplinary approach, examining the history, culture, and theory of anarchism. The journal was established in 1993 and is edited by Ruth Kinna and published by Lawrence and Wishart .

Overview [ edit ] The journal focusses on three broad themes: the re-evaluation of anarchist history , with regard to issues of culture, philosophy, and political action; the potential future of anarchism as a form of critical political action; and the application of anarchist ideas as an instrument of scholarly research. The journal publishes special issues on topics which have included sexuality , science-fiction , and "anarchism after September 11 ," as well as historical research on Leo Tolstoy , Taoism , John Locke , and post-structuralism . More recently, a central focus of the journal has been anarchism's relation to globalisation .
