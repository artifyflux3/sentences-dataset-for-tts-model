It is a branch of the Liman Current from the Sea of Okhotsk and has a flow rate of about a half knot. The NKCC meets the northward flowing East Korean Warm Current at latitude 37–38° N, causing the flow to separate from the peninsula.

[ 1 ] At about latitude 40° N, the NKCC meets the Tsushima Warm Current .

[ 2 ] The East Korea Warm Current separates from the Tsushima current (4) in a ∩ shape, while the North Korea Cold Current moves eastward to the north of it.as a branch of Liman Current(8).
