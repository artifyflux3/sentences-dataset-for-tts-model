the politician Gustáv Husák of Communist Czechoslovakia which has two different meanings and it was first used by Karol Bacílek to denounce the alleged " bourgeois nationalism " of Husák in the 1950s.

[ 1 ] The later and more frequent use is for the ideology of Husák's "normalization" [ 2 ] and federalism , [ 3 ] the state ideology of Czechoslovakia from about 1969 to 1989, formulated by Husák, Vasil Biľak and others.
