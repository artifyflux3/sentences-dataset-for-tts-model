Von Neumann was twice invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians .

[ 1 ] The May 1958 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society was dedicated as a memorial volume (in an act without precedent) to von Neumann and eight articles were written about him and his work by friends and colleagues.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The National Academy of Sciences published a biographical memoir by Salomon Bochner .

[ 4 ] In addition, obituaries were written in several other journals, including the Journal of the London Mathematical Society , [ 5 ] Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , [ 6 ] Matematikai Lapok , [ 7 ] Physics Today , [ 8 ] Science , [ 9 ] Mathematics of Computation [ 10 ] and The Economic Journal .

[ 11 ] Books, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] scientific papers, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and events have been dedicated to him.

[ 17 ] In honor of his achievements and contributions to the modern world, he was named in 1999 the Financial Times Person of the Century , as a representative of the century's characteristic ideal that the power of the mind could shape the physical world, and of the "intellectual brilliance and human savagery" that defined the 20th century.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] On May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the American Scientists commemorative postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations designed by artist Victor Stabin . The scientists depicted were von Neumann, Barbara McClintock , Josiah Willard Gibbs , and Richard Feynman .

[ 21 ] Other awards and honors he received include the following.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Awards: 1926 Rockefeller Fellowship 1937 Bôcher Memorial Prize , American Mathematical Society 1947 Medal for Merit (Presidential Award) 1947 Distinguished Civilian Service Award , U.S. Navy 1955 Science Award, Air Force Association [ 25 ] 1956 Medal of Freedom (Presidential Award) 1956 Albert Einstein Commemorative Award 1956 Enrico Fermi Award , U.S. Atomic Energy Commission 1957 American Meteorological Society Award for Extraordinary Scientific Accomplishment [ 26 ] [ 27 ] 1997 Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Award (Posthumous) [ 28 ] 1997 Hall of Fame, Space Command Headquarters, Peterson Air Force Base (Posthumous) [ 29 ] Honorary societies: Academia Nacional de Ciencias Exactas, Lima, Peru Academia Nazionale dei Lincei , Rome, Italy American Academy of Arts and Sciences American Philosophical Society Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere , Milan, Italy National Academy of Sciences Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and Letters , Amsterdam, Netherlands Honorary doctorates: 1947 Princeton University 1949 University of Pennsylvania 1949 Harvard University 1952 University of Istanbul 1952 Case Institute of Technology 1952 University of Maryland 1953 Polytechnics Institut , Munich 1954 Columbia University Honorary positions: 1937 American Mathematical Society Colloquium Lecturer 1944 Gibbs Lecturer , American Mathematical Society 1951-1953 President, American Mathematical Society 1953 Vanuxem Lecturer, Princeton University 1950-1957 Member, board of advisors, Universidad de Los Andes , Colombia See also [ edit ] List of things named after John von Neumann References [ edit ] ^ O'Connor, J.
