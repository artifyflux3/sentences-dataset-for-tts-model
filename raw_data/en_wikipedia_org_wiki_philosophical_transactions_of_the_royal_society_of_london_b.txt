History [ edit ] Title page of the first volume published in 1665 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society was established in 1665 by the Royal Society and is the oldest scientific journal in the English-speaking world.

[ 1 ] Henry Oldenburg was appointed as the first (joint) secretary to the society and he was also the first editor of the society's journal. In 1887 the journal expanded to become two separate publications, one serving the physical sciences , Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences , and the other focusing on the life sciences , Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences . Nowadays, both journals publish themed issues and discussion meeting issues, while individual research articles are published in the sister journal Proceedings of the Royal Society .

The journal celebrated its 350th anniversary in 2015. To commemorate this event it published a special collection [ 2 ] of commentaries on landmark papers from the archive by scientists such as Antonie van Leeuwenhoek , Hans Sloane and Alan Turing .
