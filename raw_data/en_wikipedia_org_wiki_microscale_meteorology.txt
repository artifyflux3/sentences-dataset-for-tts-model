[ 1 ] [ 2 ] These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as "mesoscale and microscale meteorology" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale ; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a standard weather map . These include small and generally fleeting cloud "puffs" and other small cloud features.

[ 3 ] Microscale meteorology controls the most important mixing and dilution processes in the atmosphere.

[ 4 ] Important topics in microscale meteorology include heat transfer and gas exchange between soil, vegetation, and/or surface water and the atmosphere caused by near-ground turbulence .  Measuring these transport processes involves use of micrometeorological (or flux) towers. Variables often measured or derived include net radiation , sensible heat flux, latent heat flux , ground heat storage, and fluxes of trace gases important to the atmosphere , biosphere , and hydrosphere .

A micronet is an atmospheric and/or environmental observation network, composed of automated weather stations , used to monitor microscale phenomena. Micronets are sometimes considered a subtype of mesonet , and many micronets are a denser spatial resolution sub-network of a mesonet.
