It is usually applied to gases : a monatomic gas is a gas in which atoms are not bound to each other. Examples at standard conditions of temperature and pressure include all the noble gases ( helium , neon , argon , krypton , xenon , and radon ), though all chemical elements will be monatomic in the gas phase at sufficiently high temperature (or very low pressure). The thermodynamic behavior of a monatomic gas is much simpler when compared to polyatomic gases because it is free of any rotational or vibrational energy .

[ 1 ] Noble gases [ edit ] The only chemical elements that are stable single atoms (so they are not molecules ) at standard temperature and pressure (STP) are the noble gases .  These are helium , neon , argon , krypton , xenon , and radon . Noble gases have a full outer valence shell making them rather non-reactive species.

[ 2 ] While these elements have been described historically as completely inert, chemical compounds have been synthesized with all but neon and helium.

[ 3 ] When grouped together with the homonuclear diatomic gases such as nitrogen (N 2 ), the noble gases are called "elemental gases" to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds .

Thermodynamic properties [ edit ] The only possible motion of an atom in a monatomic gas is translation (electronic excitation is not important at room temperature). Thus by the equipartition theorem , the kinetic energy of a single atom of a monatomic gas at thermodynamic temperature T is given by 3 2 k B T {\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}k_{\text{B}}T} , where k B is the Boltzmann constant . One mole of atoms contains an Avogadro number ( N A {\displaystyle N_{\text{A}}} ) of atoms, so that the energy of one mole of atoms of a monatomic gas is 3 2 k B T N A = 3 2 R T {\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}k_{\text{B}}TN_{\text{A}}={\frac {3}{2}}RT} , where R is the gas constant .

In an adiabatic process , monatomic gases have an idealised γ -factor ( C p / C v ) of 5/3, as opposed to 7/5 for ideal diatomic gases where rotation (but not vibration at room temperature) also contributes. Also, for ideal monatomic gases: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the molar heat capacity at constant pressure ( C p ) is 5/2 R = 20.8 J⋅K −1 ⋅mol −1 (4.97 cal ⋅K −1 ⋅mol −1 ).

the molar heat capacity at constant volume ( C v ) is 3/2 R = 12.5 J⋅K −1 ⋅mol −1 (2.98 cal⋅K −1 ⋅mol −1 ).
