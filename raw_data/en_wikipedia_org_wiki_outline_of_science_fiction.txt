Paul , of inventor Nikola Tesla 's speculative vision of a future war.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to science fiction: Science fiction – a genre of fiction dealing with the impact of imagined innovations in science or technology, often in a futuristic setting.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Exploring the consequences of such innovations is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a "literature of ideas".

[ 4 ] What is science fiction?

[ edit ] Main article: Science fiction Definitions of science fiction : Science fiction includes such a wide range of themes and subgenres that it is notoriously difficult to define.

[ 5 ] Accordingly, there have been many definitions offered. Another challenge is that there is disagreement over where to draw the boundaries between science fiction and related genres.

Science fiction is a type of: Fiction – form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rather, imaginary and invented by its author(s). Although fiction often describes a major branch of literary work, it is also applied to theatrical, cinematic, and musical work.

Genre fiction – fictional works (novels, short stories) written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre. Also known as popular fiction.

Speculative fiction Genre – science fiction is a genre of fiction.

Genres [ edit ] Further information: Category:Science fiction genres Science fiction genre – while science fiction is a genre of fiction, a science fiction genre is a subgenre within science fiction. Science fiction may be divided along any number of overlapping axes. Gary K. Wolfe's Critical Terms for Science Fiction and Fantasy identifies over 30 subdivisions of science fiction, not including science fantasy (which is a mixed genre ).

Science [ edit ] Genres concerning the emphasis, accuracy, and type of science described include: Hard science fiction —a particular emphasis on scientific detail and/or accuracy.

Mundane science fiction —a subgenre of hard sci-fi which sets stories on Earth or the Solar System using current or plausible technology.

Soft science fiction —often exploring psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science, focus on human characters and their relations and feelings. Emphasizes social sciences while de-emphasizing the details of technological hardware and physical laws. In some cases, science and technology are depicted without much concern for accuracy.

Characteristics [ edit ] Main article: List of science fiction themes Themes related to science, technology, space and the future, as well as characteristic plots or settings include: Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction — set during or after the collapse of civilization, often dealing with survival in harsh environments.

Biopunk — centered around biotechnology and genetic engineering in general, biopunk uses some both (post)cyberpunk elements and post-modernist prose to describe a typically dystopian world of biohackers , man-made viruses, mutations, designer babies , artificial life forms , bio-genetic engineered human-animal hybrids and bio-genetically manipulated humans .

Cyberpunk — Dystopian futures with a focus on technology, hacking, and cybernetics, often exploring the impact of these technologies on society. Uses elements from the hard-boiled detective novel, film noir , Japanese anime , and post-modernist prose to describe the nihilistic, underground side of a cybernetic society Climate fiction — emphasizes effects of anthropogenic climate change and global warming at the end of the Holocene era Utopian and dystopian fiction — Utopian set in societies that have agreeable features exploring themes of freedom. Dystopian set in oppressive, controlled societies, often exploring themes of totalitarianism or societal collapse.

Dying Earth science fiction Military science fiction — focuses on armed conflicts, space warfare, and military themes in futuristic or interstellar settings Steampunk — denotes works set in (or strongly inspired by) an era when steam power was still widely used  — usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian England — though with otherwise retro-futuristic inventions, advanced technology or other science fiction elements Time travel — involving traveling to the past or future, often focusing on the paradoxes and consequences.

Space colonization Space opera — Adventures set in space, emphasizes romantic adventure, exotic settings, and larger-than-life characters, may involve large-scale conflict or galaxy-spanning narratives Social science fiction — concerned less with technology and more with sociological speculation about human society Mundane science fiction Movements [ edit ] Genres concerning politics, philosophy, and identity movements include: Christian science fiction Feminist science fiction LGBT themes in speculative fiction Libertarian science fiction Eras [ edit ] Genres concerning the historical era of creation and publication include: Scientific romance — an archaic name for what is now known as the science fiction genre, mostly associated with the early science fiction of the United Kingdom.

Pulp science fiction Golden Age of Science Fiction — a period of the 1940s during which the science fiction genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published.

New Wave science fiction — characterised by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content.

Cyberpunk — noted for its focus on "high tech, low life" and taking its name from the combination of cybernetics and punk.

Combinations [ edit ] Main articles: Genre fiction and Mixed genre Genres that combine two different fiction genres or use a different fiction genre's mood or style include: Alternate history science fiction—fiction set in a world in which history has diverged from history as it is generally known Comic science fiction Science fiction erotica Adventure science fiction—science fiction adventure is similar to many genres Gothic science fiction —a subgenre of science fiction that involves gothic conventions New Wave science fiction —characterized by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content Science fantasy —a mixed genre of story which contains some science fiction and some fantasy elements Science fiction opera —a mixture of opera and science fiction involving empathic themes Science fiction romance —fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and romance genres Science fiction mystery —fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and mystery genres, encompassing Occult detective fiction and science fiction detectives Science fiction Western —fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and Western genres Space Western —a subgenre of science fiction that transposes themes of American Western books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers.
