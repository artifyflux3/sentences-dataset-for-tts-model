_**Sovereign**_ is a [title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial,_royal_and_noble_ranks "Imperial, royal and noble ranks") that can be applied to the highest leader in various categories. The word is borrowed from [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French")_souverain_, which is ultimately derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_superānus_, meaning 'above'.

The roles of a sovereign vary from [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch"), ruler or [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state") to head of municipal government or head of a chivalric order. As a result, the word _sovereignty_ has more recently also come to mean independence or autonomy.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-1)

[Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II "Queen Elizabeth II") was the sovereign of [32 independent realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_headed_by_Elizabeth_II "List of sovereign states headed by Elizabeth II") over the course of her reign, with her role in each realm separate and legally distinct.

The word _sovereign_ is frequently used synonymously with [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch"). There are [numerous titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks#Sovereign "Royal and noble ranks") in a monarchical rule which can belong to the sovereign. The sovereign is the autonomous head of the state. Examples of the various titles in modern sovereign leaders are:

In some settings the use of the words _Sovereign lady_ (sometimes with a capital _L_ in _lady_) have been used referring to female sovereigns, notably in [Charles III's proclamation of accession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_accession_of_Charles_III "Proclamation of accession of Charles III").

The term _sovereign_ is generally used in place of "grand master" for the supreme head of various orders of [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") nations. In the [Sovereign Military Order of Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta "Sovereign Military Order of Malta"), the Grand Master is styled "Sovereign", e.g. Sovereign Grand Master, due to its status as an internationally independent sovereign entity. Examples of the Sovereign of a chivalric order are:

Municipal government
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sovereign&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Municipal government")]

As chief officer of municipal government, _the sovereign_ had duties and responsibilities deriving from the charter which established the local town borough or council. This was commonly used throughout [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland"). This usage was less common in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and occasionally meant a [Marcher Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcher_Lord "Marcher Lord").

The candidate for this position was elected by the freemen and burgesses of the town, borough and city councils and had to be a [burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_(title) "Burgess (title)") himself. And in later years he also had to be approved by the patron.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-First_report-3) The level of responsibility ranged from enacting by-laws about tolls up to the death penalty. Some charters established the sovereign as the local [magistrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate "Magistrate") or [justice of the peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace "Justice of the peace"). The office generally had no salary though some patrons provided a stipend to the sovereign in their borough.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-First_report-3) In some localities the sovereign was appointed directly by the patron of the borough which allowed him to influence the election of the local MP. Once the parliamentary franchise was lost with the [Acts of Union 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800 "Acts of Union 1800"), the role became largely ceremonial or forgotten.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-Britain1840-5)

The title of the chief officer of a city council has become known as a [mayor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor "Mayor"). In some municipal boroughs the titles borough master or [Burgomaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgomaster "Burgomaster"), [bailiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailiff "Bailiff"), [portreeve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portreeve "Portreeve"), [warden](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/warden "wikt:warden") and [provost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(civil) "Provost (civil)") were used interchangeably with mayor and sovereign.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-Britain1840-5)

Ireland had established self-governing municipal boroughs which gave a city-state status to the locality in existence since the Norman conquest. These were most typically in the denser populated provinces of [Munster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster "Munster") and [Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster "Leinster"). The provision of the borough and the corporation was established through a charter, the granting of which was known as incorporation. Freemen and burgesses were the usual governing members of the council and elected their chief officer, the Sovereign. In earlier incarnations the council also managed the law court known as the "hundred court" and dealt with local administrative and legal business. Boroughs also elected the local MP. Positions on the council were predominantly from among the wealthy and related families in the area.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-borough-6)

The first mention of the sovereign in [Kilkenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny "Kilkenny") dates from 1231. The _Liber Primus Kilkenniensis_ is a contemporaneously written account of the proceedings of Kilkenny municipality beginning in 1230 and running to 1538.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-7) Attempts have been made to identify the names of Kilkenny's sovereigns and currently there is a list of the names of 244 sovereigns from 1282 to 1608. At that point a new charter was established for the town and in 1609 the first mayor of the City of Kilkenny is elected.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-Kilkenny-8)

Early Irish borough had a city-state status; however, with the unification of Ireland under the crown in 1603 they were transformed into more ordinary municipal towns on the English model. Part of this was to reduce the autonomy of the Irish borough and partly to establish the new rules by which the planted towns of Ireland were to operate. Since the MPs to the Irish parliament were elected by the borough council, and to prevent a Catholic majority there, additional boroughs were created in areas with a strong Protestant base. A direct result of this was the Protestant majority of 232 to 100 in the 1613 House of Commons. The new charters placed the government of the borough with the Sovereign and twelve chief burgesses, who are to elect all the rest and stipulated that all had to conform to the established church by taking the Oath of Supremacy.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-gerrymander-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-Lewis1995-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-MerewetherStephens1835-11)

[Sir John Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Davies "Sir John Davies"), [Attorney General for Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_for_Ireland "Attorney General for Ireland"), wrote "the newly erected boroughs ... will be perpetual seminaries of Protestant burgesses".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-gerrymander-9)

Historically the number of boroughs varied considerably. There were 117 boroughs in Ireland from 1685 to 1800. Prior to the passing of the [Municipal Corporations Act 1835](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835 "Municipal Corporations Act 1835"), there were sixty-eight borough corporations in Ireland.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-gerrymander-9) As each of the changes and new charters were brought in and with the loss of the parliamentary franchise, sovereigns became less powerful and more ceremonial.

There is a sailing race held in [Kinsale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsale "Kinsale") which references back to the chief officer of the town council. When looking to name a new trophy the local yacht club discovered that the 'Sovereign of Kinsale' used to put up a trophy for a sailing race in the late 1700s.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-12) The result is that the race and trophy today is known as The Sovereign's cup.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-13) Kinsale had been given its charter to set up a borough led by a Sovereign around 1319.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign#cite_note-Lewis1995-10)
