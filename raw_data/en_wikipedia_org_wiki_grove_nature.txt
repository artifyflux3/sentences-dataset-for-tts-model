Other words for groups of trees include woodland , woodlot , thicket , and stand .

( February 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The main meaning of grove is a group of trees that grow close together, generally without many bushes or other plants underneath. It is an old word in the English language, with records of its use dating as far back as the late 9th century as Old English grāf , grāfa ('grove; copse') and subsequently Middle English grove , grave ; these derive from Proto-West Germanic *graib , *graibō ('branch, group of branches, thicket'), from Proto-Germanic *graibaz, *graibô ('branch, fork').

It is related to Old English grǣf , grǣfe ('brushwood; thicket; copse'), Old English grǣfa ('thicket'), dialectal Norwegian greive ('ram with splayed horns'), dialectal Norwegian greivlar ('ramifications of an antler'), dialectal Norwegian grivla ('to branch, branch out'), Old Norse grein ('twig, branch, limb'), and cognate with modern English greave .

( February 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Naturally occurring groves are typically small, perhaps a few acres at most. In contrast, orchards , which are normally intentional planting of trees, may be small or very large, like the apple orchards in Washington state , and orange groves in Florida .

Cultural significance [ edit ] A mango grove in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija , Philippines.

Historically, groves were considered sacred in pagan, pre-Christian Germanic and Celtic cultures . Helen F. Leslie-Jacobsen argues that "we can assume that sacred groves actually existed due to repeated mentions in historiographical and ethnographical accounts. e.g.

Tacitus , Germania ."
