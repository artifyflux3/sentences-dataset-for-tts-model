Language English Website smithsonianmag .com ISSN 0037-7333 OCLC 1359769 Smithsonian is a magazine covering science, history, art, popular culture and innovation.

[ 2 ] The first issue was published in 1970.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The history of Smithsonian began when Edward K. Thompson , the retired editor of Life magazine, was asked by then-Secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley , to produce a magazine "about things in which the Smithsonian [Institution] is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested." [ 4 ] Thompson later recalled that his philosophy for the new magazine was that it "would stir curiosity in already receptive minds. It would deal with history as it is relevant to the present. It would present art, since true art is never dated, in the richest possible reproduction. It would peer into the future via coverage of social progress and of science and technology. Technical matters would be digested and made intelligible by skilled writers who would stimulate readers to reach upward while not turning them off with jargon. We would find the best writers and the best photographers—not unlike the best of the old Life ." [ 4 ] In 1973, the magazine turned a profit for the first time. By 1974, circulation had nearly quadrupled, to 635,000, and it reached the one million milestone in 1975—one of the most successful launches of its time. In 1980, Thompson was replaced by Don Moser, who had also worked at Life , and circulation reached upwards of two million, in turn, by Carey Winfrey upon his retirement in 2001.

Michael Caruso succeeded Carey Winfrey in 2011, and served as editor-in-chief until 2019.

[ 5 ] Since that time Debra Rosenberg and Terence Monmaney have been editors.

[ 6 ] Events held [ edit ] Smithsonian American Ingenuity Awards [ edit ] From 2012 until 2019, the magazine sponsored the American Ingenuity Awards, a recognition of innovation in the arts, sciences and technology. Winners have included Bryan Stevenson , Elon Musk , Lin-Manuel Miranda , OK Go , John Krasinski , Dave Eggers , Aziz Ansari , Rosanne Cash , Jeff Bezos , Fred Armisen , Bill Hader and David Lynch .

Presenters have included Stephen Hawking (twice), Stephen Colbert , David Byrne , Herbie Hancock , Erin Brockovich , Ruben Blades , Bill Nye , Art Spiegelman , and Senator Al Franken . The American Ingenuity Award was created by the artist Jeff Koons .

[ 7 ] Museum Day [ edit ] "Museum Day" redirects here; not to be confused with International Museum Day .

Smithsonian arranged Museum Day , alternatively Smithsonian Day , when museums in all 50 U.S. states offered limited free admission. In 2018, over 1,400 museums participated.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The offer included a free admission for the ticket holder plus one guest and this ticket was specific to the chosen museum only.

[ 11 ] The intention was for one ticket per person in contrast to the International Museum Day , when participating museums generally offer entirely free admission throughout the day.

In 2023 and 2024, the event was cancelled with no further explanation.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] As of 2025 [update] the web landing page redirects to the home page of the museum.
