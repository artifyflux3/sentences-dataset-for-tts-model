**Sir William Rowan Hamilton** (4 August 1805 – 2 September 1865)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-2) was an Irish [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist"), and [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") who made numerous major contributions to [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra"), [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"). His theoretical works and mathematical equations are considered fundamental to modern [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"), particularly [his reformulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") of [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics"). His career included the analysis of [geometrical optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics "Geometrical optics"), [Fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis "Fourier analysis"), and [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions "Quaternions"), the last of which made him one of the founders of modern [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3)

Hamilton was [Andrews Professor of Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews_Professor_of_Astronomy "Andrews Professor of Astronomy") at [Trinity College Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin "Trinity College Dublin"). He was also the third director of [Dunsink Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsink_Observatory "Dunsink Observatory") from 1827 to 1865. The [Hamilton Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Institute "Hamilton Institute") at [Maynooth University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynooth_University "Maynooth University") is named after him. He received the [Cunningham Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunningham_Medal "Cunningham Medal") twice, in 1834 and 1848, and the [Royal Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Medal "Royal Medal") in 1835.

He remains arguably the most influential Irish physicist, along with [Ernest Walton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Walton "Ernest Walton"). Since his death, Hamilton has been commemorated throughout the country, with several institutions, streets, monuments and stamps bearing his name.

Hamilton was the fourth of nine children born to Sarah Hutton (1780–1817) and Archibald Hamilton (1778–1819), who lived in Dublin at 29 [Dominick Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominick_Street,_Dublin "Dominick Street, Dublin"), later renumbered to 36. Hamilton's father, who was from Dublin, worked as a solicitor. By the age of three, Hamilton had been sent to live with his uncle James Hamilton, a graduate of [Trinity College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin "Trinity College Dublin") who ran a school in Talbots Castle in [Trim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim,_County_Meath "Trim, County Meath"), County Meath.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-4)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3)

Hamilton is said to have shown talent at an early age. His uncle observed that Hamilton, from a young age, had displayed an uncanny ability to acquire languages — a claim which has been disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a basic understanding of them.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 207  At the age of seven, he had already made progress in [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), and before he was 13, he had acquired, under the care of his uncle, a dozen languages: classical and modern European languages, [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"), [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), [Hindustani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language "Hindustani language"), [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"), [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language "Marathi language") and [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language "Malay language").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6) The emphasis of Hamilton's early education on languages is attributed to the wish of his father to see him employed by the [British East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East India Company").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-DNB-7)

An expert [mental calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculation "Mental calculation"), the young Hamilton was capable of working out some calculations to many decimal places. In September 1813, the American calculating [prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy "Child prodigy")[Zerah Colburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerah_Colburn_(mental_calculator) "Zerah Colburn (mental calculator)") was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was 9, a year older than Hamilton. The two were pitted against each other in a mental arithmetic contest, with Colburn emerging as the clear victor.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 208

In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton spent less time studying languages, and more on mathematics.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-mactutor-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Graves1842-9) At age ten, he stumbled across a [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") copy of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"); and at twelve he studied [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s _[Arithmetica Universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetica\_Universalis "Arithmetica Universalis")_. By age 16, he had covered much of the _[Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophiae\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_, as well as some more recent works on [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") and [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6)

In mid-1822, Hamilton began a systematic study of [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace "Laplace")'s _[Mécanique Céleste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9\_de\_m%C3%A9canique\_c%C3%A9leste "Traité de mécanique céleste")_. During this period, he encountered what he believed to be a logical error in _Mécanique Céleste_, an observation which led Hamilton to be introduced to [John Brinkley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brinkley_(astronomer) "John Brinkley (astronomer)"), then Royal Astronomer of Ireland.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-DNB-7) In November and December of 1822, he completed his first three original mathematical papers. On his first visit to Dunsink Observatory, he showed two of them to Brinkley, who requested that the papers be developed further. Hamilton complied, and early in 1823, Brinkley approved the amended version.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-10) In July of 1823, Hamilton earned a place at [Trinity College Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin "Trinity College Dublin") by examination, at age 17. His tutor there was [Charles Boyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Boyton&action=edit&redlink=1 "Charles Boyton (page does not exist)"), a family friend,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3) who brought to his attention the contemporary mathematics published by the group at the [École Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique "École Polytechnique") in Paris.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-11) John Brinkley remarked of the precocious Hamilton, "This young man, I do not say _will be_, but _is_, the first mathematician of his age."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-12)

The college awarded Hamilton two _optime_ s, or off-the-chart grades, in [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language") and in physics. He was first in every subject and at every examination. He aimed to win a Trinity College fellowship by competitive examination,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3) but this did not happen. Instead, after Brinkley in 1826 was made [Bishop of Cloyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Cloyne "Bishop of Cloyne"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-13) Hamilton was appointed in 1827 to the vacant posts left by Brinkley's departure, Andrews Professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ireland.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 209  Despite having his undergraduate career cut short in this way, he earned degrees in both classics and mathematics (BA in 1827, MA in 1837).

### Personal life and poetry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Rowan_Hamilton&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Personal life and poetry")]

In 1824, Hamilton was introduced at [Edgeworthstown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgeworthstown "Edgeworthstown") to the novelist [Maria Edgeworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Edgeworth "Maria Edgeworth"), by the Rev. [Richard Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Butler_(Irish_priest) "Richard Butler (Irish priest)"), the vicar of [Trim, County Meath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim,_County_Meath "Trim, County Meath") to whom his uncle James Hamilton was curate.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-alox-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 5, 34  During the same period, his uncle introduced him to the Disney family at [Summerhill House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhill_House "Summerhill House"), County Meath. The Disney sons attended Trinity College, and Hamilton had friends among them. At Summerhill, he met Catherine Disney, their sister.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 37 [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Brown-16)

Hamilton was attracted to Catherine Disney, but her family did not approve and Catherine was required to marry the Rev. William Barlow, a brother of her elder sister's husband. The wedding took place in 1825.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 109, 113  Hamilton wrote in 1826 about his feelings for her in an extended poem, "The Enthusiast". Over twenty years later, in 1847, he confided in [John Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel "John Herschel") that during this period he might have become a poet.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Brown-16)

In 1825, Hamilton met [Arabella Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabella_Lawrence_(educator) "Arabella Lawrence (educator)"), younger sister of [Sarah Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Lawrence_(educator) "Sarah Lawrence (educator)"), a significant correspondent and frank critic of his poetry. It was a contact he made through Maria Edgeworth's circle.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 26 [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-17)

At Dunsink Observatory
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Rowan_Hamilton&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: At Dunsink Observatory")]

Hamilton, now Royal Astronomer of Ireland, took up residence at [Dunsink Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsink_Observatory "Dunsink Observatory") where he spent the rest of his life.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-mactutor-8) He was there from 1827 until his death in 1865.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-18) In his early years at Dunsink, he observed the heavens quite regularly;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-19) He left routine observation to his assistant Charles Thompson.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-21) His sisters also supported the observatory's work.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3)

The introductory lectures by Hamilton in astronomy were celebrated; in addition to his students, they attracted scholars, poets, and women.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-22)[Felicia Hemans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_Hemans "Felicia Hemans") wrote her poem _The Prayer of the Lonely Student_ after hearing one of his lectures.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-23)

### Personal life, travel and poetic visits

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Rowan_Hamilton&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Personal life, travel and poetic visits")]

Hamilton invited his four sisters to come and live at the observatory in 1827, and they ran the household until his marriage in 1833. They included [Eliza Mary Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Mary_Hamilton "Eliza Mary Hamilton") (1807–1851), the poet.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3) In 1827, Hamilton wrote to his sister Grace about "some of" the Lawrence sisters having met his sister Eliza in Dublin.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-25)

Newly appointed to the Observatory, Hamilton set off on a tour in Ireland and England with [Alexander Nimmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nimmo "Alexander Nimmo"), who was coaching him on [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-26) One call was to Sarah Lawrence's school at [Gateacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateacre "Gateacre"), near Liverpool, where Hamilton had a chance to assess the calculator Master Noakes.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-27) They visited [William Wordsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth "William Wordsworth") at [Rydal Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydal_Mount "Rydal Mount") in September of that year, where the writer [Caesar Otway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Otway "Caesar Otway") was also present.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Barker_2001-29): 410  After the visit, Hamilton sent numerous poems to Wordsworth, becoming a "poetic disciple".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-30)

When Wordsworth visited Dublin in the summer of 1829, in a party with [John Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_(industrialist) "John Marshall (industrialist)") and his family, he stayed at Dunsink with Hamilton.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Barker_2001-29): 411  On a second tour in England with Nimmo in 1831, Hamilton parted from him at [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), to visit the Lawrence sisters and family on his mother's side in the Liverpool area. They met up again in the [Lake District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District "Lake District"), where they climbed [Helvellyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvellyn "Helvellyn") and had tea with Wordsworth. Hamilton returned to Dublin, via Edinburgh and Glasgow.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-31)

Hamilton visited [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge "Samuel Taylor Coleridge") at [Highgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highgate "Highgate"), in 1832, helped by an unexpected letter of introduction given to him by Sarah Lawrence on a visit to Liverpool in March of that year. He also paid a call, with Arabella, on the family of [William Roscoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roscoe "William Roscoe"), who had died in 1831.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-33)

He was a Christian, described as "a lover of the Bible, an orthodox and attached member of the Established Church", and as having a "profound conviction of the truth of revealed religion".[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-36)

While attending Trinity College, Hamilton proposed to his friend's sister, whose refusal drove the young Hamilton to depression and illness, even to the verge of suicide.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno-37) He proposed again in 1831 to Ellen de Vere, a sister of the poet [Aubrey De Vere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Thomas_de_Vere "Aubrey Thomas de Vere"), who declined as well.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno-37) Hamilton eventually married Helen Marie Bayly in 1833,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno-37) a country preacher's daughter, and had three children with her: [William Edwin Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edwin_Hamilton "William Edwin Hamilton") (born 1834), Archibald Henry (born 1835), and Helen Elizabeth (born 1840).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-38) Hamilton's married life turned out to be difficult and unhappy as Bayly proved to be pious, timid, and chronically ill.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno-37)

Hamilton retained his faculties unimpaired to the last, and continued the task of finishing the _Elements of Quaternions_ which had occupied the last six years of his life. He died on 2 September 1865, following a severe attack of [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout "Gout").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-39) He is buried in [Mount Jerome Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Jerome_Cemetery "Mount Jerome Cemetery") in Dublin.

Hamilton made outstanding contributions to [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics").

His first discovery was in an early paper that he communicated in 1823 to John Brinkley, who presented it under the title of _Caustics_ in 1824 to the [Royal Irish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy "Royal Irish Academy"). It was referred as usual to a committee, which recommended further development and simplification before publication. Between 1825 and 1828 the paper was expanded, and became a clearer exposition of a novel method.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6) Over this period, Hamilton gained an appreciation for the nature and importance of optics.

In 1827, Hamilton presented a theory of a single function, now known as [Hamilton's principal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principal_function "Hamilton's principal function"), that brings together mechanics and optical theory. It helped to establish the foundations of the [wave theory of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_theory_of_light "Wave theory of light") in [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"). He proposed it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his _Systems of Rays_, read in 1832.

The Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled _Theory of Systems of Rays_ (23 April 1827), and the first part was printed in 1828 in the _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_. The more important contents of the second and third parts appeared in the three voluminous supplements (to the first part) which were published in the same Transactions, and in the two papers _On a General Method in Dynamics_, which appeared in the _Philosophical Transactions_ in 1834 and 1835. In these papers, Hamilton developed his central principle of "Varying Action".

A result of this work is a prediction for transparent biaxial crystals (i.e. [monoclinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclinic_crystal_system "Monoclinic crystal system"), [orthorhombic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthorhombic_crystal_system "Orthorhombic crystal system") or [triclinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclinic_crystal_system "Triclinic crystal system") crystals).[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-40) A ray of light entering such a crystal at a certain angle would emerge as a hollow cone of rays. This discovery was known as [conical refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_refraction "Conical refraction").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6) Hamilton found it from the geometry of the [wave surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_surface "Wave surface") introduced by [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel"), which has [singular point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics) "Singularity (mathematics)").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-41) There is a basic mathematical explanation of the phenomenon, namely that the wave surface is not the boundary of a convex body. A fuller understanding awaited the [microlocal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlocal_analysis "Microlocal analysis") of the middle of the 20th century,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-42)

The step from optics to dynamics in the application of the method of "Varying Action" was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose _[Philosophical Transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical\_Transactions "Philosophical Transactions")_ for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject.

### Context and importance of the work

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Rowan_Hamilton&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Context and importance of the work")]

[Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") was a powerful new technique for working with [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion"). Hamilton's advances enlarged the class of mechanical problems that could be solved. His principle of "Varying Action" was based on the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"), in the general class of problems included under the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action "Principle of least action") which had been studied earlier by [Pierre Louis Maupertuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maupertuis "Maupertuis"), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler "Euler"), [Joseph Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange") and others. Hamilton's analysis uncovered a deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular a symmetry between momentum and position. The credit for discovering what are now called the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory) "Lagrangian (field theory)") and [Lagrange's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_equations "Lagrange's equations") also belongs to Hamilton.

Both the [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and Hamiltonian approaches have proven important in the study of continuous classical systems in physics, and quantum mechanical systems: the techniques find use in [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [relativity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory "Relativity theory") and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). In the _[Dictionary of Irish Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary\_of\_Irish\_Biography "Dictionary of Irish Biography")_[David Spearman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spearman "David Spearman") writes:[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-43)

> The formulation that he devised for classical mechanics proved to be equally suited to quantum theory, whose development it facilitated. The Hamiltonian formalism shows no signs of obsolescence; new ideas continue to find this the most natural medium for their description and development, and the function that is now universally known as the Hamiltonian, is the starting point for calculation in almost any area of physics.

Many scientists, including [Liouville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Liouville "Joseph Liouville"), [Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._G._J._Jacobi "C. G. J. Jacobi"), [Darboux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Gaston_Darboux "Jean Gaston Darboux"), [Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré"), [Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov "Kolmogorov"), [Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine")[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-44) and [Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._I._Arnold "V. I. Arnold"), have extended Hamilton's work, in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") and [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-45)

Hamilton's [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical "Mathematical") studies seem to have been undertaken and carried to their full development without collaboration, and his writings do not belong to any particular school. He was intended by the university authorities who elected him to the Professorship of Astronomy to spend his time as he best could for the advancement of science, without restrictions.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6)

Quaternion Plaque on [Broom Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge "Broom Bridge") in Dublin

Hamilton made his discovery of the algebra of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") in 1843.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 210  Among much prior related work, in 1840 [Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olinde_Rodrigues "Olinde Rodrigues") had reached a result that amounted to their discovery in all but name.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-46)

Hamilton was looking for ways of extending [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") (which can be viewed as [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") on a 2-dimensional [Argand diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argand_diagram "Argand diagram")) to higher spatial dimensions. In working with four dimensions, rather than three, he created quaternion algebra. According to Hamilton, on 16 October he was out walking along the [Royal Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canal "Royal Canal") in Dublin with his wife when the solution in the form of the equation

_i_ 2 = _j_ 2 = _k_ 2 = _ijk_ = −1
occurred to him; Hamilton then carved this equation using his penknife into the side of the nearby [Broom Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge "Broom Bridge") (which Hamilton called Brougham Bridge).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 210

The quaternions involved abandoning the [commutative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_law "Commutative law"), a radical step for the time. In the context of this prototype [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), Hamilton also introduced the cross and dot products of vector algebra, the quaternion product being the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") minus the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") as [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"). Hamilton also described a quaternion as an ordered four-element multiple of real numbers, and described the first element as the "scalar" part, and the remaining three as the "vector" part. He coined the [neologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") "tensor" and "scalar", and was the first to use the word "vector" in the modern sense.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-47)

### Other mathematical works

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Rowan_Hamilton&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Other mathematical works")]

Hamilton looked into the [solution of the quintic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_of_the_quintic "Solution of the quintic") in the [theory of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_equations "Theory of equations"), examining the results arrived at by [Niels Henrik Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel "Niels Henrik Abel"), [George Jerrard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Jerrard "George Jerrard") and others in their respective research. There is Hamilton's paper on fluctuating functions in [Fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis "Fourier analysis"), and the invention of the [hodograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodograph "Hodograph"). Of his investigations into the solutions, especially by [numerical approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_approximation "Numerical approximation"), of certain classes of physically important differential equations, only parts were published, at intervals, in the _[Philosophical Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical\_Magazine "Philosophical Magazine")_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-EB1911-6)

Hamilton also introduced the [icosian game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosian_game "Icosian game") or _Hamilton's puzzle_ in 1856. It is based on the concept of a [Hamiltonian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path "Hamiltonian path") in [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-ODNB-3)

Hamilton introduced, as a method of analysis, both quaternions and [biquaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biquaternion "Biquaternion"), the extension to eight dimensions by the introduction of complex number [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient"). When his work was assembled in 1853, the book _Lectures on Quaternions_ had "formed the subject of successive courses of lectures, delivered in 1848 and subsequent years, in the Halls of Trinity College, Dublin". Hamilton confidently declared that quaternions would be found to have a powerful influence as an instrument of research.

When he died, Hamilton was working on a definitive statement of quaternion science. His son [William Edwin Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edwin_Hamilton "William Edwin Hamilton") brought the _Elements of Quaternions_, a hefty volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866. As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by [Charles Jasper Joly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Jasper_Joly "Charles Jasper Joly"), when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing in 1899 and the second in 1901. The subject index and footnotes in this second edition improved the _Elements_ accessibility.

Hamilton was twice awarded the [Cunningham Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunningham_Medal "Cunningham Medal") of the [Royal Irish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy "Royal Irish Academy").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-48) The first award, in 1834, was for his work on conical refraction, for which he also received the [Royal Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Medal "Royal Medal") of the Royal Society the following year.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-49) He was to win it again in 1848.

In 1835, being secretary to the meeting of the [British Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "British Association for the Advancement of Science") which was held that year in Dublin, Hamilton was [knighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight") by the [lord-lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland "Lord Lieutenant of Ireland"). Other honours rapidly succeeded, among which his election in 1837 to the president's chair in the [Royal Irish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy "Royal Irish Academy"), and the rare distinction of being made a corresponding member of the [Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Academy_of_Sciences "Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences"). Later, in 1864, the newly established [United States National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences "United States National Academy of Sciences") elected its first Foreign Associates, and decided to put Hamilton's name on top of their list.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-50)

A plaque under the Broom Bridge, associated with the discovery of quaternions, was unveiled by [Éamon de Valera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera "Éamon de Valera") on 13 November 1958.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-52) Since 1989, the [National University of Ireland, Maynooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Maynooth "National University of Ireland, Maynooth"), has organised a pilgrimage called the _[Hamilton Walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton\_Walk "Hamilton Walk")_, in which mathematicians take a walk from Dunsink Observatory to the bridge, where no trace of the carving remains, though a stone plaque does commemorate the discovery.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-hw20-53)

The [Hamilton Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Institute "Hamilton Institute") is an applied mathematics research institute at [Maynooth University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynooth_University "Maynooth University") and the [Royal Irish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy "Royal Irish Academy") holds an annual public Hamilton lecture at which [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann"), [Frank Wilczek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek "Frank Wilczek"), [Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles "Andrew Wiles") and [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers "Timothy Gowers") have all spoken. 2005 was the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth and the Irish government designated that the _Hamilton Year, celebrating Irish science_. [Trinity College Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin "Trinity College Dublin") marked the year by launching the [Hamilton Mathematics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Mathematics_Institute "Hamilton Mathematics Institute").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-HMI-54)

Two [commemorative stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_stamp "Commemorative stamp") valued ½ and 2½ pence were issued by the Irish postal service on 13 November 1943 to mark the centenary of the announcement of quaternions.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Colnect.com-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-56) A 10-[euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro "Euro") commemorative silver [proof coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_coin "Proof coin") was issued by the [Central Bank of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Ireland "Central Bank of Ireland") in 2005 to commemorate 200 years since his birth.

It is believed by some modern mathematicians that Hamilton's work on quaternions was satirized by [Charles Lutwidge Dodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lutwidge_Dodgson "Charles Lutwidge Dodgson") in _[Alice in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice\_in\_Wonderland "Alice in Wonderland")_. In particular, the Mad Hatter's tea party was meant to represent the folly of quaternions and the need to revert to [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-58) In September 2022 evidence was presented to counter this suggestion, which appears to have been based on an incorrect understanding of both quaternions and their history.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-59)

Hamilton married Helen Bayly, daughter of Rev Henry Bayly, Rector of Nenagh, County Tipperary, in 1833; she was a sister of neighbours to the observatory.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-60)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 108  They had three children: the journalist [William Edwin Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edwin_Hamilton "William Edwin Hamilton") (born 1834), Archibald Henry (born 1835) and Helen Eliza Amelia (born 1840).[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-61) Helen stayed with her widowed mother at Bayly Farm, [Nenagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenagh "Nenagh") for extended periods, until her mother's death in 1837. She also was away from Dunsink, staying with sisters, for much of the time from 1840 to 1842.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-62) Hamilton's married life was reportedly difficult.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Bruno2003-5): 209  In the troubled period of the early 1840s, his sister Sydney ran his household; when Helen returned, he was happier after some depression.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton#cite_note-Hankins-15): 125, 126

In the case of Hamilton there is no occasion to state anything but the simple fact, known to all his intimates, that he was in private profession, as in public, a Christian, a lover of the Bible, an orthodox and attached member of the Established Church, though of the most liberal feelings on all points. He had some disposition towards the life of a clergyman, but preferred to keep himself free to devote all his time to science: he was offered ordination by two bishops.

"William Rowan Hamilton". _Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society_. **26**: 109–118. This memoir would be incomplete if we did not add, that our deceased member, together with the character of a scholar, a poet, a metaphysician, and a great analyst, combined with that of a kind-hearted, simple-minded Christian gentleman; we say the latter because Sir William Hamilton was too sincere a man ever to disguise, though too diffident to obtrude, his profound conviction of the truth of revealed religion.

(ed.). _Facets of Faith and Science: The Role of Beliefs in Mathematics and the Natural Sciences: An Augustinian Perspective_. Vol.2. University Press of America; Pascal Centre for Advanced Studies. In Hamilton's Calvinistic[1] theology, as in that of his Scottish friend and pupil Clerk Maxwell, God is the creator both of the universe and of the laws governing it. This means that the lawful relations among material objects are as real as the objects themselves. As a Christian, Hamilton was convinced that the stamp of God is on nature everywhere. He expected a Triune God to leave evidence of the Trinity on everything from three-dimensional space in geometry to an algebra involving triples of numbers. This "metaphysical drive," in the words of Thomas Hankins, his best twentieth-century biographer, "held him to the task" of looking for a generalization of complex numbers to triples."
