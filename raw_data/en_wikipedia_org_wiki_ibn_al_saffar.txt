He worked at the school founded by his colleague Al-Majriti in Córdoba . His best-known work was a treatise on the astrolabe , a text that was in active use until the 15th century and influenced the work of Kepler . He also wrote a commentary on the Zij as-Sindhind , and measured the coordinates of Mecca .

[ 2 ] Ibn as-Saffar later influenced the works of Abu as-Salt .

Paul Kunitzsch argued that a Latin treatise on the astrolabe long attributed to Mashallah , and used by Chaucer to write A Treatise on the Astrolabe , is in fact written by Ibn as-Saffar.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The exoplanet Saffar, also known as Upsilon Andromedae b , is named in his honor.

Saffar Island in Antarctica is named after Ibn as-Saffar.

Paul Kunitzsch has recently established that the Latin treatise on the astrolabe long ascribed to Ma'sh'allah and translated by John of Seville is in fact by Ibn al-Saffar, a disciple of Maslama al-Majriti.
