Find sources: "Stone space" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In topology and related areas of mathematics , a Stone space , also known as a profinite space [ 1 ] or profinite set , is a compact Hausdorff totally disconnected space.

[ 2 ] Stone spaces are named after Marshall Harvey Stone who introduced and studied them in the 1930s in the course of his investigation of Boolean algebras , which culminated in his representation theorem for Boolean algebras .

Equivalent conditions [ edit ] The following conditions on the topological space X {\displaystyle X} are equivalent: [ 2 ] [ 1 ] X {\displaystyle X} is a Stone space; X {\displaystyle X} is homeomorphic to the projective limit (in the category of topological spaces ) of an inverse system of finite discrete spaces ; X {\displaystyle X} is compact and totally separated ; X {\displaystyle X} is compact, T 0 , and zero-dimensional (in the sense of the small inductive dimension ); X {\displaystyle X} is coherent and Hausdorff.

Examples [ edit ] Important examples of Stone spaces include finite discrete spaces , the Cantor set and the space Z p {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}} of p {\displaystyle p} -adic integers , where p {\displaystyle p} is any prime number .  Generalizing these examples, any product of arbitrarily many finite discrete spaces is a Stone space, and the topological space underlying any profinite group is a Stone space. The Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers with the discrete topology, or indeed of any discrete space, is a Stone space.

Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras [ edit ] Main article: Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras To every Boolean algebra B {\displaystyle B} we can associate a Stone space S ( B ) {\displaystyle S(B)} as follows: the elements of S ( B ) {\displaystyle S(B)} are the ultrafilters on B , {\displaystyle B,} and the topology on S ( B ) , {\displaystyle S(B),} called the Stone topology , is generated by the sets of the form { F ∈ ∈ S ( B ) : b ∈ ∈ F } , {\displaystyle \{F\in S(B):b\in F\},} where b ∈ ∈ B .

{\displaystyle b\in B.} Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of clopen sets of the Stone space S ( B ) {\displaystyle S(B)} ; and furthermore, every Stone space X {\displaystyle X} is homeomorphic to the Stone space belonging to the Boolean algebra of clopen sets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} These assignments are functorial , and we obtain a category-theoretic duality between the category of Boolean algebras (with homomorphisms as morphisms) and the category of Stone spaces (with continuous maps as morphisms).

Stone's theorem gave rise to a number of similar dualities, now collectively known as Stone dualities .

Condensed mathematics [ edit ] The category of Stone spaces with continuous maps is equivalent to the pro-category of the category of finite sets , which explains the term "profinite sets". The profinite sets are at the heart of the project of condensed mathematics , which aims to replace topological spaces with "condensed sets", where a topological space X is replaced by the functor that takes a profinite set S to the set of continuous maps from S to X .
