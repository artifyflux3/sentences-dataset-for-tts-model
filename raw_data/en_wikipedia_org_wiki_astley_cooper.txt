[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Astley Paston Cooper, c.

1825 Born at Brooke Hall in Brooke, Norfolk on 23 August 1768 and baptised at St. Peter's Church, Brooke, [ 2 ] on 9 September, [ 3 ] Astley Cooper was the son of the Rev Dr Samuel Cooper, a clergyman of the Church of England ; his mother Maria Susanna Cooper née Bransby [ 4 ] wrote several epistolary novels.

[ 5 ] At the age of sixteen he was sent to London and placed under Henry Cline (1750–1827), surgeon to St Thomas' Hospital . From the first he devoted himself to the study of anatomy , and had the privilege of attending the lectures of John Hunter . In 1789 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at St Thomas' Hospital, where in 1791 he became joint lecturer with Cline in anatomy and surgery , and in 1800 he was appointed surgeon to Guy's Hospital on the death of his uncle, William Cooper.

[ 6 ] Astley Cooper received the Copley Medal in 1801 for two papers read before the Royal Society of London on the destruction of the tympanic membrane .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In February 1802 or February 1805 he was elected a Fellow of the Society .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ need quotation to verify ] In 1805 he took an active part in the formation of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London and was its President in 1819. In 1804 he brought out the first, and in 1807 the second, part of his great work on hernia , which added so largely to his reputation that in 1813 his annual professional income rose to 21,000 pounds sterling. In the same year he was appointed professor of comparative anatomy to the Royal College of Surgeons and was very popular as a lecturer.

[ 6 ] In 1817 Cooper performed his famous operation of tying the abdominal aorta for aneurysm; and in 1820 he removed an infected wen (in more modern terminology, a sebaceous cyst ) from the scalp of King George IV .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] About six months afterwards he received a baronetcy , which, as he had no son, was to descend to his nephew and adopted son, Astley Cooper.

[ 6 ] [ 14 ] He was appointed sergeant surgeon to George IV in 1828.

[ 1 ] He served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827 and again in 1836, and he was elected a vice-president of the Royal Society in 1830.

[ 6 ] In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . He died on 12 February 1841 in London, and is interred, by his own desire, in the crypt of the Chapel of Thomas Guy, St Thomas Street (on the site now shared by King's College London and Guy's Hospital ).

[ 15 ] A statue by Edward Hodges Baily was erected in St Paul's Cathedral .

[ 16 ] Cooper lived at Gadebridge House in the market town of Hemel Hempstead .

[ 17 ] Due to his influence and vigorous lobbying, supported by other residents of the area, a railway line was constructed in the 1830s by the London and Birmingham Railway to the south of the town [ 18 ] instead of directly through it. This led to the citizens of Hemel Hempstead having no railway station in their town.

[ 19 ] Legacy [ edit ] The importance of Sir Astley Cooper is remembered with a number of street names (Astley Cooper Place in the village of his birth, Brooke, Norfolk; Astley Road and Paston Road in Hemel Hempstead), and with The Astley Cooper School , formerly Grove Hill School, but renamed after him in 1984.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Works [ edit ] In the field of vascular surgery and cerebral circulation , Cooper was the first to demonstrate experimentally the effects of bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries in dogs and to propose treatment of aneurysms by ligation of the vessel. In 1805 he published in the first volume of Medico-Chirurgical Transactions , an account of his attempt to tie the common carotid artery for treating an aneurysm in a patient. In 1808 he tried the same with the external iliac artery for a femoral aneurysm and in 1817 he ligated the aorta for an iliac aneurysm.

[ 22 ] Statue of Cooper, St Paul's Cathedral, London by Edward Hodges Baily Cooper was an anatomist and identified several previously undescribed anatomical structures, many of which were named after him: Cooper's fascia , a covering of the spermatic cord .

Cooper's pubic ligament , the superior pubic ligament .

Cooper's stripes , a fibrous structure in the ulnar ligaments.

Cooper's ligaments , the suspensory ligaments of the breasts .

He also described a number of new diseases, which likewise became eponymous: Cooper's testis ( neuralgia of the testicles ) Cooper's disease (benign cysts of the breast) Cooper's hernia (retroperitoneal hernia) Cooper's neuralgia (neuralgia of the breast) His chief published works were: Anatomy and Surgical Treatment of Hernia (1804–1807); Dislocations and Fractures (1822); Lectures on Surgery (1824–1827); Illustrations of Diseases of the Breast (1829); Anatomy of the Thymus Gland (1832); Anatomy of the Breast (1840).

The fame of Astley Cooper spread rapidly and it was only natural that in 1820 King George IV chose him to treat an infected sebaceous cyst of the scalp. The intervention was successful.

An excellent notion of the fears which surgeons entertained in regard to secondary complications after the removal of wens is furnished by the case of George IV., who had a sebaceous cyst on the top of his head. This formed the subject of a serious consultation attended by Cline, Astley Cooper, Brodie , and others. Eventually Cooper, with Cline's assistance, removed the wen [...].

The line, as originally laid out, was to have [...] passed through Cashiobury and Grove Parks, the seats of Lord Essex and Lord  Clarendon, and along the Hemel Hempstead and Little Goddesden valleys, in Hertfordshire. This latter portion of the project excited a vehement opposition on the part of the landowners, who formed a powerful confederacy against the bill. The principal parties who took and active part in the opposition were Lady Bridgewater and her trustees, Lord Essex and Sir Astley Cooper, supported by the Grand Junction Canal Company. By their influence the landowners throughout the counties of Hertford and Buckingham were completely organized in opposition to the measure. [...] Public meetings were held in most of the districts through which the line was projected to pass, under the presidency of the nobility and gentry, when it was unanimously determined that railways were wholly unnecessary. [...] The Hemel Hempstead and Goddesden valleys were [...] avoided, and the line proceeded by the towns of Berkhampstead and Tring.
