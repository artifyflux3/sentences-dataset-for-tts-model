It is named after Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen , the Russian discoverer of Antarctica . The plate was in existence during the Late Cretaceous epoch and Paleogene period, and it was adjacent to eastern Marie Byrd Land . Independent plate motion ceased at 61 million years ago. The boundaries are poorly defined.
