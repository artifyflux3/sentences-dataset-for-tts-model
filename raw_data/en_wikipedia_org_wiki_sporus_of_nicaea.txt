For the Roman freedman, see Sporus .

Sporus of Nicaea ( Greek : Σπόρος ; c. 240 – c. 300) was a Greek mathematician and astronomer , probably from Nicaea, ancient district Bithynia (modern-day Iznik ) in province Bursa , in modern-day Turkey .

Much of his work focused on squaring the circle and reproducing cubes , both in his own attempts at these problems or in criticizing the work of other contemporary mathematicians. Sporus criticized Archimedes for not producing a more accurate approximation of π.
