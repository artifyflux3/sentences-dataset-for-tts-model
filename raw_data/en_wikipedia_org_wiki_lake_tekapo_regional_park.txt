It covers 165 hectares (410 acres) at the eastern side of the southern end of Lake Tekapo , east of the Lake Tekapo township . It is the newest of the four Canterbury regional parks managed  by Environment Canterbury .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Pre-European history [ edit ] Local Māori call the lake "Takapo" meaning "leave by night". According to oral history, the lake has a taniwha (monster), and the tohunga (spiritual leader) Hipa Te Maiharoa is the only person to have swum the lake and escaped it.

Ngāi Tahu used the lake as a source for a source of waterfowl and a species of eel they call tuna .

[ 1 ] European settlement [ edit ] Europeans settled the Mackenzie Basin in the mid-1850s, establishing part of Tekapo Station at the site of the current regional park. The station was divided between Mt Hay Station and Sawdwon Stations in 1948.

[ 1 ] In 1951, the completion of Lake Tekapo Dam submerged a homestead on the site. In 1957, fencing and tree planting of the area began to control soil erosion and drifting sands; [ 1 ] the plantings were mostly Corsican , Lodgepole and Ponderosa pine with some European larch .

[ 2 ] In 1963, the area was vested as a Soil Conservation Reserve.

[ 1 ] Regional park [ edit ] Environment Canterbury took over stewardship of the site in 1989.

[ 1 ] The Lake Tekapo Recreational Park Society was established in August 2008.

[ 3 ] It provides support the council in developing the park and coordinate volunteer activities, with funding from local businesses and organisations.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 2011, the society proposed the development of an area in the park for a caravan park.

[ 4 ] In 2019, the society called for a reduction to the main access road to the park due to a "rapid rise" in the number of people using the park.

[ 5 ] Naming [ edit ] "Tekapo" is a misspelling of Takapō , the name of the lake in the Māori language .

Takapō means "to leave in haste at night".

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2021, the Mackenzie District Council announced that it will start using the dual names of Tekapo and Takapō when referring to Lake Tekapo.

[ 8 ] Environment Canterbury refers to the park as Takapō Regional Park.

[ 9 ] Recreation [ edit ] The park has 24 kilometres of mountain biking, cycling, walking and running tracks, graded for difficulty. There are extensive conifers , views of the lake and Two Thumb Range . There is an orienteering course, and cross-country skiing is also possible in winter.

[ 1 ] The park also features a 2 hectares (4.9 acres) fully fenced dog park, shallow swimming beaches, picnic tables and picnic spots, disc golf facilities, and a public toilet. There are no on-site barbecues and fires are banned, but people can bring their own enclosed barbecue and gas to use near the beach.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Boats are allowed in the lake, [ 1 ] but there is a 5 knot speed limit for paddle, sail and power craft in a designated area near the park.

[ 2 ] Stuff listed the park as one of the best dog-friendly destinations in New Zealand, [ 10 ] while the New Zealand Herald listed it as one of the best autumn destinations.

[ 11 ] The Vancouver Sun recommended a hike of the regional park as part of a New Zealand holiday.

[ 12 ] The park can be accessed via Lilybank Road, or on tracks from the Lake Tekapo township and Cowans Hill.
