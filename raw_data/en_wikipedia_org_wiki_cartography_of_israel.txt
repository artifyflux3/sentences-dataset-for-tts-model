[ 1 ] Defining borders of present day Israel [ edit ] Prior to the declaration of Israel in 1948, the UN proposed a United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine based on the location of land legally purchased [ 2 ] and used to create Jewish Settlements in the area.

Jewish Settlement in Palestine 1880-1914 This maps depicts the originally anticipated borders of Israel upon inception 1938 China's attempt to erase mapping of Israel [ edit ] In October 2023, internet users noticed "the name Israel no longer appears on leading local digital maps services such as Baidu or Alibaba".

[ 3 ] Sources report that major cities are still defined as well as the borders that define present-day Israel and Palestinian territories, but not the name itself.

[ 4 ] WION (World Is One News) reported that it is because 'Chinese internet is getting inundated with antisemitism following the Israel-Hamas war'.
