[ 1 ] Kant divided transcendental theology into " ontotheology " and cosmotheology , both of which he also invented, "in order to distinguish between two competing types of 'transcendental theology'".

[ 2 ] Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmotheology as follows: "Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology." [ 1 ] A critique of transcendental theology as developed by Kant is that it is argued that human reason is not capable of proving God's existence ; [ citation needed ] Kant solves this problem by appealing to moral symbolism. Thus, Kant describes God as a moral trinity: holy lawgiver, good governor, and just judge.
