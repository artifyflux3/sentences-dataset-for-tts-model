Humans everywhere classify animals and plants into obvious species -like groups. The relationship between a folk taxonomy and a scientific classification can assist in understanding how evolutionary theory deals with the apparent constancy of "common species" and the organic processes centering on them. From the vantage of evolutionary psychology , such natural systems are arguably routine "habits of mind", a sort of heuristic used to make sense of the natural world.
