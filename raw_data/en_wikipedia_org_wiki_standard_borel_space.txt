Except in the case of discrete Polish spaces, the standard Borel space is unique, up to isomorphism of measurable spaces .

Formal definition [ edit ] A measurable space ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is said to be "standard Borel" if there exists a metric on X {\displaystyle X} that makes it a complete separable metric space in such a way that Œ£ Œ£ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is then the Borel œÉ-algebra .

[ 1 ] Standard Borel spaces have several useful properties that do not hold for general measurable spaces.

Properties [ edit ] If ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} and ( Y , T ) {\displaystyle (Y,T)} are standard Borel then any bijective measurable mapping f : ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) ‚Üí ‚Üí ( Y , T ) {\displaystyle f:(X,\Sigma )\to (Y,\mathrm {T} )} is an isomorphism (that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable).  This follows from Souslin's theorem , as a set that is both analytic and coanalytic is necessarily Borel.

If ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} and ( Y , T ) {\displaystyle (Y,T)} are standard Borel spaces and f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} then f {\displaystyle f} is measurable if and only if the graph of f {\displaystyle f} is Borel.

The product and direct union of a countable family of standard Borel spaces are standard.

Every complete probability measure on a standard Borel space turns it into a standard probability space .

Kuratowski's theorem [ edit ] Theorem .  Let X {\displaystyle X} be a Polish space , that is, a topological space such that there is a metric d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} that defines the topology of X {\displaystyle X} and that makes X {\displaystyle X} a complete separable metric space.  Then X {\displaystyle X} as a Borel space is Borel isomorphic to one of
(1) R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} (2) Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } or (3) a finite discrete space. (This result is reminiscent of Maharam's theorem .) It follows that a standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality , [ 2 ] and that any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum .

Borel isomorphisms on standard Borel spaces are analogous to homeomorphisms on topological spaces : both are bijective and closed under composition, and a homeomorphism and its inverse are both continuous , instead of both being only Borel measurable.
