[ 1 ] Young girls playing a board game in the Iisalmi library in Finland , 2016 A board game is a type of tabletop game [ 2 ] [ 3 ] that involves small objects ( game pieces ) that are placed and moved in particular ways on a specially designed patterned game board , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] potentially including other components, e.g. dice.

[ 6 ] The earliest known uses of the term "board game" are between the 1840s and 1850s.

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] [ 9 ] While game boards are a necessary and sufficient condition of this genre , card games that do not use a standard deck of cards, as well as games that use neither cards nor a game board, are often colloquially included, with some referring to this genre generally as "table and board games" or simply "tabletop games".

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Eras [ edit ] Further information: History of games This timeline was made with information from the Wikipedia articles on Board Game, Hasbro, Board Game Cafe, Tabletop Simulator, and Monopoly. All information on this timeline was from those Wikipedia pages as they were on November 24th, 2024 Ancient era [ edit ] Board games have been played, traveled, and evolved in most cultures and societies throughout history [ 11 ] Board games have been discovered in a number of archaeological sites. The oldest discovered gaming pieces were discovered in southwest Turkey, a set of elaborate sculptured stones in sets of four designed for a chess-like game, which were created during the Bronze Age around 5,000 years ago.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Numerous archaeological finds of game boards exist that date from as early as the Neolithic period including, as of 2024, a total of 14 Neolithic sites reporting 51 game boards, ranging from mid- 7th millennium to early 8th millennium .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Oldest game [ edit ] The Royal Game of Ur , estimated to have originated from around 4,600 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, an example of which was found in the royal tombs of ancient Mesopotamia ( c.

2600 BC – c.

2400 BC ), [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] is considered the oldest playable boardgame in the world, with well-defined game's rules discovered written on a cuneiform tablet by a Babylonian astronomer in c.

177 BC – c.

176 BC .

[ 21 ] [ 15 ] Another game similar to the Royal Game of Ur was discovered in 1977 by the Italian Archaeological Mission in grave no. 731, a pseudo-catacomb grave at Shahr-i Sokhta , a UNESCO World Heritage archaeological site in Iran. This board game set, comprising 27 pieces and 4 different dice, dates to 2600–2400 BCE. For the first time, the entire set has been scientifically analyzed and reconstructed by researchers [ 22 ] , and it is considered the oldest complete and playable board game ever discovered.

[ 23 ] Currently, Senet is argued to be the oldest known board game in the world, with possible game board fragments ( c.

3100 BC ) [ 24 ] and undisputed pictorial representations ( c.

2686;BC – c.

2613 BC ) [ 25 ] having been found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials dating as far back as 3500 BC.

[ 26 ] However, while Senet was played for thousands of years, it fell out of fashion sometime after 400 A.D. during the Roman period ; [ 25 ] the rules were never written down, therefore they are not decisively known.

[ 27 ] Similarly, Mehen is one of the oldest games dated with reasonable confidence, i.e., c.

3000 BC – c.

2300 BC , [ 28 ] [ 21 ] with some estimating it dates back to c.

3500 BC .

[ 29 ] The rules, scoring system, and game pieces, however, are unknown or speculative.

[ 29 ] [ 21 ] The title of the oldest known board game has been difficult to establish.

[ 29 ] An example of this is mancala , which includes a broad family of board games with a core design of two rows of small circular divots or bowls carved into a surface, which has had numerous estimations of its generic age due to the many variants that have been discovered in different locations across Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.

[ 29 ] These are dated across many different historical periods, from archaeological sites dating the game at c.

800 BC – c.

200 BC (Roman Settlements); c.

2500 BC – c.

1500 BC (Egypt); and even c.

7000  BC – c.

5000  BC (Jordan). The later based on divots carved out of limestone in a Neolithic dwelling from c.

5870  BC ± 240 BC, [ 16 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] although this later dating has been disputed.

[ 31 ] Furthermore, when considering the Neolithic period game boards discoveries, caution has been given against considering these finds as representing earliest human game playing, as the absence of evidence of such games does not equate to evidence that no games were played during earlier periods.

[ 34 ] : 11 The most popular of the board games sold during this period was Monopoly (1935), with 500 million games played as of 1999.

In the late 1990s, companies began producing more new games to serve a growing worldwide market.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The early 21st century saw the emergence of a new "Golden Age" for board games called the "Board Game Renaissance".

[ 36 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] This period of board games industry development, of which board games such as Ticket to Ride (2004) and were a major part, saw a shift away from the 20th-century domination by well-established standby Golden Era board games like Monopoly (1935) and Game of Life (1960).

[ 40 ] Regional history [ edit ] Further information: History of games Europe [ edit ] Further information: Eurogame § History Board games have a long tradition in Europe. The oldest records of board gaming in Europe date back to Homer 's Iliad (written in the 8th century BC), in which he mentions the Ancient Greek game of petteia .

[ 41 ] This game of petteia would later evolve into the Roman game of ludus latrunculorum .

[ 41 ] Germany Kriegsspiel is a genre of wargaming developed in 19th century Prussia , to teach battle tactics to officers.

[ 42 ] Ireland Fidchell boards dating from the 10th century has been uncovered in Ireland, [ 43 ] with the game said to date back to at least 144 AD.

[ 44 ] Scandinavia The ancient Norse game of hnefatafl was developed sometime before 400 AD .

[ 45 ] United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the association of dice and cards with gambling led to all dice games except backgammon being treated as "lotteries by dice" in the Gaming Acts of 1710 and 1845 .

[ 46 ] One of the most prolific publishers of board games of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was the English board game publisher John Wallis and his sons (John Wallis Jr. and Edward Wallis).

[ 47 ] The global popularisation of board games, with special themes and branding, coincided with the formation of the global dominance of the British Empire .

[ 48 ] Examples of british empire games included: British Empire Games Game Title Release Date Creator Description Ref A Tour Through the British Colonies and Foreign Possessions 1850 John Betts This board game was a race game that consisted of a board with 37 numbered pictures, each correlating to a British colony, arranged in four circular levels, numbered 1 ( Heligoland , Germany) to 37 ( London , England), three concentric ones and an inner fourth level of London ("Metropolis of the British Empire"). A teetotum was spun with a player's piece correspondingly moving ahead through the spaces of the game board, upon which a corresponding description to the space the player lands was read out aloud from an accompanying rule booklet by the presiding player (a player abstaining from directly playing the game), except when directed in the book. The descriptions included commentary about the various colonies and occasional game board movement directions to the player. There winner would be the player to reach London first.

The player's followed the instructions printed in circles along the tracks, which contained sailor-themed dangers and advantages.

United States Due to a number of factors, such as the decrease of industrial working hours and the implementation of a Saturday half-day holiday, United States shifted from agrarian to urban living in the nineteenth century, which provided greater leisure time and a rise in middle class income.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] The American home, once an economic production focus, started to become one for entertainment, enlightenment, and education under maternal supervision, where children were encouraged to play board games that developed literacy skills and provided moral instruction.

[ 54 ] The first board games published in the United States were Travellers' Tour Through the United States and its sister game Traveller's Tour Through Europe , published in 1822 by New York City bookseller F. & R. Lockwood.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Margaret Hofer described this period, from 1880s–1920s, as "The Golden Age" of board gaming in America.

[ 34 ] Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through mass production , which made them cheaper and more easily available. In the 19th century, the industry itself was still developing, albeit significantly more rapidly; however, the games manufactured in America were still primarily for children.

[ 57 ] Beginning in the late 20th century, during the period known as board game renaissance, games started to evolve considerably, from a strategic play standpoint and also in terms of increased advertising and marketing.

[ 57 ] In modern day United States, board game venues have recently grown in popularity. In 2016 alone, more than 5,000 board game cafés opened in the United States.

[ 55 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] The game's rules of this version were written on a cuneiform tablet by a Babylonian astronomer in 177 BC, and involved two players racing their pieces from one end of a 20-square board to the other in a similar way to backgammon, with the central squares being used for fortune telling.

[ 60 ] [ 21 ] [ 12 ] Backgammon also originated in ancient Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] While no archeological or reliable documentary evidence exists of the exact origins of the game, according to legend, Liubo was invented in around 1728–1675 BC in China by Wu Cao, a minister of King Jie the last Xia dynasty king. China developed a number of chess variants, including xiangqi (Chinese chess), dou shou qi (Chinese animal chess), and luzhanqi (Chinese army chess), each with their own variants.

[ 64 ] Games like mahjong , and Fighting the Landlords (Dou DiZhu) also originated in China.

In modern-day China, board game cafes have become popular, with cities like Shanghai having more game cafés than Starbucks.

1391–1353 BC) Luck, strategy, and diplomacy [ edit ] Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as Candy Land (1949) and snakes and ladders require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.

[ 78 ] Two Qataris playing the traditional board game of damah Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in backgammon , Monopoly , or Risk ; but over many games, a skilled player will win more often.

[ 79 ] The elements of luck can also make for more excitement at times, and allow for more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as expected value and risk management must be considered.

[ 80 ] Luck may be introduced into a game by several methods. The use of dice of various sorts goes back to one of the earliest board games, the Royal Game of Ur . These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in Monopoly , to how their forces fare in battle, as in Risk , or which resources a player gains, as in Catan (1995). Other games such as Sorry!

(1934) use a deck of special cards that, when shuffled, create randomness.

Scrabble (1948) creates a similar effect using randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness.

German-style board games are notable for often having fewer elements of luck than many North American board games.

[ 81 ] Luck may be reduced in favor of skill by introducing symmetry between players. For example, in a dice game such as Ludo ( c.

1896 ), by giving each player the choice of rolling the dice or using the previous player's roll.

Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players, making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, cooperative games being the exception. An important facet of Catan , for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In Risk , two or more players may team up against others.

Easy diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against.

Advanced diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game Diplomacy from 1954) consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] In perfect information games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as Tigris and Euphrates (1997) or Stratego (1946), some information is hidden from players.

[ 84 ] This makes finding the best move more difficult and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.

[ 85 ] Software [ edit ] Main article: Digital tabletop game Many board games are now available as video games. These are aptly termed digital board games, and their distinguishing characteristic compared to traditional board games is they can now be played online against a computer or other players. Some websites (such as boardgamearena.com, yucata.de, etc.) [ 86 ] allow play in real time and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use email to notify the players after each move.

[ 87 ] The Internet and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed.

[ 88 ] Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or DVDs in accompaniment to the game.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as Vassal , Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds are more specialized for role-playing games.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, Fantasy Grounds has licenses for both Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder materials, while Tabletop Simulator allows game publishers to provide paid downloadable content for their games.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] However, as these games offer the ability to add in the content through user modifications , there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.

[ 95 ] Market [ edit ] The modern German board game Catan is printed in 30 languages and sold 15 million by 2009.

While the board gaming market is estimated to be smaller than that for video games , it has also experienced significant growth from the late 1990s.

[ 38 ] A 2012 article in The Guardian described board games as "making a comeback".

[ 96 ] Other expert sources suggest that board games never went away, and that board games have remained a popular leisure activity which has only grown over time.

[ 97 ] Another from 2014 gave an estimate that put the growth of the board game market at "between 25% and 40% annually" since 2010, and described the current time as the "golden era for board games".

[ 38 ] The rise in board game popularity has been attributed to quality improvement (more elegant mechanics , components , artwork, and graphics) as well as increased availability thanks to sales through the Internet.

[ 38 ] Crowd-sourcing for board games is a large facet of the market, with $233 million raised on Kickstarter in 2020.

[ 98 ] A 1991 estimate for the global board game market was over $1.2 billion.

[ 99 ] A 2001 estimate for the United States "board games and puzzle" market gave a value of under $400 million, and for United Kingdom, of about £50 million.

[ 100 ] A 2009 estimate for the Korean market was put at 800 million won, [ 101 ] and another estimate for the American board game market for the same year was at about $800 million.

[ 102 ] A 2011 estimate for the Chinese board game market was at over 10 billion yuan .

[ 103 ] A 2013 estimate put the size of the German toy market at 2.7 billion euros (out of which the board games and puzzle market is worth about 375 million euros), and Polish markets at 2 billion and 280 million zlotys , respectively.

[ 104 ] In 2009, Germany was considered to be the best market per capita, with the highest number of games sold per individual.

[ 105 ] Hobby board games [ edit ] Some academics, such as Erica Price and Marco Arnaudo, have differentiated "hobby" board games and gamers from other board games and gamers.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] A 2014 estimate placed the U.S. and Canada market for hobby board games (games produced for a "gamer" market) at only $75 million, with the total size of what it defined as the "hobby game market" ("the market for those games regardless of whether they're sold in the hobby channel or other channels") at over $700 million.

[ 108 ] A similar 2015 estimate suggested a hobby game market value of almost $900 million.

[ 109 ] Research [ edit ] Board games serve diverse interests.

Left: kōnane for studious competition.

Right: kōnane for lighthearted fun.

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as game studies or ludology.

[ 110 ] While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess , Go , mancala ), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly , Scrabble , and Risk , [ 111 ] and especially modern board games such as Catan , Agricola , and Pandemic . Much research has been carried out on chess, partly because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot , William Chase, Herbert A. Simon , and Fernand Gobet have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing ability.

[ 112 ] Linearly arranged board games have improved children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a number line in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.

[ 113 ] Research studies show that board games such as Snakes and Ladders result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation, and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece.

[ 114 ] Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's executive functions [ 115 ] and help reduce risks of dementia for the elderly.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility, culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games [ 118 ] and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities.

[ 119 ] Additionally, board games can be therapeutic.

Bruce Halpenny , a games inventor said when interviewed about his game, The Great Train Robbery : With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player's imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble, they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society because most jobs are boring and repetitive.

[ 120 ] Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to the traditional educational curriculum if the content is appropriate and the gameplay informs students on the curriculum content.

[ 121 ] [ 122 ] Categories [ edit ] Historical development [ edit ] Harold Murray 's A History of Board Games Other Than Chess (1952) [ 123 ] has been called the first attempt to develop a "scheme for the classification of board games", in which he separated board games into five categories: "race", "war", "hunt", "alignment" / "configuration", and "mancala" games.

[ 124 ] [ 57 ] Robert Bell 's Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations (1869) [ 125 ] similarly espoused a classification of board games, this time divided into four categories, "race", "war", "positional", and "mancala" games.

[ 57 ] In David Parlett 's The Oxford History of Board Games (1999), [ 126 ] based on the work of Murray and Bell, [ 57 ] he described a "classical" categorization of board games which consisted of four primary categories: " race ", " space ", " chase ", and " displace " games.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] : 17 Modern board games have been classified in a variety of ways, a classification that can be based on the board game's mechanics, theme, age range, player number, and promotion. The diversity of board games means that some games belong to several categories.

[ 128 ] : 13 Mechanics [ edit ] A board game's mechanics usually involve an assessment of a player or player/s achievements while adhering to a series of pre-established rules , i.e.

gameplay , such as capturing opponents' pieces, calculation of a final score, or achieving a predefined goal. Board games have a range of rule complexity but also a range of strategic depth, both of which determine the ease of mastering the game, i.e., hard-to-master games like chess possess a relatively simple rule set but have great strategic depth.

[ 129 ] Examples of categories based on a modern categorization of a board game's mechanics include: [ 59 ] Board game categorization by mechanics Board game categories Description Examples Ref Alignment Alignment board games are a subcategory of space board games. In an alignment game, a player is required to position their tokens in an array of a prescribed length. Like space games, these games are often abstract games.

These board games are also called Ameritrash board games; however, this term is not necessarily a negative label.

When players land on certain spaces, it triggers specific actions or offers the player certain gameplay options. These board games are also known as roll-and-move games.

[ 128 ] : 11 Parlett went so far as to describe these promotional and television spin-off games as being “of an essentially trivial, ephemeral, mind-numbing, and ultimately soul-destroying degree of worthlessness".

[ 126 ] : 7 The prominent themes found in board games of the Golden Era included: travel, sports, courtship, racism, city life, war, education and capitalist enterprise".

[ 33 ] Common modern thematic game categories include: Thematic categorization of board games Board game genres Description Examples Ref Adventure An adventure -themed board game has themes of heroism, exploration, and puzzle-solving, often involving the game characters in quests.
