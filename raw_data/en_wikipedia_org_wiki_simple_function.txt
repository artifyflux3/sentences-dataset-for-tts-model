( January 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Function that attains finitely many values In the mathematical field of real analysis , a simple function is a real (or complex )-valued function over a subset of the real line , similar to a step function . Simple functions are sufficiently "nice" that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example, simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be measurable , as used in practice.

A basic example of a simple function is the floor function over the half-open interval [1, 9), whose only values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A more advanced example is the Dirichlet function over the real line, which takes the value 1 if x is rational and 0 otherwise. (Thus the "simple" of "simple function" has a technical meaning somewhat at odds with common language.) All step functions are simple.

Simple functions are used as a first stage in the development of theories of integration , such as the Lebesgue integral , because it is easy to define integration for a simple function and also it is straightforward to approximate more general functions by sequences of simple functions.

Definition [ edit ] Formally, a simple function is a finite linear combination of indicator functions of measurable sets . More precisely, let ( X , Σ) be a measurable space . Let A 1 , ..., A n ∈ Σ be a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, and let a 1 , ..., a n be a sequence of real or complex numbers . A simple function is a function f : : X → → C {\displaystyle f\colon X\to \mathbb {C} } of the form f ( x ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n a k 1 A k ( x ) , {\displaystyle f(x)=\sum _{k=1}^{n}a_{k}{\mathbf {1} }_{A_{k}}(x),} where 1 A {\displaystyle {\mathbf {1} }_{A}} is the indicator function of the set A .

Properties of simple functions [ edit ] The sum, difference, and product of two simple functions are again simple functions, and multiplication by constant keeps a simple function simple; hence it follows that the collection of all simple functions on a given measurable space forms a commutative algebra over C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } .

Integration of simple functions [ edit ] If a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined on the space ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} ,  the integral of a simple function f : : X → → R {\displaystyle f\colon X\to \mathbb {R} } with respect to μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined to be ∫ ∫ X f d μ μ = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n a k μ μ ( A k ) , {\displaystyle \int _{X}fd\mu =\sum _{k=1}^{n}a_{k}\mu (A_{k}),} if all summands are finite.

Relation to Lebesgue integration [ edit ] The above integral of simple functions can be extended to a more general class of functions, which is how the Lebesgue integral is defined. This extension is based on the following fact.

Theorem . Any non-negative measurable function f : : X → → R + {\displaystyle f\colon X\to \mathbb {R} ^{+}} is the pointwise limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions.

It is implied in the statement that the sigma-algebra in the co-domain R + {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}} is the restriction of the Borel σ-algebra B ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {B}}(\mathbb {R} )} to R + {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}} . The proof proceeds as follows. Let f {\displaystyle f} be a non-negative measurable function defined over the measure space ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} . For each n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } , subdivide the co-domain of f {\displaystyle f} into 2 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle 2^{2n}+1} intervals, 2 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{2n}} of which have length 2 − − n {\displaystyle 2^{-n}} . That is, for each n {\displaystyle n} , define I n , k = [ k − − 1 2 n , k 2 n ) {\displaystyle I_{n,k}=\left[{\frac {k-1}{2^{n}}},{\frac {k}{2^{n}}}\right)} for k = 1 , 2 , … … , 2 2 n {\displaystyle k=1,2,\ldots ,2^{2n}} , and I n , 2 2 n + 1 = [ 2 n , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle I_{n,2^{2n}+1}=[2^{n},\infty )} , which are disjoint and cover the non-negative real line ( R + ⊆ ⊆ ∪ ∪ k I n , k , ∀ ∀ n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}\subseteq \cup _{k}I_{n,k},\forall n\in \mathbb {N} } ).

Now define the sets A n , k = f − − 1 ( I n , k ) {\displaystyle A_{n,k}=f^{-1}(I_{n,k})\,} for k = 1 , 2 , … … , 2 2 n + 1 , {\displaystyle k=1,2,\ldots ,2^{2n}+1,} which are measurable ( A n , k ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A_{n,k}\in \Sigma } ) because f {\displaystyle f} is assumed to be measurable.

Then the increasing sequence of simple functions f n = ∑ ∑ k = 1 2 2 n + 1 k − − 1 2 n 1 A n , k {\displaystyle f_{n}=\sum _{k=1}^{2^{2n}+1}{\frac {k-1}{2^{n}}}{\mathbf {1} }_{A_{n,k}}} converges pointwise to f {\displaystyle f} as n → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle n\to \infty } . Note that, when f {\displaystyle f} is bounded, the convergence is uniform.
