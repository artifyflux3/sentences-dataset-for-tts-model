Early life Macaulay Carson Culkin was born on August 26, 1980, in the Manhattan borough of New York City .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He was named after British historian Thomas Babington Macaulay . Culkin was the third of seven children born to Christopher "Kit" Culkin , a former stage actor, and Patricia Brentrup, a native of North Dakota .

[ 4 ] The couple met in 1974 while Brentrup was working as a road traffic controller in Sundance, Wyoming .

[ 5 ] Culkin's six siblings include Shane ( b.

1976), Dakota (1979–2008), Kieran ( b.

1982), Quinn ( b.

1984), Christian ( b.

1987), and Rory ( b.

1989). He also had a paternal half-sister, Jennifer Adamson (1970–2000). His paternal aunt is actress Bonnie Bedelia .

[ 6 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Culkin has German, Irish, and Norwegian ancestry.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] During Culkin's early childhood, the family lived together in a small apartment in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, and struggled financially.

[ 4 ] His mother worked as a telephone operator and his father was a sacristan at a local Catholic church.

[ 11 ] Culkin was raised Roman Catholic [ 12 ] and attended St. Joseph's School of Yorkville for five years [ 13 ] before transferring to the Professional Children's School .

[ 14 ] Culkin said his father, Kit Culkin, was violent towards him and their family, calling him the "worst person he's ever known." He said he felt that the abuse was caused by jealousy, because "everything [Kit] tried to do in his life [Macaulay] excelled at before [he] was 10 years old".

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In a 2025 interview, Culkin revealed that he and his father have not made contact in over 30 years.

[ 17 ] His parents never married; they split during his teens, and his mother filed for custody .

[ 18 ] Culkin took his parents to court to remove their name from his trust fund , which was reportedly worth between $15 and 20 million, and hired an executor .

[ 15 ] [ 18 ] Career See also: Macaulay Culkin filmography 1980s: Early work Culkin began acting at age four. His early roles included a stage production of Bach Babies at the New York Philharmonic . He continued appearing in roles on stage, television and films throughout the 1980s. He made an uncredited appearance in the television movie The Midnight Hour (1985).

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Culkin's first credited screen role came in February 1988, as a co-star in " Something Green ," an episode of the popular action television series The Equalizer , in which he played a kidnapping victim, Paul Gephardt.

Culkin made his film debut as Cy Blue Black in the drama Rocket Gibraltar (September 1988). He played the role of Billy Livingstone in the romantic comedy film See You in the Morning (1989), starring Jeff Bridges , Alice Krige , Farrah Fawcett and Drew Barrymore . He starred as Miles Russell alongside actor John Candy in the comedy film Uncle Buck (1989).

[ 21 ] 1990s: Breakthrough Culkin at the 1991 Emmy Awards Culkin rose to fame with his lead role of Kevin McCallister in the blockbuster comedy film Home Alone (1990). The film reunited him with Uncle Buck writer and director John Hughes and Uncle Buck co-star John Candy , who played the role of Polka band member Gus Polinski . For his performance, Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe Award [ 22 ] and won an American Comedy Award [ 23 ] and a Young Artist Award .

[ 24 ] In a 2022 interview with People , co-star Joe Pesci said Culkin was "a really sweet kid and, even at his age, very professional".

[ 27 ] He played the role of Henry in the drama thriller film The Good Son (1993), which only did reasonably well, although he was nominated for an MTV Movie Award in the category for Best Villain for his performance. He was also a student at the School of American Ballet and appeared in a filmed version of The Nutcracker as the title role in 1993, which was staged by Peter Martins from the 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version of the work. In 1994, Culkin appeared in three films: Getting Even with Dad (1994), The Pagemaster (1994) and Richie Rich (1994).

Culkin established himself as one of the most successful child actors of the 1990s.

[ 28 ] He grew tired of acting and retired after Richie Rich.

[ 18 ] Wanting a "normal life", he went to a private high school in Manhattan .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 1998, he appeared in the music video for the song " Sunday " by the rock band Sonic Youth .

Culkin headed back into motion pictures in 2003 with Party Monster , in which he played a role very different from those he was known for, that of party promoter Michael Alig , a drug user and murderer. He quickly followed that with a supporting part in Saved!

, as a cynical wheelchair-using, non-Christian student in a conservative Christian high school. Though Saved!

only had modest success at the box office, Culkin received positive reviews for his role in the film and its implications for a career as an adult actor.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Culkin began doing voice-over work, with appearances in Seth Green 's Robot Chicken . In 2005, he was ranked second on VH1 's list of the "100 Greatest Kid-Stars" behind Gary Coleman .

[ 38 ] Alexis Dziena , Kuno Becker and Eliza Dushku also star in this story of a couple whose therapist recommends they engage in group sex. Shooting for the film, Culkin's first since Saved!

, took place in September 2006. The film opened in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and was released on DVD on January 22, 2008, by First Look Pictures. Culkin's next project was a role in the thirteen-episode NBC television series Kings as Andrew Cross.

[ 39 ] In 2009, Culkin appeared in a UK-based commercial for Aviva Insurance (formerly Norwich Union) to help promote their company's rebranding. Culkin stared into the camera stating, "Remember me." [ citation needed ] On August 17, 2009, Culkin made a brief cameo appearance on WWE Raw at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri , following a "falls count anywhere" match between Hornswoggle and Chavo Guerrero Jr.

[ 41 ] Their tour began in Brooklyn on January 24, 2014.

[ 42 ] In late May 2014, Culkin stormed off stage at Rock City during his kazoo solo after fans began booing and throwing pints of beer at the band.

[ 43 ] They subsequently cancelled the remaining UK shows, though they claimed the cancellation had nothing to do with the Rock City performance.

[ 44 ] On July 10, 2016, Culkin announced that the Pizza Underground was splitting up and their next album would be the last.

[ 45 ] In July 2016, Culkin appeared in a television advertisement for Compare the Market .

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] In an advertisement for Google Assistant published on December 19, 2018, Culkin reprised his Home Alone role as Kevin McCallister after 28 years.

[ 50 ] It recreated scenes from the movie where McCallister shaved his face, jumped on the bed, and decorated the Christmas tree, all while asking Google Assistant to set reminders for him.

[ 51 ] In 2019, he had a role in Seth Green 's movie Changeland with his future wife, Brenda Song , [ 52 ] which was released on June 7, 2019.

[ 62 ] In December 2018, Culkin announced that he would legally change his name to "Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin" after holding a vote through his website to choose a new middle name, with "Macaulay Culkin" winning the vote over four other candidates.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] Shortly after their son's birth, comments Culkin made on a 2018 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience about his relationship with Song (a Hmong – Thai American ) resurfaced, which were criticized for stereotyping Asians .

[ 75 ] In the interview, Culkin joked about the shape of Song's eyes, their interracial relationship, and the appearance of their potential future children. He argued that he was entitled to make Asian jokes because of his relationship with Song, and because of his future fatherhood to multiracial children, stating that he would "understand the struggle".

[ 77 ] Friendships Around the time of the first Home Alone movie, Culkin became friends with the pop singer Michael Jackson [ 78 ] and appeared in Jackson's 1991 " Black or White " music video.

[ 80 ] Culkin attended Jackson's burial on September 3, 2009.

[ 81 ] Culkin is also the godfather of Jackson's children Paris Jackson , Prince and Michael Jr.
