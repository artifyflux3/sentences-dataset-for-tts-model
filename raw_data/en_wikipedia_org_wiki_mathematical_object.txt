A **mathematical object** is an [abstract concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_concept "Abstract concept") arising in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-2) Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols "Glossary of mathematical symbols"), and therefore can be involved in [formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulas "Formulas"). Commonly encountered mathematical objects include [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)"), [shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape "Shape"), [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), and [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"). Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), [proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(mathematics) "Proof (mathematics)"), and even [formal theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_(mathematical_logic) "Theory (mathematical logic)") are considered as mathematical objects in [proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory "Proof theory").

In [philosophy of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics "Philosophy of mathematics"), the concept of "mathematical objects" touches on topics of [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"), [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) "Identity (philosophy)"), and the [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(philosophy) "Nature (philosophy)") of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-3) In [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), objects are often considered [entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity "Entity") that possess [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy) "Property (philosophy)") and can stand in various [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(philosophy) "Relation (philosophy)") to one another.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-:0-4) Philosophers debate whether mathematical objects have an independent existence outside of [human thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought") ([realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_realism "Metaphysical realism")), or if their existence is dependent on mental constructs or language ([idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism") and [nominalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism#Mathematical_nominalism "Nominalism")). Objects can range from the [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_object "Concrete object"): such as [physical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_objects "Physical objects") usually studied in [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics"), to the [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(mathematics) "Abstraction (mathematics)"), studied in [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics"). What constitutes an "object" is foundational to many areas of philosophy, from [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") (the study of being) to [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") (the study of knowledge). In mathematics, objects are often seen as entities that exist independently of the [physical world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_world "Physical world"), raising questions about their ontological status.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-6) There are varying [schools of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_thought "School of thought") which offer different perspectives on the matter, and many famous mathematicians and philosophers each have differing opinions on which is more correct.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-7)

### Quine-Putnam indispensability

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_object&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Quine-Putnam indispensability")]

[Quine-Putnam indispensability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93Putnam_indispensability_argument "Quine–Putnam indispensability argument") is an argument for the existence of mathematical objects based on their [unreasonable effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences") in the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"). Every [branch of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science "Branches of science") relies largely on large and often vastly different areas of mathematics. From [physics'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") use of [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") to [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology")'s use of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") and [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") (see [mathematical biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology "Mathematical and theoretical biology")), not only does mathematics help with [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction "Prediction"), it allows these areas to have an elegant [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_mathematics "Language of mathematics") to express these ideas. Moreover, it is hard to imagine how areas like quantum mechanics and general relativity could have developed without their assistance from mathematics, and therefore, one could argue that mathematics is _indispensable_ to these theories. It is because of this unreasonable effectiveness and indispensability of mathematics that philosophers [Willard Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Quine "Willard Quine") and [Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam "Hilary Putnam") argue that we should believe the mathematical objects for which these theories depend actually exist, that is, we ought to have an [ontological commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_commitment "Ontological commitment") to them. The argument is described by the following [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism"):[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-8)

> ([Premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise") 1) We ought to have ontological commitment to all and only the entities that are indispensable to our best scientific theories.
> 
> 
> (Premise 2) Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific theories.
> 
> 
> ([Conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence")) We ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities

This argument resonates with a philosophy in [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics") called [Naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_naturalism "Metaphysical naturalism")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-9) (or sometimes Predicativism)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-10) which states that the only [authoritative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority "Authority") standards on existence are those of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science").

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plato-raphael.jpg)

Plato depicted in _[The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_School\_of\_Athens "The School of Athens")_ by [Raphael Sanzio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Sanzio "Raphael Sanzio")

[Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism") asserts that mathematical objects are seen as real, [abstract entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_and_concrete "Abstract and concrete") that exist independently of human [thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought"), often in some [Platonic realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_realm "Platonic realm"). Just as [physical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") like [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") exist, so do numbers and sets. And just as [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic) "Statement (logic)") about electrons and planets are true or false as these objects contain perfectly [objective properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy) "Property (philosophy)"), so are statements about numbers and sets. Mathematicians discover these objects rather than invent them.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-11)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-12) (See also: [Mathematical Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Contemporary_schools_of_thought "Philosophy of mathematics"))

Some notable platonists include:

*   **[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")**: The ancient [Greek philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy") who, though not a mathematician, laid the groundwork for Platonism by positing the existence of an abstract realm of perfect [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms "Theory of forms") or ideas, which influenced later thinkers in mathematics.
*   **[Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del "Kurt Gödel")**: A 20th-century logician and mathematician, Gödel was a strong proponent of mathematical Platonism, and his work in [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory") was a major influence on [modern platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism#Modern_platonism "Platonism")
*   **[Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose "Roger Penrose")**: A contemporary [mathematical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"), Penrose has argued for a Platonic view of mathematics, suggesting that mathematical truths exist in a realm of abstract reality that we discover.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-13)

[Nominalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism "Nominalism") denies the independent existence of mathematical objects. Instead, it suggests that they are merely [convenient fictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenient_fiction "Convenient fiction") or shorthand for describing relationships and structures within our language and theories. Under this view, mathematical objects do not have an existence beyond the symbols and concepts we use.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-15)

Some notable nominalists include:

*   **[Nelson Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Goodman "Nelson Goodman")**: A philosopher known for his work in the philosophy of science and nominalism. He argued against the existence of abstract objects, proposing instead that mathematical objects are merely a product of our linguistic and symbolic conventions.
*   **[Hartry Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartry_Field "Hartry Field")**: A [contemporary philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_philosophy "Contemporary philosophy") who has developed the form of nominalism called "[fictionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictionalism "Fictionalism")," which argues that mathematical statements are useful fictions that do not correspond to any actual abstract objects.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-16)

[Logicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicism "Logicism") asserts that all mathematical truths can be reduced to [logical truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth"), and a _ll_ objects forming the subject matter of those branches of mathematics are logical objects. In other words, mathematics is fundamentally a branch of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), and all mathematical concepts, [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), and truths can be derived from purely logical principles and definitions. Logicism faced challenges, particularly with the Russillian axioms, the Multiplicative axiom (now called the [Axiom of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice")) and his [Axiom of Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity "Axiom of infinity"), and later with the discovery of [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems "Gödel's incompleteness theorems"), which showed that any sufficiently powerful [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") (like those used to express [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic")) cannot be both [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic) "Completeness (logic)") and [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency"). This meant that not all mathematical truths could be derived purely from a logical system, undermining the logicist program.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-17)

Some notable logicists include:

*   **[Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege")**: Frege is often regarded as the founder of logicism. In his work, _[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Foundations\_of\_Arithmetic "The Foundations of Arithmetic")_ (Basic Laws of Arithmetic), Frege attempted to show that arithmetic could be derived from logical axioms. He developed a formal system that aimed to express all of arithmetic in terms of logic. Frege's work laid the groundwork for much of [modern logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_logic "Modern logic") and was highly influential, though it encountered difficulties, most notably [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox "Russell's paradox"), which revealed inconsistencies in Frege's system.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-18)
*   **[Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell")**: Russell, along with [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead"), further developed logicism in their monumental work _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia\_Mathematica "Principia Mathematica")_. They attempted to derive all of mathematics from a set of [logical axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_axioms "Logical axioms"), using a [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory") to avoid the paradoxes that Frege's system encountered. Although _Principia Mathematica_ was enormously influential, the effort to reduce all of mathematics to logic was ultimately seen as incomplete. However, it did advance the development of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_Logic "Formal Logic") and [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-Glock_2008_p._1-19)

[Mathematical formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics) "Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)") treats objects as symbols within a [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system"). The focus is on the manipulation of these symbols according to specified rules, rather than on the objects themselves. One common understanding of formalism takes mathematics as not a body of propositions representing an abstract piece of reality but much more akin to a game, bringing with it no more ontological commitment of objects or properties than playing [ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo "Ludo") or [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"). In this view, mathematics is about the consistency of formal systems rather than the discovery of pre-existing objects. Some philosophers consider logicism to be a type of formalism.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-20)

Some notable formalists include:

*   **[David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert")**: A leading mathematician of the early 20th century, Hilbert is one of the most prominent advocates of formalism as a foundation of mathematics (see [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program "Hilbert's program")). He believed that mathematics is a system of formal rules and that its truth lies in the consistency of these rules rather than any connection to an abstract reality.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-21)
*   **[Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl")**: German mathematician and philosopher who, while not strictly a formalist, contributed to formalist ideas, particularly in his work on the foundations of mathematics.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-22)[Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson") wrote that Weyl alone bore comparison with the "last great universal mathematicians of the nineteenth century", [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-Dyson-23)

[Mathematical constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics) "Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)") asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a specific example of a mathematical object in order to prove that an example exists. Contrastingly, in classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a [contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction") from that assumption. Such a [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction") might be called non-constructive, and a constructivist might reject it. The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the [existential quantifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantifier "Existential quantifier"), which is at odds with its classical interpretation.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-24) There are many forms of constructivism.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-25) These include [Brouwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer "L. E. J. Brouwer")'s program of [intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism "Intuitionism"), the [finitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism "Finitism") of [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") and [Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernays "Paul Bernays"), the constructive recursive mathematics of mathematicians [Shanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Aleksandrovich_Shanin "Nikolai Aleksandrovich Shanin") and [Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov_(Soviet_mathematician) "Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)"), and [Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errett_Bishop "Errett Bishop")'s program of [constructive analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_analysis "Constructive analysis").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-26) Constructivism also includes the study of [constructive set theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_set_theory "Constructive set theory") such as [Constructive Zermelo–Fraenkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CZF "CZF") and the study of philosophy.

Some notable constructivists include:

*   **[L. E. J. Brouwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer "L. E. J. Brouwer")**: Dutch mathematician and philosopher regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, known for (among other things) pioneering the [intuitionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism "Intuitionism") movement to mathematical logic, and opposition of David Hilbert's formalism movement (see: [Brouwer–Hilbert controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer%E2%80%93Hilbert_controversy "Brouwer–Hilbert controversy")).
*   **[Errett Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errett_Bishop "Errett Bishop")**: American mathematician known for his work on analysis. He is best known for developing [constructive analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_analysis "Constructive analysis") in his 1967 _Foundations of Constructive Analysis_, where he proved most of the important theorems in [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis") using constructivist methods.

[Structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_mathematics) "Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)") suggests that mathematical objects are defined by their place within a structure or system. The nature of a number, for example, is not tied to any particular thing, but to its role within the system of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"). In a sense, the thesis is that mathematical objects (if there are such objects) simply have no intrinsic nature.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-27)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-28)

Some notable structuralists include:

*   **[Paul Benacerraf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Benacerraf "Paul Benacerraf")**: A philosopher known for his work in the philosophy of mathematics, particularly his paper "What Numbers Could Not Be," which argues for a structuralist view of mathematical objects.
*   **[Stewart Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Shapiro "Stewart Shapiro")**: Another prominent philosopher who has developed and defended structuralism, especially in his book _Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-29)

### Objects versus mappings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_object&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Objects versus mappings")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Function_color_example_3.svg/250px-Function_color_example_3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Function_color_example_3.svg)

In mathematics, a [**map** or **mapping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)"), is a function in the general sense; here as in the association of any of the four colored shapes in X to its color in Y.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-30)

[Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege") famously distinguished between _[functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function\_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")_ and _objects_.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-31) According to his view, a function is a kind of ‘incomplete’ [entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity "Entity") that [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)") arguments to values, and is denoted by an incomplete expression, whereas an object is a ‘complete’ entity and can be denoted by a singular term. Frege reduced [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy) "Property (philosophy)") and [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(philosophy) "Relation (philosophy)") to functions and so these entities are not included among the objects. Some authors make use of Frege's notion of ‘object’ when discussing abstract objects.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-32) But though Frege's sense of ‘object’ is important, it is not the only way to use the term. Other philosophers include properties and relations among the abstract objects. And when the background context for discussing objects is [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory"), properties and relations of higher type (e.g., properties of properties, and properties of relations) may be all be considered ‘objects’. This latter use of ‘object’ is interchangeable with ‘entity.’ It is this more broad interpretation that mathematicians mean when they use the term 'object'.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object#cite_note-33)
