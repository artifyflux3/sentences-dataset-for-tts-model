It was originally developed by German scientist Josef Sauter in the late 1920s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is defined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same volume/surface area ratio as a particle of interest.
Several methods have been devised to obtain a good estimate of the SMD.

Definition [ edit ] The Sauter diameter ( SD , also denoted D [3,2] or d 32 ) for a given particle is defined as: S D = d v 3 d s 2 {\displaystyle SD={\frac {d_{v}^{3}}{d_{s}^{2}}}} where d s is the so-called surface diameter and d v is the volume diameter , defined as: d s = A p π π {\displaystyle d_{s}={\sqrt {\frac {A_{p}}{\pi }}}} d v = ( 6 V p π π ) 1 / 3 , {\displaystyle d_{v}=\left({\frac {6V_{p}}{\pi }}\right)^{1/3},} The quantities A p and V p are the ordinary surface area and volume of the particle, respectively.

The equation may be simplified further as: S D = 6 V p A p .

{\displaystyle SD=6{\frac {V_{p}}{A_{p}}}.} This is usually taken as the mean of several measurements n , to obtain the Sauter mean diameter (SMD): S M D = ∑ ∑ i n S D i / n {\displaystyle SMD=\sum _{i}^{n}SD_{i}/n} This provides intrinsic data that help determine the particle size for fluid problems.

Applications [ edit ] The SMD can be defined as the diameter of a drop having the same volume / surface area ratio as the entire spray.

SMD is especially important in calculations where the active surface area is important.  Such areas include catalysis and applications in fuel combustion.
