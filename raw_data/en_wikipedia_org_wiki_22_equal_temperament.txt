Play ⓘ Each step represents a frequency ratio of 22 √ 2 , or 54.55 cents ( Play ⓘ ).

When composing with 22-ET, one needs to take into account a variety of considerations. Considering the 5-limit , there is a difference between 3 fifths and the sum of 1 fourth and 1 major third. It means that, starting from C, there are two A's—one 16 steps and one 17 steps away. There is also a difference between a major tone and a minor tone. In C major, the second note (D) will be 4 steps away. However, in A minor, where A is 6 steps below C, the fourth note (D) will be 9 steps above A, so 3 steps above C. So when switching from C major to A minor, one needs to slightly change the D note. These discrepancies arise because, unlike 12-ET , 22-ET does not temper out the syntonic comma of 81/80, but instead exaggerates its size by mapping it to one step.

In the 7-limit , the septimal minor seventh (7/4) can be distinguished from the sum of a fifth (3/2) and a minor third (6/5), and the septimal subminor third (7/6) is different from the minor third (6/5). This mapping tempers out the septimal comma of 64/63, which allows 22-ET to function as a "Superpythagorean" system where four stacked fifths are equated with the septimal major third (9/7) rather than the usual pental third of 5/4. This system is a "mirror image" of septimal meantone in many ways: meantone systems tune the fifth flat so that intervals of 5 are simple while intervals of 7 are complex, superpythagorean systems have the fifth tuned sharp so that intervals of 7 are simple while intervals of 5 are complex. The enharmonic structure is also reversed: sharps are sharper than flats, similar to Pythagorean tuning (and by extension 53 equal temperament ), but to a greater degree.

Finally, 22-ET has a good approximation of the 11th harmonic, and is in fact the smallest equal temperament to be consistent in the 11-limit .

The net effect is that 22-ET allows (and to some extent even forces) the exploration of new musical territory, while still having excellent approximations of common practice consonances.

History and use [ edit ] The idea of dividing the octave into 22 steps of equal size seems to have originated with nineteenth-century music theorist RHM Bosanquet . Inspired by the use of a 22-tone unequal division of the octave in the music theory of India , Bosanquet noted that a 22-tone equal division was capable of representing 5-limit music with tolerable accuracy.

[ 1 ] In this he was followed in the twentieth century by theorist José Würschmidt , who noted it as a possible next step after 19 equal temperament , and J. Murray Barbour in his survey of tuning history, Tuning and Temperament .

[ 2 ] Contemporary advocates of 22 equal temperament include music theorist Paul Erlich and electronic music composer Sevish .

Notation [ edit ] Circle of fifths in 22 tone equal temperament, "ups and downs" notation Circle of edosteps in 22 tone equal temperament, "ups and downs" notation 22-EDO can be notated several ways. The first, Ups And Downs Notation , [ 3 ] uses up and down arrows, written as a caret and a lower-case "v", usually in a sans-serif font. One arrow equals one edostep. In note names, the arrows come first, to facilitate chord naming. This yields the following chromatic scale: C, ^C/D ♭ , vC ♯ /^D ♭ , C ♯ /vD, D, ^D/E ♭ , vD ♯ /^E ♭ , D ♯ /vE, E, F, ^F/G ♭ , vF ♯ /^G ♭ , F ♯ /vG, G, ^G/A ♭ , vG ♯ /^A ♭ , G ♯ /vA, A, ^A/B ♭ , vA ♯ /^B ♭ , A ♯ /vB, B, C The Pythagorean minor chord with 32/27 on C is still named Cm and still spelled C–E ♭ –G. But the 5-limit up minor chord uses the upminor 3rd 6/5 and is spelled C–^E ♭ –G. This chord is named C^m. Compare with ^Cm (^C–^E ♭ –^G).

The second, Quarter Tone Notation , uses half-sharps and half-flats instead of up and down arrows: C, C , C ♯ /D ♭ , D , D, D , D ♯ /E ♭ , E , E, F, F , F ♯ /G ♭ , G , G, G , G ♯ /A ♭ , A , A, A , A ♯ /B ♭ , B , B, C However, chords and some enharmonic equivalences are much different than they are in 12-EDO. For example, even though a 5-limit C minor triad is notated as C–E ♭ –G , C major triads are now C–E –G instead of C–E–G , and an A minor triad is now A–C –E even though an A major triad is still A–C ♯ –E . Additionally, while major seconds such as C–D are divided as expected into 4 quarter tones, minor seconds such as E–F and B–C are 1 quarter tone, not 2. Thus E ♯ is now equivalent to F instead of F, F ♭ is equivalent to E instead of E, F is equivalent to E , and E is equivalent to F . Furthermore, the note a fifth above B is not the expected F ♯ but rather F or G , and the note that is a fifth below F is now B instead of B ♭ .

The third, Porcupine Notation, introduces no new accidentals, but significantly changes chord spellings (e.g. the 5-limit major triad is now C–E ♯ –G ♯ ). In addition, enharmonic equivalences from 12-EDO are no longer valid. This yields the following chromatic scale: C, C ♯ , D ♭ ,
D, D ♯ , E ♭ ,
E, E ♯ , F ♭ ,
F, F ♯ , G ♭ ,
G, G ♯ , G /A , A ♭ ,
A, A ♯ , B ♭ ,
B, B ♯ , C ♭ , C Interval size [ edit ] Just intervals approximated in 22 equal temperament The table below gives the sizes of some common intervals in 22 equal temperament. Intervals shown with a shaded background—such as the septimal tritones—are more than 1/4 of a step (approximately 13.6 cents) out of tune, when compared to the just ratios they approximate.
