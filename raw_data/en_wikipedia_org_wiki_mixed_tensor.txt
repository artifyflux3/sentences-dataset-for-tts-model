( October 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In tensor analysis , a mixed tensor is a tensor which is neither strictly covariant nor strictly contravariant ; at least one of the indices of a mixed tensor will be a subscript (covariant) and at least one of the indices will be a superscript (contravariant).

A mixed tensor of type or valence ( M N ) {\textstyle {\binom {M}{N}}} , also written "type ( M , N )", with both M > 0 and N > 0, is a tensor which has M contravariant indices and N covariant indices.  Such a tensor can be defined as a linear function which maps an ( M + N )-tuple of M one-forms and N vectors to a scalar .

Changing the tensor type [ edit ] Main article: Raising and lowering indices Consider the following octet of related tensors: T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ , T α α β β γ γ .

{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta \gamma },\ T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.} The first one is covariant, the last one contravariant, and the remaining ones mixed.  Notationally, these tensors differ from each other by the covariance/contravariance of their indices.  A given contravariant index of a tensor can be lowered using the metric tensor g μν , and a given covariant index can be raised using the inverse metric tensor g μν .  Thus, g μν could be called the index lowering operator and g μν the index raising operator .

Generally, the covariant metric tensor, contracted with a tensor of type ( M , N ), yields a tensor of type ( M − 1, N + 1), whereas its contravariant inverse, contracted with a tensor of type ( M , N ), yields a tensor of type ( M + 1, N − 1).

Examples [ edit ] As an example, a mixed tensor of type (1, 2) can be obtained by raising an index of a covariant tensor of type (0, 3), T α α β β λ λ = T α α β β γ γ g γ γ λ λ , {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\gamma \lambda },} where T α α β β λ λ {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }} is the same tensor as T α α β β γ γ {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma }} , because T α α β β λ λ δ δ λ λ γ γ = T α α β β γ γ , {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }\,\delta _{\lambda }{}^{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },} with Kronecker δ acting here like an identity matrix.

Likewise, T α α λ λ γ γ = T α α β β γ γ g β β λ λ , {\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda }{}_{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda },} T α α λ λ ϵ ϵ = T α α β β γ γ g β β λ λ g γ γ ϵ ϵ , {\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda \epsilon }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda }\,g^{\gamma \epsilon },} T α α β β γ γ = g γ γ λ λ T α α β β λ λ , {\displaystyle T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma }=g_{\gamma \lambda }\,T^{\alpha \beta \lambda },} T α α λ λ ϵ ϵ = g λ λ β β g ϵ ϵ γ γ T α α β β γ γ .

{\displaystyle T^{\alpha }{}_{\lambda \epsilon }=g_{\lambda \beta }\,g_{\epsilon \gamma }\,T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.} Raising an index of the metric tensor is equivalent to contracting it with its inverse, yielding the Kronecker delta , g μ μ λ λ g λ λ ν ν = g μ μ ν ν = δ δ μ μ ν ν , {\displaystyle g^{\mu \lambda }\,g_{\lambda \nu }=g^{\mu }{}_{\nu }=\delta ^{\mu }{}_{\nu },} so any mixed version of the metric tensor will be equal to the Kronecker delta, which will also be mixed.
