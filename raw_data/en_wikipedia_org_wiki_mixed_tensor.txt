 You deserve an explanation 

August 18: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Monday, August 18, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Tensor having both covariant and contravariant indices

![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png)This article includes a [list of references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources"), [related reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Further_reading "Wikipedia:Further reading"), or [external links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links "Wikipedia:External links"), **but its sources remain unclear because it lacks [inline citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")**. Please help [improve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check "Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check") this article by [introducing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite "Wikipedia:When to cite") more precise citations._(October 2021)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Maintenance\_template\_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal"))_

In [tensor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_analysis "Tensor analysis"), a **mixed tensor** is a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") which is neither strictly [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") nor strictly [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors"); at least one of the indices of a mixed tensor will be a subscript (covariant) and at least one of the indices will be a superscript (contravariant).

A mixed tensor of **type** or **valence**(M N){\textstyle {\binom {M}{N}}}![Image 27: {\textstyle {\binom {M}{N}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b1a1eb383d54c8dcf85cd56960f21ccd6a9a138), also written "type (_M_, _N_)", with both _M_> 0 and _N_> 0, is a tensor which has _M_ contravariant indices and _N_ covariant indices. Such a tensor can be defined as a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator "Linear operator") which maps an (_M_ + _N_)-tuple of _M_[one-forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-form "One-form") and _N_[vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") to a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)").

Changing the tensor type
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mixed_tensor&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Changing the tensor type")]

Main article: [Raising and lowering indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_and_lowering_indices "Raising and lowering indices")

Consider the following octet of related tensors: T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ,T α β γ.{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta \gamma },\ T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.}![Image 28: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta \gamma },\ T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T_{\alpha }{}^{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta \gamma },\ T^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }{}^{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma },\ T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38cf7ce947c2157d962dadb4124c7f7b6a58ac2b) The first one is covariant, the last one contravariant, and the remaining ones mixed. Notationally, these tensors differ from each other by the covariance/contravariance of their indices. A given contravariant index of a tensor can be lowered using the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")_g_ _μν_, and a given covariant index can be raised using the inverse metric tensor _g_ _μν_. Thus, _g_ _μν_ could be called the _index lowering operator_ and _g_ _μν_ the _index raising operator_.

Generally, the covariant metric tensor, contracted with a tensor of type (_M_, _N_), yields a tensor of type (_M_ − 1, _N_ + 1), whereas its contravariant inverse, contracted with a tensor of type (_M_, _N_), yields a tensor of type (_M_ + 1, _N_ − 1).

### Examples

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mixed_tensor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Examples")]

As an example, a mixed tensor of type (1, 2) can be obtained by raising an index of a covariant tensor of type (0, 3), T α β λ=T α β γ g γ λ,{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\gamma \lambda },}![Image 29: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\gamma \lambda },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f29c733c609322382f11e5530f1874b7809b4b7f) where T α β λ{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }}![Image 30: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc6b4a46f199a1a3f7b330b633706dbdbd4d1f64) is the same tensor as T α β γ{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma }}![Image 31: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b34b1531e8ad4ad85ed657cb72a74a2774d3f5c6), because T α β λ δ λ γ=T α β γ,{\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }\,\delta _{\lambda }{}^{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },}![Image 32: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\lambda }\,\delta _{\lambda }{}^{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta }{}^{\gamma },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38f3e16ea209187e7a8cadb8324bcea42acfcbb7) with Kronecker _δ_ acting here like an identity matrix.

Likewise, T α λ γ=T α β γ g β λ,{\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda }{}_{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda },}![Image 33: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda }{}_{\gamma }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00d6b882cfb505a4cac87030d1f44e69bbda4355)T α λ ϵ=T α β γ g β λ g γ ϵ,{\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda \epsilon }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda }\,g^{\gamma \epsilon },}![Image 34: {\displaystyle T_{\alpha }{}^{\lambda \epsilon }=T_{\alpha \beta \gamma }\,g^{\beta \lambda }\,g^{\gamma \epsilon },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad9794ef6b255bf40002a1d20fad7f24f32f348b)T α β γ=g γ λ T α β λ,{\displaystyle T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma }=g_{\gamma \lambda }\,T^{\alpha \beta \lambda },}![Image 35: {\displaystyle T^{\alpha \beta }{}_{\gamma }=g_{\gamma \lambda }\,T^{\alpha \beta \lambda },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2bb2329b18fb01638642b77103e974077e88d9b)T α λ ϵ=g λ β g ϵ γ T α β γ.{\displaystyle T^{\alpha }{}_{\lambda \epsilon }=g_{\lambda \beta }\,g_{\epsilon \gamma }\,T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.}![Image 36: {\displaystyle T^{\alpha }{}_{\lambda \epsilon }=g_{\lambda \beta }\,g_{\epsilon \gamma }\,T^{\alpha \beta \gamma }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ebef7f9a2cec47e5ebe6722265998ce879be1a7)

Raising an index of the metric tensor is equivalent to contracting it with its inverse, yielding the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta "Kronecker delta"), g μ λ g λ ν=g μ ν=δ μ ν,{\displaystyle g^{\mu \lambda }\,g_{\lambda \nu }=g^{\mu }{}_{\nu }=\delta ^{\mu }{}_{\nu },}![Image 37: {\displaystyle g^{\mu \lambda }\,g_{\lambda \nu }=g^{\mu }{}_{\nu }=\delta ^{\mu }{}_{\nu },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c049f63d32d99d7d73d4394e0c96e0072939b23e) so any mixed version of the metric tensor will be equal to the Kronecker delta, which will also be mixed.
