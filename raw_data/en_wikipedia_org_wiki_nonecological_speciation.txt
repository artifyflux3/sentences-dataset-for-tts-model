Environmental interactions, for example, could consist of adaptations specific to foraging or a unique environment, whereas compatibility in reproduction involves mate-recognition morphology, communication systems, or other behaviors. Ecological speciation necessitates changes in both, whereas non-ecological speciation only changes compatibility in reproduction.

When speciation is not driven by (or strongly correlated with) divergent natural selection , it can be said to be nonecological , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] to distinguish it from the typical definition of ecological speciation : "It is useful to consider ecological speciation as its own form of species formation because it focuses on an explicit mechanism of speciation: namely divergent natural selection. There are numerous ways other than via divergent natural selection in which populations might become genetically differentiated and reproductively isolated." [ 3 ] Many instances of non-ecological speciation are likely allopatric , especially when the organisms in question are poor dispersers (e.g., land snails , salamanders ); however, sympatric non-ecological speciation may also be possible, especially when accompanied by an "instant" (at least in evolutionary time) loss of reproductive compatibility, as when polyploidization happens.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] Other potential mechanisms for non-ecological speciation include mutation-order speciation [ 5 ] and changes in chirality in gastropods .

[ 6 ] Non-ecological speciation might not be accompanied by strong morphological differentiation, so it might give rise to cryptic species ; however, some species are difficult for humans to differentiate that are strongly differentiated concerning their resource use and so are likely a result of ecological speciation (e.g., host shifts in parasites or phytophagous insects).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] When species recognition/sexual selection plays a strong role in maintaining species boundaries, the species generated by non-ecological speciation might be straightforward for humans to differentiate, as in some odonates .
