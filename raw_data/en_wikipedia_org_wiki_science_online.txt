[ 1 ] It was attended primarily by bloggers and science journalists from North America.

The conference was held annually, beginning in 2007.  Notable attendees included PZ Myers , Jennifer Ouellette , Rebecca Skloot , Carl Zimmer and others.  The conferences were covered as local news by publications such as The Charlotte Observer , [ 2 ] as well as "new media" like Boing Boing , [ 3 ] professional journalist organizations like the Columbia Journalism Review [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and science-oriented publications like Scientific American .

[ 6 ] In October 2014, the ScienceOnline foundation, which organized the conferences, announced that it had become insolvent and consequently was shutting down.
