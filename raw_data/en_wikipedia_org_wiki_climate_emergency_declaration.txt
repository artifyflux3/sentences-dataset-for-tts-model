The first such declaration was made by a local government ( Darebin , Melbourne ) in December 2016.

[ 2 ] Since then, over 2,100 local governments in 39 countries have made climate emergency declarations as of May 2022. Populations covered by jurisdictions that have declared a climate emergency amount to over 1 billion citizens.

[ 3 ] On 29 April 2019, the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency, which was subsequently passed by its parliament, the Senedd , on 1 May 2019, when it became the fourth country in the world to officially declare a climate emergency.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Once a government makes a declaration, the next step for the declaring government is to set priorities to mitigate climate change , prior to ultimately entering a state of emergency or equivalent.

[ 7 ] In declaring a climate emergency, a government admits that climate change (or global warming) exists and that the measures taken up to this point are not enough to limit the changes brought by it. The decision stresses the need for the government and administration to devise measures that try to stop human-caused global warming.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The declarations can be made on different levels, for example, at a national or local government level, and they can differ in depth and detail in their guidelines. The term climate emergency does not only describe formal decisions, but also includes actions to avert climate breakdown. This is supposed to justify and focus the governing body towards climate action. The specific term emergency is used to assign priority to the topic, and to generate a mindset of urgency.

The term climate emergency has been promoted by climate activists and pro-climate action politicians to add a sense of urgency for responding to a long-term problem.

[ 10 ] A United Nations Development Programme survey of public opinion in 50 countries found that sixty-four percent of 1.2 million respondents believe climate change is a global emergency.

[ 11 ] Terminology [ edit ] For further discussion regarding terminology, see Climate crisis § Alternative terminology .

Google Trends data shows a growth in searches for the terms climate emergency (shown in red ) and climate crisis (shown in blue ).

Terms like "climate emergency" and "climate crisis" have often been used by activists, and are increasingly found in academic papers.

[ 12 ] Climate emergency as a term was used in protests against climate change before 2010 (e.g. the "Climate-Emergency-Rally" in Melbourne in June 2009 [ 13 ] ). In 2017 the city council of Darebin adopted multiple measures named "Darebin Climate Emergency Plan". On 4 December 2018, the Club of Rome presented their "Climate Emergency Plan", which included 10 high-priority measures to limit global warming.

[ 14 ] With the rise of movements like Extinction Rebellion [ 15 ] and School Strike for Climate , the concern has been picked up by various governments.

Multiple European cities and communities who declared a climate emergency are simultaneously members of the Klima-Bündnis (German for climate alliance ), which obligates them to lower their CO 2 emissions by 10% every five years.

Oxford Dictionary chose climate emergency as the word of the year for 2019 and defines the term as "a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it." Usage of the term soared more than 10,000% between September 2018 and September 2019.

[ 16 ] History [ edit ] Australian climate activists demand the declaration of a climate emergency on 13 June 2009 at the "Climate Emergency Rally" during the annual Earth Day in Melbourne , Australia.

[ 29 ] He also argued against "the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves" and stated that "fossil fuels should remain underground." [ 29 ] On 10 July 2019, networks representing more than 7,000 higher and further education institutions from six continents announced that they are declaring a Climate Emergency, and agreed to undertake a three-point plan to address the crisis through their work with students.

[ 30 ] Some statements were criticized for not including specific measures.

[ 31 ] In June 2019, Councillor Trent McCarthy of the City of Darebin brought together councillors and parliamentarians in Australia and around the world for two online link-ups to connect the work of climate emergency-declared councils and governments. Following these link-ups and a successful motion at the National General Assembly of Local Government , McCarthy announced the formation of Climate Emergency Australia , a new network of Australian governments and councils advocating for a climate emergency response.

The survey found that climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world in seven out of the eight countries surveyed.

[ 33 ] In September 2019, the Australian Medical Association officially declared climate change a public health emergency.

[ 34 ] The AMA noted that climate change will cause "higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress, injury and mortality from increasingly severe weather events; increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases; food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs; [and] a higher incidence of mental-ill health." [ 34 ] The AMA has called on the Australian Government to adopt a carbon budget; reduce emissions; and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, among other proposals to mitigate the health impacts of climate change .

[ 34 ] Younger generations are putting extra attention on the effects of climate change, which could help lower the number of climate emergencies.

[ 35 ] The Australian Greens Party have called on the federal Parliament to declare a climate emergency. Greens MP for Melbourne, Adam Bandt , welcomed the UK Parliament's declaration of a climate emergency and argued that Australia should follow their lead.

[ 40 ] On 5 November 2019, the journal BioScience published an article endorsed by a further 11,000 scientists from 153 nations, that states there is a global Climate Emergency ("We declare clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency") and that the world's people face "untold suffering due to the climate crisis" unless there are major transformations to global society.

[ 42 ] On 28 July 2021, BioScience published another article, stating, that more than 2,800 additional scientists have signed that declaration; and that in addition, 1,990 jurisdictions in 34 countries have formally declared or recognized a climate emergency.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Criticism [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( November 2024 ) Declaring a climate emergency has been criticized for giving the idea of a need for authoritarian and anti-democratic policies, [ 183 ] with critics saying democracy is essential for the long-term success of climate policies.

[ 184 ] Additionally, it is seen by some critics as ineffective in combating climate change. They point to psychological impacts, the emphasis on quick short term changes rather than systemic and the lack of plans, targets and resource shifts to back up their declaration as potential problems.

[ 185 ] Climate emergency declarations also lead to widespread fear and guilt, which can inhibit action.

[ 186 ] They can arouse feelings of helplessness or hopelessness that prevent people from pursuing actual solutions, otherwise known as eco-anxiety . People facing such fear are more likely to ignore climate change in an effort to ease those fears or even be pushed into polarized ideology like climate denial .

[ 187 ] While climate emergency declarations are intended to signal urgent action, they have attracted criticism for potentially promoting authoritarian and anti-democratic approaches. Scholars argue that invoking an "emergency" framework may concentrate power in the executive branch, circumventing democratic checks and balances and normal legislative processes.

[ 188 ] Some environmental theorists associate this with "eco-authoritarianism"—a concept where urgent ecological goals justify reduced civil liberties and increased state control.

[ 189 ] Critics also note that emergency rhetoric can be used to justify restrictions on free speech and the right to protest, particularly in countries with already fragile democratic institutions.

[ 190 ] There are concerns that such declarations might enable human rights abuses, especially among marginalized populations like indigenous groups and climate refugees.

[ 191 ] Some argue that the use of war metaphors, such as calling for a “World War II-style climate mobilization,” risks legitimizing extreme, centralized control.

[ 192 ] Furthermore, the psychological effect of constant "emergency" framing can foster anxiety and inaction rather than empowerment.

[ 193 ] Other critiques highlight the symbolic nature of such declarations, often unaccompanied by concrete policy plans or funding, reducing them to performative gestures.

[ 194 ] Legal experts also raise alarms about the long-term precedent these emergency powers may set for governments to bypass democratic procedures in future crises.

[ 195 ] Finally, democratic participation is widely seen as essential for successful climate action, and critics argue that bypassing inclusive debate in the name of urgency may erode public trust and social cohesion.
