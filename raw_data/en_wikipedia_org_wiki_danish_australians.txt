History of immigration [ edit ] There was some Danish immigration at the time of the Australian gold rushes . It was estimated that there were 1,000 Danes on the Victorian goldfields .

[ 2 ] Danish immigrants had a significant effect on the  Australian dairy industry from the 1880s, in particular establishing and managing butter factories.

[ 2 ] Danes in Tasmania [ edit ] During the 1870s, a number of East Prussian and Danish Lutherans arrived in Tasmania. Most of them settled in the farming district of Bismarck , attracted by the cheap land and an abundance of clean water. The area was declared a town in 1881.

[ 3 ] Lutheranism was very slow to establish in Tasmania. Due to the absence of a Lutheran church, some of the Germans in Bismarck joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church , which arrived in the region in 1889.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] A Lutheran church was finally opened in Hobart on 11 August 1871 [ 6 ] and remains active today [ 7 ] but none was ever built in Bismarck.

Post-war migration [ edit ] There was little emigration from Denmark to Australia in the first half of the twentieth century: in 1901, Australia had a population of 6,281 people who had been born in Denmark; in 1947, that number had slackened to 2,759. At both counts, the population was approximately 75% male. Danish men married women of other ethnicities in Australia, which made it harder for the community to maintain its identity.

[ 2 ] Danish citizens were within the scope of Australia's Post-war immigration scheme .  From a population of 2,954 Danish Australians in 1954, there were 7,911 Danes living in Australia in 1981. Masculinity ratios were healthier, with 58% of these being males.

[ 2 ] At the 2006 Census, 8,963 Australian residents declared they were born in Denmark .

[ 8 ] In addition, 50,413 Australian residents claimed Danish ancestry, either singularly or with another ancestry.

[ 9 ] [ verification needed ] Culture [ edit ] There is a Danish Australian Cultural Society.

[ 10 ] The Australian Danish community has been written about in books.

[ 11 ] The Danish Royal Life Guards have a chapter of their veterans association in Australia.
