Together with the first fundamental form , it serves to define extrinsic invariants of the surface, its principal curvatures . More generally, such a quadratic form is defined for a smooth immersed submanifold in a Riemannian manifold .

Surface in R 3 [ edit ] Definition of second fundamental form Motivation [ edit ] The second fundamental form of a parametric surface S in R 3 was introduced and studied by Gauss . First suppose that the surface is the graph of a twice continuously differentiable function, z = f ( x , y ) , and that the plane z = 0 is tangent to the surface at the origin. Then f and its partial derivatives with respect to x and y vanish at (0,0). Therefore, the Taylor expansion of f at (0,0) starts with quadratic terms: z = L x 2 2 + M x y + N y 2 2 + higher order terms , {\displaystyle z=L{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}+Mxy+N{\frac {y^{2}}{2}}+{\text{higher order terms}}\,,} and the second fundamental form at the origin in the coordinates ( x , y ) is the quadratic form L d x 2 + 2 M d x d y + N d y 2 .

{\displaystyle L\,dx^{2}+2M\,dx\,dy+N\,dy^{2}\,.} For a smooth point P on S , one can choose the coordinate system so that the plane z = 0 is tangent to S at P , and define the second fundamental form in the same way.

Classical notation [ edit ] The second fundamental form of a general parametric surface is defined as follows. Let r = r ( u , v ) be a regular parametrization of a surface in R 3 , where r is a smooth vector-valued function of two variables. It is common to denote the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v by r u and r v . Regularity of the parametrization means that r u and r v are linearly independent for any ( u , v ) in the domain of r , and hence span the tangent plane to S at each point. Equivalently, the cross product r u × r v is a nonzero vector normal to the surface. The parametrization thus defines a field of unit normal vectors n : n = r u × × r v | r u × × r v | .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ={\frac {\mathbf {r} _{u}\times \mathbf {r} _{v}}{|\mathbf {r} _{u}\times \mathbf {r} _{v}|}}\,.} The second fundamental form is usually written as I I = L d u 2 + 2 M d u d v + N d v 2 , {\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} =L\,du^{2}+2M\,du\,dv+N\,dv^{2}\,,} its matrix in the basis { r u , r v } of the tangent plane is [ L M M N ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}L&M\\M&N\end{bmatrix}}\,.} The coefficients L , M , N at a given point in the parametric uv -plane are given by the projections of the second partial derivatives of r at that point onto the normal line to S and can be computed with the aid of the dot product as follows: L = r u u ⋅ ⋅ n , M = r u v ⋅ ⋅ n , N = r v v ⋅ ⋅ n .

{\displaystyle L=\mathbf {r} _{uu}\cdot \mathbf {n} \,,\quad M=\mathbf {r} _{uv}\cdot \mathbf {n} \,,\quad N=\mathbf {r} _{vv}\cdot \mathbf {n} \,.} For a signed distance field of Hessian H , the second fundamental form coefficients can be computed as follows: L = − − r u ⋅ ⋅ H ⋅ ⋅ r u , M = − − r u ⋅ ⋅ H ⋅ ⋅ r v , N = − − r v ⋅ ⋅ H ⋅ ⋅ r v .

{\displaystyle L=-\mathbf {r} _{u}\cdot \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {r} _{u}\,,\quad M=-\mathbf {r} _{u}\cdot \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {r} _{v}\,,\quad N=-\mathbf {r} _{v}\cdot \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {r} _{v}\,.} Physicist's notation [ edit ] The second fundamental form of a general parametric surface S is defined as follows.

Let r = r ( u 1 , u 2 ) be a regular parametrization of a surface in R 3 , where r is a smooth vector-valued function of two variables. It is common to denote the partial derivatives of r with respect to u α by r α , α = 1, 2 . Regularity of the parametrization means that r 1 and r 2 are linearly independent for any ( u 1 , u 2 ) in the domain of r , and hence span the tangent plane to S at each point. Equivalently, the cross product r 1 × r 2 is a nonzero vector normal to the surface. The parametrization thus defines a field of unit normal vectors n : n = r 1 × × r 2 | r 1 × × r 2 | .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ={\frac {\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {r} _{2}}{|\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {r} _{2}|}}\,.} The second fundamental form is usually written as I I = b α α β β d u α α d u β β .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} =b_{\alpha \beta }\,du^{\alpha }\,du^{\beta }\,.} The equation above uses the Einstein summation convention .

The coefficients b αβ at a given point in the parametric u 1 u 2 -plane are given by the projections of the second partial derivatives of r at that point onto the normal line to S and can be computed in terms of the normal vector n as follows: b α α β β = r , α α β β γ γ n γ γ .

{\displaystyle b_{\alpha \beta }=r_{,\alpha \beta }^{\ \ \,\gamma }n_{\gamma }\,.} Hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold [ edit ] In Euclidean space , the second fundamental form is given by I I ( v , w ) = − − ⟨ ⟨ d ν ν ( v ) , w ⟩ ⟩ ν ν {\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} (v,w)=-\langle d\nu (v),w\rangle \nu } where ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the Gauss map , and d ν ν {\displaystyle d\nu } the differential of ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } regarded as a vector-valued differential form , and the brackets denote the metric tensor of Euclidean space.

More generally, on a Riemannian manifold, the second fundamental form is an equivalent way to describe the shape operator (denoted by S ) of a hypersurface, I I ( v , w ) = ⟨ ⟨ S ( v ) , w ⟩ ⟩ = − − ⟨ ⟨ ∇ ∇ v n , w ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ n , ∇ ∇ v w ⟩ ⟩ , {\displaystyle \mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (v,w)=\langle S(v),w\rangle =-\langle \nabla _{v}n,w\rangle =\langle n,\nabla _{v}w\rangle \,,} where ∇ v w denotes the covariant derivative of the ambient manifold and n a field of normal vectors on the hypersurface.  (If the affine connection is torsion-free , then the second fundamental form is symmetric.) The sign of the second fundamental form depends on the choice of direction of n (which is called a co-orientation of the hypersurface - for surfaces in Euclidean space, this is equivalently given by a choice of orientation of the surface).

Generalization to arbitrary codimension [ edit ] The second fundamental form can be generalized to arbitrary codimension . In that case it is a quadratic form on the tangent space with values in the normal bundle and it can be defined by I I ( v , w ) = ( ∇ ∇ v w ) ⊥ ⊥ , {\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I} (v,w)=(\nabla _{v}w)^{\bot }\,,} where ( ∇ ∇ v w ) ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle (\nabla _{v}w)^{\bot }} denotes the orthogonal projection of covariant derivative ∇ ∇ v w {\displaystyle \nabla _{v}w} onto the normal bundle.

In Euclidean space , the curvature tensor of a submanifold can be described by the following formula: ⟨ ⟨ R ( u , v ) w , z ⟩ ⟩ = I I ( u , z ) I I ( v , w ) − − I I ( u , w ) I I ( v , z ) .

{\displaystyle \langle R(u,v)w,z\rangle =\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (u,z)\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (v,w)-\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (u,w)\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (v,z).} This is called the Gauss equation , as it may be viewed as a generalization of Gauss's Theorema Egregium .

For general Riemannian manifolds one has to add the curvature of ambient space; if N is a manifold embedded in a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) then the curvature tensor R N of N with induced metric can be expressed using the second fundamental form and R M , the curvature tensor of M : ⟨ ⟨ R N ( u , v ) w , z ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ R M ( u , v ) w , z ⟩ ⟩ + ⟨ ⟨ I I ( u , z ) , I I ( v , w ) ⟩ ⟩ − − ⟨ ⟨ I I ( u , w ) , I I ( v , z ) ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle R_{N}(u,v)w,z\rangle =\langle R_{M}(u,v)w,z\rangle +\langle \mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (u,z),\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (v,w)\rangle -\langle \mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (u,w),\mathrm {I} \!\mathrm {I} (v,z)\rangle \,.} See also [ edit ] First fundamental form Gaussian curvature Gauss–Codazzi equations Shape operator Third fundamental form Tautological one-form References [ edit ] Guggenheimer, Heinrich (1977).
