In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **algebra over a field** (often simply called an **algebra**) is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") equipped with a [bilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map")[product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)"). Thus, an algebra is an [algebraic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") consisting of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") together with operations of multiplication and addition and [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") by elements of a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") and satisfying the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-1)

The multiplication operation in an algebra may or may not be [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"), leading to the notions of [associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") where associativity of multiplication is assumed, and [non-associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-associative_algebra "Non-associative algebra"), where associativity is not assumed (but not excluded, either). Given an integer _n_, the [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") of [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_matrix "Real matrix")[square matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix "Square matrix") of order _n_ is an example of an associative algebra over the field of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") under [matrix addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition "Matrix addition") and [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") since matrix multiplication is associative. Three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") with multiplication given by the [vector cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_cross_product "Vector cross product") is an example of a nonassociative algebra over the field of real numbers since the vector cross product is nonassociative, satisfying the [Jacobi identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_identity "Jacobi identity") instead.

An algebra is **unital** or **unitary** if it has an [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element") with respect to the multiplication. The ring of real square matrices of order _n_ forms a unital algebra since the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix") of order _n_ is the identity element with respect to matrix multiplication. It is an example of a unital associative algebra, a [(unital) ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unital_ring "Unital ring") that is also a vector space.

Many authors use the term _algebra_ to mean _associative algebra_, or _unital associative algebra_, or in some subjects such as [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), _unital associative commutative algebra_.

Replacing the field of scalars by a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") leads to the more general notion of an [algebra over a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#Generalization:_algebra_over_a_ring). Algebras are not to be confused with vector spaces equipped with a [bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form "Bilinear form"), like [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"), as, for such a space, the result of a product is not in the space, but rather in the field of coefficients.

Let K be a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and let A be a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over K equipped with an additional [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation") from _A_ × _A_ to A, denoted here by · (that is, if x and y are any two elements of A, then _x_ · _y_ is an element of A that is called the _product_ of x and y). Then A is an _algebra_ over K if the following identities hold for all elements _x_, _y_, _z_ in A , and all elements (often called [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)")) a and b in K:

*   Right [distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity"): (_x_ + _y_) · _z_ = _x_ · _z_ + _y_ · _z_
*   Left distributivity: _z_ · (_x_ + _y_) = _z_ · _x_ + _z_ · _y_
*   Compatibility with scalars: (_ax_) · (_by_) = (_ab_) (_x_ · _y_).

These three axioms are another way of saying that the binary operation is [bilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_operator "Bilinear operator"). An algebra over K is sometimes also called a _K-algebra_, and K is called the _base field_ of A. The binary operation is often referred to as _multiplication_ in A. The convention adopted in this article is that multiplication of elements of an algebra is not necessarily [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity"), although some authors use the term _algebra_ to refer to an [associative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra").

When a binary operation on a vector space is [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative"), left distributivity and right distributivity are equivalent, and, in this case, only one distributivity requires a proof. In general, for non-commutative operations left distributivity and right distributivity are not equivalent, and require separate proofs.

### Algebra homomorphisms

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Algebra homomorphisms")]

Given _K_-algebras _A_ and _B_, a [homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") of _K_-algebras or _K_-**algebra homomorphism** is a _K_-[linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map")_f_: _A_ → _B_ such that _f_(_xy_) = _f_(_x_) _f_(_y_) for all _x_, _y_ in _A_. If _A_ and _B_ are unital, then a homomorphism satisfying _f_(1 _A_) = 1 _B_ is said to be a unital homomorphism. The space of all _K_-algebra homomorphisms between _A_ and _B_ is frequently written as

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {Hom} _{K{\text{-alg}}}(A,B).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bbb4aa0b73ba8132d44bafdba9cdc4b054f6c2a)
A _K_-algebra [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") is a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective "Bijective")_K_-algebra homomorphism.

### Subalgebras and ideals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Subalgebras and ideals")]

A **subalgebra** of an algebra over a field _K_ is a [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") that has the property that the product of any two of its elements is again in the subspace. In other words, a subalgebra of an algebra is a non-empty subset of elements that is closed under addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication. In symbols, we say that a subset _L_ of a _K_-algebra _A_ is a [subalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalgebra "Subalgebra") if for every _x_, _y_ in _L_ and _c_ in _K_, we have that _x_ · _y_, _x_ + _y_, and _cx_ are all in _L_.

In the above example of the complex numbers viewed as a two-dimensional algebra over the real numbers, the one-dimensional real line is a subalgebra.

A _left ideal_ of a _K_-algebra is a linear subspace that has the property that any element of the subspace multiplied on the left by any element of the algebra produces an element of the subspace. In symbols, we say that a subset _L_ of a _K_-algebra _A_ is a left ideal if for every _x_ and _y_ in _L_, _z_ in _A_ and _c_ in _K_, we have the following three statements.

1.   _x_ + _y_ is in _L_ (_L_ is closed under addition),
2.   _cx_ is in _L_ (_L_ is closed under scalar multiplication),
3.   _z_ · _x_ is in _L_ (_L_ is closed under left multiplication by arbitrary elements).

If (3) were replaced with _x_ · _z_ is in _L_, then this would define a _right ideal_. A _two-sided ideal_ is a subset that is both a left and a right ideal. The term _ideal_ on its own is usually taken to mean a two-sided ideal. Of course when the algebra is commutative, then all of these notions of ideal are equivalent. Conditions (1) and (2) together are equivalent to _L_ being a linear subspace of _A_. It follows from condition (3) that every left or right ideal is a subalgebra.

This definition is different from the definition of an [ideal of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)"), in that here we require the condition (2). Of course if the algebra is unital, then condition (3) implies condition (2).

### Extension of scalars

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Extension of scalars")]

If we have a [field extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension "Field extension")_F_/_K_, which is to say a bigger field _F_ that contains _K_, then there is a natural way to construct an algebra over _F_ from any algebra over _K_. It is the same construction one uses to make a vector space over a bigger field, namely the tensor product ![Image 10: {\displaystyle V_{F}:=V\otimes _{K}F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/335f8f1ccf450231a41988d52133d689c6a17b2d). So if _A_ is an algebra over _K_, then ![Image 11: {\displaystyle A_{F}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f64867539242b9693f2154d734886d054b39f0d) is an algebra over _F_.

Kinds of algebras and examples
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Kinds of algebras and examples")]

Algebras over fields come in many different types. These types are specified by insisting on some further axioms, such as [commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity") or [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity") of the multiplication operation, which are not required in the broad definition of an algebra. The theories corresponding to the different types of algebras are often very different.

An algebra is _unital_ or _unitary_ if it has a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(algebra) "Unit (algebra)") or identity element _I_ with _Ix_ = _x_ = _xI_ for all _x_ in the algebra.

An algebra is called a **zero algebra** if _uv_ = 0 for all _u_, _v_ in the algebra,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-2) not to be confused with the algebra with one element. It is inherently non-unital (except in the case of only one element), associative and commutative.

A **unital zero algebra** is the [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum "Direct sum")⁠![Image 12: {\displaystyle K\oplus V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9b11024744aafed711cfb7d76030ddee653000d)⁠ of a field ⁠![Image 13: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0)⁠ and a ⁠![Image 14: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0)⁠-vector space ⁠![Image 15: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845)⁠, that is equipped by the only multiplication that is zero on the vector space (or module), and makes it an unital algebra.

More precisely, every element of the algebra may be uniquely written as ⁠![Image 16: {\displaystyle k+v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f88f0f9f107f232a9e11c82a390ffc3b92489f3)⁠ with ⁠![Image 17: {\displaystyle k\in K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3846561ca971f4b17e10153d1f996e08e5ac192)⁠ and ⁠![Image 18: {\displaystyle v\in V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99886ebbde63daa0224fb9bf56fa11b3c8a6f4fb)⁠, and the product is the only [bilinear operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_operation "Bilinear operation") such that ⁠![Image 19: {\displaystyle vw=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e59889250b46076c1caf9d47021c728fc568e5e8)⁠ for every ⁠![Image 20: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597)⁠ and ⁠![Image 21: {\displaystyle w}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6)⁠ in ⁠![Image 22: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845)⁠. So, if ⁠![Image 23: {\displaystyle k_{1},k_{2}\in K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c58742aaf12ff525bc6e2310b1a9eccfa540c819)⁠ and ⁠![Image 24: {\displaystyle v_{1},v_{2}\in V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d73e197c5ce766e966dccb903b0557036ec32fe9)⁠, one has ![Image 25: {\displaystyle (k_{1}+v_{1})(k_{2}+v_{2})=k_{1}k_{2}+(k_{1}v_{2}+k_{2}v_{1}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdc1e66a1132ab0eb4e38a0c6bac7c29d8dfbe2b)

A classical example of unital zero algebra is the algebra of [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number "Dual number"), the unital zero **R**-algebra built from a one dimensional real vector space.

This definition extends verbatim to the definition of a _unital zero algebra_ over a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring"), with the replacement of "field" and "vector space" with "commutative ring" and "[module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)")".

Unital zero algebras allow the unification of the theory of submodules of a given module and the theory of ideals of a unital algebra. Indeed, the submodules of a module ⁠![Image 26: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845)⁠ correspond exactly to the ideals of ⁠![Image 27: {\displaystyle K\oplus V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9b11024744aafed711cfb7d76030ddee653000d)⁠ that are contained in ⁠![Image 28: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845)⁠.

For example, the theory of [Gröbner bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis") was introduced by [Bruno Buchberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Buchberger "Bruno Buchberger") for [ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)") in a polynomial ring _R_ = _K_[_x_ 1, ..., _x_ _n_] over a field. The construction of the unital zero algebra over a free _R_-module allows extending this theory as a Gröbner basis theory for submodules of a free module. This extension allows, for computing a Gröbner basis of a submodule, to use, without any modification, any algorithm and any software for computing Gröbner bases of ideals.

Similarly, unital zero algebras allow to deduce straightforwardly the [Lasker–Noether theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasker%E2%80%93Noether_theorem "Lasker–Noether theorem") for modules (over a commutative ring) from the original Lasker–Noether theorem for ideals.

### Associative algebra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Associative algebra")]

Examples of associative algebras include

*   the algebra of all _n_-by-_n_[matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") over a field (or commutative ring) _K_. Here the multiplication is ordinary [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication").
*   [group algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_ring "Group ring"), where a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") serves as a basis of the vector space and algebra multiplication extends group multiplication.
*   the commutative algebra _K_[_x_] of all [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") over _K_ (see [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring")).
*   algebras of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)"), such as the **R**-algebra of all real-valued [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") functions defined on the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") [0,1], or the **C**-algebra of all [holomorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function") defined on some fixed open set in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"). These are also commutative.
*   [Incidence algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_algebra "Incidence algebra") are built on certain [partially ordered sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set "Partially ordered set").
*   algebras of [linear operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator "Linear operator"), for example on a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space"). Here the algebra multiplication is given by the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_composition "Functional composition") of operators. These algebras also carry a [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"); many of them are defined on an underlying [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space"), which turns them into [Banach algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra "Banach algebra"). If an involution is given as well, we obtain [B*-algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B*-algebra "B*-algebra") and [C*-algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra "C*-algebra"). These are studied in [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis").

### Non-associative algebra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Non-associative algebra")]

A _non-associative algebra_[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-Schafer-3) (or _distributive algebra_) over a field _K_ is a _K_-vector space _A_ equipped with a _K_-[bilinear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map")![Image 29: {\displaystyle A\times A\rightarrow A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52b681b751812bf4885e51e18c8a6f15db5b0478). The usage of "non-associative" here is meant to convey that associativity is not assumed, but it does not mean it is prohibited – that is, it means "not necessarily associative".

Examples detailed in the main article include:

*   [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**3 with multiplication given by the [vector cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_cross_product "Vector cross product")
*   [Octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion")
*   [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra")
*   [Jordan algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_algebra "Jordan algebra")
*   [Alternative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_algebra "Alternative algebra")
*   [Flexible algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_algebra "Flexible algebra")
*   [Power-associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-associative_algebra "Power-associative algebra")

The definition of an associative _K_-algebra with unit is also frequently given in an alternative way. In this case, an algebra over a field _K_ is a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)")_A_ together with a [ring homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism")

![Image 30: {\displaystyle \eta \colon K\to Z(A),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7eb4c3fe1b9f4976f793d64d94d0ddcf1a246aa0)
where _Z_(_A_) is the [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(ring_theory) "Center (ring theory)") of _A_. Since _η_ is a ring homomorphism, then one must have either that _A_ is the [zero ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_ring "Zero ring"), or that _η_ is [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function "Injective function"). This definition is equivalent to that above, with scalar multiplication

![Image 31: {\displaystyle K\times A\to A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c523bfe1944d4134d5e6e134ddf0ff9117faf79)
given by

![Image 32: {\displaystyle (k,a)\mapsto \eta (k)a.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c36ba6340deb08edbc3fb39b75a2a2420f7d8eb)
Given two such associative unital _K_-algebras _A_ and _B_, a unital _K_-algebra homomorphism _f_: _A_ → _B_ is a ring homomorphism that commutes with the scalar multiplication defined by _η_, which one may write as

![Image 33: {\displaystyle f(ka)=kf(a)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/395e0295fcb78f6f5fc4ca8f769e19a50d207f80)

In other words, the following diagram commutes:

Structure coefficients
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Structure coefficients")]

For algebras over a field, the bilinear multiplication from _A_ × _A_ to _A_ is completely determined by the multiplication of [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") elements of _A_. Conversely, once a basis for _A_ has been chosen, the products of basis elements can be set arbitrarily, and then extended in a unique way to a bilinear operator on _A_, i.e., so the resulting multiplication satisfies the algebra laws.

Thus, given the field _K_, any finite-dimensional algebra can be specified [up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to")[isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") by giving its [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(linear_algebra) "Dimension (linear algebra)") (say _n_), and specifying _n_ 3 _structure coefficients_ _c_ _i_,_j_,_k_, which are [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"). These structure coefficients determine the multiplication in _A_ via the following rule:

![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{i}\mathbf {e} _{j}=\sum _{k=1}^{n}c_{i,j,k}\mathbf {e} _{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cd419e8cacc6b9ab0175c2938c6243c9a5655d7)
where **e**1,...,**e**_n_ form a basis of _A_.

Note however that several different sets of structure coefficients can give rise to isomorphic algebras.

In [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics"), the structure coefficients are generally written with upper and lower indices, so as to distinguish their transformation properties under coordinate transformations. Specifically, lower indices are [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") indices, and transform via [pullbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(differential_geometry) "Pullback (differential geometry)"), while upper indices are [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors"), transforming under [pushforwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_(differential) "Pushforward (differential)"). Thus, the structure coefficients are often written _c_ _i_,_j_ _k_, and their defining rule is written using the [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation "Einstein notation") as

**e**_i_**e**_j_ = _c_ _i_,_j_ _k_**e**_k_.
If you apply this to vectors written in [index notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_notation "Index notation"), then this becomes

(**xy**)_k_ = _c_ _i_,_j_ _k_ _x_ _i_ _y_ _j_.
If _K_ is only a commutative ring and not a field, then the same process works if _A_ is a [free module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_module "Free module") over _K_. If it isn't, then the multiplication is still completely determined by its action on a set that spans _A_; however, the structure constants can't be specified arbitrarily in this case, and knowing only the structure constants does not specify the algebra up to isomorphism.

Classification of low-dimensional unital associative algebras over the complex numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Classification of low-dimensional unital associative algebras over the complex numbers")]

Two-dimensional, three-dimensional and four-dimensional unital associative algebras over the field of complex numbers were completely classified up to isomorphism by [Eduard Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Study "Eduard Study").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-4)

There exist two such two-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations (with complex coefficients) of two basis elements, 1 (the identity element) and _a_. According to the definition of an identity element,

![Image 38: {\displaystyle \textstyle 1\cdot 1=1\,,\quad 1\cdot a=a\,,\quad a\cdot 1=a\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/303a2e8eb62745c282986dfb92af18fb94ffa843)
It remains to specify

![Image 39: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/096137d97e4450c56e0ef14a94baf8a3fa81dda5) for the first algebra,![Image 40: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b2a908796e3b3efe0875a3189975aa2f93911da) for the second algebra.
There exist five such three-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations of three basis elements, 1 (the identity element), _a_ and _b_. Taking into account the definition of an identity element, it is sufficient to specify

![Image 41: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=a\,,\quad bb=b\,,\quad ab=ba=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62b252e95547e5edafe98a2127c409389824d921) for the first algebra,![Image 42: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=a\,,\quad bb=0\,,\quad ab=ba=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f12c6baf3854a423e99cbd673221b75d8a1e3294) for the second algebra,![Image 43: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=b\,,\quad bb=0\,,\quad ab=ba=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e24864066dbb2bddb3c282455024397851c709ee) for the third algebra,![Image 44: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=1\,,\quad bb=0\,,\quad ab=-ba=b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1242042b35d0f53f0a70a37c8c46c4cdc5e33552) for the fourth algebra,![Image 45: {\displaystyle \textstyle aa=0\,,\quad bb=0\,,\quad ab=ba=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/15f040db4b1c9bf9e1028c5771f33d88a0761ae6) for the fifth algebra.
The fourth of these algebras is non-commutative, and the others are commutative.

Generalization: algebra over a ring
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Generalization: algebra over a ring")]

In some areas of mathematics, such as [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"), it is common to consider the more general concept of an **algebra over a ring**, where a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring")_R_ replaces the field _K_. The only part of the definition that changes is that _A_ is assumed to be an [_R_-module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") (instead of a _K_-vector space).

### Associative algebras over rings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Associative algebras over rings")]

A [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)")_A_ is always an associative algebra over its [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(ring_theory) "Center (ring theory)"), and over the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"). A classical example of an algebra over its center is the [split-biquaternion algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-biquaternion "Split-biquaternion"), which is isomorphic to ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} \times \mathbb {H} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4bc7d76fd884119d7debff60d92de9fcc539a905), the direct product of two [quaternion algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"). The center of that ring is ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb99f01c438a62e4ac5af8cff4eb402739ed67a8), and hence it has the structure of an algebra over its center, which is not a field. Note that the split-biquaternion algebra is also naturally an 8-dimensional ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)-algebra.

In commutative algebra, if _A_ is a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring"), then any unital ring homomorphism ![Image 49: {\displaystyle R\to A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c29adbb31d030193e6c294c7f438b0c64753ed4) defines an _R_-module structure on _A_, and this is what is known as the _R_-algebra structure.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-5) So a ring comes with a natural ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc)-module structure, since one can take the unique homomorphism ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} \to A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fcf64d6f11aeb1d91b42b8ff852b81aa0fad6cfa).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#cite_note-6) On the other hand, not all rings can be given the structure of an algebra over a field (for example the integers). See _[Field with one element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field\_with\_one\_element "Field with one element")_ for a description of an attempt to give to every ring a structure that behaves like an algebra over a field.
