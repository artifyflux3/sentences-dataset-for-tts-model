University of Auckland Stanford University Rice University Thesis Practical tools for exploring data and models (2008) Doctoral advisor Dianne Cook Heike Hofmann [ 2 ] Website hadley .nz Hadley Alexander Wickham (born 14 October 1979) is a New Zealand statistician known for his work on open-source software for the R statistical programming environment . He is the chief scientist at Posit PBC and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Auckland , Stanford University , and Rice University . His work includes the data visualisation system ggplot2 and the tidyverse , a collection of R packages for data science based on the concept of tidy data .

Early life and education [ edit ] Wickham was born in Hamilton, New Zealand . His sister, Charlotte Wickham, is also a statistician, data scientist and educator. She taught in the Statistics Department at Oregon State University between 2011 and 2022, [ 4 ] and currently works for Posit PBC on the developer relations team.

[ 5 ] She holds a first-class honours bachelor of science degree in Statistics from University of Auckland and a PhD in statistics from University of California, Berkeley .

[ 6 ] Wickham received a Bachelors degree in Human Biology and a master's degree in statistics at the University of Auckland in 1999–2004 and his PhD at Iowa State University in 2008, supervised by Di Cook and Heike Hofmann .

[ 2 ] [ 7 ] Career [ edit ] Wickham is the chief scientist at Posit PBC (formerly RStudio PBC) [ 8 ] and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Auckland , Stanford University , and Rice University .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] He is a prominent and active member of the R user community, and has developed several notable and widely used packages including ggplot2 , plyr, dplyr and reshape2.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Wickham's data analysis packages for R are collectively known as the tidyverse .

[ 13 ] According to Wickham's tidy data approach, each variable should be a column , each observation should be a row , and each type of observational unit should be a table .

[ 14 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] In 2006 he was awarded the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work developing tools for data reshaping and visualisation.

[ 15 ] Wickham was named a Fellow by the American Statistical Association in 2015 for "pivotal contributions to statistical practice through innovative and pioneering research in statistical graphics and computing".

[ 16 ] Wickham was awarded the international COPSS Presidents' Award in 2019 for "influential work in statistical computing, visualisation, graphics, and data analysis" including "making statistical thinking and computing accessible to a large audience".
