Molar concentration Common symbols c , [chemical symbol or formula] SI unit mol/m 3 Other units mol/L, M Derivations from other quantities c = n / V Dimension L − − 3 N {\displaystyle {\mathsf {L}}^{-3}{\mathsf {N}}} Molar concentration (also called amount-of-substance concentration or molarity ) is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

[ 1 ] Specifically, It is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species , in particular, of a solute in a solution , in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. In chemistry , the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per liter , having the unit symbol mol/L or mol / dm 3 (1000 mol/ m 3 ) in SI units. Molar concentration is often depicted with square brackets around the substance of interest; for example with the hydronium ion [H 3 O + ] = 4.57 x 10 -9 mol/L.

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly expressed in units of moles of solute per litre of solution .

[ 3 ] For use in broader applications, it is defined as amount of substance of solute per unit volume of solution, or per unit volume available to the species, represented by lowercase c {\displaystyle c} : [ 4 ] c = n V = N N A V = C N A .

{\displaystyle c={\frac {n}{V}}={\frac {N}{N_{\text{A}}\,V}}={\frac {C}{N_{\text{A}}}}.} Here, n {\displaystyle n} is the amount of the solute in moles, [ 5 ] N {\displaystyle N} is the number of constituent particles present in volume V {\displaystyle V} (in litres) of the solution, and N A {\displaystyle N_{\text{A}}} is the Avogadro constant , since 2019 defined as exactly 6.022 140 76 × 10 23 mol −1 . The ratio N V {\displaystyle {\frac {N}{V}}} is the number density C {\displaystyle C} .

In thermodynamics , the use of molar concentration is often not convenient because the volume of most solutions slightly depends on temperature due to thermal expansion . This problem is usually resolved by introducing temperature correction factors , or by using a temperature-independent measure of concentration such as molality .

[ 5 ] The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution .

Formality or analytical concentration [ edit ] If a molecule or salt dissociates in solution, the concentration refers to the original chemical formula in solution, the molar concentration is sometimes called formal concentration or formality ( F A ) or analytical concentration ( c A ). For example, if a sodium carbonate solution ( Na 2 CO 3 ) has a formal concentration of c ( Na 2 CO 3 ) = 1 mol/L, the molar concentrations are c ( Na + ) = 2 mol/L and c ( CO 2− 3 ) = 1 mol/L because the salt dissociates into these ions.

[ 6 ] Units [ edit ] While there is clear consensus on the equivalence of units: 1 mol / m 3 = 10 −3 mol / dm 3 = 10 −3 mol / L = 10 −3 M = 1 mM = 1 mmol/L guidance on unit names and abbreviations varies: [A]mount concentration ...[a]lso called amount-of-substance concentration, substance concentration (in clinical chemistry) and in older literature molarity. ...The common unit is mole per cubic decimetre (mol dm −3 ) or mole per litre (mol L −1 ) sometimes denoted by M.

— IUPAC , "Gold Book" 5ed In the older literature this quantity was often called molarity , a usage that should be avoided due to the risk of confusion with the quantity molality . Units commonly used for amount concentration are mol L −1 (or mol dm −3 ), mmol L −1 , mmol L −1 etc., often denoted M, mM, uM etc. (pronounced molar, millimolar, micromolar).

— IUPAC , "Green Book" 3ed The term molarity and the symbol M should no longer be used because they, too, are obsolete. One should use instead amount-of-substance concentration of B and such units as mol/dm 3 , kmol/m 3 , or mol/L. (A solution of, for example, 0.1 mol/dm 3 was often called a 0.1 molar solution, denoted 0.1 M solution. The molarity of the solution was said to be 0.1 M.) — NIST , Guide to the SI, Chapter 8 The SI prefix " mega " (symbol M) has the same symbol. However, the prefix is never used alone, so "M" unambiguously denotes molar.
Sub-multiples, such as "millimolar" (mM) and "nanomolar" (nM), consist of the unit preceded by an SI prefix : Name Abbreviation Concentration (mol/L) (mol/m 3 ) millimolar mM 10 −3 10 0 =1 micromolar μM 10 −6 10 −3 nanomolar nM 10 −9 10 −6 picomolar pM 10 −12 10 −9 femtomolar fM 10 −15 10 −12 attomolar aM 10 −18 10 −15 zeptomolar zM 10 −21 10 −18 yoctomolar yM 10 −24 (6 particles per 10 L) 10 −21 rontomolar rM 10 −27 10 −24 quectomolar qM 10 −30 10 −27 Related quantities [ edit ] Number concentration [ edit ] The conversion to number concentration C i {\displaystyle C_{i}} is given by C i = c i N A , {\displaystyle C_{i}=c_{i}N_{\text{A}},} where N A {\displaystyle N_{\text{A}}} is the Avogadro constant .

Mass concentration [ edit ] The conversion to mass concentration ρ ρ i {\displaystyle \rho _{i}} is given by ρ ρ i = c i M i , {\displaystyle \rho _{i}=c_{i}M_{i},} where M i {\displaystyle M_{i}} is the molar mass of constituent i {\displaystyle i} .

Mole fraction [ edit ] The conversion to mole fraction x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} is given by x i = c i M ¯ ¯ ρ ρ , {\displaystyle x_{i}=c_{i}{\frac {\overline {M}}{\rho }},} where M ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {M}}} is the average molar mass of the solution, ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the density of the solution.

A simpler relation can be obtained by considering the total molar concentration, namely, the sum of molar concentrations of all the components of the mixture: x i = c i c = c i ∑ ∑ j c j .

{\displaystyle x_{i}={\frac {c_{i}}{c}}={\frac {c_{i}}{\sum _{j}c_{j}}}.} Mass fraction [ edit ] The conversion to mass fraction w i {\displaystyle w_{i}} is given by w i = c i M i ρ ρ .

{\displaystyle w_{i}=c_{i}{\frac {M_{i}}{\rho }}.} Molality [ edit ] For binary mixtures, the conversion to molality b 2 {\displaystyle b_{2}} is b 2 = c 2 ρ ρ − − c 1 M 1 , {\displaystyle b_{2}={\frac {c_{2}}{\rho -c_{1}M_{1}}},} where the solvent is substance 1, and the solute is substance 2.

For solutions with more than one solute, the conversion is b i = c i ρ ρ − − ∑ ∑ j ≠ ≠ i c j M j .

{\displaystyle b_{i}={\frac {c_{i}}{\rho -\sum _{j\neq i}c_{j}M_{j}}}.} Properties [ edit ] Sum of molar concentrations – normalizing relations [ edit ] The sum of molar concentrations gives the total molar concentration, namely the density of the mixture divided by the molar mass of the mixture or by another name the reciprocal of the molar volume of the mixture. In an ionic solution, ionic strength is proportional to the sum of the molar concentration of salts.

Sum of products of molar concentrations and partial molar volumes [ edit ] The sum of products between these quantities equals one: ∑ ∑ i c i V i ¯ ¯ = 1.

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}c_{i}{\overline {V_{i}}}=1.} Dependence on volume [ edit ] The molar concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature, the dependence is c i = c i , T 0 1 + α α Δ Δ T , {\displaystyle c_{i}={\frac {c_{i,T_{0}}}{1+\alpha \Delta T}},} where c i , T 0 {\displaystyle c_{i,T_{0}}} is the molar concentration at a reference temperature, α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture.

Examples [ edit ] 11.6 g of NaCl is dissolved in 100 g of water. The final mass concentration ρ (NaCl) is ρ (NaCl) = ⁠ 11.6 g / 11.6 g + 100 g ⁠ = 0.104 g/g = 10.4 %.

The volume of such a solution is 104.3mL (volume is directly observable); its density is calculated to be 1.07 (111.6g/104.3mL) The molar concentration of NaCl in the solution is therefore c (NaCl) = ⁠ 11.6 g / 58 g/mol ⁠ / 104.3 mL = 0.00192 mol/mL = 1.92 mol/L.

Here, 58 g/mol is the molar mass of NaCl.

A typical task in chemistry is the preparation of 100 mL (= 0.1 L) of a 2 mol/L solution of NaCl in water. The mass of salt needed is m (NaCl) = 2 mol/L × 0.1 L × 58 g/mol = 11.6 g.

To create the solution, 11.6 g NaCl is placed in a volumetric flask , dissolved in some water, then followed by the addition of more water until the total volume reaches 100 mL.

The density of water is approximately 1000 g/L and its molar mass is 18.02 g/mol (or 1/18.02 = 0.055 mol/g). Therefore, the molar concentration of water is c (H 2 O) = ⁠ 1000 g/L / 18.02 g/mol ⁠ ≈ 55.5 mol/L.

Likewise, the concentration of solid hydrogen (molar mass = 2.02 g/mol) is c (H 2 ) = ⁠ 88 g/L / 2.02 g/mol ⁠ = 43.7 mol/L.

The concentration of pure osmium tetroxide (molar mass = 254.23 g/mol) is c (OsO 4 ) = ⁠ 5.1 kg/L / 254.23 g/mol ⁠ = 20.1 mol/L.

A typical protein in bacteria , such as E. coli , may have about 60 copies, and the volume of a bacterium is about 10 −15 L. Thus, the number concentration C is C = 60 / (10 −15 L) = 6 × 10 16 L −1 .

The molar concentration is c = ⁠ C / N A ⁠ = ⁠ 6 × 10 16 L −1 / 6 × 10 23 mol −1 ⁠ = 10 −7 mol/L = 100 nmol/L.
