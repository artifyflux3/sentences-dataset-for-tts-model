[ 1 ] He studied at the University of Edinburgh , where he gained a Ph.D. in Chemistry (1957).

[ 2 ] He was most famous for his controversial 1985 book Seven Clues to the Origin of Life .

The book popularized a hypothesis he began to develop in the mid-1960s—that self-replication of clay crystals in solution might provide a simple intermediate step between biologically inert matter and organic life . He inspired other ideas about chemical evolution , including the Miller–Urey experiment and the RNA World , all of which are hypotheses that have played important roles in attempts to understand the origin of life .

Cairns-Smith also published on the evolution of consciousness , in Evolving the Mind (1996), favoring a role for quantum mechanics in human thought .

[ 3 ] He died on 26 August 2016.

[ 4 ] Clay hypothesis [ edit ] The clay hypothesis suggests how biologically inert matter helped the evolution of early life forms: clay minerals form naturally from silicates in solution. Clay crystals, as other crystals , preserve their external formal arrangement as they grow, snap, [ clarification needed ] and grow further. Clay crystal masses of a particular external form may happen to affect their environment in ways that affect their chances of further replication. For example, a "stickier" clay crystal is more likely to silt a stream bed, creating an environment conducive to further sedimentation . It is conceivable that such effects could extend to the creation of flat areas likely to be exposed to air, dry, and turn to wind-borne dust, which could fall randomly in other streams. Thus—by simple, inorganic, physical processes—a selection environment might exist for the reproduction of clay crystals of the "stickier" shape.

[ 5 ] There follows a process of natural selection for clay crystals that trap certain forms of molecules to their surfaces that may enhance their replication potential. Complex proto-organic molecules can be catalysed by the surface properties of silicates . When complex molecules perform a "genetic takeover" from their clay "vehicle", they become an independent locus of replication – an evolutionary moment that might be understood as the first exaptation .
