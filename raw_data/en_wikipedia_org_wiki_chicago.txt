Located on the western shore of Lake Michigan , it is the third-most populous city in the United States with a population of 2.74 million at the 2020 census , [ 9 ] while the Chicago metropolitan area has 9.41 million residents and is the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation. Chicago is the seat of Cook County , the second-most populous county in the United States.

Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed . It grew rapidly in the mid-19th century.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, [ 12 ] but Chicago's population continued to grow.

[ 11 ] Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and architecture , such as the Chicago School , the development of the City Beautiful movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture , commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation . It has the largest and most diverse finance derivatives market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone.

[ 15 ] O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked among the world's top ten busiest airports by passenger traffic , [ 16 ] and the region is also the nation's railroad hub.

[ 17 ] The Chicago area has one of the highest gross domestic products (GDP) of any urban region in the world, generating $689 billion in 2018.

[ 18 ] Chicago's economy is diverse , with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce.

[ 15 ] Chicago is a major destination for tourism , with 55 million visitors in 2024 to its cultural institutions , Lake Michigan beaches , restaurants, and more.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Chicago's culture has contributed much to the visual arts, literature , film, theater , comedy (especially improvisational comedy ), food , dance, and music (particularly jazz , blues , soul , hip-hop , gospel , [ 21 ] and electronic dance music , including house music ). Chicago is home to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera of Chicago , while the Art Institute of Chicago provides an influential visual arts museum and art school . The Chicago area also hosts the University of Chicago , Northwestern University , and the University of Illinois Chicago , among other institutions of learning . Professional sports in Chicago include all major professional leagues , including two Major League Baseball teams. The city also hosts the Chicago Marathon , one of the World Marathon Majors .

Etymology and nicknames Main article: Nicknames of Chicago See also: Windy City (nickname) and List of Chicago placename etymologies The name Chicago is derived from a French rendering of the indigenous Miami–Illinois name Šikaakonki , the locative form of the word šikaakwa which can mean both " skunk " and "ramps," a wild relative of onion and garlic known to botanists as Allium tricoccum .

[ 22 ] The first known reference to the site of the city of Chicago as " Checagou " was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir.

[ 23 ] Henri Joutel , in his journal of 1688, noted that the eponymous wild "garlic" grew profusely in the area.

[ 24 ] According to his diary of late September 1687: ... when we arrived at the said place called "Chicagou" which, according to what we were able to learn of it, has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region.

[ 24 ] The city has had several nicknames throughout its history, such as the Windy City , Chi-Town, Second City, and City of the Big Shoulders.

[ 25 ] History Main article: History of Chicago For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Chicago history .

Beginnings Traditional Potawatomi regalia on display at the Field Museum of Natural History In the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi , an indigenous tribe who had succeeded the Miami , Sauk and Meskwaki peoples in this region.

[ 26 ] An artist's rendering of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 Home Insurance Building (1885) Court of Honor at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 The first known permanent settler in Chicago was a trader, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable . Du Sable was of African descent, perhaps born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), and he established the settlement in the 1780s. He is commonly known as the "Founder of Chicago." [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 1795, following the victory of the new United States in the Northwest Indian War , an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the U.S. for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the Treaty of Greenville . In 1803, the U.S. Army constructed Fort Dearborn , which was destroyed during the War of 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn by the Potawatomi before being later rebuilt.

[ 30 ] After the War of 1812, the Ottawa , Ojibwe , and Potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis . The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the 1833 Treaty of Chicago and sent west of the Mississippi River as part of the federal policy of Indian removal .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] 19th century The location and course of the Illinois and Michigan Canal (completed 1848) State and Madison streets, once known as the busiest intersection in the world (1897) On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200.

[ 33 ] Within seven years it grew to more than 6,000 people. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales began with Edmund Dick Taylor as Receiver of Public Monies. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837, [ 34 ] and for several decades was the world's fastest-growing city.

[ 35 ] As the site of the Chicago Portage , [ 36 ] the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad , and the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy .

[ 41 ] The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first-ever standardized "exchange-traded" forward contracts, which were called futures contracts .

[ 42 ] In the 1850s, Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas , the champion of the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the "popular sovereignty" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.

[ 43 ] These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln , to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for U.S. president at the 1860 Republican National Convention , which was held in a purpose-built auditorium called the Wigwam . He defeated Douglas in the general election, and this set the stage for the American Civil War .

To accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation, the city improved its infrastructure. In February 1856, Chicago's Common Council approved Chesbrough 's plan to build the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system.

[ 44 ] The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade with the use of jackscrews for raising buildings.

[ 45 ] While elevating Chicago, and at first improving the city's health, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River , and subsequently into Lake Michigan , polluting the city's primary freshwater source.

The city responded by tunneling two miles (3.2 km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs . In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River , which flows into the Mississippi River.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed an area about 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 1-mile (1.6 km) wide, a large section of the city at the time.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Much of the city, including railroads and stockyards , survived intact, [ 52 ] and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone. These set a precedent for worldwide construction.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using steel-skeleton construction.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] The city grew significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city, including the Hyde Park Township , which now comprises most of the South Side of Chicago and the far southeast of Chicago, and the Jefferson Township , which now makes up most of Chicago's Northwest Side .

[ 57 ] The desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents.

Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States . Of the total population in 1900, more than 77% were either foreign-born or born in the United States of foreign parentage.

Germans , Irish , Poles , Swedes , and Czechs made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the Pullman Strike . Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr to found Hull House in 1889.

[ 60 ] Programs that were developed there became a model for the new field of social work .

[ 61 ] During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City laws and later, state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera , smallpox , and yellow fever were both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states.

[ 62 ] The city established many large, well-landscaped municipal parks , which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving public health in Chicago was John H. Rauch, M.D.

Rauch established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.

[ 63 ] In the 1800s, Chicago became the nation's railroad hub, and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] In 1883, Chicago's railway managers needed a general time convention, so they developed the standardized system of North American time zones .

[ 66 ] This system for telling time spread throughout the continent.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park . The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] The University of Chicago , formerly at another location, moved to the same South Side location in 1892. The term "midway" for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance , a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects the Washington and Jackson Parks.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] 20th and 21st centuries 1900 to 1939 Aerial motion film photography of Chicago in 1914 as filmed by A. Roy Knabenshue During World War I and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the Southern United States . Between 1910 and 1930, the African American population of Chicago increased dramatically, from 44,103 to 233,903.

[ 71 ] This Great Migration had an immense cultural impact, called the Chicago Black Renaissance , part of the New Negro Movement , in art, literature, and music.

[ 72 ] Continuing racial tensions and violence, such as the Chicago race riot of 1919 , also occurred.

[ 73 ] The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the gangster era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters , including Al Capone , Dion O'Banion , Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era .

[ 74 ] Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of a rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.

[ 75 ] Chicago tenants picket against rent increases (March 1920) From 1920 to 1921, the city was affected by a series of tenant rent strikes , which lead to the formation of the Chicago Tenants Protective association, passage of the Kessenger tenant laws, and of a heat ordinance that legally required flats to be kept above 68 °F during winter months by landlords.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Chicago was the first American city to have a homosexual-rights organization. The organization, formed in 1924, was called the Society for Human Rights . It produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom . Police and political pressure caused the organization to disband.

[ 82 ] Men outside a soup kitchen during the Great Depression (1931) The Great Depression brought unprecedented suffering to Chicago, in no small part due to the city's heavy reliance on heavy industry. Notably, industrial areas on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the Chicago River were devastated; by 1933 over 50% of industrial jobs in the city had been lost, and unemployment rates amongst blacks and Mexicans in the city were over 40%. The Republican political machine in Chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis, and every mayor since 1931 has been a Democrat .

[ 83 ] From 1928 to 1933, the city witnessed a tax revolt, and the city was unable to meet payroll or provide relief efforts. The fiscal crisis was resolved by 1933, and at the same time, federal relief funding began to flow into Chicago.

[ 83 ] Chicago was also a hotbed of labor activism, with Unemployed Councils contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity for the poor and demand relief; these organizations were created by socialist and communist groups. By 1935 the Workers Alliance of America began organizing the poor, workers, the unemployed. In the spring of 1937 Republic Steel Works witnessed the Memorial Day massacre of 1937 in the neighborhood of East Side.

In 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was fatally wounded in Miami, Florida , during a failed assassination attempt on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt . In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the Century of Progress International Exposition World's Fair .

[ 84 ] The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.

[ 85 ] 1940 to 1979 The Chicago Picasso (1967) inspired a new era in urban public art.

During World War II , the city of Chicago alone produced more steel than the United Kingdom every year from 1939 – 1945, and more than Nazi Germany from 1943 – 1945.

[ 86 ] Protesters in Grant Park outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace in the second wave , as hundreds of thousands of blacks from the South arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards.

[ 87 ] On December 2, 1942, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project . This led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the United States, which it used in World War II in 1945.

[ 88 ] Mayor Richard J. Daley , a Democrat, was elected in 1955, in the era of machine politics . In 1956, the city conducted its last major expansion when it annexed the land under O'Hare airport, including a small portion of DuPage County.

[ 89 ] By the 1960s, white residents in several neighborhoods left the city for the suburban areas – in many American cities, a process known as white flight – as Blacks continued to move beyond the Black Belt .

[ 90 ] While home loan discriminatory redlining against blacks continued, the real estate industry practiced what became known as blockbusting , completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods.

[ 91 ] Structural changes in industry, such as globalization and job outsourcing, caused heavy job losses for lower-skilled workers. At its peak during the 1960s, some 250,000 workers were employed in the steel industry in Chicago, but the steel crisis of the 1970s and 1980s reduced this number to just 28,000 in 2015. In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr.

and Albert Raby led the Chicago Freedom Movement , which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders.

[ 92 ] Two years later, the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention , which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, with anti-war protesters, journalists and bystanders being beaten by police.

[ 93 ] Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower (now known as the Willis Tower , which in 1974 became the world's tallest building ), University of Illinois at Chicago , McCormick Place , and O'Hare International Airport , were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure.

[ 94 ] In 1979, Jane Byrne , the city's first female mayor, was elected. She was notable for temporarily moving into the crime-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project and for leading Chicago's school system out of a financial crisis.

[ 95 ] 1980 to present In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Washington's first term in office directed attention to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re‑elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack soon after.

[ 96 ] Washington was succeeded by 6th ward alderperson Eugene Sawyer , who was elected by the Chicago City Council and served until a special election.

Richard M. Daley , son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development , as well as closing Meigs Field in the middle of the night and destroying the runways. After successfully running for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term.

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] In 1992, a construction accident near the Kinzie Street Bridge produced a breach connecting the Chicago River to a tunnel below, which was part of an abandoned freight tunnel system extending throughout the downtown Loop district. The tunnels filled with 250 million US gallons (1,000,000 m 3 ) of water, affecting buildings throughout the district and forcing a shutdown of electrical power.

[ 99 ] The area was shut down for three days and some buildings did not reopen for weeks; losses were estimated at $1.95 billion.

[ 99 ] On February 23, 2011, Rahm Emanuel , a former White House Chief of Staff and member of the House of Representatives , won the mayoral election.

[ 100 ] Emanuel was sworn in as mayor on May 16, 2011, and won re-election in 2015.

[ 101 ] Lori Lightfoot , the city's first African American woman mayor and its first openly LGBTQ mayor, was elected to succeed Emanuel as mayor in 2019.

[ 102 ] All three city-wide elective offices were held by women (and women of color) for the first time in Chicago history: in addition to Lightfoot, the city clerk was Anna Valencia and the city treasurer was Melissa Conyears-Ervin .

[ 103 ] On May 15, 2023, Brandon Johnson assumed office as the 57th mayor of Chicago.

Geography Main article: Geography of Chicago Chicago skyline in September 2023 Topography Aerial view of the Chicago Loop in 2012 Downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront A satellite image of Chicago Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of freshwater Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in the Chicago Metropolitan Area , situated in both the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region . The city rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds . In addition to it lying beside Lake Michigan, two rivers—the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side—flow either entirely or partially through the city.

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect: moderating Chicago's climate, making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

[ 106 ] When Chicago was founded in 1837, most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.

[ 107 ] The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is 579 ft (176.5 m) above sea level . While measurements vary somewhat, [ 108 ] the lowest points are along the lake shore at 578 ft (176.2 m), while the highest point, at 672 ft (205 m), is the morainal ridge of Blue Island in the city's far south side.

[ 109 ] Lake Shore Drive runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's waterfront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include Lincoln Park , Grant Park , Burnham Park , and Jackson Park . There are 24 public beaches across 26 miles (42 km) of the waterfront.

[ 110 ] Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for Navy Pier , Northerly Island , the Museum Campus , and large portions of the McCormick Place Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the entire Chicago metropolitan area is "Chicagoland", which generally means the city and all its suburbs, though different organizations have slightly different definitions.

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] Communities See also: Community areas in Chicago and List of neighborhoods in Chicago Community areas of Chicago Major sections of the city include the central business district, called the Loop , and the North, South , and West Sides .

[ 114 ] The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes.

[ 115 ] The North Side is the most-densely-populated residential section of the city, and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront.

[ 116 ] The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area. The South Side contains most of the facilities of the Port of Chicago .

[ 117 ] In the late-1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas , which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods .

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] Streetscape Main article: Roads and expressways in Chicago Chicago's streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the city's original townsite plot, which was bounded by Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north, Wood Street on the west, and 22nd Street on the south.

[ 120 ] Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction, about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction. The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city (Elston, Milwaukee, Ogden, Lincoln, etc.). Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago , but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed.

[ 121 ] In 2021, Chicago was ranked the fourth-most walkable large city in the United States.

[ 122 ] Many of the city's residential streets have a wide patch of grass or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself. This helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world.

[ 123 ] Other notable streets include Michigan Avenue , State Street , 95th Street , Cicero Avenue , Clark Street , and Belmont Avenue . The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.

[ 124 ] Architecture Main article: Architecture of Chicago Further information: List of tallest buildings in Chicago and List of Chicago Landmarks The Chicago Building (1904–05) is a prime example of the Chicago School , displaying both variations of the Chicago window.

The destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first steel-framed high-rise building , the Home Insurance Building, rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the skyscraper era , [ 56 ] which would then be followed by many other cities around the world.

[ 125 ] Today, Chicago's skyline is among the world's tallest and densest.

[ 126 ] Some of the United States' tallest towers are located in Chicago; Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is the second tallest building in the Western Hemisphere after One World Trade Center , and Trump International Hotel and Tower is the third tallest in the country.

[ 127 ] The Loop's historic buildings include the Chicago Board of Trade Building , the Fine Arts Building , 35 East Wacker , and the Chicago Building , 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments by Mies van der Rohe . Many other architects have left their impression on the Chicago skyline such as Daniel Burnham , Louis Sullivan , Charles B. Atwood, John Root, and Helmut Jahn .

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] The Merchandise Mart , once the largest building in the world , had its own zip code until 2008, and stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River.

[ 130 ] Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower, also a building with its own zip code), Trump International Hotel and Tower , the Aon Center (previously the Standard Oil Building), and the John Hancock Center .

Industrial districts , such as some areas on the South Side , the areas along the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , and the Northwest Indiana area are clustered.

[ 131 ] Chicago gave its name to the Chicago School and was home to the Prairie School , two movements in architecture.

[ 132 ] Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found throughout Chicago. Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick bungalows built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the Polish Cathedral style of church architecture . The Chicago suburb of Oak Park was home to famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright , who had designed The Robie House located near the University of Chicago.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] A popular tourist activity is to take an architecture boat tour along the Chicago River.

[ 135 ] Monuments and public art Main article: List of public art in Chicago Replica of Daniel Chester French 's Statue of The Republic at the site of the World's Columbian Exposition Chicago is famous for its outdoor public art with donors establishing funding for such art as far back as Benjamin Ferguson 's 1905 trust.

[ 136 ] A number of Chicago's public art works are by modern figurative artists. Among these are Chagall's Four Seasons ; the Chicago Picasso ; Miró's Chicago ; Calder 's Flamingo ; Oldenburg 's Batcolumn ; Moore 's Large Interior Form, 1953–54 , Man Enters the Cosmos and Nuclear Energy ; Dubuffet 's Monument with Standing Beast , Abakanowicz 's Agora ; and Anish Kapoor 's Cloud Gate which has become an icon of the city. Some events which shaped the city's history have also been memorialized by art works, including the Great Northern Migration ( Saar ) and the centennial of statehood for Illinois . Finally, two fountains near the Loop also function as monumental works of art: Plensa 's Crown Fountain as well as Burnham and Bennett's Buckingham Fountain .

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] Climate Main articles: Climate of Chicago and Tornadoes in Chicago The Chicago River during the January 2014 cold wave The city mostly lies within the typical hot-summer humid continental climate ( Köppen : Dfa ), and experiences four distinct seasons.

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] Summers are hot and humid, with frequent heat waves . The July daily average temperature is 75.4 °F (24.1 °C), with afternoon temperatures peaking at 84.5 °F (29.2 °C). In a normal summer, temperatures reach at least 90 °F (32 °C) on 17 days, with lakefront locations staying cooler when winds blow off the lake.

Winters are relatively cold and snowy.

Blizzards do occur, such as in winter 2011 .

[ 142 ] There are many sunny but cold days. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 °F (2 °C). January and February are the coldest months. A polar vortex in January 2019 nearly broke the city's cold record of −27 °F (−33 °C), which was set on January 20, 1985.

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Measurable snowfall can continue through the first or second week of April.

[ 146 ] Spring and autumn are mild, short seasons, typically with low humidity.

Dew point temperatures in the summer range from an average of 55.8 °F (13.2 °C) in June to 61.7 °F (16.5 °C) in July.

[ 147 ] They can reach nearly 80 °F (27 °C), such as during the July 2019 heat wave. The city lies within USDA plant hardiness zone 6a, transitioning to 5b in the suburbs.

[ 148 ] According to the National Weather Service , Chicago's highest official temperature reading of 105 °F (41 °C) was recorded on July 24, 1934.

[ 149 ] Midway Airport reached 109 °F (43 °C) one day prior and recorded a heat index of 125 °F (52 °C) during the 1995 heatwave .

[ 150 ] The lowest official temperature of −27 °F (−33 °C) was recorded on January 20, 1985 , at O'Hare Airport.

[ 147 ] [ 150 ] Most of the city's rainfall is brought by thunderstorms , averaging 38 a year. The region is prone to severe thunderstorms during the spring and summer which can produce large hail, damaging winds, and occasionally tornadoes.

[ 151 ] Notably, the F4 Oak Lawn tornado moved through the South Side of the city on April 21, 1967, moving onto Lake Michigan as a waterspout.

[ 152 ] Downtown Chicago was struck by an F3 tornado on May 6, 1876, again moving out over Lake Michigan.

[ 153 ] Like other major cities, Chicago experiences an urban heat island , making the city and its suburbs milder than surrounding rural areas, especially at night and in winter. The proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep the Chicago lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake, [ 154 ] which is sufficient to give lakefront areas such as Northerly Island a humid subtropical ( Cfa ) climate using Köppen's 27 °F (−3 °C) winter isotherm (as opposed to the firmly continental climate of inland areas such as Midway and O'Hare International Airports ), [ 155 ] even though those areas are still continental ( Dca ) under Trewartha due to winters averaging below 32 °F (0 °C).

[ 156 ] Northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake-effect snow .

When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. In the forty years from 1850 to 1890, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1 million. At the end of the 19th century, Chicago was the 5th-most populous city in the world, [ 169 ] and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million, [ 170 ] and reached its highest ever recorded population of 3.6 million for the 1950 census.

From the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Ireland, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including Italians , Jews , Russians , Poles , Greeks , Lithuanians , Bulgarians , Albanians , Romanians , Turks , Croatians , Serbs , Bosnians , Montenegrins and Czechs .

[ 171 ] [ 172 ] To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial working class , were added an additional influx of African Americans from the American South —with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.

[ 171 ] Chicago has a significant Bosnian population , many of whom arrived in the 1990s and 2000s.

[ 173 ] In the 1920s and 1930s, the great majority of African Americans moving to Chicago settled in a so‑called " Black Belt " on the city's South Side .

[ 171 ] A large number of blacks also settled on the West Side . By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's black population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition.

[ 171 ] Around that time, a lesser known fact about African Americans on the North Side is that the block of 4600 Winthrop Avenue in Uptown was the only block African Americans could live or open establishments.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] Chicago's South Side emerged as United States second-largest urban black concentration, following New York's Harlem . In 1990, Chicago's South Side and the adjoining south suburbs constituted the largest black majority region in the entire United States.

[ 171 ] Since the 1980s, Chicago has had a massive exodus of  African Americans (primarily from the South and West sides) to its suburbs or outside its metropolitan area.

[ 176 ] The above average crime and cost of living were leading reasons for the fast declining African American population in Chicago.

[ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] Most of Chicago's foreign-born population were born in Mexico , Poland or India .

[ 180 ] A 2020 study estimated the total Jewish population of the Chicago metropolitan area, both religious and irreligious, at 319,500.

[ 181 ] Chicago's population declined in the latter half of the 20th century, from over 3.6 million in 1950 down to under 2.7 million by 2010. By the time of the official census count in 1990, it was overtaken by Los Angeles as the United States' second largest city.

[ 297 ] The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions and approves the city budget.

[ 298 ] The Chicago Police Department provides law enforcement and the Chicago Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois , in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois state's attorney ; in the Federal court it is the United States attorney .

Politics Main article: Political history of Chicago Presidential election results in Chicago [ 299 ] Year Democratic Republican Others 2024 78.3% 775,699 20.6% 203,817 1.2% 11,776 2020 82.5% 944,735 15.8% 181,234 1.6% 18,772 2016 82.9% 912,945 12.3% 135,320 4.8% 53,262 During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist , anarchist and labor organizations .

[ 300 ] For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been " solid blue " in presidential elections since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.

[ citation needed ] Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 17 districts in the United States House of Representatives . All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; only two Republicans have represented a significant portion of the city since 1973, for one term each: Robert P. Hanrahan from 1973 to 1975, and Michael Patrick Flanagan from 1995 to 1997.

[ citation needed ] Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.

[ 301 ] During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal "independent" faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of Harold Washington (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest-serving mayor, Richard M. Daley , the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic primary vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

[ 302 ] The city is home of former United States President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama ; Barack Obama was formerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a U.S. senator. The Obamas' residence is located near the University of Chicago in Kenwood on the city's south side.

[ 303 ] Crime Main articles: Crime in Chicago and Timeline of organized crime in Chicago Ford Explorer SUV as a Chicago Police Department vehicle, 2021 Chicago's crime rate in 2020 was 3,926 per 100,000 people.

[ 304 ] Chicago experienced major rises in violent crime in the 1920s, in the late 1960s, and in the 2020s.

[ 305 ] [ 306 ] Chicago's biggest criminal justice challenges have changed little over the last 50 years, and statistically reside with homicide, armed robbery , gang violence, and aggravated battery . Chicago has a higher murder rate than the larger cities of New York and Los Angeles. However, while it has a large absolute number of crimes due to its size, Chicago is not among the top-25 most violent cities in the United States.

[ 307 ] [ 308 ] Murder rates in Chicago vary greatly depending on the neighborhood in question.

[ 309 ] The neighborhoods of Englewood on the South Side, and Austin on the West side, for example, have homicide rates that are ten times higher than other parts of the city.

[ 310 ] Chicago has an estimated population of over 100,000 active gang members from nearly 60 factions.

[ 311 ] [ 312 ] According to reports in 2013, "most of Chicago's violent crime comes from gangs trying to maintain control of drug-selling territories," [ 313 ] and is specifically related to the activities of the Sinaloa Cartel , which is active in several American cities.

[ 314 ] Violent crime rates vary significantly by area of the city, with more economically developed areas having low rates, but other sections have much higher rates of crime.

[ 313 ] In 2013, the violent crime rate was 910 per 100,000 people; [ 315 ] the murder rate was 10.4 per 100,000 – while high crime districts saw 38.9 murders, low crime districts saw 2.5 murders per 100,000.

[ 316 ] Chicago's long history of public corruption regularly draws the attention of federal law enforcement and federal prosecutors.

[ 317 ] From 2012 to 2019, 33 Chicago alderpersons were convicted on corruption charges, roughly one third of those elected in the time period. A report from the Office of the Legislative Inspector General noted that over half of Chicago's elected alderpersons took illegal campaign contributions in 2013.

[ 318 ] Most corruption cases in Chicago are prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney 's office, as legal jurisdiction makes most offenses punishable as a federal crime.

[ 319 ] Education Schools and libraries When it was opened in 1991, the central Harold Washington Library appeared in Guinness World Records as the largest municipal public library building in the world.

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is the governing body of the school district that contains over 600 public elementary and high schools citywide, including several selective-admission magnet schools. There are eleven selective enrollment high schools in the Chicago Public Schools, designed to meet the needs of Chicago's most academically advanced students. These schools offer a rigorous curriculum with mainly honors and Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

[ 320 ] Walter Payton College Prep High School is ranked number one in the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois.

[ 321 ] Chicago high school rankings are determined by the average test scores on state achievement tests.

[ 322 ] The district, with an enrollment exceeding 400,545 students (2013–2014 20th Day Enrollment), is the third-largest in the U.S.

[ 323 ] On September 10, 2012, teachers for the Chicago Teachers Union went on strike for the first time since 1987 over pay, resources, and other issues.

[ 324 ] According to data compiled in 2014, Chicago's "choice system", where students who test or apply and may attend one of a number of public high schools (there are about 130), sorts students of different achievement levels into different schools (high performing, middle performing, and low performing schools).

[ 325 ] Chicago has a network of Lutheran schools , [ 326 ] and several private schools are run by other denominations and faiths, such as the Ida Crown Jewish Academy in West Ridge . The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago operates Catholic schools , including Jesuit preparatory schools and others. A number of private schools are completely secular. There is also the private Chicago Academy for the Arts , a high school focused on six different artistic disciplines, and the public Chicago High School for the Arts , a high school focused on five disciplines (visual arts, theatre, musical theatre, dance, and music).

[ 327 ] The Chicago Public Library system operates three regional libraries and 77 neighborhood branches, including the central library.

[ 328 ] Colleges and universities For a more comprehensive list, see List of colleges and universities in Chicago .

The University of Chicago campus as seen from the Midway Plaisance Since the 1850s, Chicago has been a world center of higher education and research with several universities. These institutions consistently rank among the top "National Universities" in the United States, as determined by U.S. News & World Report .

Other notable schools include: Chicago State University ; the School of the Art Institute of Chicago ; East–West University ; National Louis University ; North Park University ; Northeastern Illinois University ; Robert Morris University Illinois ; Roosevelt University ; Saint Xavier University ; Rush University ; and Shimer College .

[ 330 ] William Rainey Harper , the first president of the University of Chicago, was instrumental in the creation of the junior college concept, establishing nearby Joliet Junior College as the first in the nation in 1901.

[ 331 ] His legacy continues with the multiple community colleges in the Chicago proper, including the seven City Colleges of Chicago : Richard J. Daley College , Kennedy–King College , Malcolm X College , Olive–Harvey College , Truman College , Harold Washington College , and Wilbur Wright College , in addition to the privately held MacCormac College .

Chicago was home of The Oprah Winfrey Show from 1986 until 2011, and of other Harpo Production operations until 2015.

Television The Chicago metropolitan area is a major media hub and the third-largest media market in the United States, after New York City and Los Angeles.

WGN is owned by the CW through a majority stake held in the network by the Nexstar Media Group , which acquired it from its founding owner Tribune Broadcasting in 2019. WGN was once carried, with some programming differences, as " WGN America " on cable and satellite TV nationwide and in parts of the Caribbean . WGN America eventually became NewsNation in 2021.

Chicago has also been the home of several prominent talk shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show , Steve Harvey Show , The Rosie Show , The Jerry Springer Show , The Phil Donahue Show , The Jenny Jones Show , and more. The city also has one PBS member station (its second: WYCC 20, removed its affiliation with PBS in 2017 [ 333 ] ): WTTW 11, producer of shows such as Sneak Previews , The Frugal Gourmet , Lamb Chop's Play-Along and The McLaughlin Group .

Chicago is a major transportation hub in the United States. It is an important component in global distribution, as it is the third-largest inter-modal port in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore .

[ 337 ] The city of Chicago has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 26.5 percent of Chicago households were without a car, and increased slightly to 27.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Chicago averaged 1.12 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

[ 338 ] Parking Due to Chicago's wheel tax , [ 339 ] residents of Chicago who own a vehicle are required to purchase a Chicago City Vehicle Sticker.

[ 340 ] In established Residential Parking Zones, only local residents can purchase Zone-specific parking stickers for themselves and guests.

[ 341 ] [ 342 ] Chicago since 2009 has relinquished rights to its public street parking.

[ 343 ] In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion deal to lease its parking meter system to an operating company created by Morgan Stanley , called Chicago Parking Meters LLC . Daley said the "agreement is very good news for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy." [ 344 ] The rights of the parking ticket lease end in 2081, and since 2022 have already recouped over $1.5 billion in revenue for Chicago Parking Meters LLC investors.

[ 345 ] Expressways Further information: Roads and expressways in Chicago Seven mainline and four auxiliary interstate highways ( 55 , 57 , 65 (only in Indiana), 80 (also in Indiana ), 88 , 90 (also in Indiana ), 94 (also in Indiana ), 190 , 290 , 294 , and 355 ) run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S. Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan) and one named after two-time Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson .

The Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways are the busiest state maintained routes in the entire state of Illinois.

[ 346 ] Transit systems Chicago Union Station , opened in 1925, is the third-busiest passenger rail terminal in the United States.

The Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a rapid transit elevated and subway system known as the Chicago "L" or just the "L" (short for "elevated"), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both Midway and O'Hare Airports. The CTA's rail lines consist of the Red , Blue , Green , Orange , Brown , Purple , Pink , and Yellow lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of three in the United States, the other are New York City and Philadelphia) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.

Metra , the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line commuter rail service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The Metra Electric Line shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's South Shore Line , which provides commuter service between South Bend and Chicago.

Pace provides bus and paratransit service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.

[ 347 ] Greyhound Lines provides inter-city bus service to and from the city at the Chicago Bus Station , and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of Megabus (North America) .

Passenger rail An Amtrak train on the Empire Builder route departs Chicago from Union Station .

Amtrak long distance and commuter rail services originate from Union Station .

[ 348 ] Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation.

[ 349 ] The services terminate in Port Huron , St. Paul , the San Francisco Area, New York City, New Orleans, Portland , Seattle , Miami , Milwaukee , Carbondale , Quincy , Boston, St. Louis , Kansas City , Grand Rapids , Los Angeles, San Antonio , and Pontiac . Future service will terminate at Moline . An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad . Parts of this were built, but it was never completed.

Bicycle and scooter sharing systems In July 2013, the bicycle-sharing system Divvy was launched with 750 bikes and 75 docking stations [ 350 ] It is operated by Lyft for the Chicago Department of Transportation .

[ 351 ] As of July 2019, Divvy operated 5800 bicycles at 608 stations, covering almost all of the city, excluding Pullman , Rosedale, Beverly , Belmont Cragin and Edison Park .

[ 352 ] In May 2019, The City of Chicago announced its Chicago's Electric Shared Scooter Pilot Program, scheduled to run from June 15 to October 15.

[ 353 ] The program started on June 15 with 10 different scooter companies, including scooter sharing market leaders Bird , Jump , Lime and Lyft .

[ 354 ] Each company was allowed to bring 250 electric scooters , although both Bird and Lime claimed that they experienced a higher demand for their scooters.

[ 355 ] The program ended on October 15, with nearly 800,000 rides taken.

[ 356 ] Freight rail Chicago is the largest hub in the railroad industry.

[ 357 ] All five Class I railroads meet in Chicago. As of 2002 [update] , severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long to get through the Chicago region as it took to get there from the West Coast of the country (about 2 days).

[ 358 ] According to U.S. Department of Transportation, the volume of imported and exported goods transported via rail to, from, or through Chicago is forecast to increase nearly 150 percent between 2010 and 2040.

[ 359 ] CREATE, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program , comprises about 70 programs, including crossovers, overpasses and underpasses, that intend to significantly improve the speed of freight movements in the Chicago area.

[ 360 ] Airports Further information: Transportation in Chicago § Airports O'Hare International Airport Chicago is served by O'Hare International Airport , the world's busiest airport measured by airline operations, [ 361 ] on the far Northwest Side, and Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second-busiest by total passenger traffic.

[ 362 ] Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago.

Gary/Chicago International Airport and Chicago Rockford International Airport , located in Gary, Indiana and Rockford, Illinois , respectively, can serve as alternative Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway. In recent years the state of Illinois has been leaning towards building an entirely new airport in the Illinois suburbs of Chicago.

[ 363 ] The City of Chicago is the world headquarters for United Airlines , the world's third-largest airline.

Port authority Main article: Port of Chicago The Port of Chicago consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago operated by the Illinois International Port District (formerly known as the Chicago Regional Port District).

The Illinois International Port district also operates Foreign trade zone No. 22, which extends 60 miles (97 km) from Chicago's city limits.

Utilities Electricity for most of northern Illinois is provided by Commonwealth Edison , also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders Iroquois County to the south, the Wisconsin border to the north, the Iowa border to the west and the Indiana border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of Exelon ) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any U.S. state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city began installing wind turbines on government buildings to promote renewable energy.

[ 365 ] [ 366 ] [ 367 ] Natural gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group , which is headquartered in Chicago.

Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now landfilled , mainly in the Calumet area . From 1995 to 2008, the city had a blue bag program to divert recyclable refuse from landfills.

[ 368 ] Because of low participation in the blue bag programs, the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling like other cities. This proved successful and blue bins were rolled out across the city.

[ 369 ] Health systems Prentice Women's Hospital on the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Downtown Campus The Illinois Medical District is on the Near West Side. It includes Rush University Medical Center , ranked as the second best hospital in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report for 2014–16, the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago , Jesse Brown VA Hospital, and John H.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

The University of Illinois College of Medicine at UIC is the second-largest medical school in the United States (2,600 students, including those at campuses in Peoria, Rockford and Urbana–Champaign ).

[ 373 ] In addition, the Chicago Medical School and Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine are located in the suburbs of North Chicago and Maywood , respectively. The Midwestern University Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine is in Downers Grove .
