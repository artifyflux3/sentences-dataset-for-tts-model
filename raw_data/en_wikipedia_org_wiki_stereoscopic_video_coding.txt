( July 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 3D video coding is one of the processing stages required to manifest stereoscopic content into a home . There are three techniques which are used to achieve stereoscopic video: [ 1 ] Color shifting ( anaglyph ) Pixel subsampling (side-by-side, checkerboard, quincunx ) Enhanced video stream coding ( 2D+Delta , 2D+Metadata, 2D plus depth ) Spatial video encoding [ edit ] MV-HEVC , extension of HEVC (H.265) Multiview Video Coding (MVC 3D) See also [ edit ] 2D plus Delta 2D-plus-depth Motion compensation Multiview Video Coding References [ edit ] ^ "Compatible Video Coding of Stereoscopic Sequences using MPEG-2's Scalability and Interlaced Structure" (PDF) .
