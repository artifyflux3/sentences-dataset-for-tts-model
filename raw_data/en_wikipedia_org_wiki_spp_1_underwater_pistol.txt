[ 2 ] It was developed in the late 1960s and accepted for use in 1975.

[ 8 ] Under water, standard bullets are inaccurate and have very short range. This pistol instead fires a round-based 4.5 millimetres (0.18 in) caliber steel dart about 115 millimetres (4.5 in) long, weighing 12.8 grams (0.45 oz), which has longer range and more penetrating power than a speargun . The complete cartridge is 145 millimetres (5.7 in) long and weighs 17.5 grams (0.62 oz).

[ 7 ] Design [ edit ] The SPP-1 has four barrels, each containing one cartridge. Its ammunition comes as a magazine of four cartridges which is inserted into the pistol's breech.

[ 6 ] Its barrel is not rifled ; the fired projectile is kept in line by hydrodynamic effects. As a result, it is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.

[ 1 ] A double-action firing mechanism fires one cartridge sequentially for each pull of the trigger. When all four cartridges are spent, the gun can be reloaded above or below water.

[ 2 ] The SPP-1M pistol is essentially the same as the SPP-1, with the following differences: [ 6 ] It has an extra spring above the sear to improve the trigger pull.

Its trigger guard is larger to accommodate diving gloves.

The weapon was designed by Vladimir Simonov , the cartridge by Pyotr Sazonov and Oleg Kravchenko .

[ 1 ] Simonov also designed the APS amphibious rifle .

[ 9 ] Performance [ edit ] Depth reduces range because the higher pressure closes the cavity sooner. Once the projectile is no longer supercavitating , hydrodynamic drag increases greatly, and the projectile becomes unstable.

Lethal range is defined as the range from which it can easily penetrate a padded underwater suit or a 5 millimetres (0.20 in) thick glass faceplate.

[ 5 ] It is manufactured by TOZ (Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod/ Тульский Оружейный Завод) Tula Arms Plant , [ 3 ] and exported by Rosoboronexport , [ 2 ] the state agency for Russia's export and import of defense-related products.
