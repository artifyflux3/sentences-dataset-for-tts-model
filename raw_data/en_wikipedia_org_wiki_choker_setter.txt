[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The work process involves the choker setter wrapping a special cable end (choker) around a log and then moving clear so the yarding engineer (e.g. skidder operator) can pull the log to a central area.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In clearcutting , fallers will typically cut down all the trees and limb and buck them into logs before the choke setters and others arrive to remove the logs.

[ 5 ] New chokers are often radio controlled, making the job both easier and safer.
