[ 10 ] History [ edit ] Suffolk University founder Gleason Archer Sr.

, c.

1915 Suffolk University was initially founded as a law school in 1906 by Boston lawyer Gleason Archer Sr.

, who named it "Archer's Evening Law School", intending it for law students who worked during the day. The school was renamed "Suffolk School of Law" in 1907, after Archer moved it from his Roxbury, Massachusetts home into his law offices in downtown Boston .

A year later the first of Archer's students had passed the bar, leading to a boost in registration.

[ 11 ] The school's original goal was to "serve ambitious young men who are obliged to work for a living while studying law." [ 11 ] Calvin Coolidge , then Governor of Massachusetts and eventual 30th President of the United States, laying cornerstone for the law building, in 1920 By 1930, Archer developed Suffolk into one of the largest law schools in the country, and decided to create "a great evening university" that working people could afford.

[ 11 ] The school became a university in the 1930s when the "Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences" was founded in 1934 and the Sawyer Business School—then known as the "College of Business Administration"—in 1937. That same year, the three academic units were incorporated as Suffolk University.

[ 11 ] During the 1990s Suffolk constructed its first residence halls, began satellite programs with other colleges in Massachusetts, and opened its international campuses.

[ 11 ] From 1990 to 2005, its endowment increased over 400%, to approximately $72 million, and enrollment climbed.

[ 12 ] Presidents [ edit ] Gleason Archer Sr.

(1906–1948) Walter Burse (1948–1954) Robert Munce (1954–1960) Dennis C. Haley (1960–1965) John E. Fenton (1965–1970) Thomas Fulham (1970–1980) Daniel Perlman (1980–1989) David Sargent (1989–2010) Barry Brown (2010–2012) (interim) James McCarthy (2012–2014) Norman R. Smith (2014–2015) (interim) Margaret McKenna (2015–2016) [ 13 ] Marisa Kelly (2016–present) Campus [ edit ] Sargent Hall A Suffolk University Law Library reading room The main campus in downtown Boston is situated on well-known Beacon Hill, adjacent to the Massachusetts State House and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court . Up until 1995, Suffolk was a commuter-only school. Today, there are five coed residence halls, housing over 65% of freshman, and a total of 24% of the entire undergraduate population: Smith Hall Nathan R. Miller Hall 10 West Modern Theatre One Court Street [ 14 ] The residence hall at 150 Tremont Street, renamed Smith Hall in 2018, was the first built by the university and currently houses students in singles, doubles, quads, and suites, with communal bathrooms.

Nathan R. Miller Residence Hall (located at 10 Somerset St.) was opened in 2005 and houses 15 floors of freshman, and 2 floors of sophomores in singles, doubles and quads, with bathrooms shared between every two rooms or one bathroom per quad.

The 10 West Residence Hall, opened in 2008, has housing for freshman and sophomores in singles and doubles. Suites accommodate 3–5 students and a variety of apartment-style suites (that include full kitchens) house 2 to 8 students.

Both Miller Hall and 150 Tremont have cafeterias. Students living at 10 West/Modern Theater can eat at 150 Tremont. Suffolk University occasionally leases additional properties (such as the Hyatt & Holiday Inn Beacon Hill). If leased, those locations house freshman students.

The Modern Theatre Residence Hall opened in the fall of 2010 and is considered an extension to the 10 West Resident Hall. The two residence halls share one entrance at 10 West Street. The Modern Theater Residence Hall is built over the restored Modern Theatre (Boston) .

In the fall of 2020, the university added a new residence hall, the Ames Building at One Court Street, which it purchased in the fall of 2019.

[ 15 ] On June 26, 2024, Suffolk University announced plans for a sixth residence hall after the purchase of a new property. President Marisa Kelly said that 101 Tremont Street across from Granary Burial Ground will be converted to an 11-story residence hall following their pending permit and review process of the city of Boston.

Part-time Global MBAs complete either a global experiential research project at their place of business or a 3-month consulting project that includes an intensive 2 week residency outside the US.

Students in their second year are considered candidates for the program by remaining one year at the institution with a 3.5 GPA.
