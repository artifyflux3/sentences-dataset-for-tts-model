All entries must be able to be verified from reliable sources. Up to one percent decline from start to finish is allowed. Times driven privately or by manufacturers need the presence of an independent, reliable source or at least some video footage to confirm the car and tire condition to qualify as independent.

Eligible cars [ edit ] Further information: List of automotive superlatives , Talk:List of fastest production cars § Notes for editors , and Production car Because of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interested groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions, this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the links above.

Production car definition [ edit ] For the purposes of this list, a production car is defined as: Being constructed principally for retail sale to consumers for their personal use, and to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible); Fitted with the original manufacturer-supplied road tires; Having had 25 or more articles made by the original vehicle manufacturer and offered for commercial sale to the public in new condition [ i ] (pre-production prototypes, and cars modified by either professional tuners or individuals, are not eligible); Being street-legal in their intended markets and capable of passing any official tests or inspections required to be granted this status.

By 0–60 mph (97 km/h) (less than 3.0 s) [ edit ] Many elements change how fast the car can accelerate to 60 mph.

[ ii ] [ iii ] Tires, elevation above sea level, weight of the driver, testing equipment, weather conditions and surface of testing track all influence these times.

[ 3 ] Since one-foot rollout before the timer starts is used by some North American publications, times which exclude the time of the first foot of acceleration are included.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] All times are independently tested and verified.

^ Various factors can contribute  to variability in car speed test results. British and U.S. car measurements quote 0–60 miles/hour and 1/4 mile times while European car measurements quote 0–100 kilometers/hour and 400 meter times (which translate to 0–96.5606 kilometers/hour and 402.336 meter times, or to 0–62.1371 miles/hour and 1/4.02336 mile times, respectively) ^ a b Most measurements exclude an initial " rollout ", [ 1 ] which according to Car and Driver "can affect the elapsed time by as much as 0.3 second".

[ 2 ] Furthermore, environmental conditions change how fast the car drives (tires, surface of testing track, wind, elevation above sea level (especially for non-electric vehicles), weight of the driver, and equipment used for testing are all critical). Times sourced for example by Car and Driver , are modified artificially using computer software after the drive test is complete, to theoretically account for how the car would have performed differently given different weather conditions.

[ 3 ] ^ a b c Car models similar to an already mentioned model but differentiated only by minor package options (for example "convertible editions") are omitted acknowledging that speed results with those editions can be only slightly less fast. In the case of a tie between two cars, since there exist a variety of different opinions regarding the interpretation of, for example, 1/4 mile trap speed results, the car shown first is the one with the earlier model year (of the fast time's represented model, and not necessarily of any driven car) or if both years are the same it goes to the car having the earliest date associated with the performance data's verification or publishing.

^ a b c This is the earliest model year of the car that can claim all its following listed data without later modification. This is not necessarily the model year of any driven car, the year when testing was performed, the year during which owners took first delivery of the model, the year it was unveiled, or when it was built.

^ a b List specifications of the tested car here when multiple factory configurations for the model are available, e.g. RWD or AWD, tire options, special option packages, engine output, software updates, etc. If the model is only available in a single configuration, leave it blank.

Motor Trend ´s LaFerrari report published a 9.7 second 1/4 mile after the 9.9 second result was rewritten to account for weather.

Motor Trend stated: " Fiorano 's downhill front straight was the only place we were allowed to do acceleration runs, and we couldn't run backward for a two-way average. The data shows the fastest quarter-mile run declining by 18.2 feet from start to finish, or 1.4%. For reference, the National Hot Rod Association allows a 1.0 percent maximum grade over the course of a quarter mile. It's difficult to say how much of an advantage this gives the LaFerrari, but it helps enough that we'll asterisk these results until we can test a car on level ground". 0-60 mph in 3.68 s and 1/4 mile of 11.03 s @ 141.75 mph were measured on neutral ground.
