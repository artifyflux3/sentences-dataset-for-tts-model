From an anonymous edition published in 1658.

Alexander of Aphrodisias ( Ancient Greek : Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς , romanized : Alexandros ho Aphrodisieus ; fl.

200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of Aristotle . He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school . He wrote many commentaries on the works of Aristotle , extant are those on the Prior Analytics , Topics , Meteorology , Sense and Sensibilia , and Metaphysics . Several original treatises also survive, and include a work On Fate , in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one On the Soul . His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" ( ὁ ἐξηγητής ).

Life and career [ edit ] Alexander was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria (present-day Turkey ) [ 1 ] and came to Athens towards the end of the 2nd century.  He was a student of the two Stoic , [ 2 ] or possibly Peripatetic , philosophers Sosigenes [ 3 ] and Herminus , [ 4 ] and perhaps of Aristotle of Mytilene .

[ 5 ] At Athens he became head of the Peripatetic school and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.  Alexander's dedication of On Fate to Septimius Severus and Caracalla , in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.  A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander.

[ 1 ] His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor Antoninus Pius , while proconsul of Asia.  The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher.  This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexander's corpus should be ascribed to his father.

[ 6 ] Commentaries [ edit ] Commentaria in Analytica priora Aristotelis , 1549 Andrea Briosco , Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias , 16th century plaquette , Bode-Museum Commentaria in meteorologica Aristotelis , 1548 Alexander composed several commentaries on the works of Aristotle , in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle.

[ 7 ] His extant commentaries are on Prior Analytics (Book 1), Topics , Meteorology , Sense and Sensibilia , and Metaphysics (Books 1–5).

[ 8 ] The commentary on the Sophistical Refutations is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the Metaphysics .

[ 9 ] The lost commentaries include works on the De Interpretatione , Posterior Analytics , Physics , On the Heavens , On Generation and Corruption , On the Soul , and On Memory .

[ 9 ] Simplicius of Cilicia mentions that Alexander provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes , and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle .

[ 10 ] In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on Aristotle's Categories in the Archimedes Palimpsest , and Robert Sharples suggested Alexander as the most likely author.

[ 11 ] Original treatises [ edit ] There are also several extant original writings by Alexander. These include: On the Soul , Problems and Solutions , Ethical Problems , On Fate , and On Mixture and Growth .

[ 8 ] Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: Medical Questions , Physical Problems , and On Fevers .

[ 8 ] Additional works by Alexander are preserved in Arabic translation, these include: On the Principles of the Universe , [ 12 ] On Providence , and Against Galen on Motion .

[ 13 ] On the Soul ( De anima ) is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by Aristotle in his own De anima .

[ 14 ] Alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material ( nous hylikos ) and inseparable from the body.

[ 7 ] He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.

[ 7 ] He identified the active intellect ( nous poietikos ), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God .

[ 7 ] A second book is known as the Supplement to On the Soul ( Mantissa ). The Mantissa is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology .

[ 15 ] The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics , of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light , and the final four with fate and providence .

[ 15 ] The Mantissa was probably not written by Alexander in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.

[ 16 ] Problems and Solutions ( Quaestiones ) consists of three books which, although termed "problems and solutions of physical questions," treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.

[ 17 ] Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with logic and metaphysics , and six with questions of fate and providence.

[ 17 ] It is unlikely that Alexander wrote all of the Quaestiones , some may be Alexander's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.

[ 18 ] Ethical Problems was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the Quaestiones .

[ 17 ] The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on Aristotle, and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from Alexander's school.

[ 19 ] It is likely that the work was not written by Alexander himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving Alexander.

[ 19 ] On Fate is a treatise in which Alexander argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity.

[ 7 ] In On Fate Alexander denied three things - necessity ( ἀνάγκη ), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand ( προκαταβεβλημένα αἴτια ) or predetermined by antecedents ( προηγούμενα αἴτια ). He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today.

[ 20 ] On Mixture and Growth discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies.

[ 21 ] It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on Stoic physics , and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.

[ 21 ] On the Principles of the Universe is preserved in Arabic translation. This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.

[ 22 ] The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.

[ 23 ] Alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.

[ 24 ] The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay.

[ 24 ] His principal sources are the Physics (book 7), Metaphysics (book 12), and the Pseudo-Aristotelian On the Universe .

[ 24 ] On Providence survives in two Arabic versions.

[ 25 ] In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that divine Providence extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.

[ 25 ] Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.

[ 25 ] Influence [ edit ] By the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as "the commentator" ( ὁ ἐξηγητής ).

[ 26 ] His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabs , who translated many of them, [ 7 ] and he is heavily quoted by Maimonides .

In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued a condemnation , which probably targeted the writings of Alexander among others.

[ 27 ] In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by Pietro Pomponazzi (against the Thomists and the Averroists ), [ 7 ] and by his successor Cesare Cremonini .  This school is known as Alexandrists .

Alexander's band , an optical phenomenon , is named after him.

Modern editions [ edit ] Several of Alexander's works were published in the Aldine edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495–1498; his De Fato and De Anima were printed along with the works of Themistius at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into Latin by Grotius and also by Schulthess , was edited by J. C. Orelli , Zürich , 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by H. Bonitz , Berlin, 1847.

[ 7 ] In 1989 the first part of his On Aristotle's Metaphysics was published in English translation as part of the Ancient commentators project . Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.
