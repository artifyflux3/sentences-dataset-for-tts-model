Last update: 2018-10-14 ( March 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Planet Simulator , also known as a Planetary Simulator , is a climate -controlled simulation chamber designed to aid in the study of the origin of life . The device was announced by researchers at McMaster University on behalf of the Origins Institute on 4 October 2018.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The project began in 2012 and was funded with $1 million from the Canada Foundation for Innovation , the Ontario government , and McMaster University . It was built and manufactured by Angstrom Engineering Inc of Kitchener, Ontario .

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] The device was designed and developed by biophysicist Maikel Rheinstadter and co-principal investigators biochemist Yingfu Li and astrophysicist Ralph Pudritz for researchers to study a theory that suggests life on early Earth began in " warm little ponds " rather than in deep ocean vents nearly four billion years ago.

[ 3 ] The device can recreate conditions of the primitive Earth to see whether cellular life can be created, and then later, evolve .

[ 3 ] The Planet Simulator can mimic the environmental conditions consistent on the early Earth and other astronomical bodies, including other planets and exoplanets [ 3 ] by controlling temperature , humidity , pressure , atmosphere and radiation levels within the simulation chamber.
