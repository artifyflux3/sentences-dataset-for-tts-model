The Carlsberg Ridge is the northern section of the Central Indian Ridge , a divergent tectonic plate boundary between the African plate and the Indo-Australian plate , traversing the western regions of the Indian Ocean .

The ridge of which the Carlsberg Ridge is a part extends northward from a triple point junction near the island of Rodrigues (the Rodrigues Triple Point ) to a junction with the Owen fracture zone . The ridge started its northwards propagation in the late Maastrichtian and reached the incipient Arabian Sea in the Eocene . Then it continued to accrete basalt but did not propagate for nearly 30 Ma . Then, in the early Miocene it started to propagate westwards towards the Afar hot spot, opening the Gulf of Aden.

[ 1 ] The Carlsberg Ridge is seismically active, with a major earthquake being recorded by the United States Geological Survey at 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale on July 15, 2003.

[ 2 ] The submarine ridge was discovered by the Danish research vessel Dana during the Carlsberg Foundation's Oceanographic Expedition around the world (1928–1930), better known as the 2nd Dana Expedition , and named after the Carlsberg Foundation , which funded the entire expedition and subsequent analysis and publication of results.
