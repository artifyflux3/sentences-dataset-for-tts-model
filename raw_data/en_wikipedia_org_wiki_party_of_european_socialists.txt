[ 7 ] The PES comprises national-level political parties from all the European economic area states (EEA) plus the United Kingdom. This includes major parties such as the Social Democratic Party of Germany , the French Socialist Party , the British Labour Party , the Italian Democratic Party , the Portuguese Socialist Party , the Romanian Social Democrat Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party . Parties from a number of other European countries and from the Mediterranean region are also admitted to the PES as associate or observer parties.

[ 8 ] Most member, associate, and observer parties are members of the wider Progressive Alliance or Socialist International .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The PES is currently led by its president, Stefan Löfven , a former Prime Minister of Sweden . Its political group in the European Parliament is the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). The PES also operates in the European Committee of the Regions (in the PES Group in the Committee of the Regions ) and the European Council .

Name [ edit ] The party's English name is "Party of European Socialists". In addition, the following names are used in other languages: Albanian : Partia e Socialistëve Europianë Bosnian : Stranka evropskih socijalista Bulgarian : Партия на европейските социалисти Croatian : Stranka europskih socijalista Czech : Strana evropských socialistů Danish : De Europæiske Socialdemokrater Dutch : Partij van Europese Socialisten Estonian : Euroopa Sotsialistlik Partei Finnish : Euroopan sosialidemokraattinen puolue French : Parti socialiste européen German : Sozialdemokratische Partei Europas Greek : Ευρωπαϊκό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα Hungarian : Európai Szocialisták Pártja Icelandic : Flokkur evrópskra sósíalista Irish : Páirtí na Sóisialaithe Eorpach Italian : Partito del Socialismo Europeo Latvian : Eiropas Sociāldemokrātiskā partija Lithuanian : Europos socialistų partija Luxembourgish : Partei vun den Europäesche Sozialisten Macedonian : Партија на европските социјалисти Maltese : Partit tas-Soċjalisti Ewropej Norwegian : Det europeiske sosialdemokratiske partiet Polish : Partia Europejskich Socjalistów Portuguese : Partido Socialista Europeu Romanian : Partidul Socialiștilor Europeni Serbian : Партија европских социјалиста Slovak : Strana európskych socialistov Slovene : Stranka evropskih socialistov Spanish : Partido Socialista Europeo Swedish : Europeiska socialdemokratiska partiet Turkish : Avrupa Sosyalistler Partisi In March 2014 following the congress in Rome, the PES added the tagline "Socialists and Democrats" to its name following the admission of Italy's Democratic Party into the organisation.

[ 9 ] History [ edit ] 1960s [ edit ] In 1961, the Socialists in the European Parliament attempted to produce a common 'European Socialist Programme' but this was neglected due to the applications of Britain, Denmark, Ireland and Norway to join the European Community . The Socialists' 1962 congress pushed for greater democratisation and powers for Parliament, though it was only in 1969 that this possibility was examined by the member states.

[ 10 ] 1970s [ edit ] In 1973, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the European Community , bringing in new parties from these countries. The enlarged Socialist Congress met in Bonn and inaugurated the Confederation of the Socialist Parties of the European Community . The Congress also passed a resolution on social policy , including the right to decent work, social security , democracy and equality in the European economy.

[ 11 ] In 1978, the Confederation of Socialist Parties approved the first common European election Manifesto. It focused on several goals among which the most important were to ensure a right to decent work , fight pollution, end discrimination, protect the consumer and promote peace, human rights and civil liberties.

1980s [ edit ] At its Luxembourg Congress in 1980, the Confederation of Socialist Parties approved its first Statute. The accession of Greece to the EU in 1981, followed by Spain and Portugal in 1986, brought in more parties.

In 1984, a common Socialist election manifesto proposed a socialist remedy for the economic crisis of the time by establishing a link between industrial production, protection of fundamental social benefits, and the fight for an improved quality of life .

[ 11 ] 1990s [ edit ] In 1992, with the European Community becoming the European Union and with the Treaty of Maastricht establishing the framework for political parties at a European level, the Confederation of Socialist Parties voted to transform itself into the Party of European Socialists. The party's first programme concentrated on job creation, democracy, gender equality , environmental and consumer protection, peace and security, regulation of immigration, discouragement of racism and fighting organised crime.

[ 11 ] Along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the founding members of the PES were: [ 12 ] Social Democratic Party of Austria Socialist Party (Francophone) and the Socialist Party (Flemish) of Belgium Social Democrats of Denmark Socialist Party of France Social Democratic Party of Germany Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Greece Labour Party of Ireland Italian Democratic Socialist Party , Italian Socialist Party and Democratic Party of the Left of Italy Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party Labour Party of the Netherlands Socialist Party of Portugal Spanish Socialist Workers' Party Swedish Social Democratic Party Labour Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party of the UK 2000s [ edit ] In 2004, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen defeated Giuliano Amato to be elected President of the PES, succeeding Robin Cook in the post. He was re-elected for a further 2.5 years at the PES Congress in Porto on 8 December 2006 and again at the Prague Congress in 2009.

2010s [ edit ] In 2010, the Foundation for European Progressive Studies was founded as the European political foundation ( think tank ) of the PES.

Mr Rasmussen stood down at the PES Progressive Convention in Brussels on 24 November 2011. He was replaced as interim president by Sergey Stanishev , at the time chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and former prime minister of Bulgaria.

On 28–29 September 2012, the PES Congress in Brussels [ 13 ] Congress elected interim president Sergey Stanishev as full President, as well as four deputies: Jean-Christophe Cambadélis (1st Vice-President – PS ), Elena Valenciano ( PSOE ), Jan Royall ( Labour ) and Katarína Neveďalová ( Smer-SD ). The same Congress elected Achim Post ( SPD ) as its new secretary general, and adopted a process which it described as "democratic and transparent" for electing its next candidate for Commission President in 2014.

[ 14 ] Sergey Stanishev was re-elected PES President on 22–23 June 2015 in Budapest. The Congress also approved Achim Post ( SPD ) as the Secretary-General as well as the four Vice-Presidents: Jean-Christophe Cambadélis ( PS ), Carin Jämtin ( Swedish Social Democratic Party ), Katarína Neveďalová ( Smer-SD ) and Jan Royall ( Labour ).

On 7–8 December 2018, the PES Congress gathered in Lisbon to elect its leadership.

Sergey Stanishev was confirmed as party President and Achim Post ( SPD ) as secretary general.

Iratxe García ( Spanish Socialist Workers' Party ) was elected by the new presidency 1st Vice-President of the PES and Francisco André ( Socialist Party (Portugal) ), Katarína Neveďalová ( Smer-SD ) and Marita Ulvskog ( Swedish Social Democratic Party ) were elected PES Vice-Presidents. During the PES Presidency of October 2019, Heléne Fritzon ( Swedish Social Democratic Party ) became PES Vice-President, replacing Marita Ulvskog.

On 22–23 February 2019, the PES held its Election Congress in Madrid to endorse a Common Candidate and adopt its manifesto for the 2019 European Parliament election . The Election Congress acclaimed European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans and adopted its manifesto: A New Social Contract for Europe.

[ 15 ] 2020s [ edit ] On 16 December 2021, the PES held its Council in Brussels , adopting the resolution: Fairness, Sustainability, Respect: a progressive vision for the future of Europe.

[ 16 ] On 14–15 October 2022, the PES Congress in Berlin elected Stefan Löfven ( Swedish Social Democratic Party ) as PES President and welcomed a new PES leadership team: [ 17 ] Caroline Gennez ( Vooruit (political party) ) as Treasurer, Iratxe García ( Spanish Socialist Workers' Party ) as First Vice President, Katarina Barley ( SPD ) and Francisco André ( Socialist Party (Portugal) ) as Executive Vice Presidents, Tanja Fajon ( Social Democrats (Slovenia) ), Victor Negrescu ( Social Democratic Party (Romania) ), Kati Piri ( Labour Party (Netherlands) ), Andrzej Szejna (New Left), and Radmila Šekerinska ( Social Democratic Union of Macedonia ) as Vice Presidents. Achim Post ( SPD ) continued as Secretary General, Giacomo Filibeck ( Democratic Party (Italy) ) took up the position of Executive Secretary General, Yonnec Polet ( Socialist Party (Belgium) ) remained as Deputy Secretary General, and Saar van Bueren ( Labour Party (Netherlands) ) became Deputy Secretary General. The Congress adopted the resolution: With Courage For Europe: leading Europe through change.

[ 18 ] On 29 June 2023, Georgian Dream was removed from the PES due to activities and positions far outside PES values.

[ 19 ] On 12 October, after the 2023 Slovak parliamentary election , the PES suspended Smer-SD and Hlas-SD over their plans to enter into coalition with the ultranationalist Slovak National Party (SNS), which the PES views as a "radical-right party." [ 20 ] On 2 March 2024, the PES held its Election Congress in Rome and acclaimed European Commissioner Nicolas Schmit as presidential candidate and adopted its election programme.

[ 21 ] Membership [ edit ] The PES has thirty-three full member parties from each of the twenty-seven EU member states, Norway and the UK. There are a further twelve associate and twelve observer parties from other European countries.

At present five countries are led by a PES-affiliated leader, who represents that state at the European Council : Germany ( Olaf Scholz ), Spain ( Pedro Sánchez ), Malta ( Robert Abela ), and Denmark ( Mette Frederiksen ).

The makeup of national delegations to the Council of Ministers is at some times subject to coalitions: for the above governments led by a PES party, that party may not be present in all Council configurations; in other governments led by non-PES parties a PES minister may be its representative for certain portfolios. PES is in coalition in the following countries: Romania, Belgium, Slovenia and Estonia.
