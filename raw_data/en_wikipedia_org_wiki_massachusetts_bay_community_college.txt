( November 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Massachusetts Bay Community College was chartered in February 1961 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as one of the first community colleges in Massachusetts. MassBay opened with temporary campuses in Watertown, in a property leased from Raytheon Company, and Boston, and at the time served just several hundred students. In 1975, the college moved to its permanent location in Wellesley Hills, on the campus of the former Elizabeth Seton High School. In 1990, MassBay entered into a lease with Framingham Public Schools for a second campus in Framingham to house its health sciences and human services programs. In 2001, MassBay opened its Automotive Technology Center in Ashland. In January 2024, the college opened a new 68,000 square foot, LEED Gold Certified MassBay Center for Health Sciences, Early Childhood, and Human Services in Framingham.
