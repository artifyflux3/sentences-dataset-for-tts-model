It has equation x 4 − − x 2 + y 2 = 0.

{\displaystyle x^{4}-x^{2}+y^{2}=0.} It was studied by Camille-Christophe Gerono .

Parameterization [ edit ] Because the curve is of genus zero, it can be parametrized by rational functions; one means of doing that is x = t 2 − − 1 t 2 + 1 , y = 2 t ( t 2 − − 1 ) ( t 2 + 1 ) 2 .

{\displaystyle x={\frac {t^{2}-1}{t^{2}+1}},\ y={\frac {2t(t^{2}-1)}{(t^{2}+1)^{2}}}.} Another representation is x = cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ , y = sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ = sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 φ φ ) / 2 {\displaystyle x=\cos \varphi ,\ y=\sin \varphi \,\cos \varphi =\sin(2\varphi )/2} which reveals that this lemniscate is a special case of a Lissajous figure .

Dual curve [ edit ] The dual curve (see Plücker formula ), pictured below, has therefore a somewhat different character. Its equation is ( x 2 − − y 2 ) 3 + 8 y 4 + 20 x 2 y 2 − − x 4 − − 16 y 2 = 0.

{\displaystyle (x^{2}-y^{2})^{3}+8y^{4}+20x^{2}y^{2}-x^{4}-16y^{2}=0.} Dual to the lemniscate of Gerono References [ edit ] J. Dennis Lawrence (1972).
