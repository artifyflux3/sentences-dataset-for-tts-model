Chartered in 1766, Rutgers was originally called Queen's College [ 10 ] and was affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church . It is the eighth-oldest college in the United States, the second-oldest in New Jersey (after Princeton University ), and one of nine colonial colleges that were chartered before the American Revolution .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In 1825, Queen's College was renamed Rutgers College [ 13 ] in honor of Colonel Henry Rutgers , whose substantial gift to the school had stabilized its finances during a period of uncertainty.

[ 14 ] For most of its existence, Rutgers was a private liberal arts college . It has evolved into a coeducational public research university since being designated the State University of New Jersey by the state's legislature in 1945 and 1956.

[ 15 ] Rutgers has several distinct campuses. Since colonial times, its historic core has been located along College Avenue in New Brunswick, New Jersey .

Rutgers University–New Brunswick also includes the landscaped campus of Douglass College , a women's college that was traditionally paired with Rutgers. It also comprises the campus of Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences , which includes the College Farm and Rutgers Gardens, as well as both the Busch and Livingston campuses in Piscataway.

Apart from the main campus at New Brunswick, campuses at Rutgers University–Newark , Rutgers University–Camden , and Rutgers Health complete the university's main footprint. The university has additional facilities throughout the state, including oceanographic research facilities at the Jersey Shore .

[ 16 ] Rutgers is a land-grant , sea-grant , and space-grant university, as well as the largest university in the state .

[ 17 ] Instruction is offered by 9,000 faculty members in 175 academic departments to over 45,000 undergraduate students and more than 20,000 graduate and professional students.

[ 5 ] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education [ 18 ] and is a member of the Association of American Universities [ 19 ] and the Universities Research Association .

[ 20 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Rutgers University 18th century [ edit ] Two decades after the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University , was established in 1746 by the New Light Presbyterians, ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church , seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the Thirteen Colonies , sought to establish a college to train those who wanted to become ministers within the Dutch Reformed Church in the colony, which developed into the Reformed Church in America .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] The university's coat of arms , featuring four quarters , a reference to the shields of the House of Orange-Nassau (for William III of Orange and England , New Jersey , Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz , and Henry Rutgers [ 23 ] Through several years of effort by Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen (1691–1747) and Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh (1736–1790), later the college's first president, Queen's College received its charter on November 10, 1766, from New Jersey's last royal governor, William Franklin (1730–1813), the son of Benjamin Franklin .

[ 21 ] The original charter established the college under the corporate name the trustees of Queen's College, in New-Jersey , named in honor of Queen Charlotte (1744–1818), and created both the college and the Queen's College Grammar School, intended to be a preparatory school affiliated and governed by the college.

[ 22 ] The Grammar School, today the private Rutgers Preparatory School , was a part of the college community until 1959.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] New Brunswick was chosen as the location over Hackensack because the New Brunswick Dutch had the support of the Anglican population, making the royal charter easier to obtain.

[ 25 ] Old Queens , the oldest building at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey , built between 1809 and 1825; Old Queens houses much of the Rutgers University administration.

The original purpose of Queen's College was to "educate the youth in language, liberal, the divinity, and useful arts and sciences" and for the training of future ministers for the Dutch Reformed Church.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] [ 26 ] In 1771, the college admitted its first students, which included a single sophomore and a handful of first-year students taught by a lone instructor, and granted its first degree in 1774, to Matthew Leydt .

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] Despite the religious nature of the early college, the first classes were held at a tavern called the Sign of the Red Lion.

[ 27 ] When the Revolutionary War broke out and taverns were suspected by the British as being hotbeds of rebel activity, the college abandoned the tavern and held classes in private homes.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] Like many colleges founded in the U.S. during this time, Rutgers benefited from slave labor and funds derived from purchasing and selling slaves. Research undertaken at the university in the 2010s began to uncover and document these connections, including the university's foundation on land taken from the indigenous Lenape people.

[ 28 ] 19th century [ edit ] Further information: Henry Rutgers In its early years, due to a lack of funds, Queen's College was closed for two extended periods. Early trustees considered merging the college with the College of New Jersey, in Princeton , but the measure failed by one vote. They later considered relocating it to New York City .

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] In 1808, after raising $12,000, the college temporarily reopened and broke ground on a building of its own, called " Old Queens ", designed by architect John McComb Jr.

[ 29 ] The college's third president, Ira Condict , laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the New Brunswick Theological Seminary , founded in 1784, relocated from Brooklyn , to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College and the Queen's College Grammar School , and all three institutions were then overseen by the Reformed Church in America .

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] During those formative years, all three institutions fit into Old Queens. In 1830, Queen's College Grammar School moved across the street, and in 1856, the seminary relocated to a seven-acre (28,000 m 2 ) tract less than one-half mile (800 m) away.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), an early benefactor and the namesake of Rutgers University After several years of closure resulting from an economic depression after the War of 1812 , Queen's College reopened in 1825 and was renamed "Rutgers College" in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Henry Rutgers (1745–1830). According to the board of trustees, Colonel Rutgers was honored because he epitomized Christian ethics . A year after the school was renamed, it received two donations from its namesake: a $200 bell still hanging from the cupola of Old Queen's and a $5,000 bond (equivalent to $139,000 in 2024) which placed the college on sound financial footing.

[ 30 ] Rutgers College became the land-grant college of New Jersey in 1864 under the Morrill Act of 1862 , resulting in the establishment of the Rutgers Scientific School, featuring departments of agriculture , engineering , and chemistry .

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] The Rutgers Scientific School would expand over the years to grow into the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station (1880) and divide into the College of Engineering (1914) and the College of Agriculture (1921).

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] Rutgers created the New Jersey College for Women in 1918, and the School of Education in 1924.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] 20th century [ edit ] With the development of graduate education, and the continued expansion of the institution, the collection of schools became Rutgers University in 1924.

[ 24 ] Rutgers College continued as a liberal arts college within the university. Later, University College (1945) was founded to serve part-time, commuting students and Livingston College (1969) was created by the Rutgers Trustees, ensuring that the interests of ethnically diverse New Jersey students were met.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] Rutgers was designated the state university of New Jersey by acts of the New Jersey Legislature in 1945 and 1956.

[ 31 ] Although Rutgers thus became a public university, it still retains—as the successor to the private college founded and chartered in 1766—some private rights and protections regarding its fundamental character and mission.

[ 32 ] The newly-designated state university absorbed the University of Newark in 1946 and then the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School in 1950. These two institutions became Rutgers University–Newark and Rutgers University–Camden , respectively. On September 10, 1970, the board of governors voted to admit women into Rutgers College.

[ 22 ] [ 24 ] On the western end of Voorhees Mall is a bronze statue of William the Silent , commemorating the university's Dutch heritage.

[ 33 ] There were setbacks in the growth of the university. In 1967, the Rutgers Physics Department had a Centers of Excellence Grant from the NSF which allowed the physics department to hire several faculty each year. These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the associate or full professor designation would become tenured. The governor and the chancellor forced Rutgers to lose this grant by rejecting the condition that tenure be granted.

[ 34 ] In 1970, the newly formed Rutgers Medical School hired major faculty members from other institutions. In 1971, the governor's office separated Rutgers Medical School from Rutgers University and made it part of New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry , and many faculty left the medical school, including the dean of the medical school, Dewitt Stetten, who later became the director of the National Institutes of Health. As a result of the separation of the medical school from Rutgers University, Ph.D. programs that had been started in the medical center were lost, and students had to seek other institutions to finish their degrees. After the dissolution of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in 2013, the medical school again became part of the university.

[ 35 ] Before 1982, separate liberal arts faculties existed in the several separate " residential colleges " (Rutgers, Douglass, Livingston, University, and Cook colleges) at Rutgers–New Brunswick.

[ 36 ] In 1982, under president Edward J. Bloustein , the liberal arts faculties of these five institutions were centralized into one college, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which itself had no students. The separate residential colleges persisted for students, and while instructors for classes were now drawn from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, separate standards for admission, good standing, and graduation continued for students, depending on which residential college they were enrolled in.

[ 37 ] In January 1987, around 2,800 non-teaching employees went on strike for increased salaries, which ended after nine days after an agreement with the administration was made.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] 21st century [ edit ] In 2007, Rutgers New Brunswick, Douglass, Livingston, and University Colleges, along with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were merged into the new " School of Arts and Sciences " with one set of admissions criteria, curriculum, and graduation requirements. At this time, the liberal arts components of Cook College were absorbed into the School of Arts and Sciences as well, while the other aspects of that college remained, but as the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. These changes in 2007 ended the 241-year history of Rutgers College as a distinct institution.

[ 40 ] Students at the 2011 Rutgers tuition protests fought against rising education costs and diminished state subsidies. Campus groups (including the Rutgers Student Union, the Rutgers One Coalition, and the Rutgers University Student Assembly (RUSA), supported by New Jersey United Students (NJUS), mobilized to keep the increase in annual student financial obligation to a minimum through marches, sit-ins, letters to administration officials and forums.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] In 2011, there was an attempt by then New Jersey governor Chris Christie and members of the legislature to merge Rutgers–Camden into Rowan University , it ultimately was rejected in part due to several on-campus protests and pushback from Camden faculty, students, and alumni.

[ 43 ] On June 20, 2012, the outgoing president of Rutgers University, Richard L. McCormick , announced that Rutgers will "integrate five acres along George Street between Seminary Place and Bishop Place into the College Avenue Campus." [ 44 ] Most of the block had been occupied by the New Brunswick Theological Seminary . Rutgers agreed to rebuild the seminary in exchange for the land.

[ 45 ] In 2013, most of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey was integrated with Rutgers University and, along with several existing Rutgers units, was reformed as Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] This merger attached the New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School to Rutgers University.

[ 35 ] The Rutgers Shield was released on its 250th year anniversary in 2015 In 2013, Rutgers changed part of its alma mater, " On the Banks of the Old Raritan ." Where the lyrics had stated, "My father sent me to old Rutgers, and resolved that I should be a man," now they state, "From far and near we came to Rutgers, and resolved to learn all that we can." [ 48 ] The song for the Camden campus "On the Banks of the Old Delaware" are lyrically similar aside from the river name.

[ 49 ] In 2016, Rutgers celebrated its 250th anniversary. On May 15, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to speak at the university's commencement.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] The university held a variety of celebrations, academic programs, and commemorative events which culminated on the 250th anniversary date, November 10, 2016.

[ 52 ] In November 2016, Rutgers released research findings that revealed: "an untold history of some of the institution's founders as slave owners and the displacement of the Native Americans who once occupied land that was later transferred to the college." [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In January 2020, Jonathan Holloway made history as the first African American and person of color to be named president of Rutgers.

[ 56 ] On April 9, 2023, three unions voted to go on the first strike by academics in the university's 257-year history. Classes and research were suspended for a week.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted " no confidence " in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools.

[ 59 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] University president [ edit ] See also: List of Rutgers University presidents Since 1785, twenty-two men have served as the institution's president, beginning with Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh , a Dutch Reformed minister who was responsible for establishing the college.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Before 1930, most of the university's presidents were clergy affiliated with Christian denominations in the Reformed tradition .

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Two presidents were alumni of Rutgers College— William H. S. Demarest (Class of 1883) and Philip Milledoler Brett (Class of 1892).

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] The president serves in an ex officio capacity as a presiding officer within the university's 59-member board of trustees and its eleven-member board of governors, [ 65 ] and is appointed by these boards to oversee the day-to-day operations of the university across its campuses. He is charged with implementing "board policies with the help and advice of senior administrators and other members of the university community." [ 66 ] The president is responsible only to those two governing boards—there is no oversight by state officials.

[ 67 ] The current president is William F. Tate IV , who assumed the role on July 1, 2025. He succeeded the 21st president Jonathan Holloway who assumed office on July 1, 2020.

[ 68 ] Governing boards [ edit ] Governance at Rutgers University rests with a board of trustees consisting of 41 members, and a board of governors consisting of 15 voting members: eight are appointed by the Governor of New Jersey and seven chosen by and from among the board of trustees.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body to the board of governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the property and assets of the university that existed before the institution became the State University of New Jersey in 1945. The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of governors in 1956.

[ 72 ] Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.

[ 73 ] The members of the board of trustees are voted upon by different constituencies or appointed. "Two faculty and two students are elected by the University Senate as nonvoting representatives. The 59 voting members are chosen in the following way as mandated by state law: 20 charter members (of whom at least three shall be women), 16 alumni members nominated by the nominating committee of the board of trustees, and five public members appointed by the governor of the state with confirmation by the New Jersey Senate .

The New Brunswick Campus, located in New Brunswick and adjacent Piscataway , is the largest campus of the university. The Newark Campus in Newark and the Camden Campus in Camden are located in the northern and southern parts of the state, respectively.

[ 75 ] Combined, these campuses comprise 33 degree-granting schools and colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels of study.

[ 75 ] The university is centrally administered from New Brunswick, although chancellors at the Newark and Camden campuses hold significant autonomy for some academic issues.

[ 76 ] Rutgers–New Brunswick [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers University–New Brunswick The Honors College at Rutgers University–New Brunswick The New Brunswick Campus (or Rutgers–New Brunswick) is the largest campus and the site of the original Rutgers College. Spread across six municipalities in Middlesex County, New Jersey , it lies chiefly in the City of New Brunswick and adjacent Piscataway and is composed of five smaller campuses and a few buildings in downtown New Brunswick. The historic College Avenue Campus is close to downtown New Brunswick and includes the seat of the university, Old Queens and other nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century buildings that constitute the Queens Campus and Voorhees Mall . Its proximity to New Brunswick's train station and numerous food vendors located downtown, in addition to a large amount of off-campus housing and fraternity and sorority houses, make this a popular weekend destination.

Across the city, Douglass Campus and Cook Campus are intertwined and often referred to as the Cook/Douglass Campus. Cook Campus has extensive farms and woods that reach North Brunswick and East Brunswick. Separated by the Raritan River is Busch Campus , in Piscataway, and Livingston Campus, also mainly in Piscataway but including remote sections of land extending into Edison and Highland Park. The Busch Campus is noted as the home of Rutgers' highly ranked Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, as well as the golf course and football stadium. The Livingston campus is home to Jersey Mike's Arena (formerly the Rutgers Athletic Center [RAC]), a trapezoidal building that is home to many sports teams, notably the men's basketball team. Additionally, this campus has undergone many renovations and is regarded as the most "modern" campus. The campus entrance is delineated by the all-glass Rutgers Business School building known as "100 Rock" (because of the building's Piscataway address, 100 Rockafeller Road).

Rutgers Campus Buses transport students between the various campuses.

[ 77 ] As of 2010, the New Brunswick-Piscataway campuses include 19 undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including the School of Arts and Sciences , the School of Communication and Information , the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy , the School of Engineering , the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences , the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy , the Graduate School, the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, the Graduate School of Education, the School of Management and Labor Relations , Mason Gross School of the Arts , the College of Nursing, the Rutgers Business School and the School of Social Work. As of 2012 [update] , 40,434 students (31,593 undergraduates and 8,841 graduate students) were enrolled at the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus.

[ 4 ] The New Brunswick-Piscataway campus includes a Business School building on the Livingston Campus.

[ 78 ] Rutgers–Newark [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers University–Newark Further information: Rutgers Business School , Rutgers Law School , and Rutgers University School of Public Affairs and Administration The Newark Campus (or Rutgers–Newark) consists of eight undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including Newark College of Arts and Sciences, University College, School of Criminal Justice, Graduate School, School of Nursing, School of Public Affairs and Administration , Rutgers Business School and the Newark location of the Rutgers Law School . As of 2012 [update] , 7,666 undergraduates and 4,345 graduate students (total 12,011) are enrolled at the Newark campus.

[ 4 ] Originally the University of Newark, the campus was renamed and rebranded as Rutgers–Newark in 1945.

Rutgers–Camden [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers University–Camden Further information: Rutgers Law School Rutgers University–Camden 's quad walk The Camden Campus (or Rutgers–Camden) consists of six undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including Camden College of Arts and Sciences, University College, Graduate School, Rutgers School of Business–Camden, Rutgers School of Nursing–Camden, [ 79 ] and the Camden location of the Rutgers Law School . The schools are located in the Cooper's Grant and Central Waterfront neighborhoods of Camden. As of 2012 [update] , 4,708 undergraduates and 1,635 graduate students (total 6,343) are enrolled at the Camden campus.

[ 4 ] The campus was founded as the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School in the 1920s, and became part of Rutgers in 1950.

[ 80 ] Rutgers Health [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers Health Rutgers Health (formerly Rutgers Biomedcial and Health Sciences) is a division of the university that serves as an umbrella organization for schools, centers, and institutes from Rutgers University and the old University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey . The organization was incorporated into the university following the 2013 merger of Rutgers and UMDNJ.

[ 81 ] While its various facilities are spread across several locations statewide, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences is considered a "campus" for certain organizational purposes, such as the appointment of a separate chancellor.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] In July 2023, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences renamed to Rutgers Health.

[ 86 ] Rutgers Health comprises nine schools and other research centers and institutes including; Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, New Jersey Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Nursing , School of Dental Medicine, School of Health Related Professions, the School of Public Health, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Environmental and the Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Brain Health Institute, and the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research. The programs are offered at different location sites across New Jersey in New Brunswick, Newark, Blackwood , Stratford and Scotch Plains, New Jersey .

[ 87 ] Rutgers-Online [ edit ] As of 2015, Rutgers offered a total of 11 fully online degree programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

[ 88 ] Online degree programs at Rutgers must meet the same academic expectations, in terms of both teaching and learning outcomes, as traditional on-campus programs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of courses were conducted through remote instruction.

[ 89 ] Off-campus [ edit ] Rutgers offers classes at several off-campus sites in affiliation with community colleges and other state colleges throughout New Jersey.

[ 90 ] These partnerships are designed to enable students to achieve a seamless transfer to Rutgers and to take all of their Rutgers classes in a select number of the most popular majors at the community college campus. The collaborative effort provides access to Rutgers faculty teaching Rutgers courses, at a convenient location, but it is also one of the few programs that cater exclusively to the non-traditional student population. Rutgers' current partners include Atlantic Cape , Brookdale , Mercer , Morris , Camden , and Raritan Valley community colleges.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Academics [ edit ] The university offers more than 100 distinct bachelor, 100 masters, and 80 doctoral and professional degree programs across 175 academic departments, 29 degree-granting schools, and colleges, 16 of which offer graduate programs of study.

[ 93 ] It is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (1921), and in 1989, became a member of the Association of American Universities , an organization of the 62 leading research universities in North America.

[ 94 ] Rutgers–New Brunswick is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 95 ] Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden are classified by the same organization as "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".

The Office of Institutional Research and Academic Planning estimates that costs in-state students of attending Rutgers would amount to $25,566 for an undergraduate living on-campus and $30,069 for a graduate student. For an out-of-state student, the costs rise to $38,228 and $39,069 respectively.

[ 4 ] As of the 2024–2025 academic school year, the estimated cost of tuition for in-state students is $14,222, $33,734 for out-of-state students, and $15,332 for Room and Board.

[ 105 ] In the 2010–2011 academic year, undergraduate students at Rutgers, through a combination of federal (53.5%), state (23.6%), university (18.1%), and private (4.8%) scholarships, loans, and grants, received $492,260,845 of financial aid . 81.4% of all undergraduates, or 34,473 students, received some form of financial aid. During the same period, graduate students, through a combination of federal (61.9%), state (1.8%), university (34.5%), and private (1.9%) scholarships, loans, and grants received $182,384,256 of financial aid. 81.5% of all graduate students, or 11,852 students received some form of financial aid.

[ 4 ] Alongside Pell and TAG grant which are well-known federal and state aids, Rutgers provides EOF grant, merit based scholarships such as SAS Excellence Award, Scarlet Guarantee, and many other forms of aid. Rutgers is an active participant of the EOF program giving financially or academically disadvantaged students resources to success. Furthermore, the Scarlet Guarantee covers any tuition cost for students whose aid might not if the student's household income is below a certain amount. Apart from need based aid, Rutgers University have a list of Scholarships which first-time or continuing students can apply to based upon GPA and/or extra-curriculum involvement. The University also offers multiple opportunities for students to earn while in college through Federal Work Study, on-campus employment, and internships.

[ 106 ] In 2007, the university's Office for Enrollment Management launched the Rutgers Future Scholars Program as an initiative to help 7th graders from low-income families achieve academic success and be the first in their families to go to college. The program targets students from the school systems of Rutgers's hometowns, New Brunswick/Piscataway, Newark, and Camden. Once admitted, the students receive mentoring and college prep courses each summer leading up to the year of their college applications. If admitted to the university, they are given a full tuition scholarship for four years of undergraduate study. The program has been very successful and currently admits as many as 200 new 7th graders each year with most of the original 200 now attending the university as undergraduates.

[ 107 ] Academic Support [ edit ] Rutgers University have a variety of resources to help students succeed academically. Rutgers offers academic counselling to help students plan a study schedule, plan a schedule for the semester, decide their major, and complete their major requirements in time. The Learning Centers at Rutgers provide Peer Tutoring and Study Groups where students can work with or receive help from others who are taking or have taken the same courses. Certain courses provide extra tutoring like the Computer Science program offer tutoring from RUCATS(Rutgers Computing Academic Tutoring for Students). Students can use resources such as the Penji app to find available academic support. Rutgers offers these academic support resources motioned above for free to its students.

This research center hosts researchers in psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , electrical engineering , and anthropology .

[ 148 ] It was at Rutgers that Selman Waksman discovered several antibiotics , including actinomycin , clavacin , streptothricin , grisein, neomycin , fradicin , candicidin , candidin, and others. Waksman, along with graduate student Albert Schatz , discovered streptomycin —a versatile antibiotic that was to be the first applied to cure tuberculosis . For this discovery, Waksman received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1952.

[ 149 ] Rutgers developed water-soluble sustained release polymers, tetraploids , robotic hands , artificial bovine insemination , and the ceramic tiles for the heat shield on the Space Shuttle . In health-related field, Rutgers has the Environmental & Occupational Health Science Institute (EOHSI).

[ 150 ] Rutgers is also home to the RCSB Protein Data bank , [ 151 ] 'an information portal to Biological Macromolecular Structures' cohosted with the San Diego Supercomputer Center . This database is the authoritative research tool for bioinformaticists using protein primary, secondary and tertiary structures worldwide.'

330 Cooper student housing on the Camden campus Demarest Hall dormitory on the New Brunswick campus Rutgers University offers a variety of housing options. On the New Brunswick -Piscataway campus, students are given the option of on-campus housing in both traditional dorms or apartments. Freshman students, however, are allowed only a dorm, while upperclassmen have a wider array of on-campus housing choices, like apartments, but must apply for on-campus housing through the Rutgers online lottery process. Most students seeking on-campus housing will be accommodated with a space and sophomores are guaranteed housing.

[ 157 ] Many Rutgers students opt to rent apartments or houses off-campus within the city of New Brunswick.

[ 158 ] Similar setups are to be found in Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden.

Rutgers University's three campuses are in Newark , Camden , and New Brunswick .

In 2008, U.S. News & World Report ranked Rutgers University–Newark the most diverse university campus in the United States.

[ 159 ] Because the area of Rutgers' New Brunswick-Piscataway campus—which is composed of several constituent colleges and professional schools—is sprawled across six municipalities, the individual campuses are connected by an inter-campus bus system. The Rutgers bus system is the second-largest bus service in New Jersey, transporting six million passengers on an annual basis.

[ 160 ] Security and emergency services [ edit ] Services provided by the university include Rutgers Police , Emergency Medical Services, an emergency management office, bus and shuttle service , inter- and intra-campus mail, and occupational and environmental health and safety.

[ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] Student organizations and activities [ edit ] Shrubbery at the College Avenue campus Rutgers Law School on the Newark Campus Rutgers University has a student government that controls funding to student groups. The student government is made up of campus councils and professional school councils. Those councils then send representatives to the student assembly as well as the university senate. An example of these campus councils is the University College Council, which represents adult, part-time, and military veteran students.

[ 164 ] Rutgers hosts over 700 student organizations ; among the first student groups was the first college newspaper in the United States .

The Political Intelligencer and New Jersey Adviser began publication at Queen's College in 1783, and ceased operation in 1785.

[ 24 ] Continuing this tradition is the university's current college newspaper, The Daily Targum , established in 1869, which is the second-oldest college newspaper published in the United States, after The Dartmouth (1843). Both poet Joyce Kilmer and economist Milton Friedman served as editors. Also included are The Medium , a weekly satirical newspaper billed as Rutgers Entertainment Weekly, Rutgers Centurion , a conservative newspaper, the Rutgers University Glee Club , a male choral singing group established in 1872 (among the oldest in the country). Rutgers a cappella groups have routinely placed well in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella , including in 2010 when The OrphanSporks placed second in the semifinals.

[ 165 ] Governed by the Rutgers University Student Assembly and funded by student fees, students can organize groups for practically any political ideology or issue, ethnic or religious affiliation, academic subject, activity or hobby.

[ 166 ] Rutgers University is home to chapters of many Greek organizations , and a significant percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. Several fraternities and sororities maintain houses for their chapters in the area of Union Street (known familiarly as "Frat Row") in New Brunswick , within blocks of Rutgers' College Avenue Campus. Chapters of Zeta Psi and Delta Phi were organized at Rutgers as early as 1845. The Alpha Rho chapter of Chi Psi fraternity, founded at Rutgers College in 1879, was the first fraternity at Rutgers to own a fraternity house, purchased in 1887 and still in use by the fraternity today. There are over fifty fraternities and sororities on the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, ranging from traditional to historically African-American , Hispanic , Multicultural , and Asian interest organizations.

[ 167 ] The New Brunswick campus of Rutgers University has a chapter of the only active co-ed pre-medical fraternity, Phi Delta Epsilon , as of 2008 [update] .

[ 168 ] Most Greek organizations are governed by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, but twelve organizations maintain chapters in New Brunswick without sanction by the university's administration.

[ 169 ] It is Rutgers's tradition for students to participate in one of the largest student-run philanthropic events in New Jersey, the Embrace Kids Foundation for children with cancer and blood disorders. The annual Dance Marathon involves hundreds of dancers and volunteers. In 2015, the marathon collected $692,046.

[ 170 ] [ 171 ] Rutgers has five vocal ensembles: Voorhees Choir (the New Brunswick campus's women's ensemble), Kirkpatrick Choir (the university's most selective coed ensemble), Glee Club (New Brunswick's most esteemed tenor-bass ensemble), [ 172 ] University Choir (a larger mixed choir in New Brunswick), and the Rutgers Concert Choir (Camden's vocal ensemble of faculty and students).

[ 173 ] [ 174 ] Traditions [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers University traditions The Grease Trucks are a group of truck-based food vendors located at various locations on the New Brunswick campus. They serve traditional grill fare and Middle-Eastern specialties. Three Rutgers Grease Trucks remain on the College Avenue Campus, while the remaining two were moved to the Cook/Douglass Campus.

[ 175 ] The Dance Marathon is a student-run fundraisers. Hundreds of dancers pledge to raise funds and remain standing for 32 hours. Rutgers has held this tradition since 1999 and to date has raised more than $1.3 million for the Embrace Kids Foundation and for other charities. In the two decades starting in 1998, the event had raised $5.8 million for the Embrace Kids Foundation.

[ 176 ] Rutgers Day is an annual festival established in 1906.

[ 177 ] Mottos, colors and mascots [ edit ] Rutgers University's motto Sol iustitiae et occidentem illustra is a modification of Utrecht University 's motto Sol iustitiae illustra nos gleaned from a literal Latin Bible translation of Malachi 4:2 and highlights the historic connection of these two universities.

[ 178 ] Rutgers University's only school color is scarlet . Students had sought to make orange the school color, citing Rutgers' Dutch heritage and about the Prince of Orange . The Rutgers student publication Targum (which would become the Daily Targum ) proposed that scarlet be adopted in May 1869, claiming that it was a striking color and because the scarlet ribbon was easily obtained. During the first intercollegiate football game with Princeton on November 6, 1869, the players from Rutgers wore scarlet-colored turbans and handkerchiefs to distinguish them as a team from the Princeton players.

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] The board of trustees officially made scarlet the school color in 1900.

[ 180 ] In its early days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as "The Scarlet" after the school color, or as "Queensmen" after the institution's first name, Queen's College.

[ 180 ] In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox ( Le Roman de Renart ) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales .

[ 180 ] At the time, the student humor magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer , and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926.

[ 181 ] The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College , in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard .

[ 181 ] However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with "being chicken ." [ 182 ] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as "Queensmen," the "Scarlet," the "Red Lions," the "Redmen" and the "Flying Dutchmen." [ 180 ] [ 183 ] Earlier proposed nicknames included "Pioneers" and "Cannoneers." When Harvey Harman , then coach of the football team was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, "Awnish You can call it the Chanticleer, you can call it a fighting cock , you can call it any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [ 184 ] Harman later is said to have bought the first "Scarlet Knight" mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.

[ 185 ] Today, the Scarlet Knight costumed mascot appearing at Rutgers football and basketball games and other campus events is called "Sir Henry".

[ 9 ] In later years the Camden and Newark campuses adopted their mascots, the Scarlet Raptor (Camden) and the Scarlet Raider (Newark).

[ 186 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Rutgers Scarlet Knights See also: List of college athletic programs in New Jersey, USA § Division I The Rutgers "R" logo debuted in 1998 and has represented the school in athletics since.

The Rutgers college football team in 1882 The Rutgers-New Brunswick men's varsity eight rowing on the Raritan River SHI Stadium , the home field of Scarlet Knights football The Rutgers–Camden athletic teams are called the Scarlet Raptors . The Rutgers–Newark athletic teams are called the Scarlet Raiders . The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA Division III .

[ 187 ] Rutgers was among the first American institutions to engage in intercollegiate athletics, and participated in a small circle of schools that included Yale University , Columbia University , and long-time rival, Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey). The four schools met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition, and particularly to codify the new game of football . Although invited, Harvard chose not to attend.

[ 188 ] In the early years of intercollegiate athletics, the schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the American Northeast and by the turn of the 20th century, colleges and universities across the United States began to participate.

[ 189 ] Rutgers University is referred to as "the birthplace of college football " as the first intercollegiate football game was held on College Field between Rutgers and Princeton on November 6, 1869, in New Brunswick, New Jersey , on a plot of ground behind where the present-day College Avenue Gymnasium now stands. Rutgers won the game, with a score of 6 runs to Princeton's 4.

[ 24 ] [ 180 ] [ 190 ] A Rutgers-Princeton rivalry still exists today. According to Parke H. Davis , the 1869 Rutgers football team shared the national title with Princeton.

[ 191 ] (This game is believed to have been closer to soccer than to modern American football.) [ 192 ] In 1864, rowing became the first organized sport at Rutgers. Six-mile races were held on the Raritan River among six-oared boats. In 1870, Rutgers held its first intercollegiate competition, against the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the then top-ranked amateur crew of the time. Women's crew was added to the program in 1974. Financial support of the men's crew program was discontinued by the university in 2006, though the crew continues to compete (funded entirely by alumni and private support) at a high level in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges conference.

[ 193 ] The first intercollegiate athletic event at Rutgers was a baseball game on May 2, 1866, against Princeton in which they suffered a 40–2 loss.

[ 194 ] Beginning in 1866, Rutgers was unaffiliated with any formal athletic conference and thus classified as "independent" for eighty years. From 1946 to 1951, the university was a member of the Middle Three Conference, and from 1958 to 1961, was a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference .

[ 195 ] In 1978, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights became a member of the Atlantic 10 conference. In 1991, it joined the Big East Conference for football. All sports programs at Rutgers New Brunswick subsequently became affiliated with the Big East in 1995.

[ 196 ] The first intercollegiate competition in Ultimate Frisbee was held between students from Rutgers and Princeton on November 6, 1972, to mark the one hundred third anniversary of the first intercollegiate football game. Rutgers won 29–27.

[ 197 ] The Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's Basketball Team was among the "Final Four" and ended the 1976 season ranked fourth in the United States, after an 86–70 loss against the University of Michigan in the semifinals, and a 106–92 loss against UCLA in the consolation round of the 1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament .

[ 198 ] The Rutgers Scarlet Knights are members of the Big Ten Conference , a collegiate athletic conference consisting of 14 colleges and universities from the Midwestern and East Coast regions of the United States. The Big Ten Conference is a member of the Bowl Championship Series . Rutgers currently fields 27 intercollegiate sports programs and is a Division I school as sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association . Rutgers fields thirty teams in NCAA Division I sanctioned sports, including football , baseball , basketball , crew , cross country , fencing , field hockey , golf , gymnastics , lacrosse , soccer , softball , tennis , track and field , swimming and diving , wrestling , and volleyball .

[ 199 ] The Scarlet Knights have won five Big East Conference tournament titles: men's soccer (1997), men's track & field (2005), baseball (2000, 2007), and women's basketball (2007). Several other teams have won regular season titles but failed to win the conference's championship tournament.

[ 200 ] Although the Rutgers Scarlet Knights' football team had losing seasons in 2016 and 2015 (won-lost records of 2–10 and 4–8, respectively) [ 201 ] it achieved success previously, being invited to the Insight Bowl on December 27, 2005, in which they lost 45 to 40 against Arizona State University .

[ 202 ] This was Rutgers' first bowl appearance since the December 16, 1978, loss against Arizona State, 34–18, at the Garden State Bowl . The 2006 football season also saw Rutgers being ranked within the Top 25 teams in major college football polls. After the November 9, 2006, victory over the 3rd ranked, undefeated Louisville Cardinals , Rutgers jumped up to seventh in the AP Poll , eighth in the USA Today/Coaches poll , seventh in the Harris Interactive Poll , and sixth in the Bowl Championship Series rankings. These were Rutgers' highest rankings in the football polls since they were ranked fifteenth in 1961. Rutgers ended the season 11–2 after winning the inaugural Texas Bowl on December 28, 2006, defeating the Wildcats of Kansas State University by a score of 37–10 and finishing the season ranked twelfth in the final AP poll of sportswriters, the team's highest season-ending ranking.

[ 203 ] Under Head Coach C. Vivian Stringer , the women's basketball program is among the elite programs in the country as they remain consistently ranked in the Top 25, consistently making the NCAA Women's Championship Tournament, and sometimes winning the Big East regular season championship. In 2006–2007, the Scarlet Knights won their first-ever Big East Conference Tournament Championship. The program has been highly competitive since its inception, winning the 1982 AIAW National Championship, reaching the 2000 Final Four, and reaching the Final Four and national championship game in 2007.

[ 204 ] The Scarlet Knights maintain athletic rivalries with other collegiate institutions. The university has historic rivalries with Princeton University , Columbia University (formerly King's College ), Lafayette College , Lehigh University , and New York University originating from the early days of college football. While they maintain this rivalry in other sports, neither of them has met in football since 1980. Rutgers has a basketball rivalry with Seton Hall University .

[ 205 ] Penn State and the University of Maryland are the two schools with which Rutgers was developing rivalries within the Big Ten.

[ 206 ] In the fall of 2007, six Rutgers New Brunswick/Piscataway NCAA Division I sports were discontinued by the university, including men's swimming and diving, men's heavyweight and lightweight crew, men's tennis, and men's and women's fencing. Some continued as club teams, while some were disbanded completely.
