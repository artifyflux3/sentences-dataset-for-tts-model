Country United States Presented by Libertarian Futurist Society First award 1979 Currently held by Michael Flynn ( In the Belly of the Whale ) Website lfs.org The Prometheus Award is an award for libertarian science fiction given annually by the Libertarian Futurist Society. American author and activist L. Neil Smith established the Best Novel category for the award in 1979; however, it was not awarded regularly until the newly founded Libertarian Futurist Society revived it in 1982.  The Society created a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (for classic works of libertarian and anti-authoritarian science fiction and fantasy, not necessarily novels) in 1983, and also presents occasional one-off Special Awards.

While the Best Novel category is limited to novels published in English for the first time during the previous calendar year, Hall of Fame nominees — which must have been published at least 20 years ago — may be in any narrative or dramatic form, including novels, novellas, stories, films, television series or episodes, plays, musicals, graphic novels, song lyrics, or verse.

The Best Novel winner receives a plaque with a one-ounce gold coin, and the Hall of Fame winner a plaque with a smaller gold coin.

Prometheus Blog Appreciation Series [ edit ] Since 2019, LFS members have launched an Appreciation series of review-essays honoring all past winners and making clear why each work of fiction fits the distinctive focus of the award – something that was viewed as not necessarily obvious to sf/fantasy fans unfamiliar with the broad scope of libertarian thinking and analysis, which often overlaps with classical liberalism, its philosophical cousin.

Each Appreciation review-essay is published on the Prometheus Blog at https://www.lfs.org/blog/ and then linked next to each winning title on the past-winners list posted on the LFS website's Prometheus Awards page.

Multiple recipients [ edit ] Some authors have won the award for best novel more than once: Thrice [ edit ] Cory Doctorow Victor Koman Ken MacLeod L. Neil Smith Twice [ edit ] Travis J. I. Corcoran Michael F. Flynn James P. Hogan Neal Stephenson Vernor Vinge F. Paul Wilson Daniel Suarez Five authors have won the Prometheus Hall of Fame award more than once: Poul Anderson Robert Heinlein George Orwell Ayn Rand F. Paul Wilson Process [ edit ] Books published in a given year are eligible (although books from the last few months of the previous year are also eligible if it is felt that they have been overlooked).

All members may nominate novels for the award.

Members of the Best Novel Committee read all of the nominated novels (typically between 12 and 16) and vote for a slate of typically 5 finalists.

Full members, Sponsors and Benefactors (higher membership levels) then vote on the finalists.

Step 2 happens in the first few months of the following year.

Step 3 happens in early summer of the following year.

The awards were historically given at the Annual Worldcon or NASFIC . Since the pandemic, they have been presented live via Zoom and then posted on YouTube and the Videos page of the LFS website (www.lfs.org).
