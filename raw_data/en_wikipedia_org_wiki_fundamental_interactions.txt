In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), the **fundamental interactions** or **fundamental forces** are interactions in nature that appear not to be reducible to more basic interactions. There are four fundamental interactions known to exist: [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-Braibant-2011-1) The gravitational and electromagnetic interactions produce long-range forces whose effects can be seen directly in everyday life. The strong and weak interactions produce forces at [subatomic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_scale "Subatomic scale") and govern nuclear interactions inside [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"). Some scientists hypothesize that a [fifth force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_force "Fifth force") might exist, but these hypotheses remain speculative.

Each of the known fundamental interactions can be described mathematically as a _[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field\_(physics) "Field (physics)")_. The gravitational interaction is attributed to the [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), described by [Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")[general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"). The other three are discrete [quantum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), and their interactions are mediated by [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") described by the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-2)

Within the Standard Model, the strong interaction is carried by a particle called the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon") and is responsible for [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") binding together to form [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"), such as [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"). As a residual effect, it creates the [nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear force") that binds the latter particles to form [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). The weak interaction is carried by particles called [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons"), and also acts on the nucleus of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), mediating [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay"). The electromagnetic force, carried by the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), creates [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), which are responsible for the attraction between [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital")[electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and atomic nuclei which holds atoms together, as well as [chemical bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bonding "Chemical bonding") and [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave"), including [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light "Visible light"), and forms the basis for electrical technology. Although the electromagnetic force is far stronger than gravity, it tends to cancel itself out within large objects, so over large (astronomical) distances gravity tends to be the dominant force, and is responsible for holding together the large scale structures in the universe, such as planets, stars, and galaxies. The historical success of models that show relationships between fundamental interactions have led to efforts to go beyond the Standard Model and combine all four forces in to a [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything").

In his 1687 theory, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") postulated space as an infinite and unalterable physical structure existing before, within, and around all objects while their states and relations unfold at a constant pace everywhere, thus [absolute space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time "Absolute space and time"). Inferring that all objects bearing mass approach at a constant rate, but collide by impact proportional to their masses, Newton inferred that matter exhibits an attractive force. His [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation") implied there to be instant interaction among all objects.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-4) As conventionally interpreted, Newton's theory of motion modelled a _[central force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\_force "Central force")_ without a communicating medium.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-6) Thus Newton's theory violated the tradition, going back to [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes"), that there should be no [action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-7) Conversely, during the 1820s, when explaining magnetism, [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") inferred a _field_ filling space and transmitting that force. Faraday conjectured that ultimately, all forces unified into one.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-8)

In 1873, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") unified electricity and magnetism as effects of an electromagnetic field whose third consequence was light, travelling at constant speed in vacuum. If his [electromagnetic field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electrodynamics "Classical electrodynamics") held true in all [inertial frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frames_of_reference "Inertial frames of reference"), this would contradict Newton's theory of motion, which relied on [Galilean relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_relativity "Galilean relativity").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-9) If, instead, his field theory only applied to reference frames at rest relative to a mechanical [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether")—presumed to fill all space whether within matter or in vacuum and to manifest the electromagnetic field—then it could be reconciled with Galilean relativity and Newton's laws. (However, such a "Maxwell aether" was later disproven; Newton's laws did, in fact, have to be replaced.)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-10)

The [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of elementary particles, with the [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") in the first three columns, the [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson") in the fourth column, and the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") in the fifth column

The Standard Model of particle physics was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century. In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions associate with [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particles "Elementary particles"), whose behaviours are modelled in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") (QM). For predictive success with QM's [probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") outcomes, [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") conventionally models QM [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(particle_physics) "Event (particle physics)") across a field set to [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity"), altogether relativistic quantum field theory (QFT).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-11) Force particles, called [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson")—_force carriers_ or _[messenger particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger\_particles "Messenger particles")_ of underlying fields—interact with matter particles, called [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion").

[Everyday matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonic_matter "Baryonic matter") is atoms, composed of three fermion types: [up-quarks and down-quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") constituting, as well as electrons orbiting, the atom's nucleus. Atoms interact, form [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), and manifest further properties through electromagnetic interactions among their electrons absorbing and emitting photons, the electromagnetic field's force carrier, which if unimpeded traverse potentially infinite distance. Electromagnetism's QFT is [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") (QED).

The force carriers of the weak interaction are the massive [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons"). Electroweak theory (EWT) covers both electromagnetism and the weak interaction. At the high temperatures shortly after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), the weak interaction, the electromagnetic interaction, and the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") were originally mixed components of a different set of ancient pre-symmetry-breaking fields. As the early universe cooled, these fields [split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_breaking "Symmetry breaking") into the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the short-range weak interaction, and the Higgs boson. In the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism"), the Higgs field manifests Higgs bosons that interact with some quantum particles in a way that endows those particles with mass. The strong interaction, whose force carrier is the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"), traversing minuscule distance among quarks, is modeled in [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") (QCD). EWT, QCD, and the Higgs mechanism comprise [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics")' [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") (SM). Predictions are usually made using calculational approximation methods, although such [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics) "Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)") is inadequate to model some experimental observations (for instance [bound states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") and [solitons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton "Soliton")). Still, physicists widely accept the Standard Model as science's most experimentally confirmed theory.

Overview of the fundamental interactions
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fundamental_interaction&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Overview of the fundamental interactions")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Particle_overview.svg/500px-Particle_overview.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Particle_overview.svg)

An overview of the various families of elementary and composite particles, and the theories describing their interactions. Fermions are on the left, and bosons are on the right.

In the [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract) "Model (abstract)") of fundamental interactions, [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") consists of [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), which carry [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property "Physical property") called [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)") and [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") ±1⁄2 (intrinsic [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") ±_ħ_⁄2, where ħ is the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant")). They attract or repel each other by exchanging [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson").

The interaction of any pair of fermions in perturbation theory can then be modelled thus:

Two fermions go in → _interaction_ by boson exchange → two changed fermions go out.
The exchange of bosons always carries [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") between the fermions, thereby changing their speed and direction. The exchange may also transport a charge between the fermions, changing the charges of the fermions in the process (e.g., turn them from one type of fermion to another). Since bosons carry one unit of angular momentum, the fermion's spin direction will flip from +1⁄2 to −1⁄2 (or vice versa) during such an exchange (in units of the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant")). Since such interactions result in a change in momentum, they can give rise to classical Newtonian [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"). In quantum mechanics, physicists often use the terms "force" and "interaction" interchangeably; for example, the weak interaction is sometimes referred to as the "weak force".

According to the present understanding, there are four fundamental interactions or forces: [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation"), electromagnetism, the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and the strong interaction. Their magnitude and behaviour vary greatly, as described in the table below. Modern physics attempts to explain every observed [physical phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_phenomenon "Natural phenomenon") by these fundamental interactions.

The fundamental interactions can be compared using dimensionless [coupling constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constants "Coupling constants") the characterize the intensity or "strength" of the interactions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-Braibant-2011-1): 102 [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-12)

The modern (perturbative) [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") view of the fundamental forces other than gravity is that particles of matter ([fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion")) do not directly interact with each other, but rather carry a charge, and exchange [virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particles "Virtual particles") ([gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson")), which are the interaction carriers or force mediators. For example, photons mediate the interaction of [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), and gluons mediate the interaction of [color charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge"). The full theory includes perturbations beyond simply fermions exchanging bosons; these additional perturbations can involve bosons that exchange fermions, as well as the creation or destruction of particles: see [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagrams "Feynman diagrams") for examples.

_Gravitation_ is the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale, where electromagnetic interactions dominate.

Gravitation is the most important of the four fundamental forces for astronomical objects over astronomical distances for two reasons. First, gravitation has an infinite effective range, like electromagnetism but unlike the strong and weak interactions. Second, gravity always attracts and never repels; in contrast, astronomical bodies tend toward a near-neutral net electric charge, such that the attraction to one type of charge and the repulsion from the opposite charge mostly cancel each other out.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-13)

Even though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravitation, electrostatic attraction is not relevant for large celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies, simply because such bodies contain equal numbers of protons and electrons and so have a net electric charge of zero. Nothing "cancels" gravity, since it is only attractive, unlike electric forces which can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, all objects having mass are subject to the gravitational force, which only attracts. Therefore, only gravitation matters on the large-scale structure of the universe.

The long range of gravitation makes it responsible for such large-scale phenomena as the structure of galaxies and [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") and, being only attractive, it slows down the [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe"). Gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena on more modest scales, such as [planetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet")[orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit"), as well as everyday experience: objects fall; heavy objects act as if they were glued to the ground, and animals can only jump so high.

Gravitation was the first interaction to be described mathematically. In ancient times, [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") hypothesized that objects of different masses fall at different rates. During the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution"), [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") experimentally determined that this hypothesis was wrong under certain circumstances—neglecting the friction due to air resistance and buoyancy forces if an atmosphere is present (e.g. the case of a dropped air-filled balloon vs a water-filled balloon), all objects accelerate toward the Earth at the same rate. Isaac Newton's [law of Universal Gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Universal_Gravitation "Law of Universal Gravitation") (1687) was a good approximation of the behaviour of gravitation. Present-day understanding of gravitation stems from Einstein's [General Theory of Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Theory_of_Relativity "General Theory of Relativity") of 1915, a more accurate (especially for [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") masses and distances) description of gravitation in terms of the [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").

Merging general relativity and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") (or [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory")) into a more general theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") is an area of active research. It is hypothesized that gravitation is mediated by a massless [spin-2 particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)#Fermions_and_bosons "Spin (physics)") called the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton").

Although general relativity has been experimentally confirmed (at least for weak fields, i.e. not black holes) on all but the smallest scales, there are [alternatives to general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_general_relativity "Alternatives to general relativity"). These theories must reduce to general relativity in some limit, and the focus of observational work is to establish limits on what deviations from general relativity are possible.

Proposed [extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_dimensions "Extra dimensions") could explain why the gravity force is so weak.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-14)

### Electroweak interaction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fundamental_interaction&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Electroweak interaction")]

[Electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") and weak interaction appear to be very different at everyday low energies. They can be modeled using two different theories. However, above unification energy, on the order of 100 [GeV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeV "GeV"), they would merge into a single electroweak force.

The electroweak theory is very important for modern [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), particularly on how the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") evolved. This is because shortly after the Big Bang, when the temperature was still above approximately 10 15[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin"), the electromagnetic force and the weak force were still merged as a combined electroweak force.

For contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg were awarded the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") in 1979.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-16)

Electromagnetism is the force that acts between [electrically charged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") particles. This phenomenon includes the [electrostatic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_force "Electrostatic force") acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism") forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.

Electromagnetism has an infinite range, as gravity does, but is vastly stronger. It is the force that binds electrons to atoms, and it [holds molecules together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond"). It is responsible for everyday phenomena like [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light"), [magnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet "Magnet"), [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity"), and [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"). Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic-level, properties of the [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element").

In a four kilogram (~1 gallon) jug of water, there is

![Image 7: {\displaystyle 4000\ {\mbox{g}}\,{\rm {{H}_{2}{\rm {{O}\cdot {\frac {1\ {\mbox{mol}}\,{\rm {{H}_{2}{\rm {O}}}}}{18\ {\mbox{g}}\,H_{2}O}}\cdot {\frac {10\ {\mbox{mol}}\,e^{-}}{1\ {\mbox{mol}}\,H_{2}O}}\cdot {\frac {96,000\ {\mbox{C}}\,}{1\ {\mbox{mol}}\,e^{-}}}=2.1\times 10^{8}C\ \,\ }}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2016dd4d95ebbc8f1073dd99b2a1909ab298e69b)

of total electron charge. Thus, if we place two such jugs a meter apart, the electrons in one of the jugs repel those in the other jug with a force of

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {1 \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{\frac {(2.1\times 10^{8}\mathrm {C} )^{2}}{(1m)^{2}}}=4.1\times 10^{26}\mathrm {N} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6bdb301a79d5afa6eb79d50491460d7236afd221)

This force is many times larger than the weight of the planet Earth. The [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") in one jug also repel those in the other with the same force. However, these repulsive forces are canceled by the attraction of the electrons in jug A with the nuclei in jug B and the attraction of the nuclei in jug A with the electrons in jug B, resulting in no net force. Electromagnetic forces are tremendously stronger than gravity, but tend to cancel out so that for astronomical-scale bodies, gravity dominates.

Electrical and magnetic phenomena have been observed since ancient times, but it was only in the 19th century [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same fundamental interaction. By 1864, [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") had rigorously quantified this unified interaction. Maxwell's theory, restated using [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus"), is the classical theory of electromagnetism, suitable for most technological purposes.

The constant [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in vacuum (customarily denoted with a lowercase letter _c_) can be derived from Maxwell's equations, which are consistent with the theory of special relativity. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s 1905 theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), however, which follows from the observation that the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") is constant no matter how fast the observer is moving, showed that the theoretical result implied by Maxwell's equations has profound implications far beyond electromagnetism on the very nature of time and space.

In another work that departed from classical electro-magnetism, Einstein also explained the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect") by utilizing Max Planck's discovery that light was transmitted in 'quanta' of specific energy content based on the frequency, which we now call [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"). Starting around 1927, [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") combined [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") with the relativistic theory of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). Further work in the 1940s, by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson"), [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger "Julian Schwinger"), and [Sin-Itiro Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin-Itiro_Tomonaga "Sin-Itiro Tomonaga"), completed this theory, which is now called [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), the revised theory of electromagnetism. Quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical basis for electromagnetic behavior such as [quantum tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling "Quantum tunneling"), in which a certain percentage of electrically charged particles move in ways that would be impossible under the classical electromagnetic theory, that is necessary for everyday electronic devices such as [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistors "Transistors") to function.

The _weak interaction_ or _weak nuclear force_ is responsible for some nuclear phenomena such as [beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay"). Electromagnetism and the weak force are now understood to be two aspects of a unified [electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction") — this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known as the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"). In the theory of the electroweak interaction, the carriers of the weak force are the massive [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson") called the [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons"). The weak interaction is the only known interaction that does not conserve [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics) "Parity (physics)"); it is left–right asymmetric. The weak interaction even [violates CP symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP-violation "CP-violation") but does [conserve CPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT_symmetry "CPT symmetry").

The _strong interaction_, or _strong nuclear force_, is the most complicated interaction, mainly because of the way it varies with distance. The nuclear force is powerfully attractive between nucleons at distances of about 1 femtometre (fm, or 10−15 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5 fm. At distances less than 0.7 fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows.

After the nucleus was discovered in 1908, it was clear that a new force, today known as the nuclear force, was needed to overcome the [electrostatic repulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"), a manifestation of electromagnetism, of the positively charged protons. Otherwise, the nucleus could not exist. Moreover, the force had to be strong enough to squeeze the protons into a volume whose diameter is about 10−15[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), much smaller than that of the entire atom. From the short range of this force, [Hideki Yukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa "Hideki Yukawa") predicted that it was associated with a massive force particle, whose mass is approximately 100 MeV.

The 1947 discovery of the [pion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion "Pion") ushered in the modern era of particle physics. Hundreds of hadrons were discovered from the 1940s to 1960s, and an [extremely complicated theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_theory "Regge theory") of hadrons as strongly interacting particles was developed. Most notably:

*   The pions were understood to be oscillations of [vacuum condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_expectation_value "Vacuum expectation value");
*   [Jun John Sakurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_John_Sakurai "Jun John Sakurai") proposed the rho and omega [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson "Vector boson") to be [force carrying particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "Yang–Mills theory") for approximate symmetries of [isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin "Isospin") and [hypercharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercharge "Hypercharge");
*   [Geoffrey Chew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chew "Geoffrey Chew"), Edward K. Burdett and [Steven Frautschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Frautschi "Steven Frautschi") grouped the heavier hadrons into families that could be understood as vibrational and rotational excitations of [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory").

While each of these approaches offered insights, no approach led directly to a fundamental theory.

[Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") along with [George Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zweig "George Zweig") first proposed fractionally charged quarks in 1961. Throughout the 1960s, different authors considered theories similar to the modern fundamental theory of [quantum chromodynamics (QCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") as simple models for the interactions of quarks. The first to hypothesize the gluons of QCD were [Moo-Young Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo-Young_Han "Moo-Young Han") and [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu "Yoichiro Nambu"), who introduced the [quark color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_color "Quark color") charge. Han and Nambu hypothesized that it might be associated with a force-carrying field. At that time, however, it was difficult to see how such a model could permanently confine quarks. Han and Nambu also assigned each quark color an integer electrical charge, so that the quarks were fractionally charged only on average, and they did not expect the quarks in their model to be permanently confined.

In 1971, Murray Gell-Mann and [Harald Fritzsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Fritzsch "Harald Fritzsch") proposed that the Han/Nambu color gauge field was the correct theory of the short-distance interactions of fractionally charged quarks. A little later, [David Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross "David Gross"), [Frank Wilczek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek "Frank Wilczek"), and [David Politzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Politzer "David Politzer") discovered that this theory had the property of [asymptotic freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom "Asymptotic freedom"), allowing them to make contact with [experimental evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering "Deep inelastic scattering"). They concluded that QCD was the complete theory of the strong interactions, correct at all distance scales. The discovery of asymptotic freedom led most physicists to accept QCD since it became clear that even the long-distance properties of the strong interactions could be consistent with experiment if the quarks are permanently [confined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement "Color confinement"): the strong force increases indefinitely with distance, trapping quarks inside the hadrons.

Assuming that quarks are confined, [Mikhail Shifman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Shifman "Mikhail Shifman"), [Arkady Vainshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Vainshtein "Arkady Vainshtein") and [Valentine Zakharov](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valentine_Zakharov&action=edit&redlink=1 "Valentine Zakharov (page does not exist)") were able to compute the properties of many low-lying hadrons directly from QCD, with only a few extra parameters to describe the vacuum. In 1980, [Kenneth G. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_G._Wilson "Kenneth G. Wilson") published computer calculations based on the first principles of QCD, establishing, to a level of confidence tantamount to certainty, that QCD will confine quarks. Since then, QCD has been the established theory of strong interactions.

QCD is a theory of fractionally charged quarks interacting by means of 8 bosonic particles called gluons. The gluons also interact with each other, not just with the quarks, and at long distances the lines of force collimate into strings, loosely modeled by a linear potential, a constant attractive force. In this way, the mathematical theory of QCD not only explains how quarks interact over short distances but also the string-like behavior, discovered by Chew and Frautschi, which they manifest over longer distances.

Conventionally, the Higgs interaction is not counted among the four fundamental forces.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-18)

Nonetheless, although not a [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") interaction nor generated by any [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") symmetry, the [Higgs field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field "Higgs field")'s cubic [Yukawa coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction "Yukawa interaction") produces a weakly attractive fifth interaction. After [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking "Spontaneous symmetry breaking") via the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism"), Yukawa terms remain of the form

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\frac {\lambda _{i}}{\sqrt {2}}}{\bar {\psi }}\phi '\psi ={\frac {m_{i}}{\nu }}{\bar {\psi }}\phi '\psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b667c2e5c34a77b2ad921c28198de07e769fe8a),
with Yukawa coupling ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \lambda _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72fde940918edf84caf3d406cc7d31949166820f), particle mass ![Image 11: {\displaystyle m_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95ec8e804f69706d3f5ad235f4f983220c8df7c2) (in [eV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt")), and Higgs [vacuum expectation value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_expectation_value "Vacuum expectation value")246.22 GeV. Hence coupled particles can exchange a [virtual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle "Virtual particle") Higgs boson, yielding [classical potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction#Classical_potential "Yukawa interaction") of the form

![Image 12: {\displaystyle V(r)=-{\frac {m_{i}m_{j}}{m_{\rm {H}}^{2}}}{\frac {1}{4\pi r}}e^{-m_{\rm {H}}\,c\,r/\hbar }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c9e3457ac16703cc8641a255b9f194d66eb2063),
with Higgs mass 125.18 GeV. Because the [reduced Compton wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Compton_wavelength "Reduced Compton wavelength") of the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") is so small (1.576×10−18 m, comparable to the [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons")), this potential has an effective range of a few [attometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attometer "Attometer"). Between two electrons, it begins roughly 10 11 times weaker than the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and grows exponentially weaker at non-zero distances.

The fundamental forces may become unified into a single force at very high energies and on a minuscule scale, the [Planck scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale "Planck scale").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-19)[Particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator") cannot produce the enormous energies required to experimentally probe this regime. The weak and electromagnetic forces have already been unified with the [electroweak theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction") of [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow"), [Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam "Abdus Salam"), and [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg "Steven Weinberg"), for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-22) Numerous theoretical efforts have been made to systematize the existing four fundamental interactions on the model of electroweak unification.

[Grand Unified Theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theories "Grand Unified Theories") (GUTs) are proposals to show that each of the three fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model is a different manifestation of a single interaction with [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics) "Symmetry (physics)") that break down and create separate interactions below some extremely high level of energy. GUTs are also expected to predict some of the relationships between constants of nature that the Standard Model treats as unrelated and [gauge coupling unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_coupling_unification "Gauge coupling unification") for the relative strengths of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions#cite_note-23) (GUT). Some attempts at GUTs hypothesize "shadow" particles, such that every known [matter particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") associates with an undiscovered [force particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson"), and vice versa, altogether [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry") (SUSY). Other theorists seek to quantize the gravitational field by the modelling behaviour of its hypothetical force carrier, the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton") and achieve quantum gravity (QG). One approach to QG is [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity") (LQG). Still other theorists seek both QG and GUT within one framework, reducing all four fundamental interactions to a [Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Everything "Theory of Everything") (ToE). The most prevalent aim at a ToE is [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), although to model [matter particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), it added [SUSY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry") to [force particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson")—and so, strictly speaking, became [superstring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory"). Multiple, seemingly disparate superstring theories were unified on a backbone, [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory"). Theories beyond the Standard Model remain highly speculative, lacking great experimental support.

A so-called [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything"), which would integrate GUTs with a quantum gravity theory, faces a greater barrier because no quantum gravity theory (e.g., [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity"), and [twistor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory "Twistor theory")) has secured wide acceptance. Some theories look for a graviton to complete the Standard Model list of force-carrying particles, while others, like loop quantum gravity, emphasize the possibility that time-space itself may have a quantum aspect to it.

Beyond the Standard Model
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fundamental_interaction&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Beyond the Standard Model")]

Some theories beyond the Standard Model include a hypothetical [fifth force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_force "Fifth force"), and the search for such a force is an ongoing line of experimental physics research. In [supersymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetric "Supersymmetric") theories, some particles, known as [moduli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_(physics) "Moduli (physics)"), acquire their masses only through supersymmetry breaking effects and can mediate new forces. Another reason to look for new forces is the discovery that the [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe") is accelerating (also known as [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy")), creating a need to explain a nonzero [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant") and possibly other modifications of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Fifth forces have also been suggested to explain phenomena such as [CP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_parity "Charge parity") violations, [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter"), and [dark flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_flow "Dark flow").
