It was introduced by Paul Bernays in a 1942 article in reverse mathematics that explores which set-theoretic axioms are needed to develop analysis.

[ a ] Formal statement [ edit ] A homogeneous relation R {\displaystyle R} on X {\displaystyle X} is called a total relation if for every a ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle a\in X,} there exists some b ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle b\in X} such that a R b {\displaystyle a\,R~b} is true.

The axiom of dependent choice can be stated as follows: 
For every nonempty set X {\displaystyle X} and every total relation R {\displaystyle R} on X , {\displaystyle X,} there exists a sequence ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} in X {\displaystyle X} such that x n R x n + 1 {\displaystyle x_{n}\,R~x_{n+1}} for all n ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} .} In fact, x 0 may be taken to be any desired element of X . (To see this, apply the axiom as stated above to the set of finite sequences that start with x 0 and in which subsequent terms are in relation R {\displaystyle R} , together with the total relation on this set of the second sequence being obtained from the first by appending a single term.) If the set X {\displaystyle X} above is restricted to be the set of all real numbers , then the resulting axiom is denoted by D C R .

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}_{\mathbb {R} }.} Use [ edit ] Even without such an axiom, for any n {\displaystyle n} , one can use ordinary mathematical induction to form the first n {\displaystyle n} terms of such a sequence.
The axiom of dependent choice says that we can form a whole ( countably infinite ) sequence this way.

The axiom D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is the fragment of A C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {AC}}} that is required to show the existence of a sequence constructed by transfinite recursion of countable length, if it is necessary to make a choice at each step and if some of those choices cannot be made independently of previous choices.

Equivalent statements [ edit ] Over Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} ( Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice), D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is equivalent to the Baire category theorem for complete metric spaces.

[ 1 ] It is also equivalent over Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} to the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem .

[ b ] [ 2 ] D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is also equivalent over Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} to the statement that every pruned tree with ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } levels has a branch ( proof below ).

Furthermore, D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is equivalent to a weakened form of Zorn's lemma ; specifically D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is equivalent to the statement that any partial order such that every well-ordered chain is finite and bounded, must have a maximal element.

[ 3 ] Proof that D C ⟺ ⟺ {\displaystyle \,{\mathsf {DC}}\iff } Every pruned tree with ω levels has a branch ( ⟸ ⟸ ) {\displaystyle (\,\Longleftarrow \,)} Let R {\displaystyle R} be an entire binary relation on X {\displaystyle X} . The strategy is to define a tree T {\displaystyle T} on X {\displaystyle X} of finite sequences whose neighboring elements satisfy R .

{\displaystyle R.} Then a branch through T {\displaystyle T} is an infinite sequence whose neighboring elements satisfy R .

{\displaystyle R.} Start by defining ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x n ⟩ ⟩ ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{n}\rangle \in T} if x k R x k + 1 {\displaystyle x_{k}R\,x_{k+1}} for 0 ≤ ≤ k < n .

{\displaystyle 0\leq k<n.} Since R {\displaystyle R} is entire, T {\displaystyle T} is a pruned tree with ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } levels. Thus, T {\displaystyle T} has a branch ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x n , … … ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{n},\dots \rangle .} So, for all n ≥ ≥ 0 : {\displaystyle n\geq 0\!:} ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x n , x n + 1 ⟩ ⟩ ∈ ∈ T , {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{n},x_{n+1}\rangle \in T,} which implies x n R x n + 1 .

{\displaystyle x_{n}R\,x_{n+1}.} Therefore, D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is true.

( ⟹ ⟹ ) {\displaystyle (\,\Longrightarrow \,)} Let T {\displaystyle T} be a pruned tree on X {\displaystyle X} with ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } levels. The strategy is to define a binary relation R {\displaystyle R} on T {\displaystyle T} so that D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} produces a sequence t n = ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x f ( n ) ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle t_{n}=\langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{f(n)}\rangle } where t n R t n + 1 {\displaystyle t_{n}R\,t_{n+1}} and f ( n ) {\displaystyle f(n)} is a strictly increasing function. Then the infinite sequence ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x k , … … ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{k},\dots \rangle } is a branch. (This proof only needs to prove this for f ( n ) = m + n .

{\displaystyle f(n)=m+n.} ) Start by defining u R v {\displaystyle u\,R\,v} if u {\displaystyle u} is an initial subsequence of v , length ⁡ ⁡ ( u ) > 0 , {\displaystyle v,\operatorname {length} (u)>0,\,} and length ⁡ ⁡ ( v ) = {\displaystyle \operatorname {length} (v)=} length ⁡ ⁡ ( u ) + 1.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {length} (u)+1.} Since T {\displaystyle T} is a pruned tree with ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } levels, R {\displaystyle R} is entire. Therefore, D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} implies that there is an infinite sequence t n {\displaystyle t_{n}} such that t n R t n + 1 .

{\displaystyle t_{n}\,R\,t_{n+1}.} Now t 0 = ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x m ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle t_{0}=\langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{m}\rangle } for some m ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle m\geq 0.} Let x m + n {\displaystyle x_{m+n}} be the last element of t n .

{\displaystyle t_{n}.} Then t n = ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x m , … … , x m + n ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle t_{n}=\langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{m},\dots ,x_{m+n}\rangle .} For all k ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle k\geq 0,} the sequence ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x k ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{k}\rangle } belongs to T {\displaystyle T} because it is an initial subsequence of t 0 ( k ≤ ≤ m ) {\displaystyle t_{0}\,(k\leq m)} or it is a t n ( k ≥ ≥ m ) .

{\displaystyle t_{n}\,(k\geq m).} Therefore, ⟨ ⟨ x 0 , … … , x k , … … ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},\dots ,x_{k},\dots \rangle } is a branch.

Relation with other axioms [ edit ] Unlike full A C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {AC}}} , D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {DC}}} is insufficient to prove (given Z F {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}} ) that there is a non-measurable set of real numbers, or that there is a set of real numbers without the property of Baire or without the perfect set property . This follows because the Solovay model satisfies Z F + D C {\displaystyle {\mathsf {ZF}}+{\mathsf {DC}}} , and every set of real numbers in this model is Lebesgue measurable , has the Baire property and has the perfect set property.

The axiom of dependent choice implies the axiom of countable choice and is strictly stronger.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is possible to generalize the axiom to produce transfinite sequences. If these are allowed to be arbitrarily long, then it becomes equivalent to the full axiom of choice.
