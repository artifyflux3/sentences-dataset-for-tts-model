[ 3 ] Reception [ edit ] In 2011, the Columbia Journalism Review ' s "News Startups Guide" called Live Science "a purebred Web animal, primarily featuring one-off stories and photo galleries produced at high speed by its mostly young staffers, almost all of whom have journalism degrees," noting that, "If you are looking for resource-intensive expositions of global warming, for instance, or thickly narrated journeys into the research process, LiveScience [ sic ] will disappoint. The site carries the big science news of the day, but its strength lies in the quirky diversity of its other content–oddball studies overlooked by major news organizations."
