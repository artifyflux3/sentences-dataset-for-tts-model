( January 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Paintings by Alex Grey in The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors Visionary art is art that purports to transcend the physical world and portray a wider vision of awareness including spiritual or mystical themes , or is based in such experiences.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism , first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Its artists included Ernst Fuchs , Rudolf Hausner , Arik Brauer , Wolfgang Hutter and Anton Lehmden among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including Mati Klarwein , Robert Venosa , [ 4 ] and De Es Schwertberger .

Definition [ edit ] Visionary artist Laurence Caruana with visionary art paintings.

Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness.

[ 1 ] Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential.

Symbolism , Cubism , Surrealism and Psychedelic art are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count Hilma af Klint , Hieronymous Bosch , William Blake , Morris Graves (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), Emil Bisttram , and Gustave Moreau amongst their antecedents.

Schools and organizations [ edit ] The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism , which includes Ernst Fuchs and Arik Brauer , is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.

[ citation needed ] The Society for the Art of Imagination , founded by Brigid Marlin serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern cooperatives involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as Burning Man and Boom Festival , and exhibition/ritual spaces such as Temple of Visions and the Interdimensional Art Movement.

[ citation needed ] The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, is a museum devoted entirely to visionary art.
