They're strong, punchy tales which his glittering 'technosleaze' trademark: some are obvious precursors of the novels, and the fine title piece's hair-raising cyberspace jaunt is echoed all too closely in Neuromancer ." [ 4 ] J. Michael Caparula reviewed Burning Chrome in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 82. Caparula commented that "This is vital reading; harsh, gritty, complex, visionary."
