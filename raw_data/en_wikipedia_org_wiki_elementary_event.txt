[ 1 ] Using set theory terminology, an elementary event is a singleton . Elementary events and their corresponding outcomes are often written interchangeably for simplicity, as such an event corresponding to precisely one outcome.

The following are examples of elementary events: All sets { k } , {\displaystyle \{k\},} where k ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} } if objects are being counted and the sample space is S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , … … } {\displaystyle S=\{1,2,3,\ldots \}} (the natural numbers ).

{ H H } , { H T } , { T H } , and { T T } {\displaystyle \{HH\},\{HT\},\{TH\},{\text{ and }}\{TT\}} if a coin is tossed twice.

S = { H H , H T , T H , T T } {\displaystyle S=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}} where H {\displaystyle H} stands for heads and T {\displaystyle T} for tails.

All sets { x } , {\displaystyle \{x\},} where x {\displaystyle x} is a real number . Here X {\displaystyle X} is a random variable with a normal distribution and S = ( − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ ) .

{\displaystyle S=(-\infty ,+\infty ).} This example shows that, because the probability of each elementary event is zero, the probabilities assigned to elementary events do not determine a continuous probability distribution ..

Probability of an elementary event [ edit ] Elementary events may occur with probabilities that are between zero and one (inclusively). In a discrete probability distribution whose sample space is finite, each elementary event is assigned a particular probability. In contrast, in a continuous distribution, individual elementary events must all have a probability of zero.

Some "mixed" distributions contain both stretches of continuous elementary events and some discrete elementary events; the discrete elementary events in such distributions can be called atoms or atomic events and can have non-zero probabilities.

[ 2 ] Under the measure-theoretic definition of a probability space , the probability of an elementary event need not even be defined. In particular, the set of events on which probability is defined may be some σ-algebra on S {\displaystyle S} and not necessarily the full power set .
