[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Unregistered trademarks can instead be marked with the trademark symbol , ™ , while unregistered service marks are marked with the service mark symbol , ℠ . The proper manner to display these symbols is immediately following the mark; the symbol is commonly in superscript style, but that is not legally required. In many jurisdictions, only registered trademarks confer easily defended legal rights.

[ 3 ] In the US, the registered trademark symbol was originally introduced in the Trademark Act of 1946 .

[ 4 ] Because the symbol is not commonly available on typewriters (or ASCII ), it was common to approximate it with " (r) " [ 5 ] or " (R) " [ a ] It is also legal in the US to use the text "Registered, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office" or "Reg U.S. Pat & TM Off." [ 2 ] [ 6 ] Computer usage [ edit ] See also: Unicode input The registered trademark character was added to several extended ASCII character sets, including ISO-8859-1 from which it was inherited by Unicode as U+00AE ® REGISTERED SIGN .
