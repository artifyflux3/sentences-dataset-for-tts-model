Hierarchy theory focuses on levels of organization and issues of scale , with a specific focus on the role of the observer in the definition of the system.

[ 1 ] Complexity in this context does not refer to an intrinsic property of the system but to the possibility of representing the systems in a plurality of non-equivalent ways depending on the pre-analytical choices of the observer. Instead of analyzing the whole structure, hierarchy theory refers to the analysis of hierarchical levels, and the interactions between them.
