It is the 17th-most populous city in Texas and the most populous city in the Texas panhandle .

[ 7 ] The estimated population of Amarillo was 200,393 as of April 1, 2020, comprising nearly half of the panhandle's population.

[ 8 ] The Amarillo metropolitan area had an estimated population of 308,297 as of 2020.

[ 9 ] The city of Amarillo, originally named Oneida , is situated in the Llano Estacado region.

[ 10 ] The availability of the railroad and freight service provided by the Fort Worth and Denver Railway contributed to the city's growth as a cattle-marketing center in the late 19th century.

[ 11 ] Amarillo was once the self-proclaimed " Helium Capital of the World" for having one of the country's most productive helium fields.

[ 12 ] The city is also known as "The Yellow Rose of Texas" (as the city takes its name from the Spanish word for yellow), [ 13 ] "Yellow City" for its name, and "Rotor City, USA" for its V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft assembly plant. Amarillo operates one of the largest meat-packing areas in the United States.

Pantex , the only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility in the country, is also a major employer. The location of this facility also gave rise to the nickname "Bomb City".

This section is missing information about events in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page .

( August 2025 ) During April 1887, John T. Berry, from Abilene, Texas , established a site for a town, choosing a well-watered section along the right-of-way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway that was building across the Texas Panhandle. Barry and merchants from Colorado City, Texas wanted to make his new townsite the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, the site won the election for a county seat to be established for Potter County. Availability of the railroad's freight service made the town a fast-growing cattle -marketing center.

[ 11 ] The settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo (the Spanish word for the color yellow). This probably had been suggested by yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer, or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek , named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores. Early residents originally pronounced the city's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation / ˌ ɑː m ə ˈ r iː j oʊ / ah-mə- REE -yoh , but it later was supplanted by the current pronunciation.

[ 15 ] Amarillo in 1889, three weeks after incorporation An aerial view of the Amarillo business district in 1912 Grand Opera House, Amarillo, Texas (postcard, circa 1909–1924) Downtown Amarillo in 1944 On June 19, 1888, Henry B. Sanborn , who is given credit as the "Father of Amarillo", [ 16 ] and his business partner Joseph F. Glidden began buying land to move Amarillo to the east after arguing that Berry's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city's site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over some people who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.

[ 17 ] Heavy rains almost flooded Berry's part of the town in 1889, prompting even  more people to move to Sanborn's location. This eventually led to another county-seat election, which made Sanborn's site the new county seat in 1893.

[ 11 ] By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator , milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in wheat and small grains production during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.

[ 11 ] The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later.

[ 18 ] The plant was the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for many years.

[ 19 ] The U.S. National Helium Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.

[ 20 ] Amarillo, March 1943 Amarillo was hit by the Dust Bowl in the 1930s and entered an economic depression .

World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War .

[ 11 ] In 1951, the army air base was reactivated as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded to accommodate a Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing.

[ 21 ] The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Amarillo's population as 6.1% Hispanic and 88.5% non-Hispanic white.

[ 22 ] In the 1980s, ASARCO , Iowa Beef Processors (present-day Tyson Foods ), Owens-Corning , and Weyerhaeuser built plants at Amarillo. The Eastridge neighborhood houses many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam , Laos , and Burma , many finding employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant.

[ 23 ] The following decade, Amarillo's city limits encompassed 60 square miles (155 km 2 ) in Potter and Randall Counties.

Interstate 27 highway connecting Lubbock to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.

[ 11 ] Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway, predecessors of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad had established services to and from Amarillo. These three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.

[ 24 ] U.S. Routes 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersected at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops.

Geography [ edit ] Lighthouse pinnacle in Palo Duro Canyon: The canyon system is located south of the city.

Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle . It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas . It is situated in the grasslands of the Texas Panhandle and is surrounded by dense prairie and desert. Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with broad daily temperature changes, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and "northers", long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust storms , and floods.

Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have taken place over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in playa lakes .

[ 10 ] According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 90.3 square miles (234 km 2 ), with 89.9 sq mi (233 km 2 ) of it land and 0.4 sq mi (1.0 km 2 ) of it (0.50%) covered by water. The Amarillo metropolitan area covers four counties: Armstrong , Carson , Potter, and Randall. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the Oklahoma , New Mexico and Colorado state capitals than it does to Austin .

Flowing about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Amarillo is the Canadian River , which divides the Western High Plains ecological region. The southern divide of the Western High Plains is the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains geographical region. The river is dammed to form Lake Meredith , a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region.

[ 25 ] The city is situated near the Panhandle Field, in a productive gas and oil area, covering 200,000 acres (81,000 ha) in Hartley , Potter, Moore , Hutchinson , Carson, Gray , Wheeler , and Collingsworth Counties. The Potter County portion had the nation's largest natural gas reserve.

[ 26 ] Approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of Amarillo is Palo Duro Canyon . The tallest peak is reported to be 2,500 feet (760 m) underground in northeastern Potter County under the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument .

[ 28 ] Both the city and most of the county as a whole lie in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a.

[ 29 ] Amarillo is characterized by a winter season featuring large diurnal temperature variation , great day-to-day variability, possible sudden and/or severe Arctic air outbreaks (in Texas, called "blue northers"), possible blizzards and hot summers with generally low humidity. The average annual precipitation is 20.4 inches or 520 millimeters. Much of Amarillo's precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months.

According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of " Tornado Alley " and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the nighttime hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo's most densely populated areas, on the south and east sides of the city, had catastrophic damage; the tornado killed 7 people and injured more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 38.6 °F (3.7 °C) in January to 79.6 °F (26.4 °C) in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The National Weather Service in Amarillo forecasts and provides climatic data for the city.

Extreme temperatures range from −16 °F (−26.7 °C) on February 12, 1899 to 111 °F (43.9 °C) on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically dip to 0 °F or −17.8 °C in most years, while highs above 100 °F or 37.8 °C are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below 10 °F or −12.2 °C, 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of 90 °F (32.2 °C)+ highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below 70 °F or 21.1 °C are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards occur occasionally, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly 18 inches or 46 centimeters seasonally and the median figure is near 10 inches or 25 centimeters.

[ 30 ] Amarillo is also recorded as the windiest city in the U.S. by the Weather Channel.

Infrastructure [ edit ] Air transportation [ edit ] Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport is a public airport located 10 miles (16 km) east of the central business district of Amarillo, north of Interstate 40. A portion of the former Amarillo Air Force Base was converted to civilian use and became part of the airport.

[ 110 ] The airport was renamed in 2003 for NASA astronaut Rick Husband , an Amarillo native and commander of the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia , STS-107 , which disintegrated on re-entry killing Husband and his crewmates.

[ 111 ] Several major air carriers offer non-stop service to Dallas/Fort Worth , Houston , Austin , Denver , Phoenix and Las Vegas .

Tradewind Airport is a public-use general aviation airport located in Randall County, 3 nautical miles (3.5 mi; 5.6 km) south of Amarillo's central business district. The airport covers 595 acres (241 ha) and has two asphalt -paved runways and one helipad .

[ 112 ] Buffalo Airport is a public-use general aviation airport located in Randall County, 9 nautical miles (10 mi; 17 km) south of Amarillo's central business district. The airport covers 40 acres (16 ha) and has two grass runways.

[ 113 ] Ground transportation [ edit ] Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. Each year ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers.

[ 48 ] Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The last passenger train out of the city was the Santa Fe Railroad 's San Francisco Chief , from Chicago , in 1971. The Texas Zephyr between Denver and Dallas last served Amarillo in 1967.

[ 114 ] The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day.

[ 115 ] The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments are of grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief , would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.

Several streets around Amarillo's downtown area are still paved with bricks.

The streets in Amarillo's downtown area conform to a grid pattern . The city's original street layout was set up by William H. Bush. Beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east, Bush named the north to south streets for past United States presidents , in chronological order except for John Quincy Adams because the surname had been taken by the second president, John Adams .

[ 116 ] The last president so honored was Grover Cleveland ; as the city expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.

While the streets running north–south are designated 'streets', east–west streets are numbered and are designated 'avenues'. North of the Fort Worth & Denver (now BNSF) railyard, the numbers are "NW" (northwest) west of Polk Street and "NE" (northeast) east of Polk. South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially "SW" (southwest) west of Polk, and "SE" (southeast) east of Polk. Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW and SE avenues as W (west) and E (east), respectively. One example of the numbering difference is the former U.S. Highway 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood. Most call it 'West Sixth Street' instead of SW Sixth Avenue.

In 1910, the Amarillo voters had approved to pay for street paving with bricks .

[ 117 ] As of 2003, the city still has 16.2 miles (26.1 km) of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. In 2002, the city spent $200,000 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.

[ 118 ] Major highways [ edit ] Amarillo is served by two interstate highways: Interstate 27 and Interstate 40 . Amarillo is also the northern terminus for I-27, of which less than one mile (~1.6 km) is located in Potter County. The highway terminates at the city's main west–east highway, Interstate 40, just north of the Potter–Randall county line. The roadway continues northward into downtown Amarillo via U.S.

60 , 87 , and 287 , via a series of four one-way streets including Buchanan, Pierce, Fillmore and Taylor. North of downtown the highway becomes US 87 & 287 and continues northward to Dumas .

[ 45 ] Interstate 40, the city's major east–west thoroughfare, was completed entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across the center of the city despite local opposition.

[ 119 ] Loop 335 is a beltway that circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and a two-lane highway to the southeast and northwest.

[ citation needed ] Plans to convert the entire beltway into a freeway were published by the Texas Department of Transportation in 2015.

[ 120 ] The Ports to Plains Corridor passes through Amarillo as part of Interstate 27, which is planned to be extended north from its current terminus to Raton, New Mexico .

[ 121 ] Route 66 commemorative water tower in Amarillo, Texas Previously, U.S. Route 66 had been the city's major east–west highway, [ 114 ] generally following Amarillo Boulevard to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. The highway's original alignment through Amarillo was later designated as a city route.

[ clarification needed ] Amarillo is also mentioned in the song " (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66 ".

Medical centers and hospitals [ edit ] The Harrington Regional Medical Center has two of the city's major hospitals.

Amarillo is home to medical facilities including Baptist St. Anthony's and Northwest Texas Hospitals, the Don & Sybil Harrington Cancer Center, Bivins Memorial Nursing Home, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas Tech School of Pharmacy, and Texas Panhandle Mental Health and Mental Retardation. All are located in the Harrington Regional Medical Center, the first specifically designated city hospital district in Texas.

[ 122 ] Baptist St. Anthony's, known locally as BSA, had some of its services listed on the U.S. News & World Report ' s "Top 50 Hospitals" from 2002 to 2005.

[ 123 ] BSA was a result of a 1996 merger between the Texas Panhandle's first hospital, St Anthony's, with High Plains Baptist Hospital.

[ 124 ] The BSA Hospice & Life Enrichment Center provides important services to the Amarillo area. The BSA facility, opened in 1985, was the first free-standing hospice west of the Mississippi River to be built and opened without debt.

[ 125 ] Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Northwest Texas Hospital is home to the area's only Level III designated trauma center.

The Thomas E. Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center is located east of Harrington Regional Medical Center. The facility opened in 1940 and was renamed in 2005, honoring the 18-year-old Amarillo Marine who had been posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor .

[ 126 ] Construction began in 2006 for a new Texas State Veterans Home in northwest Amarillo. The United States government, through the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, provided the funding to build the facility; the Texas government will run it after construction is completed.

[ 127 ] The Ussery-Roan Texas State Veterans Home opened in 2007.

[ 128 ] Utilities [ edit ] Drinking water is provided by the City of Amarillo and its Utilities Division. Amarillo's water supply used to come from both from Lake Meredith and the Ogallala Aquifer . Due to the lake's low water level, water is now only supplied by the aquifer. Lake Meredith is located northeast of Amarillo and in 2005 it contained at least 114 billion US gallons (430,000,000 m 3 ) of water. By 2011, lake levels had dropped so much due to the Texas drought that the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority voted to stop using it entirely.

[ 129 ] However, increased rainfall in recent years [ when?

] has helped the lake regain much of its volume.

[ 130 ] Generally, the city's daily water production averages between 40–50 million US gallons (150,000–190,000 m 3 ).

[ 131 ] Collection and disposal of the city's trash and garbage are the responsibilities of the City of Amarillo's Solid Waste Collection and Solid Waste Disposal Departments. Amarillo's non-hazardous solid waste is collected for burial in the city's landfill . The City of Amarillo also operates recycling collection centers, one located near the downtown area and four at fire stations in the city.

[ 132 ] Other utilities are primarily provided by private organizations. Natural gas is distributed by Atmos Energy . Electric power service is distributed by Xcel Energy , through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Amarillo-based Southwestern Public Service Company.

[ 133 ] Wired telephone service is mainly provided by AT&T . Cable television is primarily provided by Suddenlink Communications .

In popular culture [ edit ] Outside media attention [ edit ] The city gained national media attention in 1998 when local cattlemen unsuccessfully sued television talk show host Oprah Winfrey for comments made on her show connecting American beef to mad cow disease , costing them and their industry millions of dollars.

[ 134 ] In order to attend the trial in Amarillo, she temporarily relocated her show to the Amarillo Little Theatre for nearly a year. During the trial, Winfrey hired Dallas-based jury consultant Phil McGraw to aid her attorneys on selecting and analyzing the members of the jury.

[ 135 ] McGraw would later become a regular guest on Winfrey's television show and subsequently started his own talk show, Dr. Phil , in 2002.

Another notable trial in Amarillo was the Fort Worth -area murder case of T. Cullen Davis , which involved one of the richest men in the United States, his former wife, and her daughter and boyfriend. The trial was moved from Fort Worth to Amarillo in 1977 on a change of venue.

[ 136 ] The 1997 murder of Brian Deneke and subsequent trial also brought national attention because it highlighted social divisions in the community that mirrored those in America as a whole. The defendant in the trial was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and received a light sentence.

[ 137 ] The movie Bomb City is based on the events surrounding Deneke's murder.

The small town of Tulia, Texas , approximately 47 miles (76 km) south from Amarillo, was the scene of a controversial drug sting in 1999. Local civil rights attorney Jeff Blackburn took up the case of the Tulia defendants, which became a cause célèbre and resulted in the exoneration and pardon of the defendants.

[ 138 ] A federal lawsuit directed at the officials responsible for the sting operation was held in Amarillo. In the final settlement, the City of Amarillo agreed to pay $5 million in damages to the former Tulia defendants; disband the Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force that it set up to oversee the sting operation; and require early retirement for two Amarillo Police Department officers who were responsible for supervising the sting's sole undercover agent.

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] On May 5, 2020, Amarillo ranked 13th in the nation for Highest Average Daily Growth Rate of COVID-19 cases by the New York Times.

[ 141 ] In music [ edit ] Amarillo has been mentioned in popular music such as " Amarillo " ( Gorillaz ) " Amarillo by Morning " (notably covered by George Strait ) " Amarillo Sky " ( Jason Aldean ) " Blame It on Texas " ( Mark Chesnutt ) " Brownsville Girl " ( Bob Dylan , who refers to Amarillo as the "land of the living dead") " (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66 " ( Nat King Cole ) "My Rifle, My Pony, and Me" ( Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson , featured in Rio Bravo and later in several episodes of The Sopranos ) "A Quick Death In Texas" ( Clutch ) "Running Gun" ( Marty Robbins ) "Sweet Amarillo" ( Old Crow Medicine Show ) "Two Lane Blacktop" ( Rob Zombie ) Tony Christie 's 1971 cover of " Is This the Way to Amarillo ", written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield , topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks in 2005, breaking the record for the longest time taken for a song to top the UK Singles Chart after its original release set by Jackie Wilson 's " Reet Petite " in December 1986. Christie's record was broken 16 years later when " Last Christmas " by Wham!

topped the UK Singles Chart in January 2021, 36 years and 1 month after its original release (a record subsequently broken in June 2022 when " Running Up That Hill " by Kate Bush topped the chart 36 years and 10 months after it originally entered the chart).

[ 142 ] [ 143 ] In film and television [ edit ] The Amarillo Film Commission is a division of the Amarillo Convention and Visitor Council that was created to provide film crews with locations and other assistance when filming in Amarillo.

[ 144 ] Amarillo was the setting for several motion pictures, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , Switchback , and The Plutonium Circus , the 1995 South by Southwest Film Festival winner for best documentary feature.

[ citation needed ] Amarillo also features heavily in the Better Call Saul episode of the same name , the third of the show's second season, in which protagonist Jimmy McGill visits the city to solicit clients.
