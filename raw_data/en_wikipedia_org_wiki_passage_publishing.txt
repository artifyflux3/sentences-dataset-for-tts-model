[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Keeperman was a University of California, Irvine , lecturer from 2013 to 2022.

Founded in 2021, Passage publishes works from online personalities, reprints and new translations of fiction and nonfiction from historical fascist and reactionary authors.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Keeperman was born to a Jewish family and was raised in Moraga, California .

[ 1 ] He celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1996.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] In college, he played for the University of California, San Diego, basketball team .

[ 1 ] Keeperman was a master of fine arts student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and was a lecturer in the university's English department from 2013 to 2022.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] He began blogging under the pseudonym "Mr Lomez" in 2006.

[ 1 ] He used the Lomez identity from 2012 to 2014 in the comment section of Steve Sailer 's blog posts, and then on Twitter accounts since around 2015.

[ 1 ] The account was criticized for using slurs to describe gay people and Asians and for proposing the lynching of journalists.

[ 8 ] In the 2020s, Lomez wrote in The American Mind , The Federalist , and an anti-feminist essay in First Things .

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] Keeperman was described by The Guardian as a "prominent member[...] of the so-called ' new right '.

[ 1 ] and Sohrab Ahmari for the New Statesman named him as an "influential, anonymous right-wing scribe and publisher". Ahmari also noted him as an example of the "Unabomber right", what he called a very online section of the far-right which he said had views parallel to Ted Kaczynski , that "shares both Kaczynskiâ€™s yearning for a return to nature and his rejection of any effort to ameliorate industrialismâ€™s baleful effects through economic reform".

[ 9 ] Publishing [ edit ] Passage Publishing, also known as Passage Press, is a far-right and " new right " independent publisher led by Keeperman that publishes works from online personalities, reprints and new translations of fiction and nonfiction from historical fascist and reactionary authors.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 3 ] The New York Times noted Passage as popular with conservative intellectuals.

[ 10 ] It was founded in 2021 out of the Passage Prize, an online writing and arts competition offering a $20,000 cryptocurrency prize for selected works. The judges were neoreactionary Curtis Yarvin and self-published author Zero HP Lovecraft.

[ 11 ] [ 1 ] The name Passage Press comes from the book The Forest Passage by Ernst JÃ¼nger , who Keeperman stated was his favorite author.

[ 7 ] In 2023, Passage Prize was rebranded as "Passage Publishing," and was expanded through acquisitions of Mystery Grove Publishing.

[ 12 ] Passage has published compendiums from online figures Steve Sailer , Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin.

[ 1 ] [ 7 ] It also publishes fiction, including the Hardy Boys ' original versions, and writings by Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft .

[ 7 ] Through its imprint Passage Classics , Passage Publishing also offers works by, as described by The Guardian , " radical German nationalist and militarist Ernst JÃ¼nger ; Peter Kemp , who fought as a volunteer for Francisco Franco â€™s Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War ; and two counter-revolutionary Russian aristocrats , White Russian general Pyotr Wrangel and Prince Serge Obolensky ".

[ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ 7 ] Man's World is a bi-annual men's magazine published by Passage Publishing.

[ 1 ] Passage Publishing also engages in cultural projects, including sponsoring events.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Fashion designer Elena Velez , who is associated with the Dimes Square scene, [ 16 ] has been sponsored by Passage [ 17 ] and cited the company and its founder as inspiration.

[ 18 ] Interviewed by Ross Douthat for the New York Times , Keeperman said the goal of Passage Publishing was to "revive what is a genuine right-wing cultural and ideological â€” I hate the word "movement," because itâ€™s not quite that â€” but a right wing that can form an enduring and meaningful counterweight to a dominant left and a dominant progressive march". He contrasted this with previous works of consciously right-wing art, which he said were "moralistic", "didactic", "overly sentimental" and nostalgic instead of looking forward.

[ 7 ] In 2025, The Guardian reported that trademark records indicated that Passage Publishing had become part of Foundation Publishing Group, and that business filings identified Keeperman as CEO of Foundation Publishing Group.
