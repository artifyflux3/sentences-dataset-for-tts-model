For the album by Karl Hyde, see Edgeland (album) .

Edgelands is a term for the transitional, liminal zone of space created between rural and urban areas as formed by urbanisation .

[ 1 ] These spaces often contain nature alongside cities, towns, roads and unsightly but necessary buildings, such as power substations or depots, at the edge of cities.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The concept of edgelands was introduced by Marion Shoard in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.

[ 3 ] However, a century and a half earlier, Victor Hugo had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside ... ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities"; [ 4 ] while Richard Jeffries similarly explored the London edgeland in Nature near London (1883).
