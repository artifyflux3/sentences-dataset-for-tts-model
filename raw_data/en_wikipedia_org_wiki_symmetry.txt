A [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal")-like shape that has [reflectional symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectional_symmetry "Reflectional symmetry"), [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") and [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity "Self-similarity"), three forms of symmetry. This shape is obtained by a [finite subdivision rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_subdivision_rule "Finite subdivision rule").

**Symmetry** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[συμμετρία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:συμμετρία")_(\_summetría\_)_'agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement')[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-1) in everyday life refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-3)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-4) In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the term has a more precise definition and is usually used to refer to an object that is [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") under some [transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(function) "Transformation (function)"), such as [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"), [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)"), or [scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)"). Although these two meanings of the word can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article.

Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"); as a [spatial relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"); through [geometric transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation"); through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of [abstract objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_object "Abstract object"), including [theoretic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model "Scientific model"), [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), and [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Mainzer000-5)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-6)

This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), including [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature"); and in the arts, covering [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture"), [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art"), and music.

The opposite of symmetry is [asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry "Asymmetry"), which refers to the absence of symmetry.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/The_armoured_triskelion_on_the_flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man.svg/250px-The_armoured_triskelion_on_the_flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_armoured_triskelion_on_the_flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man.svg)

The [triskelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion "Triskelion") has 3-fold rotational symmetry.

A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-7) This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object, but doesn't change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:

*   An object has [reflectional symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectional_symmetry "Reflectional symmetry") (line or mirror symmetry) if there is a line (or in [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") a plane) going through it which divides it into two pieces that are mirror images of each other.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-8)
*   An object has [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") if the object can be rotated about a fixed point (or in 3D about a line) without changing the overall shape.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-9)
*   An object has [translational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry "Translational symmetry") if it can be [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") (moving every point of the object by the same distance) without changing its overall shape.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-10)
*   An object has [helical symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_symmetry "Helical symmetry") if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a [screw axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_axis "Screw axis").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-11)
*   An object has [scale symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_symmetry "Scale symmetry") if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-12)[Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals "Fractals") also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where smaller portions of the fractal are [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") in shape to larger portions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Gouyet-13)
*   Other symmetries include [glide reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection "Glide reflection") symmetry (a reflection followed by a translation) and [rotoreflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation") symmetry (a combination of a rotation and a reflection[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-14)).

A [dyadic relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation")_R_ = _S_ × _S_ is symmetric if for all elements _a_, _b_ in _S_, whenever it is true that _Rab_, it is also true that _Rba_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-15) Thus, the relation "is the same age as" is symmetric, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul.

In propositional logic, symmetric binary [logical connectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective") include _[and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_conjunction "Logical conjunction")_ (∧, or &), _[or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_disjunction "Logical disjunction")_ (∨, or |) and _[if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If\_and\_only\_if "If and only if")_ (↔), while the connective _if_ (→) is not symmetric.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-16) Other symmetric logical connectives include _[nand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_nand "Logical nand")_ (not-and, or ⊼), _[xor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xor "Xor")_ (not-biconditional, or ⊻), and _[nor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical\_nor "Logical nor")_ (not-or, or ⊽).

### Other areas of mathematics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Other areas of mathematics")]

Generalizing from geometrical symmetry in the previous section, one can say that a [mathematical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") is _symmetric_ with respect to a given [mathematical operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics) "Operation (mathematics)"), if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-17) The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)").

In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry. Examples include [even and odd functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions "Even and odd functions") in [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), [symmetric groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group") in [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra"), [symmetric matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix "Symmetric matrix") in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), and [Galois groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group "Galois group") in [Galois theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory "Galois theory"). In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), symmetry also manifests as [symmetric probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_probability_distribution "Symmetric probability distribution"), and as [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness "Skewness")—the asymmetry of distributions.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-18)

In science and nature
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: In science and nature")]

Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean [invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(physics) "Invariant (physics)")—that is, lack of change—under any kind of transformation, for example [arbitrary coordinate transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_covariance "General covariance").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-19) This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"), as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate [PW Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson "Philip Warren Anderson") to write in his widely read 1972 article _More is Different_ that "it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry."[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-20) See [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem") (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity such as energy or momentum; a conserved current, in Noether's original language);[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Noether-21) and also, [Wigner's classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_classification "Wigner's classification"), which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-22)

Important symmetries in physics include [continuous symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_symmetry "Continuous symmetry") and [discrete symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_symmetry "Discrete symmetry") of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"); [internal symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_symmetry "Internal symmetry") of particles; and [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry") of physical theories.

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Chance_and_a_Half%2C_Posing.jpg/250px-Chance_and_a_Half%2C_Posing.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chance_and_a_Half,_Posing.jpg)

Many animals are approximately mirror-symmetric, though internal organs are often arranged asymmetrically.

In biology, the notion of symmetry is mostly used explicitly to describe body shapes. [Bilateral animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria "Bilateria"), including humans, are more or less symmetric with respect to the [sagittal plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane "Sagittal plane") which divides the body into left and right halves.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-23) Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The [head becomes specialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalisation "Cephalisation") with a mouth and sense organs, and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric for the purpose of movement, with symmetrical pairs of muscles and skeletal elements, though internal organs often remain asymmetric.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-24)

Plants and sessile (attached) animals such as [sea anemones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_anemone "Sea anemone") often have radial or [rotational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry"), which suits them because food or threats may arrive from any direction. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [echinoderms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderms "Echinoderms"), the group that includes [starfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish "Starfish"), [sea urchins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin "Sea urchin"), and [sea lilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lilies "Sea lilies").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-25)

In biology, the notion of symmetry is also used as in physics, that is to say to describe the properties of the objects studied, including their interactions. A remarkable property of biological evolution is the changes of symmetry corresponding to the appearance of new parts and dynamics.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-26)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-27)

Symmetry is important to [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") because it undergirds essentially all _specific_ interactions between molecules in nature (i.e., via the interaction of natural and human-made [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_(chemistry) "Chiral (chemistry)") molecules with inherently chiral biological systems). The control of the [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_symmetry "Molecular symmetry") of molecules produced in modern [chemical synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis "Chemical synthesis") contributes to the ability of scientists to offer [therapeutic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug "Drug") interventions with minimal [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effects "Side effects"). A rigorous understanding of symmetry explains fundamental observations in [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry"), and in the applied areas of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy") and [crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography "Crystallography"). The theory and application of symmetry to these areas of [physical science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_science "Physical science") draws heavily on the mathematical area of [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-28)

### In psychology and neuroscience

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: In psychology and neuroscience")]

For a human observer, some symmetry types are more salient than others, in particular the most salient is a reflection with a vertical axis, like that present in the human face. [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach "Ernst Mach") made this observation in his book "The analysis of sensations" (1897),[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-29) and this implies that perception of symmetry is not a general response to all types of regularities. Both behavioural and neurophysiological studies have confirmed the special sensitivity to reflection symmetry in humans and also in other animals.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-30) Early studies within the [Gestalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology "Gestalt psychology") tradition suggested that bilateral symmetry was one of the key factors in perceptual [grouping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping "Principles of grouping"). This is known as the [Law of Symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Law_of_Symmetry "Gestalt psychology"). The role of symmetry in grouping and figure/ground organization has been confirmed in many studies. For instance, detection of reflectional symmetry is faster when this is a property of a single object.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-31) Studies of human perception and [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics "Psychophysics") have shown that detection of symmetry is fast, efficient and robust to perturbations. For example, symmetry can be detected with presentations between 100 and 150 milliseconds.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-32)

More recent neuroimaging studies have documented which brain regions are active during perception of symmetry. Sasaki et al.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-33) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare responses for patterns with symmetrical or random dots. A strong activity was present in extrastriate regions of the occipital cortex but not in the primary visual cortex. The extrastriate regions included V3A, V4, V7, and the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Electrophysiological studies have found a late posterior negativity that originates from the same areas.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-34) In general, a large part of the visual system seems to be involved in processing visual symmetry, and these areas involve similar networks to those responsible for detecting and recognising objects.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-35)

People observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology) "Reciprocity (social psychology)"), [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy "Empathy"), [sympathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy "Sympathy"), [apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remorse "Remorse"), [dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue "Dialogue"), respect, [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice"), and [revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge "Revenge"). [Reflective equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_equilibrium "Reflective equilibrium") is the balance that may be attained through deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and specific [judgments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment "Judgment").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-36) Symmetrical interactions send the [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality "Morality") message "we are all the same" while asymmetrical interactions may send the message "I am special; better than you." Peer relationships, such as can be governed by the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule "Golden Rule"), are based on symmetry, whereas power relationships are based on asymmetry.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-37) Symmetrical relationships can to some degree be maintained by simple ([game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory")) strategies seen in [symmetric games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_games "Symmetric games") such as [tit for tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat "Tit for tat").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-38)

There exists a list of journals and newsletters known to deal, at least in part, with symmetry and the arts.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-39)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Taj_Mahal%2C_Agra_views_from_around_%2885%29.JPG/250px-Taj_Mahal%2C_Agra_views_from_around_%2885%29.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Taj_Mahal,_Agra_views_from_around_(85).JPG)

Seen from the side, the [Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal "Taj Mahal") has bilateral symmetry; from the top (in plan), it has fourfold symmetry.

Symmetry finds its ways into architecture at every scale, from the overall external views of buildings such as Gothic [cathedrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral "Cathedral") and [The White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_House "The White House"), through the layout of the individual [floor plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan "Floor plan"), and down to the design of individual building elements such as [tile mosaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic "Mosaic"). [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") buildings such as the [Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal "Taj Mahal") and the [Lotfollah mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfollah_mosque "Lotfollah mosque") make elaborate use of symmetry both in their structure and in their ornamentation.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-40)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-41) Moorish buildings like the [Alhambra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra "Alhambra") are ornamented with complex patterns made using translational and reflection symmetries as well as rotations.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-42)

It has been said that only bad architects rely on a "symmetrical layout of blocks, masses and structures";[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Dunlap-43)[Modernist architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist_architecture "Modernist architecture"), starting with [International style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_style_(architecture) "International style (architecture)"), relies instead on "wings and balance of masses".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Dunlap-43)

### In pottery and metal vessels

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: In pottery and metal vessels")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Makingpottery.jpg/250px-Makingpottery.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Makingpottery.jpg)

Clay pots thrown on a [pottery wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_wheel "Pottery wheel") acquire rotational symmetry.

Since the earliest uses of [pottery wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_wheel "Pottery wheel") to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.

Cast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people "Chinese people"), for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-44)

### In carpets and rugs

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: In carpets and rugs")]

Persian rug with rectangular symmetry

A long tradition of the use of symmetry in [carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet "Carpet") and rug patterns spans a variety of cultures. American [Navajo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people "Navajo people") Indians used bold diagonals and rectangular motifs. Many [Oriental rugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_rugs "Oriental rugs") have intricate reflected centers and borders that translate a pattern. Not surprisingly, rectangular rugs have typically the symmetries of a [rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle")—that is, [motifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts) "Motif (visual arts)") that are reflected across both the horizontal and vertical axes (see [Klein four-group §Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_four-group#Geometry "Klein four-group")).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-45)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-46)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Kitchen_kaleid.svg/250px-Kitchen_kaleid.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kitchen_kaleid.svg)

Kitchen [kaleidoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope "Kaleidoscope")[quilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt "Quilt") block

As [quilts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt "Quilt") are made from square blocks (usually 9, 16, or 25 pieces to a block) with each smaller piece usually consisting of fabric triangles, the craft lends itself readily to the application of symmetry.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-47)

### In other arts and crafts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetry&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: In other arts and crafts")]

Symmetries appear in the design of objects of all kinds. Examples include [beadwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadwork "Beadwork"), [furniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture "Furniture"), [sand paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_painting "Sand painting"), [knotwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot "Knot"), [masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masks "Masks"), and [musical instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instruments "Musical instruments"). Symmetries are central to the art of [M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.C._Escher "M.C. Escher") and the many applications of [tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") in art and craft forms such as [wallpaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper "Wallpaper"), ceramic tilework such as in [Islamic geometric decoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns "Islamic geometric patterns"), [batik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik "Batik"), [ikat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat "Ikat"), carpet-making, and many kinds of [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile") and [embroidery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery "Embroidery") patterns.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-48)

Symmetry is also used in designing logos.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-49) By creating a logo on a grid and using the theory of symmetry, designers can organize their work, create a symmetric or asymmetrical design, determine the space between letters, determine how much negative space is required in the design, and how to accentuate parts of the logo to make it stand out.

[Major and minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor "Major and minor") triads on the white piano keys are symmetrical to the D.

Symmetry is not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music") touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music.

Symmetry has been used as a [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_form "Musical form") constraint by many composers, such as the [arch (swell) form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_form "Arch form") (ABCBA) used by [Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich "Steve Reich"), [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k "Béla Bartók"), and [James Tenney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tenney "James Tenney"). In classical music, [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach "Johann Sebastian Bach") used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-50)

Symmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music) "Scale (music)") and [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music) "Chord (music)"), traditional or [tonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality "Tonality") music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of [pitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)"), such as the [diatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale "Diatonic scale") or the [major chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord "Major chord"). [Symmetrical scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrical_scale "Symmetrical scale") or chords, such as the [whole tone scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone_scale "Whole tone scale"), [augmented chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_chord "Augmented chord"), or diminished [seventh chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord "Seventh chord") (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are [ambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous "Ambiguous") as to the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music) "Key (music)") or tonal center, and have a less specific [diatonic functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_functionality "Diatonic functionality"). However, composers such as [Alban Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alban_Berg "Alban Berg"), [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k "Béla Bartók"), and [George Perle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Perle "George Perle") have used axes of symmetry and/or [interval cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_cycle "Interval cycle") in an analogous way to [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_key "Musical key") or non-[tonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality "Tonality") tonal [centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music) "Tonic (music)").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1992-51) George Perle explains that "C–E, D–F♯, [and] Eb–G, are different instances of the same [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music) "Interval (music)") … the other kind of identity. … has to do with axes of symmetry. C–E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:"[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1992-51)

D D♯**E**F F♯G G♯
D C♯**C**B A♯A G♯

Thus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C–E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0).[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1992-51)

+2 3**4**5 6 7 8
2 1**0**11 10 9 8
4 4 4 4 4 4 4

Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are [enharmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic "Enharmonic") with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal [progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression "Chord progression") in the works of [Romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music "Romantic music") composers such as [Gustav Mahler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler "Gustav Mahler") and [Richard Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner "Richard Wagner") form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bartók, [Alexander Scriabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin "Alexander Scriabin"), [Edgard Varèse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se "Edgard Varèse"), and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1992-51)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1990-52)

The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg's [_Quartet_, Op. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Quartet_(Berg) "String Quartet (Berg)") (1910).[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Perle1990-52)

[Tone rows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_row "Tone row") or [pitch class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class "Pitch class")[sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music) "Set theory (music)") which are [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(music) "Invariant (music)") under [retrograde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_(music) "Permutation (music)") are horizontally symmetrical, under [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_inversion "Melodic inversion") vertically. See also [Asymmetric rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_rhythm "Asymmetric rhythm").

The relationship of symmetry to [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics") is complex. Humans find [bilateral symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry "Bilateral symmetry") in faces physically attractive;[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Grammer1994-53) it indicates health and genetic fitness.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-54)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-Jones2001-55) Opposed to this is the tendency for excessive symmetry to be perceived as boring or uninteresting. Rudolf Arnheim suggested that people prefer shapes that have some symmetry, and enough complexity to make them interesting.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-56)

Symmetry can be found in various forms in [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature"), a simple example being the [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome "Palindrome") where a brief text reads the same forwards or backwards. Stories may have a symmetrical structure, such as the rise and fall pattern of _[Beowulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf "Beowulf")_.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry#cite_note-57)
