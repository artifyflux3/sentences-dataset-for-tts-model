Not to be confused with Euler function .

The first thousand values of φ ( n ) . The points on the top line represent φ ( p ) when p is a prime number, which is p − 1.

[ 1 ] In number theory , Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n . It is written using the Greek letter phi as φ φ ( n ) {\displaystyle \varphi (n)} or ϕ ϕ ( n ) {\displaystyle \phi (n)} , and may also be called Euler's phi function . In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd( n , k ) is equal to 1.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n .

For example, the totatives of n = 9 are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, since gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3 and gcd(9, 9) = 9 . Therefore, φ (9) = 6 . As another example, φ (1) = 1 since for n = 1 the only integer in the range from 1 to n is 1 itself, and gcd(1, 1) = 1 .

Euler's totient function is a multiplicative function , meaning that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime, then φ ( mn ) = φ ( m ) φ ( n ) .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] This function gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n (the group of units of the ring Z / n Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} } ).

[ 6 ] It is also used for defining the RSA encryption system .

History, terminology, and notation [ edit ] Leonhard Euler introduced the function in 1763.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] However, he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it. In a 1784 publication, Euler studied the function further, choosing the Greek letter π to denote it: he wrote πD for "the multitude of numbers less than D , and which have no common divisor with it".

[ 10 ] This definition varies from the current definition for the totient function at D = 1 but is otherwise the same. The now-standard notation [ 8 ] [ 11 ] φ ( A ) comes from Gauss 's 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] although Gauss did not use parentheses around the argument and wrote φA . Thus, it is often called Euler's phi function or simply the phi function .

In 1879, J. J. Sylvester coined the term totient for this function, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] so it is also referred to as Euler's totient function , the Euler totient , or Euler's totient .

[ 16 ] Jordan's totient is a generalization of Euler's.

The cototient of n is defined as n − φ ( n ) . It counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that have at least one prime factor in common with n .

Computing Euler's totient function [ edit ] There are several formulae for computing φ ( n ) .

Euler's product formula [ edit ] It states φ φ ( n ) = n ∏ ∏ p ∣ ∣ n ( 1 − − 1 p ) , {\displaystyle \varphi (n)=n\prod _{p\mid n}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p}}\right),} where the product is over the distinct prime numbers dividing n .

An equivalent formulation is φ φ ( n ) = p 1 k 1 − − 1 ( p 1 − − 1 ) p 2 k 2 − − 1 ( p 2 − − 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ p r k r − − 1 ( p r − − 1 ) , {\displaystyle \varphi (n)=p_{1}^{k_{1}-1}(p_{1}{-}1)\,p_{2}^{k_{2}-1}(p_{2}{-}1)\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}-1}(p_{r}{-}1),} where n = p 1 k 1 p 2 k 2 ⋯ ⋯ p r k r {\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{k_{1}}p_{2}^{k_{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}}} is the prime factorization of n {\displaystyle n} (that is, p 1 , p 2 , … … , p r {\displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{r}} are distinct prime numbers).

The proof of these formulae depends on two important facts.

Phi is a multiplicative function [ edit ] This means that if gcd( m , n ) = 1 , then φ ( m ) φ ( n ) = φ ( mn ) .

Proof outline: Let A , B , C be the sets of positive integers which are coprime to and less than m , n , mn , respectively, so that | A | = φ ( m ) , etc. Then there is a bijection between A × B and C by the Chinese remainder theorem .

Value of phi for a prime power argument [ edit ] If p is prime and k ≥ 1 , then φ φ ( p k ) = p k − − p k − − 1 = p k − − 1 ( p − − 1 ) = p k ( 1 − − 1 p ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi \left(p^{k}\right)=p^{k}-p^{k-1}=p^{k-1}(p-1)=p^{k}\left(1-{\tfrac {1}{p}}\right).} Proof : Since p is a prime number, the only possible values of gcd( p k , m ) are 1, p , p 2 , ..., p k , and the only way to have gcd( p k , m ) > 1 is if m is a multiple of p , that is, m ∈ { p , 2 p , 3 p , ..., p k − 1 p = p k } , and there are p k − 1 such multiples not greater than p k . Therefore, the other p k − p k − 1 numbers are all relatively prime to p k .

Proof of Euler's product formula [ edit ] The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that if n > 1 there is a unique expression n = p 1 k 1 p 2 k 2 ⋯ ⋯ p r k r , {\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{k_{1}}p_{2}^{k_{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}},} where p 1 < p 2 < ... < p r are prime numbers and each k i ≥ 1 . (The case n = 1 corresponds to the empty product .) Repeatedly using the multiplicative property of φ and the formula for φ ( p k ) gives φ φ ( n ) = φ φ ( p 1 k 1 ) φ φ ( p 2 k 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ φ φ ( p r k r ) = p 1 k 1 ( 1 − − 1 p 1 ) p 2 k 2 ( 1 − − 1 p 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ p r k r ( 1 − − 1 p r ) = p 1 k 1 p 2 k 2 ⋯ ⋯ p r k r ( 1 − − 1 p 1 ) ( 1 − − 1 p 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( 1 − − 1 p r ) = n ( 1 − − 1 p 1 ) ( 1 − − 1 p 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( 1 − − 1 p r ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}\varphi (n)&=&\varphi (p_{1}^{k_{1}})\,\varphi (p_{2}^{k_{2}})\cdots \varphi (p_{r}^{k_{r}})\\[.1em]&=&p_{1}^{k_{1}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{1}}}\right)p_{2}^{k_{2}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{2}}}\right)\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{r}}}\right)\\[.1em]&=&p_{1}^{k_{1}}p_{2}^{k_{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{1}}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{2}}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{r}}}\right)\\[.1em]&=&n\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{1}}}\right)\left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{2}}}\right)\cdots \left(1-{\frac {1}{p_{r}}}\right).\end{array}}} This gives both versions of Euler's product formula.

An alternative proof that does not require the multiplicative property instead uses the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to the set { 1 , 2 , … … , n } {\displaystyle \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} , excluding the sets of integers divisible by the prime divisors.

Example [ edit ] φ φ ( 20 ) = φ φ ( 2 2 5 ) = 20 ( 1 − − 1 2 ) ( 1 − − 1 5 ) = 20 ⋅ ⋅ 1 2 ⋅ ⋅ 4 5 = 8.

{\displaystyle \varphi (20)=\varphi (2^{2}5)=20\,(1-{\tfrac {1}{2}})\,(1-{\tfrac {1}{5}})=20\cdot {\tfrac {1}{2}}\cdot {\tfrac {4}{5}}=8.} In words: the distinct prime factors of 20 are 2 and 5; half of the twenty integers from 1 to 20 are divisible by 2, leaving ten; a fifth of those are divisible by 5, leaving eight numbers coprime to 20; these are: 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19.

The alternative formula uses only integers: φ φ ( 20 ) = φ φ ( 2 2 5 1 ) = 2 2 − − 1 ( 2 − − 1 ) 5 1 − − 1 ( 5 − − 1 ) = 2 ⋅ ⋅ 1 ⋅ ⋅ 1 ⋅ ⋅ 4 = 8.

{\displaystyle \varphi (20)=\varphi (2^{2}5^{1})=2^{2-1}(2{-}1)\,5^{1-1}(5{-}1)=2\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 4=8.} Fourier transform [ edit ] The totient is the discrete Fourier transform of the gcd , evaluated at 1.

[ 17 ] Let F { x } [ m ] = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n x k ⋅ ⋅ e − − 2 π π i m k n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\{\mathbf {x} \}[m]=\sum \limits _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}\cdot e^{{-2\pi i}{\frac {mk}{n}}}} where x k = gcd( k , n ) for k ∈ {1, ..., n } . Then φ φ ( n ) = F { x } [ 1 ] = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n gcd ( k , n ) e − − 2 π π i k n .

{\displaystyle \varphi (n)={\mathcal {F}}\{\mathbf {x} \}[1]=\sum \limits _{k=1}^{n}\gcd(k,n)e^{-2\pi i{\frac {k}{n}}}.} The real part of this formula is φ φ ( n ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n gcd ( k , n ) cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 π π k n .

{\displaystyle \varphi (n)=\sum \limits _{k=1}^{n}\gcd(k,n)\cos {\tfrac {2\pi k}{n}}.} For example, using cos ⁡ ⁡ π π 5 = 5 + 1 4 {\displaystyle \cos {\tfrac {\pi }{5}}={\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}+1}{4}}} and cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 π π 5 = 5 − − 1 4 {\displaystyle \cos {\tfrac {2\pi }{5}}={\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}}} : φ φ ( 10 ) = gcd ( 1 , 10 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 π π 10 + gcd ( 2 , 10 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ 4 π π 10 + gcd ( 3 , 10 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ 6 π π 10 + ⋯ ⋯ + gcd ( 10 , 10 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ 20 π π 10 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( 5 + 1 4 ) + 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( 5 − − 1 4 ) + 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 5 − − 1 4 ) + 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 5 + 1 4 ) + 5 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 1 ) + 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 5 + 1 4 ) + 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( − − 5 − − 1 4 ) + 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( 5 − − 1 4 ) + 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( 5 + 1 4 ) + 10 ⋅ ⋅ ( 1 ) = 4.

{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}\varphi (10)&=&\gcd(1,10)\cos {\tfrac {2\pi }{10}}+\gcd(2,10)\cos {\tfrac {4\pi }{10}}+\gcd(3,10)\cos {\tfrac {6\pi }{10}}+\cdots +\gcd(10,10)\cos {\tfrac {20\pi }{10}}\\&=&1\cdot ({\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}+1}{4}})+2\cdot ({\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}})+1\cdot (-{\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}})+2\cdot (-{\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}+1}{4}})+5\cdot (-1)\\&&+\ 2\cdot (-{\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}+1}{4}})+1\cdot (-{\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}})+2\cdot ({\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}-1}{4}})+1\cdot ({\tfrac {{\sqrt {5}}+1}{4}})+10\cdot (1)\\&=&4.\end{array}}} Unlike the Euler product and the divisor sum formula, this one does not require knowing the factors of n . However, it does involve the calculation of the greatest common divisor of n and every positive integer less than n , which suffices to provide the factorization anyway.

Divisor sum [ edit ] The property established by Gauss, [ 18 ] that ∑ ∑ d ∣ ∣ n φ φ ( d ) = n , {\displaystyle \sum _{d\mid n}\varphi (d)=n,} where the sum is over all positive divisors d of n , can be proven in several ways. (See Arithmetical function for notational conventions.) One proof is to note that φ ( d ) is also equal to the number of possible generators of the cyclic group C d ; specifically, if C d = ⟨ g ⟩ with g d = 1 , then g k is a generator for every k coprime to d . Since every element of C n generates a cyclic subgroup , and each subgroup C d ⊆ C n is generated by precisely φ ( d ) elements of C n , the formula follows.

[ 19 ] Equivalently, the formula can be derived by the same argument applied to the multiplicative group of the n th roots of unity and the primitive d th roots of unity .

The formula can also be derived from elementary arithmetic.

[ 20 ] For example, let n = 20 and consider the positive fractions up to 1 with denominator 20: 1 20 , 2 20 , 3 20 , 4 20 , 5 20 , 6 20 , 7 20 , 8 20 , 9 20 , 10 20 , 11 20 , 12 20 , 13 20 , 14 20 , 15 20 , 16 20 , 17 20 , 18 20 , 19 20 , 20 20 .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{20}},\,{\tfrac {2}{20}},\,{\tfrac {3}{20}},\,{\tfrac {4}{20}},\,{\tfrac {5}{20}},\,{\tfrac {6}{20}},\,{\tfrac {7}{20}},\,{\tfrac {8}{20}},\,{\tfrac {9}{20}},\,{\tfrac {10}{20}},\,{\tfrac {11}{20}},\,{\tfrac {12}{20}},\,{\tfrac {13}{20}},\,{\tfrac {14}{20}},\,{\tfrac {15}{20}},\,{\tfrac {16}{20}},\,{\tfrac {17}{20}},\,{\tfrac {18}{20}},\,{\tfrac {19}{20}},\,{\tfrac {20}{20}}.} Put them into lowest terms: 1 20 , 1 10 , 3 20 , 1 5 , 1 4 , 3 10 , 7 20 , 2 5 , 9 20 , 1 2 , 11 20 , 3 5 , 13 20 , 7 10 , 3 4 , 4 5 , 17 20 , 9 10 , 19 20 , 1 1 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{20}},\,{\tfrac {1}{10}},\,{\tfrac {3}{20}},\,{\tfrac {1}{5}},\,{\tfrac {1}{4}},\,{\tfrac {3}{10}},\,{\tfrac {7}{20}},\,{\tfrac {2}{5}},\,{\tfrac {9}{20}},\,{\tfrac {1}{2}},\,{\tfrac {11}{20}},\,{\tfrac {3}{5}},\,{\tfrac {13}{20}},\,{\tfrac {7}{10}},\,{\tfrac {3}{4}},\,{\tfrac {4}{5}},\,{\tfrac {17}{20}},\,{\tfrac {9}{10}},\,{\tfrac {19}{20}},\,{\tfrac {1}{1}}} These twenty fractions are all the positive ⁠ k / d ⁠ ≤ 1 whose denominators are the divisors d = 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 . The fractions with 20 as denominator are those with numerators relatively prime to 20, namely ⁠ 1 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 3 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 7 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 9 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 11 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 13 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 17 / 20 ⁠ , ⁠ 19 / 20 ⁠ ; by definition this is φ (20) fractions. Similarly, there are φ (10) fractions with denominator 10, and φ (5) fractions with denominator 5, etc. Thus the set of twenty fractions is split into subsets of size φ ( d ) for each d dividing 20. A similar argument applies for any n.

Möbius inversion applied to the divisor sum formula gives φ φ ( n ) = ∑ ∑ d ∣ ∣ n μ μ ( d ) ⋅ ⋅ n d = n ∑ ∑ d ∣ ∣ n μ μ ( d ) d , {\displaystyle \varphi (n)=\sum _{d\mid n}\mu \left(d\right)\cdot {\frac {n}{d}}=n\sum _{d\mid n}{\frac {\mu (d)}{d}},} where μ is the Möbius function , the multiplicative function defined by μ μ ( p ) = − − 1 {\displaystyle \mu (p)=-1} and μ μ ( p k ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (p^{k})=0} for each prime p and k ≥ 2 . This formula may also be derived from the product formula by multiplying out ∏ ∏ p ∣ ∣ n ( 1 − − 1 p ) {\textstyle \prod _{p\mid n}(1-{\frac {1}{p}})} to get ∑ ∑ d ∣ ∣ n μ μ ( d ) d .

{\textstyle \sum _{d\mid n}{\frac {\mu (d)}{d}}.} An example: φ φ ( 20 ) = μ μ ( 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ 20 + μ μ ( 2 ) ⋅ ⋅ 10 + μ μ ( 4 ) ⋅ ⋅ 5 + μ μ ( 5 ) ⋅ ⋅ 4 + μ μ ( 10 ) ⋅ ⋅ 2 + μ μ ( 20 ) ⋅ ⋅ 1 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ 20 − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ 10 + 0 ⋅ ⋅ 5 − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ 4 + 1 ⋅ ⋅ 2 + 0 ⋅ ⋅ 1 = 8.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\varphi (20)&=\mu (1)\cdot 20+\mu (2)\cdot 10+\mu (4)\cdot 5+\mu (5)\cdot 4+\mu (10)\cdot 2+\mu (20)\cdot 1\\[.5em]&=1\cdot 20-1\cdot 10+0\cdot 5-1\cdot 4+1\cdot 2+0\cdot 1=8.\end{aligned}}} Some values [ edit ] The first 100 values (sequence A000010 in the OEIS ) are shown in the table and graph below: Graph of the first 100 values φ ( n ) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 + 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 1 1 2 2 4 2 6 4 6 4 10 10 4 12 6 8 8 16 6 18 8 20 12 10 22 8 20 12 18 12 28 8 30 30 16 20 16 24 12 36 18 24 16 40 40 12 42 20 24 22 46 16 42 20 50 32 24 52 18 40 24 36 28 58 16 60 60 30 36 32 48 20 66 32 44 24 70 70 24 72 36 40 36 60 24 78 32 80 54 40 82 24 64 42 56 40 88 24 90 72 44 60 46 72 32 96 42 60 40 In the graph at right the top line y = n − 1 is an upper bound valid for all n other than one, and attained if and only if n is a prime number. A simple lower bound is φ φ ( n ) ≥ ≥ n / 2 {\displaystyle \varphi (n)\geq {\sqrt {n/2}}} , which is rather loose: in fact, the lower limit of the graph is proportional to ⁠ n / log log n ⁠ .

[ 21 ] Euler's theorem [ edit ] Main article: Euler's theorem This states that if a and n are relatively prime then a φ φ ( n ) ≡ ≡ 1 mod n .

{\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}\equiv 1\mod n.} The special case where n is prime is known as Fermat's little theorem .

This follows from Lagrange's theorem and the fact that φ ( n ) is the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n .

The RSA cryptosystem is based on this theorem: it implies that the inverse of the function a ↦ a e mod n , where e is the (public) encryption exponent, is the function b ↦ b d mod n , where d , the (private) decryption exponent, is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ ( n ) . The difficulty of computing φ ( n ) without knowing the factorization of n is thus the difficulty of computing d : this is known as the RSA problem which can be solved by factoring n . The owner of the private key knows the factorization, since an RSA private key is constructed by choosing n as the product of two (randomly chosen) large primes p and q . Only n is publicly disclosed, and given the difficulty to factor large numbers we have the guarantee that no one else knows the factorization.

Divisibility by any fixed positive integer [ edit ] The following property, which is part of the « folklore » (i.e., apparently unpublished as a specific result: [ 26 ] see the introduction of this article in which it is stated as having « long been known ») has important consequences. For instance it rules out uniform distribution of the values of φ φ ( n ) {\displaystyle \varphi (n)} in the arithmetic progressions modulo q {\displaystyle q} for any integer q > 1 {\displaystyle q>1} .

For every fixed positive integer q {\displaystyle q} , the relation q | φ φ ( n ) {\displaystyle q|\varphi (n)} holds for almost all n {\displaystyle n} , meaning for all but o ( x ) {\displaystyle o(x)} values of n ≤ ≤ x {\displaystyle n\leq x} as x → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x\rightarrow \infty } .

This is an elementary consequence of the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes congruent to 1 modulo q {\displaystyle q} diverges, which itself is a corollary of the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions .

Generating functions [ edit ] The Dirichlet series for φ ( n ) may be written in terms of the Riemann zeta function as: [ 27 ] ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ φ φ ( n ) n s = ζ ζ ( s − − 1 ) ζ ζ ( s ) {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {\varphi (n)}{n^{s}}}={\frac {\zeta (s-1)}{\zeta (s)}}} where the left-hand side converges for ℜ ℜ ( s ) > 2 {\displaystyle \Re (s)>2} .

The Lambert series generating function is [ 28 ] ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ φ φ ( n ) q n 1 − − q n = q ( 1 − − q ) 2 {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {\varphi (n)q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}}={\frac {q}{(1-q)^{2}}}} which converges for | q | < 1 .

Both of these are proved by elementary series manipulations and the formulae for φ ( n ) .

Growth rate [ edit ] In the words of Hardy & Wright, the order of φ ( n ) is "always 'nearly n '." [ 29 ] First [ 30 ] lim sup φ φ ( n ) n = 1 , {\displaystyle \lim \sup {\frac {\varphi (n)}{n}}=1,} but as n goes to infinity, [ 31 ] for all δ > 0 φ φ ( n ) n 1 − − δ δ → → ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\varphi (n)}{n^{1-\delta }}}\rightarrow \infty .} These two formulae can be proved by using little more than the formulae for φ ( n ) and the divisor sum function σ ( n ) .

In fact, during the proof of the second formula, the inequality 6 π π 2 < φ φ ( n ) σ σ ( n ) n 2 < 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {6}{\pi ^{2}}}<{\frac {\varphi (n)\sigma (n)}{n^{2}}}<1,} true for n > 1 , is proved.

We also have [ 21 ] lim inf φ φ ( n ) n log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n = e − − γ γ .

{\displaystyle \lim \inf {\frac {\varphi (n)}{n}}\log \log n=e^{-\gamma }.} Here γ is Euler's constant , γ = 0.577215665...

, so e γ = 1.7810724...

and e − γ = 0.56145948...

.

Proving this does not quite require the prime number theorem .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Since log log n goes to infinity, this formula shows that lim inf φ φ ( n ) n = 0.

{\displaystyle \lim \inf {\frac {\varphi (n)}{n}}=0.} In fact, more is true.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] φ φ ( n ) > n e γ γ log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n + 3 log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n for n > 2 {\displaystyle \varphi (n)>{\frac {n}{e^{\gamma }\;\log \log n+{\frac {3}{\log \log n}}}}\quad {\text{for }}n>2} and φ φ ( n ) < n e γ γ log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n for infinitely many n .

{\displaystyle \varphi (n)<{\frac {n}{e^{\gamma }\log \log n}}\quad {\text{for infinitely many }}n.} The second inequality was shown by Jean-Louis Nicolas . Ribenboim says "The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption." [ 36 ] : 173 For the average order, we have [ 23 ] [ 37 ] φ φ ( 1 ) + φ φ ( 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + φ φ ( n ) = 3 n 2 π π 2 + O ( n ( log ⁡ ⁡ n ) 2 3 ( log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n ) 4 3 ) as n → → ∞ ∞ , {\displaystyle \varphi (1)+\varphi (2)+\cdots +\varphi (n)={\frac {3n^{2}}{\pi ^{2}}}+O\left(n(\log n)^{\frac {2}{3}}(\log \log n)^{\frac {4}{3}}\right)\quad {\text{as }}n\rightarrow \infty ,} due to Arnold Walfisz , its proof exploiting estimates on exponential sums due to I. M. Vinogradov and N. M. Korobov . 
By a combination of van der Corput's and Vinogradov's methods, H.-Q. Liu (On Euler's function.Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 146 (2016), no. 4, 769–775)  
improved the error term to O ( n ( log ⁡ ⁡ n ) 2 3 ( log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n ) 1 3 ) {\displaystyle O\left(n(\log n)^{\frac {2}{3}}(\log \log n)^{\frac {1}{3}}\right)} (this is currently the best known estimate of this type). The "Big O " stands for a quantity that is bounded by a constant times the function of n inside the parentheses (which is small compared to n 2 ).

This result can be used to prove [ 38 ] that the probability of two randomly chosen numbers being relatively prime is ⁠ 6 / π 2 ⁠ .

Ratio of consecutive values [ edit ] In 1950 Somayajulu proved [ 39 ] [ 40 ] lim inf φ φ ( n + 1 ) φ φ ( n ) = 0 and lim sup φ φ ( n + 1 ) φ φ ( n ) = ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim \inf {\frac {\varphi (n+1)}{\varphi (n)}}&=0\quad {\text{and}}\\[5px]\lim \sup {\frac {\varphi (n+1)}{\varphi (n)}}&=\infty .\end{aligned}}} In 1954 Schinzel and Sierpiński strengthened this, proving [ 39 ] [ 40 ] that the set { φ φ ( n + 1 ) φ φ ( n ) , n = 1 , 2 , … … } {\displaystyle \left\{{\frac {\varphi (n+1)}{\varphi (n)}},\;\;n=1,2,\ldots \right\}} is dense in the positive real numbers. They also proved [ 39 ] that the set { φ φ ( n ) n , n = 1 , 2 , … … } {\displaystyle \left\{{\frac {\varphi (n)}{n}},\;\;n=1,2,\ldots \right\}} is dense in the interval (0,1).

Totient number [ edit ] A totient number is a value of Euler's totient function: that is, an m for which there is at least one n for which φ ( n ) = m . The valency or multiplicity of a totient number m is the number of solutions to this equation.

[ 41 ] A nontotient is a natural number which is not a totient number. Every odd integer exceeding 1 is trivially a nontotient. There are also infinitely many even nontotients, [ 42 ] and indeed every positive integer has a multiple which is an even nontotient.

[ 43 ] The number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is x log ⁡ ⁡ x e ( C + o ( 1 ) ) ( log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {x}{\log x}}e^{{\big (}C+o(1){\big )}(\log \log \log x)^{2}}} for a constant C = 0.8178146...

.

[ 44 ] If counted accordingly to multiplicity, the number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is | { n : φ φ ( n ) ≤ ≤ x } | = ζ ζ ( 2 ) ζ ζ ( 3 ) ζ ζ ( 6 ) ⋅ ⋅ x + R ( x ) {\displaystyle {\Big \vert }\{n:\varphi (n)\leq x\}{\Big \vert }={\frac {\zeta (2)\zeta (3)}{\zeta (6)}}\cdot x+R(x)} where the error term R is of order at most ⁠ x / (log x ) k ⁠ for any positive k .

[ 45 ] It is known that the multiplicity of m exceeds m δ infinitely often for any δ < 0.55655 .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Ford's theorem [ edit ] Ford (1999) proved that for every integer k ≥ 2 there is a totient number m of multiplicity k : that is, for which the equation φ ( n ) = m has exactly k solutions; this result had previously been conjectured by Wacław Sierpiński , [ 48 ] and it had been obtained as a consequence of Schinzel's hypothesis H .

[ 44 ] Indeed, each multiplicity that occurs, does so infinitely often.

[ 44 ] [ 47 ] However, no number m is known with multiplicity k = 1 .

Carmichael's totient function conjecture is the statement that there is no such m .

[ 49 ] Perfect totient numbers [ edit ] Main article: Perfect totient number A perfect totient number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its iterated totients. That is, we apply the totient function to a number n , apply it again to the resulting totient, and so on, until the number 1 is reached, and add together the resulting sequence of numbers; if the sum equals n , then n is a perfect totient number.

Applications [ edit ] Cyclotomy [ edit ] Main article: Constructible polygon In the last section of the Disquisitiones [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Gauss proves [ 52 ] that a regular n -gon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if φ ( n ) is a power of 2. If n is a power of an odd prime number the formula for the totient says its totient can be a power of two only if n is a first power and n − 1 is a power of 2. The primes that are one more than a power of 2 are called Fermat primes , and only five are known: 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. Fermat and Gauss knew of these. Nobody has been able to prove whether there are any more.

Thus, a regular n -gon has a straightedge-and-compass construction if n is a product of distinct Fermat primes and any power of 2. The first few such n are [ 53 ] 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40,... (sequence A003401 in the OEIS ).

Prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions [ edit ] Main article: Prime number theorem § Prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions The RSA cryptosystem [ edit ] Main article: RSA (algorithm) Setting up an RSA system involves choosing large prime numbers p and q , computing n = pq and k = φ ( n ) , and finding two numbers e and d such that ed ≡ 1 (mod k ) . The numbers n and e (the "encryption key") are released to the public, and d (the "decryption key") is kept private.

A message, represented by an integer m , where 0 < m < n , is encrypted by computing S = m e (mod n ) .

It is decrypted by computing t = S d (mod n ) . Euler's Theorem can be used to show that if 0 < t < n , then t = m .

The security of an RSA system would be compromised if the number n could be efficiently factored or if φ ( n ) could be efficiently computed without factoring n .

Unsolved problems [ edit ] Lehmer's conjecture [ edit ] Main article: Lehmer's totient problem If p is prime, then φ ( p ) = p − 1 . In 1932 D. H. Lehmer asked if there are any composite numbers n such that φ ( n ) divides n − 1 . None are known.

[ 54 ] In 1933 he proved that if any such n exists, it must be odd, square-free, and divisible by at least seven primes (i.e.

ω ( n ) ≥ 7 ). In 1980 Cohen and Hagis proved that n > 10 20 and that ω ( n ) ≥ 14 .

[ 55 ] Further, Hagis showed that if 3 divides n then n > 10 1937042 and ω ( n ) ≥ 298848 .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Carmichael's conjecture [ edit ] Main article: Carmichael's totient function conjecture This states that there is no number n with the property that for all other numbers m , m ≠ n , φ ( m ) ≠ φ ( n ) . See Ford's theorem above.

As stated in the main article, if there is a single counterexample to this conjecture, there must be infinitely many counterexamples, and the smallest one has at least ten billion digits in base 10.

[ 41 ] Riemann hypothesis [ edit ] The Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the inequality n φ φ ( n ) < e γ γ log ⁡ ⁡ log ⁡ ⁡ n + e γ γ ( 4 + γ γ − − log ⁡ ⁡ 4 π π ) log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle {\frac {n}{\varphi (n)}}<e^{\gamma }\log \log n+{\frac {e^{\gamma }(4+\gamma -\log 4\pi )}{\sqrt {\log n}}}} is true for all n ≥ p 120569 # where γ is Euler's constant and p 120569 # is the product of the first 120569 primes.
