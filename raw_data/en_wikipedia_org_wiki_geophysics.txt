**Geophysics** () is a subject of [natural science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") concerned with the physical processes and [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property "Physical property") of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. Geophysicists conduct investigations across a wide range of scientific disciplines. The term _geophysics_ classically refers to [solid earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_earth "Solid earth") applications: Earth's [shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth "Figure of the Earth"); its [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational "Gravitational"), [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"), and [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"); its [internal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth "Structure of the Earth") and [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Chemical_composition "Earth"); its [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamics "Geodynamics") and their surface expression in [plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"), the generation of [magmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma"), [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism "Volcanism") and rock formation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Sheriff1991-1) However, modern geophysics organizations and pure scientists use a broader definition that includes the [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle") including snow and ice; [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_fluid_dynamics "Geophysical fluid dynamics") of the oceans and the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"); [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_electricity "Atmospheric electricity") and [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism") in the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere") and [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") and [solar-terrestrial physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-terrestrial_physics "Solar-terrestrial physics"); and analogous problems associated with the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and other planets.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Sheriff1991-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-IUGG-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-AGUscience-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Gutenberg_(1929)-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Runcorn-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Geophysics-6)

Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from [lodestones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone"), while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the [precession of the equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinox "Precession of the equinox"); and instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.

Geophysics is pursued for fundamental understanding of the Earth and its space environment. Geophysics often addresses societal needs, such as [mineral resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_resources "Mineral resources"), assessment and [mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigation#Disaster_mitigation "Mitigation") of [natural hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hazards "Natural hazards") and [environmental impact assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment "Environmental impact assessment").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-IUGG-2) In [exploration geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_geophysics "Exploration geophysics"), [geophysical survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_survey "Geophysical survey") data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological remains, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for [environmental remediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_remediation "Environmental remediation").

Geophysics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, and geophysicists contribute to every area of the [Earth sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_sciences "Earth sciences"), while some geophysicists conduct research in the [planetary sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_sciences "Planetary sciences"). To provide a more clear idea on what constitutes geophysics, this section describes phenomena that are studied in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and how they relate to the Earth and its surroundings. Geophysicists also investigate the physical processes and properties of the Earth, its fluid layers, and magnetic field along with the near-Earth environment in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), which includes other planetary bodies.

A map of deviations in gravity from a perfectly smooth, idealized Earth

The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun gives rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day, or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide and between every low tide.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-7)

Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth increases.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Poirier-8) Measurements of [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration") and [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential") at the Earth's surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see [gravity anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_anomaly "Gravity anomaly") and [gravimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry "Gravimetry")).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9) The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plates "Tectonic plates"). The [geopotential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopotential "Geopotential") surface called the [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid "Geoid") is one definition of the shape of the Earth. The geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Lowrie-10)

[![Image 2: Deformed blocks with grids on surface.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Pswaves.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pswaves.jpg)

Illustration of the deformations of a block by body waves and surface waves (see [seismic wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave "Seismic wave")) 

[Seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave "Seismic wave") are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior or along its surface.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-11) The entire Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called [normal modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modes "Normal modes") or [free oscillations of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave#Normal_modes "Seismic wave"). Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using [seismographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismograph "Seismograph"). If the waves come from a localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Shearer-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Stein-13)

Recording of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave "Seismic wave") from controlled sources provides information on the region that the waves travel through. If the density or composition of the rock changes, waves are reflected. Reflections recorded using [Reflection Seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology "Reflection seismology") can provide a wealth of information on the structure of the earth up to several kilometers deep and are used to increase our understanding of the geology as well as to explore for oil and gas.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9) Changes in the travel direction, called [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_refraction "Seismic refraction"), can be used to infer the [deep structure of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_interior "Earth's interior").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Stein-13)

Earthquakes pose a [risk to humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquakes#Effects/impacts_of_earthquakes "Earthquakes"). Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake (e.g., [intraplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraplate_earthquake "Intraplate earthquake") or [deep focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus_earthquake "Deep focus earthquake")), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in [earthquake engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_engineering "Earthquake engineering").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Bozorgnia2004-14)

Although we mainly notice electricity during [thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorms "Thunderstorms"), there is always a downward electric field near the surface that averages 120 [volts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt") per meter.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Harrison-15) Relative to the solid Earth, the ionization of the planet's atmosphere is a result of the galactic [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays "Cosmic rays") penetrating it, which leaves it with a net positive charge.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-16) A current of about 1800 [amperes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") flows in the global circuit.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Harrison-15) It flows downward from the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere") over most of the Earth and back upwards through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning) "Sprite (lightning)") above.

A variety of electric methods are used in geophysical survey. Some measure [spontaneous potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_potential "Spontaneous potential"), a potential that arises in the ground because of human-made or natural disturbances. [Telluric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_current "Telluric current") flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") by the time-varying, external-origin [geomagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_field "Geomagnetic field") and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic field.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-17) The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in [electrical resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity "Electrical resistivity") of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see [induced polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_polarization "Induced polarization") and [electrical resistivity tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_tomography "Electrical resistivity tomography")).

### Electromagnetic waves

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Electromagnetic waves")]

[Electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves") occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as in [Earth's outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core "Earth's outer core"). [Dawn chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_chorus_(electromagnetic) "Dawn chorus (electromagnetic)") is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the [Van Allen radiation belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt "Van Allen radiation belt"). [Whistlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio) "Whistler (radio)") are produced by [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes. [Hiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiss_(electromagnetic) "Hiss (electromagnetic)") may be generated by both. [Electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see [seismo-electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismo-electromagnetics "Seismo-electromagnetics")).

In the highly conductive liquid iron of the outer core, magnetic fields are generated by electric currents through electromagnetic induction. [Alfvén waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave "Alfvén wave") are [magnetohydrodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamic "Magnetohydrodynamic") waves in the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") or the Earth's core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the Earth's magnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic [Rossby waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_wave "Rossby wave") may be one source of [geomagnetic secular variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_secular_variation "Geomagnetic secular variation").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Merrill-18)

Electromagnetic methods that are used for geophysical survey include [transient electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_electromagnetics "Transient electromagnetics"), [magnetotellurics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotellurics "Magnetotellurics"), [surface nuclear magnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_nuclear_magnetic_resonance "Surface nuclear magnetic resonance") and electromagnetic seabed logging.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-19)

The Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and has long been used for navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the outer core.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Merrill-18) The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the [auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy) "Aurora (astronomy)").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Kivelson-20)

[![Image 3: Diagram with field lines, axes and magnet lines.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Geomagnetisme.svg/330px-Geomagnetisme.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetisme.svg)

Earth's dipole axis (pink line) is tilted away from the rotational axis (blue line). 

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif/250px-Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif)

Computer simulation of the [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") in a period of normal polarity between [reversals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal "Geomagnetic reversal")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-21)

The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole"), but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the [geomagnetic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_pole "Geomagnetic pole") stays near the [geographic pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_pole "Geographic pole"), but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These [geomagnetic reversals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversals "Geomagnetic reversals"), analyzed within a [Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#Geomagnetic_polarity_time_scale "Geomagnetic reversal"), contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the [Laschamp event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laschamp_event "Laschamp event") occurring 41,000 years ago during the [last glacial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_period#Last_glacial_period "Glacial period"). Geologists observed [geomagnetic reversal recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#History "Geomagnetic reversal") in volcanic rocks, through [magnetostratigraphy correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy#Correlation_and_ages "Magnetostratigraphy") (see [natural remanent magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_remanent_magnetization "Natural remanent magnetization")) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on [seafloor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading "Seafloor spreading"), a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy "Magnetostratigraphy"), which correlates magnetic reversals with other [stratigraphies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphic_section "Stratigraphic section") to construct geologic time scales.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Opdyke-22) In addition, the [magnetization in rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism "Paleomagnetism") can be used to measure the motion of continents.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Merrill-18)

[![Image 5: Diagram with compound balls representing nuclei and arrows.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Thorium_decay_chain_from_lead-212_to_lead-208.svg/250px-Thorium_decay_chain_from_lead-212_to_lead-208.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thorium_decay_chain_from_lead-212_to_lead-208.svg)

Example of a radioactive decay chain (see [Radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating "Radiometric dating")) 

[Radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") accounts for about 80% of the Earth's [internal heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_heat "Internal heat"), powering the geodynamo and plate tectonics.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Turcotte-23) The main heat-producing [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes "Isotopes") are [potassium-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium "Potassium"), [uranium-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium"), uranium-235, and [thorium-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium "Thorium").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-24) Radioactive elements are used for [radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating "Radiometric dating"), the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in [geochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology "Geochronology").

Unstable isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") cover several orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past [geologic eras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_(geology) "Era (geology)").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Renne-25) Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne [gamma spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_spectrometry "Gamma spectrometry") can be used to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth's surface, which is useful for mapping lithology and alteration.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-27)

[Fluid motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics") occur in the magnetosphere, [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere"), ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an enormous [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity"), flows like a fluid over long time intervals. This flow is reflected in phenomena such as [isostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy "Isostasy"), [post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound "Post-glacial rebound") and [mantle plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume "Mantle plume"). The mantle flow drives plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the geodynamo.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Merrill-18)

Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in [physical oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_oceanography "Physical oceanography") and [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"). The rotation of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth's fluid dynamics, often due to the [Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect"). In the atmosphere, it gives rise to large-scale patterns like [Rossby waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_waves "Rossby waves") and determines the basic circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean, they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as [Kelvin waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_waves "Kelvin waves") and [Ekman spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_spirals "Ekman spirals") at the ocean surface.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Pedlosky-28) In the Earth's core, the circulation of the molten iron is structured by [Taylor columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_columns "Taylor columns").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Merrill-18)

Waves and other phenomena in the magnetosphere can be modeled using [magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics "Magnetohydrodynamics").

[![Image 6: Pseudocolor image in vertical profile.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Convection-snapshot.png/500px-Convection-snapshot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Convection-snapshot.png)

A model of [thermal convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_convection "Thermal convection") in the [Earth's mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle "Earth's mantle"). The thin red columns are [mantle plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plumes "Mantle plumes"). 

The Earth is cooling, and the resulting [heat flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flow "Heat flow") generates the Earth's magnetic field through the [geodynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamo "Geodynamo") and plate tectonics through [mantle convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_convection "Mantle convection").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Davies-29) The main sources of heat are: primordial heat due to Earth's cooling and [radioactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity") in the planets upper crust.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-30) There is also some contributions from [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transitions "Phase transitions"). Heat is mostly carried to the surface by [thermal convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_convection "Thermal convection"), although there are two thermal boundary layers – the [core–mantle boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core%E2%80%93mantle_boundary "Core–mantle boundary") and the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere") – in which heat is transported by [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_(heat) "Conduction (heat)").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Fowler-31) Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)") by [mantle plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plumes "Mantle plumes"). The heat flow at the Earth's surface is about  4.2 × 10 13 W, and it is a potential source of [geothermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy "Geothermal energy") energy.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Pollack-32)

The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth's interior from [seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology"), the [geothermal gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient "Geothermal gradient") and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the [elastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)") properties of minerals; their high-pressure [phase diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagrams "Phase diagrams"), melting points and [equations of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_state "Equations of state") at high pressure; and the [rheological properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology "Rheology") of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation of rocks by [creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(deformation) "Creep (deformation)") make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity") of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn, determines the rates at which tectonic plates move.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Poirier-8)

Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Sadava-33) Its physical properties shape the [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere") and are an essential part of the [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle") and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"). Its thermodynamic properties determine [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation") and the thermal gradient in the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"). The many types of [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") involve a complex mixture of processes such as [coalescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescence_(physics) "Coalescence (physics)"), [supercooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercooling "Supercooling") and [supersaturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation "Supersaturation").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-34) Some precipitated water becomes [groundwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater "Groundwater"), and groundwater flow includes phenomena such as [percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation "Percolation"), while the [conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductivity_(electrolytic) "Conductivity (electrolytic)") of water makes electrical and electromagnetic methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") have a large effect on its motion in the oceans.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Pedlosky-28)

The many phases of ice form the [cryosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere "Cryosphere") and come in forms like [ice sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet "Ice sheet"), [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"), [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice"), freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost")).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-35)

Contrary to popular belief, the earth is not entirely spherical but instead generally exhibits an [ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid "Ellipsoid") shape- which is a result of the centrifugal forces the planet generates due to its constant motion.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:0-36) These forces cause the planets diameter to bulge towards the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") and results in the [ellipsoid shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid "Earth ellipsoid").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:0-36) Earth's shape is constantly changing, and different factors including [glacial isostatic rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound "Post-glacial rebound") (large ice sheets melting causing the Earth's crust to the rebound due to the release of the pressure[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-37)), geological features such as [mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain "Mountain") or [ocean trenches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench "Oceanic trench"), [tectonic plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics") dynamics, and [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster "Natural disaster") can further distort the planet's shape.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:0-36)

### Structure of the interior

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Structure of the interior")]

[![Image 7: Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Earthquake_wave_paths.svg/330px-Earthquake_wave_paths.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earthquake_wave_paths.svg)

Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") sampled by seismic waves 

Evidence from [seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology"), heat flow at the surface, and [mineral physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_physics "Mineral physics") is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean [specific gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity "Specific gravity") (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia") ( 0.33 M R 2, compared to  0.4 M R 2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the [Adams–Williamson equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93Williamson_equation "Adams–Williamson equation"). The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Poirier-8)

Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no [S-waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-waves "S-waves") in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. [Earth's inner core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_inner_core "Earth's inner core"), however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Lowrie-10)

Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicates some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: [inner core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_inner_core "Earth's inner core"), [outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_outer_core "Earth's outer core"), mantle, [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere") and [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)"). The mantle itself is divided into the [upper mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_mantle_(Earth) "Upper mantle (Earth)"), transition zone, lower mantle and _D′′_ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the [Mohorovičić discontinuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity "Mohorovičić discontinuity").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Lowrie-10)

The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the [geotherm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotherm "Geotherm") must also be determined. This requires physical theory for [thermal conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction "Thermal conduction") and [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") and the heat contribution of [radioactive elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclides "Radionuclides"). The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the [preliminary reference Earth model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model "Preliminary reference Earth model") (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see [post-perovskite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-perovskite "Post-perovskite")) and supplemented by [seismic tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_tomography "Seismic tomography"). The mantle is mainly composed of [silicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicates "Silicates"), and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Poirier-8)

The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures, it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes [plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics") possible.

[![Image 8: Diagram with colored surfaces and lines.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_mod.svg/330px-Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_mod.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_mod.svg)

Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") flows from left to right. 

If a planet's [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends about 10 [Earth radii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radii "Earth radii") towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the [magnetic tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotail "Magnetotail"), hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Kivelson-20)

Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy"). While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the [American Geophysical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Geophysical_Union "American Geophysical Union"), the [Canadian Geophysical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Geophysical_Union "Canadian Geophysical Union") and the [International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Geodesy_and_Geophysics "International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics") encompass both.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-NRC-38)

Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the [global positioning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_positioning_system "Global positioning system") (GPS). A three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to the [1980 Geodetic Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRS_80 "GRS 80"). An alternative, [optical astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro-geodetic "Astro-geodetic"), combines astronomical coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth such as [nutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation "Nutation") and [Chandler wobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_wobble "Chandler wobble"). Relative positions of two or more points can be determined using [very-long-baseline interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry "Very-long-baseline interferometry").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-NRC-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Torge-40)

Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using [gravimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimeters "Gravimeters") deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth's gravity field has been measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using [radar altimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_altimeter "Radar altimeter"), contributing to a more accurate [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid "Geoid").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-NRC-38) In 2002, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") launched the [Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment") (GRACE), wherein two twin [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") map variations in Earth's gravity field by making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system. Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-41)

### Satellites and space probes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Satellites and space probes")]

Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"). The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [gravity fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_field "Gravity field") of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [lunar maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_maria "Lunar maria") were measured through [lunar orbiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_program "Lunar Orbiter program"), which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [mascons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy) "Mass concentration (astronomy)"), beneath the [Imbrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Imbrium "Mare Imbrium"), [Serenitatis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Serenitatis "Mare Serenitatis"), [Crisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Crisium "Mare Crisium"), [Nectaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Nectaris "Mare Nectaris") and [Humorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Humorum "Mare Humorum") basins.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-42)

### Global positioning systems (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Global positioning systems (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS)")]

Further information: [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS "GIS")

Since geophysics is concerned with the shape of the Earth, and by extension the mapping of features around and in the planet, geophysical measurements include high accuracy GPS measurements. These measurements are processed to increase their accuracy through [differential GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_GPS "Differential GPS") processing. Once the geophysical measurements have been processed and inverted, the interpreted results are plotted using GIS. Programs such as [ArcGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS "ArcGIS") and [Geosoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosoft "Geosoft") were built to meet these needs and include many geophysical functions that are built-in, such as [upward continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upward_continuation "Upward continuation"), and the calculation of the measurement [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") such as the first-vertical derivative.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Reynolds-43) Many geophysics companies have designed in-house geophysics programs that pre-date ArcGIS and GeoSoft in order to meet the visualization requirements of a geophysical dataset.

[Exploration geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_geophysics "Exploration geophysics") is a branch of applied geophysics that involves the development and utilization of different seismic or electromagnetic methods which the aim of investigating different energy, mineral and water resources.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-44) This is done through the uses of various [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing") platforms such as; [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"), [boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat "Boat"), [drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle "Unmanned aerial vehicle"), [borehole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borehole "Borehole") sensing equipment and [seismic receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_source "Seismic source"). These equipment are often used in conjunction with different geophysical methods such as [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"), [gravimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry "Gravimetry"), [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [radiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometry "Radiometry"), [barometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer") methods in order to gather the data. The remote sensing platforms used in exploration geophysics are not perfect and need adjustments done on them in order to accurately account for the effects that the platform itself may have on the collected data. For example, when gathering [aeromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromagnetic_survey "Aeromagnetic survey") data (aircraft gathered magnetic data) using a conventional fixed-wing aircraft- the platform has to be adjusted to account for the electromagnetic currents that it may generate as it passes through [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9) There are also corrections related to changes in measured potential field intensity as the Earth rotates, as the Earth orbits the Sun, and as the moon orbits the Earth.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Reynolds-43)

Geophysical measurements are often recorded as [time-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-series "Time-series") with [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Navigation "Satellite Navigation") location. Signal processing involves the correction of time-series data for unwanted noise or errors introduced by the measurement platform, such as aircraft vibrations in gravity data. It also involves the reduction of sources of noise, such as diurnal corrections in magnetic data.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Reynolds-43) In seismic data, electromagnetic data, and gravity data, processing continues after error corrections to include [computational geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geophysics "Computational geophysics") which result in the final interpretation of the geophysical data into a geological interpretation of the geophysical measurements[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Telford-9)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Reynolds-43)

Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of [physical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_geography "Physical geography"), [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), meteorology, and physics.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-history_resources-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-46) The first known use of the word _geophysics_ was in German ("Geophysik") by [Julius Fröbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Fr%C3%B6bel "Julius Fröbel") in 1834.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-47) However, many geophysical phenomena – such as the Earth's magnetic field and earthquakes – have been investigated since the [ancient era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history "Ancient history").

### Ancient and classical eras

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Ancient and classical eras")]

[![Image 9: Picture of ornate urn-like device with spouts in the shape of dragons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/EastHanSeismograph.JPG/250px-EastHanSeismograph.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EastHanSeismograph.JPG)

Replica of [Zhang Heng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Heng "Zhang Heng")'s seismoscope, possibly the first contribution to [seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology")

The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for [feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui "Feng shui") as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-48)

In circa 240 BC, [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the [circumference of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference_of_Earth "Circumference of Earth") with great precision.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-russo273277-49) He developed a system of [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Eratosthenes-50)

Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a [seismoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismoscope "Seismoscope") by the prolific inventor [Zhang Heng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Heng "Zhang Heng") in 132 AD.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-51) This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in Europe, by [Jean de la Hautefeuille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Hautefeuille "Jean de Hautefeuille"). It was never built.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Dewey-52)

### Beginnings of modern science

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geophysics&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Beginnings of modern science")]

The 17th century had major milestones that marked the beginning of modern science. In 1600, [William Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(physicist) "William Gilbert (physicist)") release a publication titled _[De Magnete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Magnete "De Magnete")_ (1600) where he conducted series of experiments on both natural magnets (called ['loadstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone")') and artificially magnetized iron.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:12-53) His experiments lead to observations involving a small compass needle ([versorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versorium "Versorium")) which replicated magnetic behaviours when subjected to a spherical magnet, along with it experiencing '[magnetic dips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dip "Magnetic dip")' when it was pivoted on a horizontal axis.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:12-53) HIs findings led to the deduction that compasses point north due to the Earth itself being a giant magnet.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:12-53)

In 1687 [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") published his work titled _[Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ which was pivotal in the development of modern scientific fields such as [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:22-54) In it, Newton both laid the foundations for [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation"), as well as explained different geophysical phenomena such as the [precession of the equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession "Axial precession") (the orbit of whole star patterns along an [ecliptic axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptical_pole "Ecliptical pole").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-55)[Newton's theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") had gained so much success, that it resulted in changing the main objective of physics in that era to unravel natures fundamental forces, and their characterizations in laws.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-:22-54)

The first [seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer "Seismometer"), an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built by [James Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_David_Forbes "James David Forbes") in 1844.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics#cite_note-Dewey-52)
