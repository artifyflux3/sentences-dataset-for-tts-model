More precisely, a Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold with a smoothly varying Hermitian inner product on each (holomorphic) tangent space . One can also define a Hermitian manifold as a real manifold with a Riemannian metric that preserves a complex structure .

A complex structure is essentially an almost complex structure with an integrability condition, and this condition yields a unitary structure ( U(n) structure ) on the manifold. By dropping this condition, we get an almost Hermitian manifold .

On any almost Hermitian manifold, we can introduce a fundamental 2-form (or cosymplectic structure ) that depends only on the chosen metric and the almost complex structure. This form is always non-degenerate. With the extra integrability condition that it is closed (i.e., it is a symplectic form ), we get an almost Kähler structure . If both the almost complex structure and the fundamental form are integrable, then we have a Kähler structure .

Formal definition [ edit ] A Hermitian metric on a complex vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} over a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a smoothly varying positive-definite Hermitian form on each fiber. Such a metric can be viewed as a smooth global section h {\displaystyle h} of the vector bundle ( E ⊗ ⊗ E ¯ ¯ ) ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle (E\otimes {\overline {E}})^{*}} such that for every point p {\displaystyle p} in M {\displaystyle M} , h p ( η η , ζ ζ ¯ ¯ ) = h p ( ζ ζ , η η ¯ ¯ ) ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle h_{p}{\mathord {\left(\eta ,{\bar {\zeta }}\right)}}={\overline {h_{p}{\mathord {\left(\zeta ,{\bar {\eta }}\right)}}}}} for all ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , η η {\displaystyle \eta } in the fiber E p {\displaystyle E_{p}} and h p ( ζ ζ , ζ ζ ¯ ¯ ) > 0 {\displaystyle h_{p}{\mathord {\left(\zeta ,{\bar {\zeta }}\right)}}>0} for all nonzero ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } in E p {\displaystyle E_{p}} .

A Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold with a Hermitian metric on its holomorphic tangent bundle . Likewise, an almost Hermitian manifold is an almost complex manifold with a Hermitian metric on its holomorphic tangent bundle.

On a Hermitian manifold the metric can be written in local holomorphic coordinates ( z α α ) {\displaystyle (z^{\alpha })} as h = h α α β β ¯ ¯ d z α α ⊗ ⊗ d z ¯ ¯ β β {\displaystyle h=h_{\alpha {\bar {\beta }}}\,dz^{\alpha }\otimes d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }} where h α α β β ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle h_{\alpha {\bar {\beta }}}} are the components of a positive-definite Hermitian matrix .

Riemannian metric and associated form [ edit ] A Hermitian metric h on an (almost) complex manifold M defines a Riemannian metric g on the underlying smooth manifold. The metric g is defined to be the real part of h : g = 1 2 ( h + h ¯ ¯ ) .

{\displaystyle g={1 \over 2}\left(h+{\bar {h}}\right).} The form g is a symmetric bilinear form on TM C , the complexified tangent bundle. Since g is equal to its conjugate it is the complexification of a real form on TM . The symmetry and positive-definiteness of g on TM follow from the corresponding properties of h . In local holomorphic coordinates the metric g can be written g = 1 2 h α α β β ¯ ¯ ( d z α α ⊗ ⊗ d z ¯ ¯ β β + d z ¯ ¯ β β ⊗ ⊗ d z α α ) .

{\displaystyle g={1 \over 2}h_{\alpha {\bar {\beta }}}\,\left(dz^{\alpha }\otimes d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }+d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }\otimes dz^{\alpha }\right).} One can also associate to h a complex differential form ω of degree (1,1). The form ω is defined as minus the imaginary part of h : ω ω = i 2 ( h − − h ¯ ¯ ) .

{\displaystyle \omega ={i \over 2}\left(h-{\bar {h}}\right).} Again since ω is equal to its conjugate it is the complexification of a real form on TM . The form ω is called variously the associated (1,1) form , the fundamental form , or the Hermitian form . In local holomorphic coordinates ω can be written ω ω = i 2 h α α β β ¯ ¯ d z α α ∧ ∧ d z ¯ ¯ β β , {\displaystyle \omega ={i \over 2}h_{\alpha {\bar {\beta }}}\,dz^{\alpha }\wedge d{\bar {z}}^{\beta },} where d z α α ∧ ∧ d z ¯ ¯ β β = d z α α ⊗ ⊗ d z ¯ ¯ β β − − d z ¯ ¯ β β ⊗ ⊗ d z α α .

{\displaystyle dz^{\alpha }\wedge d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }=dz^{\alpha }\otimes d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }-d{\bar {z}}^{\beta }\otimes dz^{\alpha }.} It is clear from the coordinate representations that any one of the three forms h , g , and ω uniquely determine the other two. The Riemannian metric g and associated (1,1) form ω are related by the almost complex structure J as follows ω ω ( u , v ) = g ( J u , v ) g ( u , v ) = ω ω ( u , J v ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega (u,v)&=g(Ju,v)\\g(u,v)&=\omega (u,Jv)\end{aligned}}} for all complex tangent vectors u and v . The Hermitian metric h can be recovered from g and ω via the identity h = g − − i ω ω .

{\displaystyle h=g-i\omega .} All three forms h , g , and ω preserve the almost complex structure J . That is, h ( J u , J v ) = h ( u , v ) g ( J u , J v ) = g ( u , v ) ω ω ( J u , J v ) = ω ω ( u , v ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h(Ju,Jv)&=h(u,v)\\g(Ju,Jv)&=g(u,v)\\\omega (Ju,Jv)&=\omega (u,v)\end{aligned}}} for all complex tangent vectors u and v .

A Hermitian structure on an (almost) complex manifold M can therefore be specified by either a Hermitian metric h as above, a Riemannian metric g that preserves the almost complex structure J , or a nondegenerate 2-form ω which preserves J and is positive-definite in the sense that ω ( u , Ju ) > 0 for all nonzero real tangent vectors u .

Note that many authors call g itself the Hermitian metric.

Properties [ edit ] Every (almost) complex manifold admits a Hermitian metric. This follows directly from the analogous statement for Riemannian metric. Given an arbitrary Riemannian metric g on an almost complex manifold M one can construct a new metric g ′ compatible with the almost complex structure J in an obvious manner: g ′ ( u , v ) = 1 2 ( g ( u , v ) + g ( J u , J v ) ) .

{\displaystyle g'(u,v)={1 \over 2}\left(g(u,v)+g(Ju,Jv)\right).} Choosing a Hermitian metric on an almost complex manifold M is equivalent to a choice of U( n )-structure on M ; that is, a reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle of M from GL( n , C ) to the unitary group U( n ). A unitary frame on an almost Hermitian manifold is complex linear frame which is orthonormal with respect to the Hermitian metric. The unitary frame bundle of M is the principal U( n )-bundle of all unitary frames.

Every almost Hermitian manifold M has a canonical volume form which is just the Riemannian volume form determined by g . This form is given in terms of the associated (1,1)-form ω by v o l M = ω ω n n !

∈ ∈ Ω Ω n , n ( M ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {vol} _{M}={\frac {\omega ^{n}}{n!}}\in \Omega ^{n,n}(M)} where ω n is the wedge product of ω with itself n times. The volume form is therefore a real ( n , n )-form on M . In local holomorphic coordinates the volume form is given by v o l M = ( i 2 ) n det ( h α α β β ¯ ¯ ) d z 1 ∧ ∧ d z ¯ ¯ 1 ∧ ∧ ⋯ ⋯ ∧ ∧ d z n ∧ ∧ d z ¯ ¯ n .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {vol} _{M}=\left({\frac {i}{2}}\right)^{n}\det \left(h_{\alpha {\bar {\beta }}}\right)\,dz^{1}\wedge d{\bar {z}}^{1}\wedge \dotsb \wedge dz^{n}\wedge d{\bar {z}}^{n}.} One can also consider a hermitian metric on a holomorphic vector bundle .

Kähler manifolds [ edit ] The most important class of Hermitian manifolds are Kähler manifolds . These are Hermitian manifolds for which the Hermitian form ω is closed : d ω ω = 0 .

{\displaystyle d\omega =0\,.} In this case the form ω is called a Kähler form . A Kähler form is a symplectic form , and so Kähler manifolds are naturally symplectic manifolds .

An almost Hermitian manifold whose associated (1,1)-form is closed is naturally called an almost Kähler manifold . Any symplectic manifold admits a compatible almost complex structure making it into an almost Kähler manifold.

Integrability [ edit ] A Kähler manifold is an almost Hermitian manifold satisfying an integrability condition . This can be stated in several equivalent ways.

Let ( M , g , ω, J ) be an almost Hermitian manifold of real dimension 2 n and let ∇ be the Levi-Civita connection of g . The following are equivalent conditions for M to be Kähler: ω is closed and J is integrable, ∇ J = 0 , ∇ω = 0 , the holonomy group of ∇ is contained in the unitary group U( n ) associated to J , The equivalence of these conditions corresponds to the " 2 out of 3 " property of the unitary group .

In particular, if M is a Hermitian manifold, the condition dω = 0 is equivalent to the apparently much stronger conditions ∇ ω = ∇ J = 0 . The richness of Kähler theory is due in part to these properties.
