It was founded in 627 BC [ 4 ] by Greek settlers from Corinth and Corcyra (modern Corfu ).

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] and evolved into a significant political, commercial, and military hub throughout antiquity. Initially a Greek colony, it became a major Illyrian center, then a key Roman and Byzantine stronghold, before continuing its historical trajectory under later empires.

Greek period (7th century BC – 3rd century BC) [ edit ] Epidamnos was established in a strategic coastal location, facilitating maritime trade and interaction with the Illyrians, making it a vital trading hub between Greek city-states and local Taulantii tribe. The Taulantii tribe played a key role in the city's development, and evidence suggests a degree of cultural fusion between the Greek settlers and the indigenous Illyrians. Illyrians influenced the city but never ruled it independently.

Politically, Epidamnos was originally governed as an oligarchy, with power concentrated among the aristocracy. Allegedly, individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden and all traffic was through the authorized city agent or poletes .

[ citation needed ] . The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating the struggle between the two cities. These internal struggles led to broader regional conflicts, with Corcyra and Corinth intervening in Epidamnos' affairs, setting the stage for the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), as described by Thucydides .

Over time, internal conflicts led to a shift toward a more democratic system, as noted several times by Aristotle in Politics , who took Epidamnos as an example of governments with tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate.

In the fourth century BC the city-state was part of the kingdoms of Cassander and Pyrrhus . The general vicinity of Epidamnos was called Epidamnia .

[ 7 ] During the Hellenistic era, the city was briefly controlled by the Macedonian rulers Cassander and Pyrrhus of Epirus in the 4th century BC. Pyrrhus, one of the most formidable opponents of Rome, used Epidamnos as a strategic base in his campaigns.

Roman period (3rd century BC – 4th century AD) [ edit ] Epidamnos was seized by the Romans in 229 BC during their first campaign against Illyrian forces, the first Illyrian War , however, the city managed to maintain semi-autonomy and turned into a roman colony. Due to its strategic location along the Adriatic, Rome transformed the city into an important transit point, renaming it Dyrrachium to avoid the negative connotations of "Epidamnos" (which resembled the Latin word damnum , meaning "loss"). Despite this, the name Dyrrachion had already been used on local coins as early as the 5th century BC, due to the fact that in the Roman period, Dyrrachium was more common.

Pausanias (6.x.8) says "the modern Roman city is not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city is called Dyrrhachium from its founder." Dyrrachium played a crucial role as the main port for Roman travelers crossing the Ionian Sea from Brundisium (modern Brindisi) in Italy. It served as the starting point of the Via Egnatia , the major military and trade route connecting Roman Illyria with Macedonia and Thrace , leading to key cities such as Thessalonica and Byzantium (later Constantinople ).

In 48 BC, Dyrrachium became a battleground during the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Pompey successfully defended the city but failed to capitalize on his advantage, leading to his decisive defeat at Pharsalus. Under the Roman Empire, the city remained an important administrative center, and in AD 345, a devastating earthquake led to its reconstruction on its old foundations.

Byzantine and medieval period [ edit ] Dyrrachium became the capital of the newly established Roman province of Epirus Nova in the late 3rd century AD, reinforcing its religious and administrative importance. Its bishopric was elevated to a metropolitan see, overseeing the dioceses of the province. The city's fortifications were reinforced under Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century to defend against barbarian invasions.

In the 9th century, Emperor Nikephoros I reorganized the province as the Theme of Dyrrachium , an important Byzantine military district. The city served as a key stronghold against Slavic and Norman incursions, playing a pivotal role in the empire's defense of the Adriatic coast. The Normans, under Robert Guiscard, besieged and captured Dyrrachium in 1081, only for the Byzantines to reclaim it later.

Throughout the Middle Ages, control of Dyrrachium frequently shifted between the Byzantines, Venetians, and the Despotate of Epirus. The Byzantines continued to refer to the city by its original name, Epidamnus, as late as the 13th century, as recorded in the Synopsis Chronike .

[ 8 ] Legacy and modern significance [ edit ] Dyrrachium, now Durrës, remains one of Albania's most historically significant cities. Its ancient ruins, including remnants of Roman roads, an amphitheater, and Byzantine fortifications, stand as testaments to its rich and complex past. Its strategic location on the Adriatic continues to make it a crucial economic and cultural center in the region.
