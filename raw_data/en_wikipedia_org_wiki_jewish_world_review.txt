[ 2 ] [ 4 ] The founder and editor-in-chief, Binyamin L. Jolkovsky , is a rabbinical school graduate [ 5 ] and a former correspondent for Yated Ne'eman , an Israeli daily.

[ 6 ] In 2023, Jolkovsky claimed the site was now “among the oldest surviving non-corporate sites on the web." [ 7 ] Although the magazine is written to appeal to Orthodox Jews , Jolkovsky said he seeks a broader readership because "there are a lot of Christians who live Jewish values better than some Jews." [ 5 ] Regarding his magazine's political orientation, he said: "It is hard to understand a religious person who votes Democrat ...

Maimonides , the great Jewish philosopher, said there are ten levels of charity, tzedakah . The highest level is making a person self-sufficient, which sounds like what the GOP wants to do." [ 8 ] Political positions [ edit ] The magazine's first edition said it would not be "preachy or partisan ".

[ 9 ] It is described by the Center for Media and Democracy as "politically conservative and religiously-minded".
