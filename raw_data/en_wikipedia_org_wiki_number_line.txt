The order of the natural numbers shown on the number line

A **number line** is a graphical representation of a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") that serves as spatial representation of [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), usually graduated like a [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler "Ruler") with a particular [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(geometry) "Origin (geometry)") point representing the number [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero") and evenly spaced marks in either direction representing [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers"), imagined to extend infinitely. The association between numbers and [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") on the line links [arithmetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic "Elementary arithmetic") operations on numbers to [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") relations between points, and provides a conceptual framework for learning mathematics.

In [elementary mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_mathematics "Elementary mathematics"), the number line is initially used to teach [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction") of integers, especially involving [negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number"). As students progress, more kinds of numbers can be placed on the line, including [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction "Fraction"), [decimal fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_fraction "Decimal fraction"), [square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_roots "Square roots"), and [transcendental numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number "Transcendental number") such as the [circle constant π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi"): Every point of the number line corresponds to a unique [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), and every real number to a unique point.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-1)

Using a number line, numerical concepts can be interpreted geometrically and geometric concepts interpreted numerically. An [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics) "Inequality (mathematics)") between numbers corresponds to a left-or-right order relation between points. Numerical [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") are associated to geometrical [segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") of the line. Operations and [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") on numbers correspond to [geometric transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformations "Geometric transformations") of the line. Wrapping the line into a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") relates [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") to the geometric composition of [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"). Marking the line with [logarithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") spaced graduations associates [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") and [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)") with geometric [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"), the principle underlying the [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule "Slide rule"). In [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), [coordinate axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axis "Coordinate axis") are number lines which associate points in a geometric space with [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of numbers, so geometric shapes can be described using numerical [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") and numerical functions can be [graphed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function").

In advanced mathematics, the number line is usually called the **real line** or **real number line**, and is a geometric line [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of real numbers, with which it is often conflated; both the real numbers and the real line are commonly denoted **R** or ⁠![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)⁠. The real line is a one-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space"), so is sometimes denoted **R**1 when comparing it to higher-dimensional spaces. The real line is a one-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") using the difference between numbers to define the [distance between points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") on the line. It can also be thought of as a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), a [measure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space "Measure space"), or a [linear continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_continuum "Linear continuum"). The real line can be embedded in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"), used as a two-dimensional geometric representation of the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number").

The first mention of the number line used for operation purposes is found in [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis")'s _Treatise of Algebra_ (1685).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-2) In his treatise, Wallis describes addition and subtraction on a number line in terms of moving forward and backward, under the metaphor of a person walking.

An earlier depiction without mention to operations, though, is found in [John Napier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier "John Napier")'s _A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes_ (1616), which shows values 1 through 12 lined up from left to right.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-3)

Contrary to popular belief, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")'s original _[La Géométrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La\_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie "La Géométrie")_ does not feature a number line, defined as we use it today, though it does use a coordinate system. In particular, Descartes's work does not contain specific numbers mapped onto lines, only abstract quantities.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-4)

Drawing the number line
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Drawing the number line")]

A number line is usually represented as being [horizontal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane "Horizontal plane"), but in a [Cartesian coordinate plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") the vertical axis (y-axis) is also a number line.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-purple-5) The arrow on the line indicates the positive direction in which numbers increase.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line#cite_note-purple-5) Some textbooks attach an arrow to both sides, suggesting that the arrow indicates continuation. This is unnecessary, since according to the rules of geometry a line without endpoints continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. A line with one endpoint as a _ray_, and a line with two endpoints as a _line segment_.

If a particular number is farther to the right on the number line than is another number, then the first number is greater than the second (equivalently, the second is less than the first). The distance between them is the magnitude of their difference—that is, it measures the first number minus the second one, or equivalently the absolute value of the second number minus the first one. Taking this difference is the process of [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction").

Thus, for example, the length of a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") between 0 and some other number represents the magnitude of the latter number.

Two numbers can be [added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Added "Added") by "picking up" the length from 0 to one of the numbers, and putting it down again with the end that was 0 placed on top of the other number.

Two numbers can be [multiplied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplied "Multiplied") as in this example: To multiply 5 × 3, note that this is the same as 5 + 5 + 5, so pick up the length from 0 to 5 and place it to the right of 5, and then pick up that length again and place it to the right of the previous result. This gives a result that is 3 combined lengths of 5 each; since the process ends at 15, we find that 5 × 3 = 15.

[Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)") can be performed as in the following example: To divide 6 by 2—that is, to find out how many times 2 goes into 6—note that the length from 0 to 2 lies at the beginning of the length from 0 to 6; pick up the former length and put it down again to the right of its original position, with the end formerly at 0 now placed at 2, and then move the length to the right of its latest position again. This puts the right end of the length 2 at the right end of the length from 0 to 6. Since three lengths of 2 filled the length 6, 2 goes into 6 three times (that is, 6 ÷ 2 = 3).

Portions of the number line
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Portions of the number line")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Intervalo_real_04.svg/250px-Intervalo_real_04.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Intervalo_real_04.svg)

The closed interval [a,b].

The section of the number line between two numbers is called an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)"). If the section includes both numbers it is said to be a closed interval, while if it excludes both numbers it is called an open interval. If it includes one of the numbers but not the other one, it is called a half-open interval.

All the points extending forever in one direction from a particular point are together known as a [ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(mathematics) "Ray (mathematics)"). If the ray includes the particular point, it is a closed ray; otherwise it is an open ray.

Extensions of the concept
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Extensions of the concept")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/LogLog_exponentials.svg/250px-LogLog_exponentials.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LogLog_exponentials.svg)

A log-log plot of _y_=_x_(blue), _y_=_x_ 2(green), and _y_=_x_ 3(red).

Note the logarithmic scale markings on each of the axes, and that the log _x_ and log _y_ axes (where the logarithms are 0) are where _x_ and _y_ themselves are 1.

On the number line, the distance between two points is the unit length if and only if the difference of the represented numbers equals 1. Other choices are possible.

One of the most common choices is the _logarithmic scale_, which is a representation of the _positive_ numbers on a line, such that the distance of two points is the unit length, if the ratio of the represented numbers has a fixed value, typically 10. In such a logarithmic scale, the origin represents 1; one inch to the right, one has 10, one inch to the right of 10 one has 10×10 = 100, then 10×100 = 1000 = 10 3, then 10×1000 = 10,000 = 10 4, etc. Similarly, one inch to the left of 1, one has 1/10 = 10–1, then 1/100 = 10–2, etc.

This approach is useful, when one wants to represent, on the same figure, values with very different [order of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude "Order of magnitude"). For example, one requires a logarithmic scale for representing simultaneously the size of the different bodies that exist in the [Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), typically, a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), a [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), a [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human"), the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"), and the visible Universe.

Logarithmic scales are used in [slide rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule "Slide rule") for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on logarithmic scales.

### Combining number lines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Combining number lines")]

A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the [imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number "Imaginary number"). This line, called [imaginary line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_line_(mathematics) "Imaginary line (mathematics)"), extends the number line to a [complex number plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number_plane "Complex number plane"), with points representing [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number").

Alternatively, one real number line can be drawn horizontally to denote possible values of one real number, commonly called _x_, and another real number line can be drawn vertically to denote possible values of another real number, commonly called _y_. Together these lines form what is known as a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), and any point in the plane represents the value of a pair of real numbers. Further, the Cartesian coordinate system can itself be extended by visualizing a third number line "coming out of the screen (or page)", measuring a third variable called _z_. Positive numbers are closer to the viewer's eyes than the screen is, while negative numbers are "behind the screen"; larger numbers are farther from the screen. Then any point in the three-dimensional space that we live in represents the values of a trio of real numbers.

### As a linear continuum

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: As a linear continuum")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Illustration_of_supremum.svg/250px-Illustration_of_supremum.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_of_supremum.svg)

Each set on the real number line has a supremum.

The real line is a [linear continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_continuum "Linear continuum") under the standard < ordering. Specifically, the real line is [linearly ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_ordered "Linearly ordered") by <, and this ordering is [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_order "Dense order") and has the [least-upper-bound property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-upper-bound_property "Least-upper-bound property").

In addition to the above properties, the real line has no [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element "Greatest element") or [minimum element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_element "Least element"). It also has a [countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable "Countable")[dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set "Dense set")[subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset"), namely the set of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"). It is a theorem that any linear continuum with a countable dense subset and no maximum or minimum element is [order-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-isomorphic "Order-isomorphic") to the real line.

The real line also satisfies the [countable chain condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_chain_condition "Countable chain condition"): every collection of mutually [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets"), [nonempty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonempty "Nonempty") open [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") in **R** is countable. In [order theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory "Order theory"), the famous [Suslin problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suslin_problem "Suslin problem") asks whether every linear continuum satisfying the countable chain condition that has no maximum or minimum element is necessarily order-isomorphic to **R**. This statement has been shown to be [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic) "Independence (mathematical logic)") of the standard axiomatic system of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") known as [ZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC "ZFC").

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Absolute_difference.svg/250px-Absolute_difference.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Absolute_difference.svg)

The [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") on the real line is [absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference "Absolute difference").

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Epsilon_Umgebung.svg/250px-Epsilon_Umgebung.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epsilon_Umgebung.svg)

An _ε_-[ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") around a number _a_

The real line forms a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), with the [distance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_function "Distance function") given by absolute difference:

![Image 15: {\displaystyle d(x,y)=|x-y|.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/407bd64e1184ff03e4394a2d6276cc0d8e9a8f15)
The [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") is clearly the 1-dimensional [Euclidean metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric "Euclidean metric"). Since the n-dimensional Euclidean metric can be represented in matrix form as the n-by-n identity matrix, the metric on the real line is simply the 1-by-1 identity matrix, i.e. 1.

If _p_ ∈ **R** and _ε_> 0, then the ε-[ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") in **R** centered at p is simply the open [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)")(_p_ − _ε_, _p_ + _ε_).

This real line has several important properties as a metric space:

*   The real line is a [complete metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space "Complete metric space"), in the sense that any [Cauchy sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence") of points converges.
*   The real line is [path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path-connected "Path-connected") and is one of the simplest examples of a [geodesic metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_metric_space "Geodesic metric space").
*   The [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension") of the real line is equal to one.

### As a topological space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_line&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: As a topological space")]

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Real_Projective_Line_%28RP1%29.png/250px-Real_Projective_Line_%28RP1%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Real_Projective_Line_(RP1).png)

The real line can be [compactified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(mathematics) "Compactification (mathematics)") by adding a [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity").

The real line carries a standard [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), which can be introduced in two different, equivalent ways. First, since the real numbers are [totally ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_ordered "Totally ordered"), they carry an [order topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology "Order topology"). Second, the real numbers inherit a [metric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_topology "Metric topology") from the metric defined above. The order topology and metric topology on **R** are the same. As a topological space, the real line is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to the open interval (0, 1).

The real line is trivially a [topological manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_manifold "Topological manifold") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)"). Up to homeomorphism, it is one of only two different connected 1-manifolds without [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_with_boundary "Manifold with boundary"), the other being the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"). It also has a standard differentiable structure on it, making it a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). (Up to [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism"), there is only one differentiable structure that the topological space supports.)

The real line is a [locally compact space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space "Locally compact space") and a [paracompact space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracompact_space "Paracompact space"), as well as [second-countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable "Second-countable") and [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space "Normal space"). It is also [path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path-connected "Path-connected"), and is therefore [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") as well, though it can be disconnected by removing any one point. The real line is also [contractible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible "Contractible"), and as such all of its [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group "Homotopy group") and [reduced homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_homology "Reduced homology") groups are zero.

As a locally compact space, the real line can be compactified in several different ways. The [one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-point_compactification "One-point compactification") of **R** is a circle (namely, the [real projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line "Real projective line")), and the extra point can be thought of as an unsigned infinity. Alternatively, the real line has two [ends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(topology) "End (topology)"), and the resulting end compactification is the [extended real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line "Extended real number line")[−∞, +∞]. There is also the [Stone–Čech compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification "Stone–Čech compactification") of the real line, which involves adding an infinite number of additional points.

In some contexts, it is helpful to place other topologies on the set of real numbers, such as the [lower limit topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limit_topology "Lower limit topology") or the [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology"). For the real numbers, the latter is the same as the [finite complement topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_complement_topology "Finite complement topology").

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Bijection_between_vectors_and_points_on_number_line.svg/250px-Bijection_between_vectors_and_points_on_number_line.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bijection_between_vectors_and_points_on_number_line.svg)

The bijection between points on the real line and vectors

The real line is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over the [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")**R** of real numbers (that is, over itself) of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)"). It has the usual multiplication as an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product"), making it a [Euclidean vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector_space "Euclidean vector space"). The [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)") defined by this inner product is simply the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value").

The real line carries a canonical [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)"), namely the [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure "Lebesgue measure"). This measure can be defined as the [completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_measure "Complete measure") of a [Borel measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_measure "Borel measure") defined on **R**, where the measure of any interval is the length of the interval.

Lebesgue measure on the real line is one of the simplest examples of a [Haar measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure "Haar measure") on a [locally compact group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_group "Locally compact group").

When _A_ is a unital [real algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field"), the products of real numbers with 1 is a real line within the algebra. For example, in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane")_z_ = _x_ + i _y_, the subspace {_z_: _y_ = 0} is a real line. Similarly, the algebra of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")

_q_ = _w_ + _x_ i + _y_ j + _z_ k
has a real line in the subspace {_q_: _x_ = _y_ = _z_ = 0}.

When the real algebra is a [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum_of_modules "Direct sum of modules")![Image 18: {\displaystyle A=R\oplus V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5ea37f23b0f6e0f7bee536ceb6053c51f914dbc) then a **conjugation** on _A_ is introduced by the mapping ![Image 19: {\displaystyle v\to -v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25440ff911a74e42a9ee7acc5a4b490fcf42bb0a) of subspace _V_. In this way the real line consists of the [fixed points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics) "Fixed point (mathematics)") of the conjugation.

For a dimension _n_, the [square matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrices "Square matrices") form a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") that has a real line in the form of real products with the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix") in the ring.
