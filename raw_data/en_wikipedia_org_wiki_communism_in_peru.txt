Throughout the movement's history, a number of parties, movements and organisations in the country have referred to themselves by the name of " communist party ". The oldest to do so is the Peruvian Communist Party ( Partido Comunista Peruano , PCP), originally founded in 1928 as the Peruvian Socialist Party (PSP) by Marxist philosopher and journalist José Carlos Mariátegui . The 1960s brought about the emergence of splinter groups up until the 21st century. One of these groups, commonly known as the Shining Path (PCP-SL), waged an insurgency against the Peruvian State that resulted in a 20-year period of violence that took place from 1980 to 2000, while its splinter groups have continued to operate from 2001 onwards.

History [ edit ] The first Peruvian political party to adopt communism as an ideology was the Peruvian Communist Party ( Partido Comunista Peruano , PCP). It was originally founded as the Peruvian Socialist Party (PSP) in 1928 by a group of nine socialist sympathisers (known as the "Group of Lima"), which included Marxist philosopher and journalist José Carlos Mariátegui , [ 1 ] and formally changed its name in 1930, following Mariátegui's death and his succession by Eudocio Ravines [ es ] as party leader.

Following a period of outright illegality, the group gradually incorporated itself into the legal political scene during the 1960s, which led to the disappointment with its so-called bureaucratic and collaborationist character, believing that guerrilla warfare was the only path to the establishment of a socialist state . In 1962, a faction split and formed the National Liberation Army (ELN) a year later, which led such a military campaign until its defeat by 1965.

Peruvian reception for Marxism was increased by the 1959 victory of the Cuban revolution and the Fidel Castro 's declaration following Cuba post- Bay of Pigs invasion declaration that he was a Marxist-Leninist and always would be.

[ 2 ] : 132 Fernando Belaúnde Terry 's administration was tolerant of the political left, and a variety of Marxist parties expanded during his time in office.

[ 2 ] : 132–133 In 1963, the ongoing Sino-Soviet split separated the PCP into two rival factions, one pro-Soviet and the other pro-Chinese . The latter subsequently split from the Peruvian Communist Party in January 1964 and adopted the name Peruvian Communist Party – Red Flag (PCP-BR).

[ 3 ] The party was originally led by Saturnino Paredes , José Sotomayor , and Abimael Guzmán .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Due to internal disagreements among the party's three leaders, the party expelled several of its members in its early history. Two parties subsequently emerged from a 1969 split in the party: the Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland (PCP-PR) and the Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path (PCP-SL) [ a ] led by Guzmán. Afterwards, Paredes became the party's sole leader and renamed the party "Peruvian Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist)". In response to the Sino-Albanian split , the party dropped its commitment to Maoism and aligned itself with the Party of Labour of Albania and Hoxhaism . In 1978, the "PCP-Mayoría" faction split from the PCP to form a more pro-Soviet branch, as it considered that the PCP had adopted Eurocommunism instead, operating until the 1980s.

The elections of 1980 formally ended the so-called Revolutionary Government of Francisco Morales Bermúdez , who had seized power from Juan Velasco Alvarado through a military coup in 1975. The previously banned socialist and communist parties participated in the elections, leading to the PCP attaining five seats in the constituent assembly, while left-wing groups as a whole achieved an important presence and united to form the United Left alliance, which formed one of the country's main political forces during the 1980s.

In contrast to the aforementioned legal route of the political left, Guzmán's PCP-SL began its war against the Peruvian government by burning ballots in Chuschi , a town in rural Ayacucho . Guzmán's faction considered the political left as revisionists , openly and actively opposing them through its period of insurgency . The Shining Path's leadership was captured and arrested by the Special Intelligence Group in 1992, and entered amnesty talks the following year. Rump factions of the group that opposed the peace talks have since continued a low-intensity insurgency that continues to this day, allying themselves with narcoterrorist groups in rural parts of the country, notably the Valle de los Ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM).

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the PCP and other communist parties in Peru have since participated at a much smaller level in the country's politics, mainly through broad left-wing political alliances.
