Cross swell at Île de Ré , France. The waves themselves are examples of cnoidal waves .

Cross sea near Lisbon , Portugal.

A cross sea (also referred to as a squared sea or square waves ) is a sea state of wind-generated ocean waves that form nonparallel wave systems. Cross seas have a large amount of directional spreading.

[ 1 ] This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind . Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old.

Two weather systems that are far from each other may create a cross sea when the waves from the systems meet at a place far from either weather system. Until the older waves have dissipated, they can present a perilous sea hazard.

[ 2 ] This sea state is fairly common and a large percentage of ship accidents have been found to occur in this state.

[ 3 ] Vessels fare better against large waves when sailing directly perpendicular to oncoming surf. In a cross sea scenario, that becomes impossible as sailing into one set of waves necessitates sailing parallel to the other.

[ 4 ] Cross seas present a particular hazard for small boats and swimmers, since they can generate rip currents and waves up to 10 feet (3 m).

[ 5 ] A cross swell is generated when the wave systems are longer-period swells , rather than short-period wind-generated waves.
