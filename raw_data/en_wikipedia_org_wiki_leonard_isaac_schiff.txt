He was a physicist best known for his book Quantum Mechanics , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] originally published in 1949 [ 4 ] (a second edition appeared in 1955 and a third in 1968).

Education [ edit ] Leonard Schiff entered Ohio State University at age 14.

[ 5 ] Schiff received his B.S. & M.S. (working under L. H. Thomas ) from Ohio State University and his doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937 under Philip M. Morse with thesis Theory of the Collision of Light Elements .

[ 6 ] Career [ edit ] Schiff was a theoretical physicist who, after completing his doctorate, worked as a research associate for two years at the University of California and the California Institute of Technology . From 1940 to 1945 he was a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania . From 1945 to 1947, he worked at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and joined the physics faculty at Stanford University in 1947.

[ 7 ] In 1948, Schiff became one of the initial directors of Varian Associates who provided technical support to the company, along with Edward Ginzton , William Hansen , and Marvin Chodorow .

[ 8 ] In 1959 and 1960 Schiff and fellow physicist George Pugh wrote papers which advocated using orbiting gyroscopes to test general relativity . Schiff teamed with fellow Stanford faculty Bob Cannon and Bill Fairbank to conduct research that provided part of the foundation for the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) to test Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He was the first chairman of the Faculty Senate at Stanford.

[ 11 ] Family [ edit ] Leonard Schiff was the son of Edward and Mathilda Schiff and was of Lithuanian Jewish descent.

[ 5 ] He married Francis Ballard in 1941.

[ 12 ] They were the parents of two children:  Leonard Schiff and Ellen Schiff.  His wife was a cousin of Artemus Ginzton, the wife of Schiff's friend and colleague Edward Ginzton .

[ 5 ] Recognition [ edit ] Schiff became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1939.

[ 13 ] He was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1957.

[ 14 ] In 1966, he received the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers .

[ 2 ] Also, he received the Dinkelspiel Award for Excellence in Teaching at Stanford University .

[ 15 ] Schiff Hall, an undergraduate dormitory at Stanford, is named for him.
