( BCG ) is an American global management consulting firm founded in 1963 and headquartered in Boston , Massachusetts.

[ 3 ] It is one of the " Big Three " (or MBB, the world's three largest management consulting firms by revenue) along with McKinsey & Company and Bain & Company . Since 2021, BCG has been led by the German executive Christoph Schweizer.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] The firm was founded in 1963 as part of The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company.

Bruce Henderson had been recruited from Arthur D. Little to establish the consulting arm operating as a subsidiary under the name Management and Consulting Division of the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Initially the division only advised clients of the bank, with billings for the first month at just US$500. Henderson hired his second consultant, Arthur P. Contas, in December 1963.

[ 7 ] In 1966, BCG opened its second office in Tokyo, Japan.

[ 8 ] In 1967, Henderson met Bill Bain and offered him a role at the firm. Bain agreed and joined in 1967 at a starting salary of $17,000 per year.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In the early 1970s, Bain was considered internally to be Henderson's eventual successor. However, in 1973 Bain resigned from BCG to start his own strategy consulting firm, Bain & Company , hiring away six of BCG's employees.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 1974, Henderson arranged an employee stock ownership plan so that the employees could make the company independent from The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. The buyout of all shares was completed in 1979.

[ 12 ] In the 1970s, BCG created and popularized the "growth–share matrix," a chart to help large corporations decide how to allocate cash among their business units. The corporation would categorize its business units as "Stars," "Cash Cows," "Question Marks," or "Dogs," and then allocate cash accordingly, moving money from "Cash Cows" toward "Stars" and "Question Marks," which have higher market growth rates and hence greater upside potential.

[ 13 ] The BCG growth-share matrix Main article: Growth–share matrix In the 1980s, BCG introduced the concept of time-based competition that reconsidered the role of time management in providing market advantages. The concept was the subject of an essay in the Harvard Business Review .

[ 14 ] In May 2021, the firm elected Christoph Schweizer as CEO, replacing Rich Lesser who would step down and serve as the firm's Global Chair.

[ 15 ] In 2022, Boston Consulting Group released its "2022 Annual Sustainability Report" highlighting numerous initiatives focused on societal and planetary impact. Since 2015, the progress in numbers is 30% less greenhouse gas emissions, 20% less water usage, 15% less waste generation, and 10% less energy consumption.

[ 16 ] BCG typically hires for an associate or a consultant position, recruiting from top undergraduate colleges , advanced degree programs  and business schools .

[ 17 ] Controversy [ edit ] This "criticism" or "controversy" section may compromise the article's neutrality .

( April 2025 ) Angola [ edit ] An article published by The New York Times on January 19, 2020, identified the Boston Consulting Group as having worked with Isabel dos Santos , who exploited Angola's natural resources while the country suffers from poverty, illiteracy, and infant mortality.

[ 18 ] According to the article, BCG was contracted by the Angolan state-owned petroleum company Sonangol , as well as the jewelry company De Grisogono , owned by her husband through shell companies in Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands; the firm was reportedly paid through offshore companies in tax havens such as Malta.

[ 18 ] Palestine [ edit ] Involvement with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and Subsequent Fallout [ edit ] Between October 2024 and May 2025 BCG helped design and run the business operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] which in turn has been linked to US-based private security firms, and is being investigated over the identity of its donors.

[ 21 ] In June 2025, BCG terminated its contract with the GHF. It had said that the work was done "pro bono" but The Washington Post reported that BCG submitted invoices of over $1 million per month.

[ 22 ] BCG then fired two senior partners, calling the work they oversaw for GHF "unauthorized".

[ 23 ] The two senior partners dismissed by BCG were Matt Schlueter and Ryan Ordway, both from the firm’s U.S. defense and security practice, who did not disclose the full nature of their engagement and oversaw the GHF work without authorization.

[ 24 ] It was later revealed by the Financial Times that BCG's work was more extensive than previously disclosed, covering more than $4 million of contracted work. It also included modeling work on the postwar reconstruction of Gaza, including cost estimates for giving hundreds of thousands of Gazans 'relocation packages' worth $9,000 per person in exchange for them leaving the territory.

[ 20 ] Save the Children suspended its partnership with BCG as a result of BCG's work with the GHF and for "modelling a plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians from Gaza".

[ 25 ] Involvement in Gaza redevelopment proposal [ edit ] See also: Donald Trump's Gaza Strip proposal In 2025, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was reported to have contributed financial modelling to a controversial postwar redevelopment proposal for the Gaza Strip. The proposal, referred to as the Great Trust, was initiated by a group of Israeli businessmen and presented to the Trump administration. It envisioned transforming Gaza into a regional trading and industrial hub, with speculative projects such as a "Trump Riviera" and an "Elon Musk Smart Manufacturing Zone".

[ 26 ] As part of its involvement, BCG consultants modelled various redevelopment and resettlement scenarios, including a proposal to offer financial incentives for up to 500,000 Palestinians to voluntarily relocate from Gaza. A confidential spreadsheet created by the firm explored potential destination countries such as Somalia , the breakaway region of Somaliland , the United Arab Emirates , Egypt , and Jordan . These assumptions aligned with reports at the time that the U.S. and Israeli governments had informally approached East African countries about accepting Palestinian refugees. The relocation component was widely condemned; United Nations officials likened it to ethnic cleansing, and several European governments criticized the concept. Egypt and other Arab states also firmly rejected the idea, citing concerns over permanent resettlement and domestic instability.

[ 27 ] The episode led to parliamentary scrutiny in the UK, as well as a broader reassessment of BCG’s role in international aid and reconstruction efforts. The World Food Programme also reviewed its collaboration with the firm following revelations about its involvement in the Gaza proposal.

[ 28 ] Saudi Arabia [ edit ] The New York Times also reported that Boston Consulting Group is one of the consulting firms, along with McKinsey and Booz Allen , helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate power in Saudi Arabia .

[ 29 ] While a BCG spokesperson said the firm turns down projects involving military and intelligence strategy, BCG is involved in designing the economic blueprint for the country, a plan called Vision 2030 .

[ 29 ] In June 2021, BCG was hired to examine the feasibility for the country to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup . The bid was assessed to be a great deal, as FIFA 's policy of continental rotation blocked all the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) nations from hosting the World Cup until 2034, after Qatar was set to become the first Middle Eastern nation to host the tournament in 2022.

[ 30 ] Saudi Arabia would eventually receive hosting rights for the 2034 FIFA World Cup instead.

In 2024, BCG consulting heads were summoned to appear before congress to disclose financial details between them and Saudi Arabia and warned staff that they could face jail time if they reveal information.

[ 31 ] Sweden [ edit ] Boston Consulting Group has received criticism for its involvement in the construction of the New Karolinska Solna University Hospital after an investigation by Dagens Nyheter . Specifically, the potential conflict of interest where a former BCG employee and then hospital executive approved numerous expenses without proper receipts and the high cost paid for external consultants including BCG.

[ 32 ] In the investigative journalism book Konsulterna - Kampen om Karolinska (roughly The Consultants - The Struggle for the Karolinska University Hospital ), the authors and Dagens Nyheter journalists Anna Gustavsson and Lisa Röstlund argue that the value-based health care model as recommended by BCG had not been properly investigated and have resulted in an exponential growth in administration and lack of responsibility for patients.

[ 33 ] United States [ edit ] In 2022, BCG filed a lawsuit against GameStop as the latter allegedly denied payment of fee worth $30 million for a project. GameStop argued that it saw it is in the best interest of its stakeholders to deny payment as BCG brought little improvement to the EBITDA of the company, which the consultancy allegedly promised to improve. BCG counter argued that the company has delivered more than it promised in statement of proposal and that the quoted variable fee was based on the "projected," not realized, improvement in EBITDA, as per the contract.

[ 34 ] On July 30, 2024 the suit was concluded in a joint dismissal.
