Archaeological investigations have revealed that the Cistercian monks of the nearby Rievaulx Abbey had a large woolhouse there, dating from the middle of the 13th century.

The Cistercian monks, known to have been skilled metallurgists , also had a blast furnace (the only medieval example yet identified in Britain ) for the smelting of iron ore into cast iron . The iron ore left in the slag at Laskill has been identified by Gerry McDonnell (archeometallurgist of the University of Bradford ) as more refined than anything else at the time, suggesting a much more efficient blast furnace technology than otherwise existed – perhaps as advanced as a modern blast furnace.  The destruction of the abbey at Rievaulx by King Henry VIII during the Reformation put an end to this blast furnace and its advanced technology .  Had the monks been allowed to share their new blast furnace techniques, which they frequently did with other advancements, the world might have entered the Industrial Revolution a full two and a half centuries earlier.
