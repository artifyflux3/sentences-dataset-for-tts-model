The logarithmic y -axis shows performance in G FLOPS .

Combined performance of 500 largest supercomputers Fastest supercomputer Supercomputer in 500th place Share of operating systems families in TOP500 supercomputers by time trend Usage share of web browsers in November 2020 according to StatCounter 2025 [ edit ] AI [ edit ] On January 14, the New York Times , The New York Daily News , and the Center of Investigative Reporting have a hearing in a combined lawsuit against OpenAI .

[ 1 ] OpenAI develops a model called "GPT 4b-micro", which suggests ways that protein factors could be re-engineered to become more effective.

[ 2 ] DeepSeek releases DeepSeek-R1 on 20th January, a large language model based on DeepSeek-V3 utilising a chain-of-thought process similar to OpenAI o1 .

[ 3 ] 2024 [ edit ] AI [ edit ] An AI-based study shows for the first time that fingerprints from different fingers of the same person share strong detectable similarities.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] A preprint trial suggests large language models could be used for tailored manipulation , being more persuasive than humans when using personal information.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Notable innovations: LAION releases a first version of BUD-E , a fully open source voice assistant , [ 8 ] an automatic waste sorting system that can distinguish between over 500 waste categories is released, [ 9 ] researchers describe an AI ecosystem interface of foundation models connected to many APIs as specialized subtask-solvers, [ 10 ] the chatbot Grok is made open source to a substantial extent.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Hardware [ edit ] Researchers describe an approach for an optical disk with petabit capacity, [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Internet penetration [ edit ] According to the International Telecommunication Union , the global Internet population reached 5.5 billion in 2024, meaning more than two-thirds of the world's population is now online.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] 2023 [ edit ] AI [ edit ] Further information: Generative artificial intelligence Combining GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion to generate art from sketches [ 17 ] Chatbot and text-generating AI, ChatGPT (released on 30 Nov 2022), a large language model , became popular, with some considering the large public's attention as unwarranted hype as potential applications are limited. Similar software such as Cleverbot existed for many years, and the software is, on the fundamental level, not structured toward accuracy – e.g. providing seemingly credible but incorrect answers to queries and operating "without a contextual understanding of the language " – but only toward essentially the authenticity of mimicked human language.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] It was estimated that only two months after its launch, it had 100 million active users.

[ 23 ] Applications may include solving or supporting school writing assignments, [ 24 ] malicious social bots (e.g. for misinformation , propaganda, and scams), [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and providing inspiration (e.g.

for artistic writing or in design or ideation in general).

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Google released chatbot Bard due to effects of the ChatGPT release, [ 29 ] with potential for integration into its Web search and, like ChatGPT software, also as a software development helper tool .

[ 30 ] DuckDuckGo released the DuckAssist feature integrated into its search engine that summarizes information from Wikipedia to answer search queries that are questions. The experimental feature was shut down without explanation on 12 April.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] There has been further development regarding LLMs or ChatGPT as user interfaces of Wikipedia or as software using its structured knowledge by others.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] It may demonstrate an alternative approach to ChatGPT whose fundamental algorithms are not designed to generate text that is true, including for example " hallucinations " and fake citations or misinformation more generally.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Elicit.org may provide a free alternative to this tool.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] A broader alternative approach to the software's Q&A applications and use of text generation for assignments may be the improvement of media literacy and Web search skills in education systems.

Further LLM developments during what has been called an " AI boom " included: local or open source versions of LLaMA which was leaked in March, [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] news outlets reported on GPT4-based Auto-GPT that given natural language commands uses the Internet and other tools in attempts to understand and achieve its tasks with unclear or so-far little practicality, [ 43 ] a systematic evaluation of answers from four "generative search engines" suggested their outputs "appear informative, but frequently contain unsupported statements and inaccurate citations", [ 44 ] a multi-modal open source tool for understanding and generating speech, [ 45 ] a data scientist argued that "researchers need to collaborate to develop open-source LLMs that are transparent " and independent, [ 46 ] Stability AI launched an open source LLM.

[ 47 ] A method for editing NeRF scenes, a novel media technique from 2020, [ 48 ] with natural language commands was demonstrated by Nvidia.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] An open letter " Pause Giant AI Experiments " initiated by the Future of Life Institute called for "AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4" due to "profound risks to society and humanity".

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] It received substantial media attention and also contributed to speculations about perceived large LLM potential). At the time there was extensive media coverage of views that regard ChatGPT as a potential step towards AGI or sentient machines, also extending to some academic works (e.g. a popular preprint by a company).

[ 17 ] The coverage focused on such views may not represent the majority expert views and, for example, some researchers noted that e.g. the ability to generate coherent text and imitations are not the same as understanding language.

[ 53 ] A set of techniques under development included self-refining code or text.

[ 54 ] ChatGPT was shown to outperform human doctors in responding to online medical questions when measured on quality and empathy by "a team of licensed health care professionals", [ 55 ] [ 56 ] albeit the chatbot may have previously been trained with these reddit question and answers threads .

News outlets reported on a preprint that described the development of a large language model software that can answer medical questions with a 67.6% accuracy on MedQA and nearly matched human clinician performance when answering open-ended medical questions, Med-PaLM. The AI makes use of comprehension-, recall of knowledge-, and medical reasoning -algorithms but remains inferior to clinicians.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] As of 2023, humans often – if not most often – conduct query-based web searches, read websites and/or conduct physical doctor's visits to inquire health information, despite various difficulties, [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] partly as they typically did not undergo any formal training in media literacy , [ 64 ] digital literacy [ 65 ] [ 66 ] or health literacy , [ 67 ] as such is not part of schools curricula in most education systems as of 2023.

[ 67 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] A novel potentially significantly more efficient text-to-image approach, as implemented in MUSE, was reported.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] A use of world models for a wide range of domains that make decisions using e.g. different 3D worlds and reward frequencies and outperforms previous approaches, DreamerV3, was reported as a step towards general artificial intelligence in a preprint.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] A large language model , ProGen, that can generate functional protein sequences with a predictable function, with input including tags specifying protein properties, was reported.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] A deep-learning model, ZFDesign, for zinc finger design for any genomic target for gene- and epigenetic -editing was reported.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] Software for generating 3D dynamic scenes ( text-to-4D ), MAV3D , was reported.

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] A study reported the development of deep learning algorithms to identify technosignature candidates, finding 8 potential alien signals not detected earlier.

[ 83 ] [ 84 ] An international norms and arms control proposal for artificial intelligence in the military (such as LAWs and weapons decision-making), the " Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy ]", was published by the U.S. government.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] The first international summit on military AI led to a joint unbinding statement by the U.S., China and other nations , with some external calls for starting negotiations on an internationally binding law or an enforcement -mechanisms-driven law.

[ 88 ] The world's first COVID-19 drug designed by generative AI was approved for human use, with clinical trials expected to begin in China. The new drug, ISM3312, was developed by Insilico Medicine .

[ 89 ] The LLM GPT-4 was launched by OpenAI .

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] It and ChatGPT based on it continued to receive major global media attention.

[ 92 ] Google revealed PaLM-E , an embodied multimodal language model with 562 billion parameters.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] AI Descartes system overview [ 95 ] Researchers demonstrated an open source ' AI scientist ' that can create models of natural phenomena from knowledge axioms and experimental data, showing the software can rediscover physical laws like "Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption" using logical reasoning and a few data points.

[ 96 ] [ 95 ] The fMRI machine used for brain-reading Researchers demonstrated a non-invasive brain-reading method. It can translate a person's neural activity into a continuous stream of text using fMRI data and transformer machine learning . Prior training data is required for this semantic decoding. Participants listened to stories for 16 hours while their brain activity was recorded.

[ 97 ] A new AI algorithm developed by Baidu was shown to boost the antibody response of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by 128 times.

[ 98 ] Outline of the study's open source virtual brain model [ 99 ] Computational neuroscientists showed that people with higher intelligence scores in HCP cognitive tests took more time to solve difficult problems and that their higher synchrony between brain areas allowed for better integration of evidence (or progress) from preceding working memory sub-problem processing. Reducing synchrony in " avatar " simulations , that were adjusted and tuned towards personalization , "led decision-making circuits to quickly jump to conclusions". Their codified results may be useful for an understanding of cognition to replicate or imitate in bio-inspired computing .

[ 100 ] [ 99 ] AI was used to develop an experimental antibiotic called abaucin , which is shown to be effective against A. baumannii .

[ 101 ] A machine learning model is trained to recognise the key features of chemicals with senolytic activity. It finds three chemicals – ginkgetin, periplocin and oleandrin – able to remove senescent cells without damaging healthy cells.

[ 102 ] [ 103 ] Articles in science outlets like Nature suggest contemporary viral concerns about hypothetical existential risk of AI "plays into the tech companies' agenda" – partly in the form of 'criti-hype' [ 104 ] – and that this "hinders effective regulation of the societal harms AI is causing right now" and in the near-future.

[ 105 ] A science writer provides an overview of "the nascent industry of AI-designed drugs ".

[ 161 ] [ 162 ] In April, Twitter was warned by EU digital policy-makers after a report indicated its recent policies "boost" Russian disinformation-based propaganda.

[ 163 ] One of the first empirical studies on what real users are shown during their typical use of popular Web search engines interpreted its results to show that choices for unreliable news sources for their queries are driven primarily by users' own choices and less by the engine's algorithms. The Web scientists linked their findings to the concept of filter bubbles which emphasizes the role of design- [ 164 ] and personalization algorithms.
