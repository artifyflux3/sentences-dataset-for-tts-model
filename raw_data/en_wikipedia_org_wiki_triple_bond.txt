Triple bonds are stronger than the equivalent single bonds or double bonds , with a bond order of three. The most common triple bond is in a nitrogen N 2 molecule; the second most common is that between two carbon atoms, which can be found in alkynes . Other functional groups containing a triple bond are cyanides and isocyanides . Some diatomic molecules, such as diphosphorus [ 1 ] and carbon monoxide , are also triple bonded. In skeletal formulae the triple bond is drawn as three parallel lines (≡) between the two connected atoms.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] acetylene , H−C≡C−H cyanogen , N≡C−C≡N carbon monoxide , C≡O Chemical compounds with triple bond(s) Bonding [ edit ] Triple bonding can be explained in terms of orbital hybridization . In the case of acetylene, each carbon atom has two sp-orbitals and two p-orbitals . The two sp-orbitals are linear, with 180° bond angles , and occupy the x-axis in the cartesian coordinate system . The p-orbitals are perpendicular to the sp-orbitals on the y-axis and the z-axis. When the atoms approach each other, the sp orbitals overlap to form an sp-sp sigma bond . At the same time the p z -orbitals approach and together they form a p z -p z pi-bond . Likewise, the other pair of p y -orbitals form a  p y -p y pi-bond. The result is formation of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.

In the bent bond model , the triple bond can also formed by the overlapping of three sp 3 lobes without the need to invoke a pi-bond.

[ 5 ] Triple bonds between elements heavier than oxygen [ edit ] Structure of hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungsten(III) , an example of a metal-metal triple bond.

Many elements beyond oxygen can form triple bonds. These bonds are common in some transition metals.

Hexa(tert-butoxy)ditungsten(III) and Hexa(tert-butoxy)dimolybdenum(III) are well known examples, in which the metal-metal bond distance is about 233 pm.

[ 6 ] The former has attracted particular attention for its reactions with alkynes, leading to metal-carbon triple bonded compounds of the formula RC≡W(OBut) 3 [ 7 ] Additionally, phosphorus can exist as the highly reactive diatomic molecule diphosphorus , which has roughly half the bond-dissociation energy of dinitrogen.
