Situated in the southwest of the country, where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva , it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva . Geneva is a global city , an international financial centre , and a worldwide centre for diplomacy , which has led to it being called the "Peace Capital".

[ 6 ] It hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world, [ 7 ] including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations [ 8 ] and the ICRC and IFRC of the Red Cross .

[ 9 ] It was where the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian treatment in war were signed, and, in the aftermath of World War I , it hosted the League of Nations . It shares a unique distinction with municipalities such as New York City , Bonn , Basel , and Strasbourg as a city which serves as the headquarters of at least one critical international organization without being the capital of a country.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The city of Geneva ( Ville de Genève ) had a population of 203,856 in January 2021 [ 13 ] within its municipal territory of 16 km 2 (6 sq mi).

[ 14 ] The Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat , [ 15 ] including suburbs and exurbs in Vaud and the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie , extends over 2,292 km 2 (885 sq mi) [ 16 ] and had a population of 1,053,436 in 2021.

[ 17 ] The Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District , and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français [ fr ] (a federation of eight French intercommunal councils), form the Grand Genève ("Greater Geneva"), a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation [ fr ] in charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of Geneva.

[ 18 ] The Grand Genève GLCT extends over 1,996 km 2 (771 sq mi) [ 19 ] and had a population of 1,046,168, with 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.

[ 20 ] In 2025, Geneva was ranked as the world's fifteenth most important financial centre by the Global Financial Centres Index , fourth in Europe behind London, Frankfurt and Dublin.

[ 21 ] In 2024, Geneva was ranked as the third most liveable city in the world by Mercer , [ 22 ] as well as the fourth most expensive city in the world.

[ 23 ] In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings , second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power .

[ 24 ] Etymology [ edit ] The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar , with the spelling Genava , [ 25 ] probably from the Celtic * genawa- from the stem * genu- ("mouth"), in the sense of an estuary , an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova ).

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis ). After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva ).

[ 28 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Geneva For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Geneva .

For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see bishopric of Geneva .

A view of Geneva by Frances Elizabeth Wynne , 4 August 1858 Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe, [ 29 ] when the Roman Republic took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire , and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th.

Aerial view (1966) In the Middle Ages , Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council . In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy .
In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin , the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism , became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva . By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782 , an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, Revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. France lost Geneva, which recovered its independence, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars . On 19 May 1815, Geneva joined the Swiss Confederation . In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.

[ 30 ] Geography [ edit ] Topography [ edit ] Satellite view of Geneva; Cointrin Airport is centre left. The Salève (in France) is the large area of green at the bottom right.

Map of Geneva, 1:50,000 Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva , where the Rhône flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura : the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward.

The Geneva area seen from above the Jura mountain chain, with the International airport in the foreground, and the Mont Blanc mountain range in the background The city covers an area of 15.93 km 2 (6.2 sq mi), while the area of the canton is 282 km 2 (108.9 sq mi), including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud . The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km 2 (14.7 sq mi) and is sometimes referred to as petit lac ('small lake'). The canton has only a 4.5 km-long (2.8 mi) border with the rest of Switzerland. Of 107.5 km (66.8 mi) of the border, 103 are shared with France, the department of Ain to the north and west and the department of Haute-Savoie to the south and east.

Of the land in the city, 0.24 km 2 (0.093 sq mi), or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.5 km 2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, 14.63 km 2 (5.65 sq mi), or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), 0.49 km 2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km 2 (4.9 acres), or 0.1%, is wasteland.

[ 31 ] Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.

[ 31 ] Confluence of the Rhône and the Arve The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 m (1,225.7 ft) and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton , two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age . This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.

[ 32 ] The second main river of Geneva is the Arve , which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre.

Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city.

Climate [ edit ] Average temperature and precipitation 1961–1990 [ 33 ] The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate , more specifically an oceanic climate ( Köppen climate classification : Cfb ). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise , a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.

[ 34 ] In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis . The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car.

Mont Salève (1,379 m (4,524 ft)), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc , the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix , which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.

During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11 °C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.

[ 35 ] The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in February 1956.

( November 2024 ) The Administrative Council ( French : Conseil administratif ) constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors ( Conseiller administratif / Conseillère administrative ), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor ( la maire/le maire ). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Madame la maire de Genève Frédérique Perler . Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of office is from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2025. The delegates take office due to a winner-takes-all election ( French : scrutin majoritaire , Swiss Standard German : Majorzwahl or Majorz ). The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate.

[ clarification needed ] The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions .

[ 42 ] As of 2020, [update] Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority in the election held on 15 March / 5 April 2020.

[ 43 ] Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.

It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold.
The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall ( Hôtel de Ville ), in the old city.

[ 45 ] The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15 March 2020 for the term 2020–2025. Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 Les Libéraux-Radicaux (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party ; (PDC) 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG), 7 Ensemble à Gauche (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP ( Parti Suisse du Travail – Parti Ouvrier et Populaire ) and solidaritéS , 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).

[ 46 ] Elections [ edit ] National Council [ edit ] In the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote. The next seven most popular parties were the PS (17.9%, -5.9), PLR (15.1%, -2.4), the UDC (12.6%, -3.7), the PdA / solidaritéS (10%, +1.3), the PDC (5.4%, -5.3), the pvl (5%, +2.9), and MCR (4.9%, -2.7).

[ 47 ] In the federal election a total of 34,319 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.6%.

[ 48 ] In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 23.8% of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidaritéS (8.8%). In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.

[ 49 ] Metropolitan cooperation [ edit ] The city centre of Geneva is located only 1.9 km (1.2 mi) from the border of France . As a result, the urban area and the metropolitan area largely extend across the border on French territory. Due to the small size of the municipality of Geneva (16 km 2 (6 sq mi)) [ 14 ] and extension of the urban area over an international border, official bodies of transnational cooperation were developed as early as the 1970s to manage the cross-border Greater Geneva area at a metropolitan level.

In 1973, a Franco-Swiss agreement created the Comité régional franco-genevois ('Franco-Genevan Regional Committee', CRFG ). In 1997 an 'Urban planning charter' of the CRFG defined for the first time a planning territory called agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise ('Franco- Vaud -Genevan urban area'). 2001 saw the creation of a Comité stratégique de développement des transports publics régionaux ('Strategic Committee for the Development of Regional Public Transports', DTPR ), a committee which adopted in 2003 a 'Charter for Public Transports', first step in the development of a metropolitan, cross-border commuter rail network (see Léman Express ).

In 2004, a public transnational body called Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois ('Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area project') was created to serve as the main body of metropolitan cooperation for the planning territory defined in 1997, with more local French councils taking part in this new public body than in the CRFG created in 1973. Finally in 2012 the Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois was renamed Grand Genève ('Greater Geneva'), and the following year it was transformed into a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation [ fr ] ( GLCT ), a public entity under Swiss law, which now serves as the executive body of the Grand Genève .

The Grand Genève GLCT is made up of the Canton of Geneva , the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français [ fr ] (literally 'Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory'), this last one a federation of eight French intercommunal councils in Ain and Haute-Savoie . The Grand Genève GLCT extends over 1,996 km 2 (771 sq mi) [ 19 ] and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.

[ 20 ] International relations [ edit ] Geneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities. It declares itself related to the entire world.

[ 14 ] The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area , a Functional Urban Area (as per Eurostat methodology) which extends over Swiss territory (entire Canton of Geneva and part of the canton of Vaud ) and French territory (parts of the departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie ).

[ 15 ] The Geneva Functional Urban Area covers a land area of 2,292 km 2 (885 sq mi) (24.2% in Switzerland, 75.8% in France) [ 16 ] and had 1,053,436 inhabitants in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 57.8% of them on Swiss territory and 42.2% on French territory.

[ 17 ] The Geneva metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in Europe. Its population rose from 906,603 in Jan. 2010 [ 54 ] to 1,053,436 in Jan. 2021, which means the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.39% per year during those 11 years. Growth is higher in the French part of the metropolitan area (+1.80% per year between 2010 and 2021) than in the Swiss part (+1.10% per year between 2010 and 2021), as Geneva attracts many French commuters due to high Swiss salaries and a favourable Franco-Swiss tax regime for French residents working in Switzerland.

Language [ edit ] The official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French .

English is also common due to a high number of Anglophone residents working in international institutions and the bank sector. In 2000 there were 128,622 residents, or 72.3% of the population, who spoke French as a first language. English was the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%), followed by Spanish (7,462 or 4.2%), Italian (7,320 or 4.1%), and German (7,050 or 4.0%); 113 spoke Romansh , an official language in Switzerland.

According to the Federal Statistical Office (OFS), the largest share of the population, 51.1%, identified as either having no religious affiliation (48.8%) or as having an unknown affiliation (2.36%).

Christianity , as a whole, accounted for 38.5% of the population, with 26.3% identifying as Catholic , 5.90% as Protestant , and 6.29% belonging to other Christian communities. Among other religious groups, 7.32% of the population identified as Muslim , 1.29% as Jewish , and 1.72% adhered to other religions.

[ 66 ] The 2000 census [update] recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or atheist , 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church , and 8,698 (4.89%) were Muslim . There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland , 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.

[ 55 ] According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population were Christian , (34.2% Catholic , 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva ) and 6.2% other Christians, mostly other Protestants ), 38% of Genevans were non-religious , 6.1% were Muslim and 1.6% were Jews.

[ 67 ] Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the Protestant Rome due to it being the base of John Calvin , William Farel , Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers . Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general secularization, has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg .

The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex , Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches , a worldwide organization of Presbyterian , Continental Reformed , Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The executive committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover , Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.

"Protestant Rome" [ edit ] Reformation Wall in Geneva; from left to right: William Farel , John Calvin , Theodore Beza , and John Knox Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was de jure and de facto Catholic . Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland.

John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism . Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole.

St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition . Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza , Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.

Geneva was a haven for Calvinists, while Roman Catholics and others considered heretics were persecuted. The case of Michael Servetus , an early Nontrinitarian , is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.

[ citation needed ] In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I , the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.

[ 29 ] Napoleon's common policy granted civil rights to Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, as well as the reverse, and also emancipated Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy . A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state , enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.

[ 29 ] Crime [ edit ] See also: Crime in Switzerland In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.

Le Courrier mainly focuses on Geneva. Both Le Temps (headquartered in Geneva) and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of the Romandy .

Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation , known collectively as Radio Télévision Suisse . While both networks cover the whole Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM ( FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud ), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4 MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available.

Traditions and customs [ edit ] Geneva observes Jeûne genevois on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva.

Geneva celebrates L'Escalade on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a Escalade race, usually during the first week-end of December. This race takes place around Geneva's Old Town, and with more that 50,000 participants is the largest in the country.

[ 70 ] Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.

The Société des Vieux-Grenadiers is a local gentlemen's club founded in 1749 and regroups the local political and economical elite. The society has a military branch performing during official events since the late XIXth century.

[ 71 ] Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official "herald of the spring" in Geneva. The sautier (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.

[ 72 ] As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier).

[ 73 ] In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February.

Music and festivals [ edit ] Fireworks at the Fêtes de Genève, 2012 The opera house , the Grand Théâtre de Genève , which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande .

Every summer the Fêtes de Genève (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio Télévision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the Fêtes de Genève.

[ 74 ] An annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.

[ 75 ] Further annual festivals are the Fête de l'Olivier , a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980, [ 76 ] and the Genevan Brass Festival , founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.

[ 77 ] Education [ edit ] Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies The Canton of Geneva's public school system has écoles primaires (ages 4–12) and cycles d'orientation (ages 12–15). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by collèges (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin , which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world, [ 74 ] [ 78 ] écoles de culture générale (15–18/19) and the écoles professionnelles (15–18/19). The écoles professionnelles offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.

[ 79 ] In 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women.

During the 2011–2012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.

[ 80 ] The University of Geneva .

Geneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled.

[ 81 ] In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked 35th European university.

[ 82 ] The Geneva Graduate Institute was among the first academic institutions in the world to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in anthropology and sociology, law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies.

Geneva is also home to more than a dozen private, for-profit universities whose activities have come under scrutiny for offering degrees that are not recognized in Switzerland and engaging in "unscrupulous practices". These schools include the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, the International University in Geneva , the Geneva Business School and IFM Business School .

[ 83 ] The oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva , founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations .

Founded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. It hosts the Large Hadron Collider .

Geneva is home to five major libraries, the Bibliothèques municipales Genève , the Haute école de travail social , the Institut d'études sociales , the Haute école de santé , the École d'ingénieurs de Genève and the Haute école d'art et de design . There were (as of 2008 [update] ) 877,680 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year 1,798,980 items were loaned.

[ 84 ] Further information: Foundation For Technical Education Economy [ edit ] Geneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is one of the global leaders in financial centres.

[ 85 ] Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management.

Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.

[ 86 ] Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge , Cargill , Vitol , Gunvor , BNP Paribas , Trafigura or Mercuria Energy Group , in addition to being home to the world's largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company . Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE , BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV , Crédit Agricole , Credit Suisse , ING , Société Générale , and UBS , all having their headquarters in the area for this business.

Wealth management is dominated by non-publicly listed banks and private banks, particularly Pictet , Lombard Odier , Edmond de Rothschild Group , Union Bancaire Privée , Mirabaud Group , Dukascopy Bank , Bordier & Cie , Banque SYZ , or REYL & Cie . In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank , JPMorgan Chase , or Arab Bank .

Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking , dominated by luxury firms such as Patek Philippe , Vacheron Constantin , Chopard , Piaget , Rolex , Roger Dubuis , Franck Muller , F. P. Journe and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates , Satigny , and Meyrin .

Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton [ 87 ] Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS , the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos , a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter & Gamble , Japan Tobacco International , or L'Oréal (in Vernier).

Its international mindedness, well-connected airport , and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo .

Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.

Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] This section needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( July 2020 ) Main article: Transports Publics Genevois Geneva railway station TCMC (Tramway Cornavin – Meyrin – CERN) The city is served by the Geneva Airport . It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station (French: Gare de Genève-Aéroport ) to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV . Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland ( A1 motorway ) and France.

Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by Transports Publics Genevois . In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises , which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon , Yvoire , Thonon , Évian , Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers .

Geneva Sécheron railway station Trains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens ) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.

In 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse , in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the Léman Express regional rail network.

TOSA Bus at PALEXPO Flash bus stops In May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system [ 100 ] with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo . The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric "flash" recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.

[ 101 ] Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.

[ 102 ] An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010–2014), though as of 2018 [update] , work on the project has yet to be started.

[ 103 ] Utilities [ edit ] The SIG-owned incinerator of Cheneviers, Verbois dam, and the solar farm Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève , known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake ; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater , originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers . The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods , and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels . Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, "Voisin, voisine" a fibre-to-the-home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district.

Ecological infrastructure [ edit ] In the context of the city's Climate Strategy, Geneva's Office cantonal de l'agriculture et de la nature (OCAN) has developed and sustained a network of ecological infrastructure, mainly constituted by biological corridors. Its 2021 revision of the Lighting Plan ( Plan Lumière ) further introduces dark infrastructure in the form of black corridors ( Trame Noire).

In 2024, the metropolitan area Geneva created an open data light pollution map encompassing a “dark grid”.
