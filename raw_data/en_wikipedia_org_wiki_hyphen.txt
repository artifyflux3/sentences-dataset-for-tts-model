The **hyphen****‐** is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark used to join [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word") and to separate [syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable "Syllable") of a single word. The use of hyphens is called **hyphenation**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-1)

The hyphen is sometimes confused with [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") ([en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash")–, [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash")— and others), which are wider, or with the [minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign")−, which is also wider and usually drawn a little higher to match the crossbar in the [plus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_sign "Plus sign")+.

As an [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") for use with computers, it is represented in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") by any of several [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)"). These include the dual-use [hyphen-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus "Hyphen-minus"), the [soft hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen "Soft hyphen"), the [nonbreaking hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Nonbreaking_hyphens), and an unambiguous form known familiarly as the "Unicode hyphen", shown at the top of the infobox on this page. The character most often used to represent a hyphen (and the one produced by the key on a keyboard) is called the "hyphen-minus" in the Unicode specification because it also used as a [minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign"). The name derives from its name in the original [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard, where it was called "hyphen(minus)".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-2)

The word is derived from Ancient Greek ὑφ' ἕν (_huph' hén_), contracted from ὑπό ἕν (_hypó hén_), "in one" (literally "under one").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-4) An (ἡ) ὑφέν (_(he) hyphén_) was an [undertie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertie "Undertie")-like ‿ sign written below two adjacent letters to indicate that they belong to the same word when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity, before [word spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider "Word divider") was practiced.

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Gutenberg_bible_Old_Testament_Epistle_of_St_Jerome.jpg/250px-Gutenberg_bible_Old_Testament_Epistle_of_St_Jerome.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gutenberg_bible_Old_Testament_Epistle_of_St_Jerome.jpg)

First page of the first volume: the [epistle of St Jerome to Paulinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome%27s_epistle_to_Paulinus_(Gutenberg_Bible_preface) "Jerome's epistle to Paulinus (Gutenberg Bible preface)") from the University of Texas copy. The page has 40 lines.

The first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of [Dionysius Thrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Thrax "Dionysius Thrax"). At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low [tie mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(typography) "Tie (typography)") between the two words.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-nicky-5) In Greek these marks were known as _[enotikon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enotikon "Enotikon")_, officially [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek") as a hyphen.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-elot-6)

With the introduction of [letter spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_spacing "Letter spacing") in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), the hyphen, still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Houston2013-7)

The modern format of the hyphen originated with [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg "Johannes Gutenberg") of Mainz, Germany, c. 1455 with the publication of his 42-line [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible "Gutenberg Bible"). His tools did not allow for a [sublinear](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sublinear "wikt:sublinear") hyphen, and he thus moved it to the middle of the line.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Houston2013b-8) Examination of an original copy on [vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum "Vellum") (Hubay index #35) in the [U. S. Library of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words composed of individual movable type to be secured within a rigid, nonprinting frame. To ensure each line fit the frame uniformly, Gutenberg addressed differences in line length by inserting a hyphen at the end of a line at the right-hand margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His [double hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen "Double hyphen"), ⸗, appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") does not have definitive hyphenation rules,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Economist_intro-9) though various [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide") provide detailed usage recommendations and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or "hanging" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., _nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers_). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.

The use of the hyphen in [English compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_compound "English compound") nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the _[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorter\_Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary")_ removed the hyphens from 16,000 entries, such as _fig-leaf_ (now _fig leaf_), _pot-belly_ (now _pot belly_), and _pigeon-hole_ (now _pigeonhole_).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-10) The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g., _[toolbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar")_, _[hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink")_, and _[pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin "Pastebin")_).

Despite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Prefixes_and_suffixes)). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of [syllabification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification "Syllabification") in [justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified "Typographic alignment") texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in [columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_(typography) "Column (typography)") with narrow [line lengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length "Line length"), as when used with [newspapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper "Newspaper")).

#### Justification and line-wrapping

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Justification and line-wrapping")]

When flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word into two so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables ([syllabification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification "Syllabification")) and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins ([justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified "Typographic alignment")) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography) "River (typography)"). This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the column (called the "line length" in typography) is very narrow. For example:

_Justified text

without hyphenation_ _Justified text

with hyphenation_
We,therefore,the

 representatives of the United

 States of America ...We,therefore,the represen-

 tatives of the United States 

 of America ...

Rules (or guidelines) for correct hyphenation vary between languages, and may be complex, and they can interact with other [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") and [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting") practices. [Hyphenation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphenation_algorithm "Hyphenation algorithm"), when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts.

It may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word [being mentioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction "Use–mention distinction") (as when used in a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary "Dictionary")) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a [critical edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_edition "Critical edition")), not only to control its [word wrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_wrap "Word wrap") behavior (which [encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") handles with [hard and soft hyphens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Soft_and_hard_hyphens) having the same [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph")) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). _[Webster's Third New International Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s\_Third\_New\_International\_Dictionary "Webster's Third New International Dictionary")_[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Gove1993-11) and the _[Chambers Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers\_Dictionary "Chambers Dictionary")_[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Chambers2006-12) use a [double hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen "Double hyphen") for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Kromhout2001-13) The _[Concise Oxford Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise\_Oxford\_Dictionary "Concise Oxford Dictionary") (fifth edition)_ suggested repeating an integral hyphen at the start of the following line.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Hartmann1986-14)

#### Prefixes and suffixes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Prefixes and suffixes")]

[Prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix "Prefix") (such as _de-_, _pre-_, _re-_, and _non-_[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-footnote_prefix_list-15)) and [suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix "Suffix") (such as _-less_, _-like_, _-ness_, and _-hood_) are sometimes hyphenated, especially when the unhyphenated spelling resembles another word or when the [affixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") is deemed misinterpretable, ambiguous, or somehow "odd-looking" (for example, having two consecutive [monographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography "Phonemic orthography") that look like the [digraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)") of English, like e+a, e+e, or e+i). However, the unhyphenated style, which is also called _closed up_ or _solid_, is usually preferred, particularly when the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)") has been relatively familiarized or popularized through extensive use in various contexts. As a [rule of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb "Rule of thumb"), affixes are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen would hurt clarity.

The hyphen may be used between vowel letters (e.g., _ee_, _ea_, _ei_) to indicate that they do not form a [digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)"). Some words have both hyphenated and unhyphenated variants: _de-escalate/deescalate_, _co-operation/cooperation_, _re-examine/reexamine_, _de-emphasize/deemphasize_, and so on. Words often lose their hyphen as they become more common, such as _[email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email")_ instead of _e-mail_. When there are tripled letters, the hyphenated variant of these words is often more common (as in _shell-like_ instead of _shelllike_).

Closed-up style is avoided in some cases: possible [homographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph "Homograph"), such as _[recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation "Recreation")_ (fun or sport) versus _re-creation_ (the act of creating again), _retreat_ (turn back) versus _re-treat_ (give [therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy "Therapy") again), and _un-ionized_ (not in [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") form) versus _unionized_ (organized into [trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union")); combinations with [proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun") nouns or adjectives (_un-American_, _de-Stalinisation_);[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Grammar_book-17)[acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") (_anti-TNF antibody_, _non-SI units_); or numbers (_pre-1949 diplomacy_, _pre-1492 cartography_). Although _[proto-oncogene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-oncogene "Proto-oncogene")_ is still hyphenated by both _Dorland's_ and _Merriam-Webster's Medical_, the solid (that is, unhyphenated) styling (_protooncogene_) is a common variant, particularly among oncologists and geneticists.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A [diaeresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic) "Diaeresis (diacritic)") may also be used in a like fashion, either to separate and mark off monographs (as in _coöperation_) or to signalize a [vocalic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") terminal e (for example, _[Brontë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bront%C3%AB\_family "Brontë family")_). This use of the diaeresis peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was never applied extensively across the language: only a handful of diaereses, including _coöperation_ and _Brontë_, are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; thus _reëxamine_, _reïterate_, _deëmphasize_, etc. are seldom encountered. In borrowings from Modern French, whose [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_orthography "French orthography") utilizes the diaeresis as a means to differentiate [graphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme"), various English dictionaries list the dieresis as optional (as in _naive_ and _naïve_) despite the juxtaposition of a and i.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

#### Syllabification and spelling

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Syllabification and spelling")]

Hyphens are occasionally used to denote [syllabification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification "Syllabification"), as in _syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion_. Various British and North American dictionaries use an [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (sometimes called a "middle dot" or "hyphenation point"), for this purpose, as in _syl·la·bi·fi·ca·tion_. This practice allows the hyphen to be reserved exclusively for instances where a true hyphen is intended– for example, _self-con·scious_, _un·self-con·scious_, and _long-stand·ing_. Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate the spelling of a word, as in _W-O-R-D_ to represent _word_.

In nineteenth-century American literature, hyphens were also used irregularly to divide syllables in words from indigenous North American languages, without regard for etymology or pronunciation,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-18) such as "Shuh-shuh-gah" (from [Ojibwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language "Ojibwe language")_zhashagi_, "blue heron") in _[The Song of Hiawatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Song\_of\_Hiawatha "The Song of Hiawatha")_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-19) This usage is now rare and deprecated,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] except in some place names such as [Ah-gwah-ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ah-gwah-ching,_Minnesota "Ah-gwah-ching, Minnesota").

[Compound modifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_modifier "Compound modifier") are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an [adverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb "Adverb")–[adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective "Adjective") combination appears _before_ a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in _American-football player_ or _little-celebrated paintings_. Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a "player of American football" or an "American player of football" and whether the writer means paintings that are "little celebrated" or "celebrated paintings" that are little.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-20) Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in _ice-cream-flavored candy_, and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (_spine-tinglingly frightening_). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, some style guides prefer the construction _high school students_, to _high-school students_.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-IU_Style_Guide-22) Although the expression is technically ambiguous ("students of a high school"/"school students who are high"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun–noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: _grade point average_ and _department store manager_.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-IU_Style_Guide-22)

When a compound modifier _follows_ the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, "that gentleman is well respected", not "that gentleman is well-respected"; or "a patient-centered approach was used" but "the approach was patient centered."[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-23) But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, "A cost-effective method was used" and "The method was cost-effective" (_cost-effective_ is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries). When one of the parts of the modifier is a [proper noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun") or a [proper adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_adjective "Proper adjective"), there is no hyphen (e.g., "a South American actor").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Hyphenated_Compound_Words-24)

When the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in _-ly_ (e.g., "a poorly written novel"), various style guides advise no hyphen.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Hyphenated_Compound_Words-24)[_[additional citation(s) needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] However, some do allow for this use. For example, _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist") Style Guide_ advises: "Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions... Less common adverbs, including all those that end _-ly_, are less likely to need hyphens."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Economist_12-25) In the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb–adjective modifiers with the adverb ending in _-ly_ (e.g., "a craftily-constructed chair"). However, this has become rare. For example, _wholly owned subsidiary_ and _quickly moving vehicle_ are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: "quickly" cannot modify "vehicle".

However, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Grammar_book-17) For example, the phrase _more-important reasons_ ("reasons that are more important") is distinguished from _more important reasons_ ("additional important reasons"), where _more_ is an adjective. Similarly, _more-beautiful scenery_ (with a [mass-noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun "Mass noun")) is distinct from _more beautiful scenery_. (In contrast, the hyphen in "a more-important reason" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words—such as _well_, _ill_, _little_, and _much_—attract special attention in this category.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Economist_12-25) The hyphen in "well-[past_participled] noun", such as in "[well-differentiated cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation "Cellular differentiation")", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because _early_ has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with _advanced-stage disease_ and _adult-onset disease_, like the parallelism of _early-stage disease_ and _early-onset disease_. Similarly, the hyphen in _little-celebrated paintings_ clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.

Hyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-AMA10section8.3.1-26) although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus _28-year-old woman_ and _twenty-eight-year-old woman_ or _32-foot wingspan_ and _thirty-two-foot wingspan_, but _the woman is 28 years old_ and _a wingspan of 32 feet_.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Plural_nouns-27) However, with symbols for [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") units (such as _[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre")_ or _[kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")_)—in contrast to the _names_ of these units (such as _[metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre")_ or _[kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram")_)—the numerical value is always separated from it with a space: _a 25 kg sphere_. When the unit names are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: _a 25-kilogram sphere_, _a roll of 35-millimetre film_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-28)

In spelled-out [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)"), hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus _two-thirds majority_[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-Plural_nouns-27) and _one-eighth portion_ but _I drank two thirds of the bottle_ or _I kept three quarters of it for myself_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-APA6section4.13-29) However, at least one major style guide[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-AMA10section8.3.1-26) hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).

In English,  an [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash"), –, sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, _San Francisco–area residents_, _hormone receptor–positive cells_, _cell cycle–related factors_, and _public-school–private-school rivalries_).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-LutzStevenson2005-30) A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (_hormone-receptor-positive cells_, _cell-cycle-related factors_). (For other aspects of en dash–versus–hyphen use, see _[Dash § En dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En\_dash "Dash")_.)

#### Object–verbal-noun compounds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Object–verbal-noun compounds")]

When an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as _[egg-beater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixer\_(cooking) "Mixer (cooking)")_ (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, _egg-beater, egg beater,_ and _eggbeater_ are all common.

An example of an ambiguous phrase appears in _they stood near a group of alien lovers_, which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; _they stood near a group of alien-lovers_ clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as "alien" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase _a hungry pizza-lover_, the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as "pizza" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.

Similarly, _a man-eating shark_ is nearly the opposite of _a man eating shark_; the first refers to a shark that eats people, and the second to a man who eats [shark meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_meat "Shark meat"). _A government-monitoring program_ is a program that monitors the government, whereas _a government monitoring program_ is a government program that monitors something else.

Some married couples compose a new [surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname "Surname") (sometimes referred to as a [double-barrelled name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-barrelled_name "Double-barrelled name")) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname.

With already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became [Aaron Taylor-Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Taylor-Johnson "Aaron Taylor-Johnson") and [Sam Taylor-Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Taylor-Johnson "Sam Taylor-Johnson"). Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example [Julia Louis-Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Louis-Dreyfus "Julia Louis-Dreyfus") is a descendant of Louis Lemlé Dreyfus whose son was Léopold Louis-Dreyfus.

Connecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in _lily-of-the-valley_, _cock-a-hoop_, _clever-clever_, _tittle-tattle_ and _orang-utan_. Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, _orang-utan_ is also written as _orangutan_ or _orang utan_, and _lily-of-the-valley_ may be hyphenated or not.

A **suspended hyphen** (also called a **suspensive hyphen** or **hanging hyphen**, or less commonly a **dangling** or **floating hyphen**) may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words that are connected by "and", "or", or "to". For example, _short-term and long-term plans_ may be written as _short- and long-term plans._ This usage is now common and specifically recommended in some style guides.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-IU_Style_Guide-22) Suspended hyphens are also used, though less commonly, when the base word comes first, such as in "investor-owned and -operated". Uses such as "applied and sociolinguistics" (instead of "applied linguistics and sociolinguistics") are frowned upon; the Indiana University style guide uses this example and says "Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-IU_Style_Guide-22) This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, _preoperative and postoperative_ becomes _pre- and postoperative_ (not _pre- and post-operative_) when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-AMA10section8.3.1-26)

A hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in [dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date "Calendar date") (see [§ Usage in date notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Use_in_date_notation)), [telephone numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number "Telephone number") or sports [scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(game) "Score (game)").

It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an en dash (see [Dash §En dash §§Ranges of values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Ranges_of_values "Dash")).

It is sometimes used to hide letters in words ([filleting for redaction or censoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_(redaction) "Fillet (redaction)")), as in "[G-d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-d "G-d")", although an en dash can be used as well ("G–d").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-31)

It is often used in [reduplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication "Reduplication").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-32)

Due to their similar appearances, hyphens are sometimes mistakenly used where an en dash or em dash would be more appropriate.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-33)

Some stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens to mark attributive phrases:

*   _Disease-causing poor nutrition_ is poor nutrition that causes disease. 
    *   _Disease causing poor nutrition_ is a disease that causes poor nutrition.

*   A _hard-working man_ is a man who works hard. 
    *   A _hard working man_ is a working man who is tough.

*   A _man-eating shark_ is a shark that eats humans. 
    *   A _man eating shark_ is a man who is eating shark meat.

*   _Three-hundred-year-old trees_ are an indeterminate number of trees that are each 300 years old. 
    *   _Three hundred-year-old trees_ are three trees that are each 100 years old.
    *   _Three hundred year-old trees_ are 300 trees that are each a year old.

In the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") character encoding, the hyphen (or minus) is character 45 10.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-34) As [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") is identical to ASCII (the 1967 version) for all encodings up to 127 10, the number 45 10 (2D 16) is also assigned to this character in Unicode, where it is denoted as U+002D-HYPHEN-MINUS.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-35) Unicode has, in addition, other encodings for minus and hyphen characters: U+2212−MINUS SIGN and U+2010‐HYPHEN, respectively. The unambiguous [§"Unicode hyphen"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#%22Unicode_hyphen%22) at U+2010 is generally inconvenient to enter on most keyboards and the glyphs for this hyphen and the hyphen-minus are identical in most fonts ([Lucida Sans Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucida_Sans_Unicode "Lucida Sans Unicode") is one of the few exceptions). Consequently, use of the hyphen-minus as the hyphen character is very common. Even the [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Standard "Unicode Standard") regularly uses the hyphen-minus rather than the U+2010 hyphen.

The hyphen-minus has limited use in indicating subtraction; for example, compare 4+3−2=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus) — in most typefaces, the [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") for hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character is typically designed so that it does. Nevertheless, in many spreadsheet and programming applications the hyphen-minus must be typed to indicate subtraction, as use of the Unicode minus sign will not be recognised.

The hyphen-minus is often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the latter characters are unavailable (such as [type-written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_writer "Type writer") or ASCII-only text), where they take effort to enter (via [dialog boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box "Dialog box") or multi-key [keyboard shortcuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut "Keyboard shortcut")), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Consequently, some writers use two or three hyphen-minuses (`--` or `---`) to represent an em dash.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-36) In the TeX typesetting languages, a single hyphen-minus (`-`) renders a hyphen, a single hyphen-minus in math mode (`$-$`) renders a minus sign, two hyphen-minuses (`--`) renders an en dash, and three hyphen-minuses (`---`) renders an em dash.

The hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying [command-line options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_option "Command-line option"). The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the [getopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopt "Getopt") function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters, `--`, to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with [pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix) "Pipeline (Unix)") in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized [in lieu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_lieu "wikt:in lieu") of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a [standard stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams "Standard streams"), instead of a file, is to be worked with.

### Soft and hard hyphens

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Soft and hard hyphens")]

Although software ([hyphenation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphenation_algorithm "Hyphenation algorithm")) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be [reflowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflowable_document "Reflowable document")). For this purpose, the concept of a [soft hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen "Soft hyphen") (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is _allowed_ but not _forced_. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.

Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation _may_ occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules[_[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid\_weasel\_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")_] of the [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.

In contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a "hard hyphen". This can be a Unicode hyphen, a hyphen-minus, or a nonbreaking hyphen (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Nonbreaking_hyphens)). Confusingly, the term is sometimes limited to nonbreaking hyphens.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Nonbreaking hyphens

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Nonbreaking hyphens")]

The [word segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_segmentation "Word segmentation") rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a [word boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_boundary_(linguistics) "Word boundary (linguistics)") and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. This is not always desirable, it could lead to ambiguity (e.g. _retreat_ and _re‑treat_ would be indistinguishable with a line break after _re_), it can split off an ending as in "_n_‑th" (though _n_ th or "_n_ th" could be used), and it is inappropriate in some languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language")_an t‑athair_ or [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language "Romanian language")_s‑a_ would be undesirable). The **non-breaking hyphen**, **nonbreaking hyphen**, or **no-break hyphen** looks identical to the regular hyphen, but word processors do not break words at it. The [nonbreaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonbreaking_space "Nonbreaking space") exists for similar reasons.

Because the conventional _hyphen-minus_ mark on keyboards is ambiguous (it can be interpreted– sometimes unexpectedly– as a hyphen or a minus, depending on context), in addition the [Unicode consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_consortium "Unicode consortium") allocated [codepoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepoint "Codepoint") for an unambiguous minus and an unambiguous hyphen. The Unicode hyphen (U+2010‐HYPHEN) is seldom used. Even the [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Standard "Unicode Standard") uses U+002D instead of U+2010 in its text.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-37)

Use in date notation
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyphen&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Use in date notation")]

Use of hyphens to delineate the parts of a written date (rather than the [slashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) "Slash (punctuation)") used conventionally in [Anglophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophone "Anglophone") countries) is specified in the [international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard "International standard")[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 "ISO 8601"). Thus, for example, 1789-07-14 is the standard way of writing the date of [Bastille Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day "Bastille Day"). This standard has been transposed as European Standard EN 28601 and has been incorporated into various national typographic style guides (e.g., [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN "DIN") 5008 in Germany). Now all official European Union (and many member state) documents use this style. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.

This method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") make the use of slashes in [file names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_name "File name") difficult or impossible. [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS"), [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 "OS/2") and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows") use `/` to introduce and separate switches to [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) "Shell (computing)") commands, and on both Windows and [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") systems slashes in a filename introduce subdirectories which may not be desirable. Besides encouraging use of dashes, the Y-M-D order and zero-padding of numbers less than 10 are also copied from ISO 8601 to make the filenames sort by date order.

Unicode has multiple hyphen characters:[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-PropList-38)

*   U+002D-[HYPHEN-MINUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus "Hyphen-minus"), a character of multiple uses

*   U+FE63﹣SMALL HYPHEN-MINUS (compatibility character for a small hyphen-minus, used in East Asian typography)

*   U+FF65･HALFWIDTH KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT (compatibility character for a wide katakana middle dot, has the Unicode property of "Hyphen" despite its name)

Unicode distinguishes the hyphen from the general [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct"). The characters below do not have the Unicode property of "Hyphen" despite their names:[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_note-PropList-38)

Thus _a woman who is 28 years old_ becomes _a 28-year-old woman_. There are occasional exceptions to this general rule, for instance with fractions (_a two-thirds majority_) and irregular plurals (_a two-criteria review_, _a two-teeth bridge_).
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#cite_ref-39)**The soft hyphen serves as an invisible marker that is used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated [line break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Line wrap and word wrap") is preferred should one be needed. This avoids forcing a line break in an inconvenient place, should the text be reflowed. It becomes visible only if [word wrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Line wrap and word wrap") occurs at the end of a line.

Adverbs: Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions [examples elided]. But if the adverb is one of two words together being used adjectivally, a hyphen may be needed [examples elided]. The hyphen is especially likely to be needed if the adverb is short and common, such as _ill_, _little_, _much_ and _well_. Less common adverbs, including all those that end _-ly_, are less likely to need hyphens [example elided].

Retrieved 10 November 2020. In typescript, a double hyphen (--) is often used for a long dash. Double hyphens in a typeset document are a sure sign that the type was set by a typist, not a typographer. A typographer will use an em dash, three-quarter em, or en dash, depending on context or personal style. The em dash is the nineteenth-century standard, still prescribed in many editorial style books, but the em dash is too long for use with the best text faces. Like the oversized space between sentences, it belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography.
