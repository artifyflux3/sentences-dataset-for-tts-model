Biography [ edit ] Incandela received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1986. He worked on the UA2 experiment at CERN to study the recently discovered W and Z bosons before searching for charged Higgs bosons. He then moved back to the US in 1991 to work at FNAL, where he led the construction and design of silicon detectors and co-led the search for the top quark using lifetime tagging of b quark jets. This channel had the strongest contribution to the top quark discovery in 1995. Since 1997 he has been involved with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN , initially leading the construction of a large part of the tracking system for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. In 2011 he was elected to be the spokesperson for the CMS experiment.
