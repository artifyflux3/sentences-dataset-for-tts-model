( April 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) BFO 2.0 Basic Formal Ontology ( BFO ) is a top-level ontology developed by Barry Smith and his associates for the purposes of promoting interoperability among domain ontologies built in its terms through a process of downward population.  A guide to building BFO-conformant domain ontologies was published by MIT Press in 2015.

[ 1 ] The ontology arose against the background of research in ontologies in the domain of geospatial information science by David Mark, Pierre Grenon, Achille Varzi and others, [ 2 ] with a special role for the study of vagueness and of the ways sharp boundaries in the geospatial and other domains are created by fiat.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] BFO has passed through four major releases.

[ 5 ] The current revision was released in 2020, [ 6 ] and this forms the basis of the standard ISO/IEC 21838-2 , [ 7 ] which was released by the Joint Committee of the International Standards Organization and International Electrotechnical Commission in 2021.

[ 8 ] The structure of BFO is based on a division of entities into two disjoint categories of continuant and occurrent , the former consists of objects and spatial regions, the latter contains processes conceived as extended through (or spanning) time. BFO thereby seeks to consolidate both time and space within a single framework.

Applications [ edit ] BFO has been adopted as a foundational ontology by over 450 ontology projects, [ 9 ] principally in the areas of biomedical ontology , security and defense (intelligence) ontology, [ 10 ] and industry ontologies.

[ 11 ] [ 6 ] Example applications of BFO can be seen in the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI).

In 2021, the standard ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 Information Technology — Top-level Ontologies (TLO) — Part 2: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) was published by the Joint Technical Committee of the International Standards Organization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.

[ 8 ] ISO/IEC 21838 is a multi-part standard. Part 1 of the standard [ 12 ] specifies the requirements that must be met if an ontology is to be classified as a top-level ontology by the standard.

In January 2024, BFO and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO), a suite of BFO-extension ontologies, were adopted as the  "baseline standards for formal DOD and IC ontology" development work in the DOD and Intelligence Community. A memorandum to this effect was signed by the chief data officers of the DOD, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office.
