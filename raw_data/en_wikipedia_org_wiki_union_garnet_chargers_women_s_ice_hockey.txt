Messa Rink at Achilles Center Schenectady, New York Colors Union garnet and white [ 1 ] The Union Garnet Chargers ice hockey team represents Union College in Schenectady , New York , United States .

History [ edit ] From 1999 to 2003, the team competed in Division III hockey. In 2003, the team joined the ECAC.

On February 20, 2010, senior Jackie Koetteritz, had played in her 125th game for the team, setting a record for the most games for the team.

[ 2 ] On November 4, 2011: Emilie Arseneault scored a short handed goal late into the second period to give the team a 2–1 conference victory over the Clarkson Golden Knights women's ice hockey program. It was the team's first ECAC win since the 2009–2010 season, and only their second ECAC win since 2004.

[ 3 ] Despite ending the 2013–14 season with a 9–24–1 record, several milestones were achieved. Their nine wins, all recorded by goaltender Shenae Lundberg, setting a record for most wins in one season by a goaltender, signified the highest win total under Head Coach Claudia Asano Barcomb. Starting the season 2–0 for the first time in program history, the team enjoyed another notable first, defeating the Princeton Tigers. They also set a new program record with 25 power play goals, as senior forward Stefanie Thomson scored seven power play goals, also a program record. Subsequently, their efforts on the power play resulted in the third best power play in the ECAC conference, ranking eighth best in the nation. As a side note, team captain Maddy Norton would lead the team in assists (18) and points (21).

In 2019–2020, the team finished 9th in the ECAC, their highest finish in the league. They finished the season at 5–24–5 overall, and 5–13–5 in conference play.
