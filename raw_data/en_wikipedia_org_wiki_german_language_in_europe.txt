German as an official language [ edit ] German is the official language of six countries, all of which lie in central and western Europe. These countries (with the addition of South Tyrol of Italy ) also form the Council for German Orthography and are referred to as the German Sprachraum (German language area). Since 2004, Meetings of German-speaking countries have been held annually with six participants: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland: [ 1 ] Country Population [ 2 ] Speakers Notes Native [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Second [ 3 ] [ 5 ] Germany 84,607,016 75,101,421 (91.8%) 5,600,000 (6.9%) De facto sole nationwide official language [ a ] Belgium 11,810,018 73,000 (0.6%) 2,472,746 (22%) Co-official language , as well as the sole official language in the German speaking community Austria 9,154,514 8,040,960 (93%) 516,000 (6%) De jure sole nationwide official language Switzerland 8,931,306 5,329,393 (64.6%) 395,000 (5%) Co-official language at federal level; de jure sole official language in 17 , co-official in 4 cantons ( out of 26 ) Luxembourg 672,050 11,000 (2%) 380,000 (67.5%) De jure nationwide co-official language Liechtenstein 39,724 32,075 (85.8%) 5,200 (13.9%) De jure sole nationwide official language Total 115,203,387 87,875,432 9,368,947 Total speakers: 97,244,378 Subdivisions of countries [ edit ] While not official at the national level, German is a co-official language in subdivisions of the countries listed below. In each of these regions, German is an official language on the administrative level.

Region Country Population 2006/2011 [ clarification needed ] Native speakers Notes Autonomous Province of South Tyrol Italy 511,750 354,643 (69.3%) [ 6 ] Co-official language on province level; equal to Italian Opole Voivodeship (28 communes) Silesian Voivodeship (3 communes) Poland 250,000 ~50,000 (~20%) [ 7 ] Auxiliary language in 31 communes ; [ 8 ] also national minority language [ 9 ] Other legal statuses [ edit ] See also: Geographical distribution of German speakers There are other political entities (countries as well as dependent entities) which acknowledge other legal statuses for the German language or one of its dialects. While these may cover minority rights, support of certain language facilities (schools, media, etc.), and the promotion of cultural protection/heritage, they do not encompass the establishment of German as an "official" language, i.e., being required in public offices or administrative texts.

These countries include: Brazil (German is a statewide cultural language in Espírito Santo and Rio Grande do Sul ; Standard German official in 2 municipalities and non-standard German dialects official in 16 others) [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Czech Republic (national minority language) [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 12 ] Denmark (minority language in Syddanmark , established with the Bonn-Copenhagen declarations , 1955) [ 9 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Hungary (national minority language) [ 9 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Namibia ( national language ; co-official language 1884–1990) [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Poland (national minority language; also auxiliary language in 31 communes ) [ 9 ] Romania (national minority language) [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 18 ] Russia (minority language in the Azovo German National District ) [ 19 ] Slovakia (regional minority language) [ 9 ] Although in France , the High German varieties of Alsatian and Moselle Franconian are identified as " regional languages " according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1998, the French government has not yet ratified the treaty, and therefore those varieties have no official legal status.

[ 20 ] Due to the German diaspora , many other countries with sizable populations of (mostly bilingual) German L1 speakers include Argentina , Australia , Bolivia , Canada , Chile , Peru , Paraguay , as well as the United States .

[ 21 ] However, in none of these countries does German or a German variety have any legal status.

Section 6 (5) (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 acknowledges German as a language commonly used by communities in South Africa though not being an official language.
