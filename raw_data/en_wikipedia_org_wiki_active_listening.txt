core components of active listening Active listening is the practice of preparing to listen , observing what verbal and non-verbal messages are being sent, and then providing appropriate feedback for the sake of showing attentiveness to the message being presented.

[ 1 ] Active listening is listening to understand.

[ 2 ] This form of listening conveys a mutual understanding between speaker and listener. Speakers receive confirmation their point is coming across and listeners absorb more content and understanding by being consciously engaged. The overall goal of active listening is to eliminate any misunderstandings and establish clear communication of thoughts and ideas between the speaker and listener.

[ 3 ] By actively listening to another person, a sense of belonging and mutual understanding between the two individuals is created.

The term "active listening" was introduced in 1957 by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson , who developed the concept as a foundational approach to empathetic and intentional communication.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It may also be referred to as reflective listening .

[ 3 ] Active listening encloses the communication attribute characterized by paying attention to a speaker for better comprehension, both in word and emotion. It is the opposite of passive listening, where a listener may be distracted or note critical points to develop a response. It calls for an attentive mind and empathetic concern for the speaker's perspective.

[ 6 ] Active listening is a communication technique designed to foster understanding and strengthen interpersonal relationships by intentionally focusing on the speaker's verbal and non-verbal cues . Unlike passive listening, which involves simply hearing words, active listening requires deliberate engagement to fully comprehend the speaker's intended message.

[ 7 ] Research has demonstrated that active listening promotes trust, reduces misunderstandings, and enhances emotional connection, making it a valuable tool in both personal and professional contexts.

[ 2 ] In addition to its interpersonal and professional use, active listening is increasingly recognized as an essential tool in digital communication , intercultural dialogue, and social justice contexts. Recent research highlights its role in reducing bias , fostering inclusion, and enhancing understanding across diverse perspectives.

A key component of successful negotiations is active listening.  Since successful negotiations depend on a give-and-take of information, active listening is actually just as crucial as talking, if not more so.  Action must be taken by both parties to an exchange, not only the one providing the information.  In this sense, active listening is essential to making sure that all information is successfully shared and taken in. The best method for fostering goodwill and coming to fruitful agreements is active listening, which can reduce conflict and advance a situation that might otherwise be at a standstill.  In the meantime, listening shows the other person that one is setting aside one's own agenda and giving them space to think about the matter from their point of view.

[ 8 ] Active listening is being fully engaged while another person is talking. It is listening with the intent to understand the other person fully, rather than listening to respond. Active listening includes asking curious questions such as, "How did you feel?" or "What did you think?" [ 9 ] History [ edit ] William James identified a variety of attention called "the reproduction of the sensation from within." He suggested that people could learn more by engaging this ability directly: ...reading not merely with the eye, and of listening not merely with the ear, but... articulating to one’s self the words seen or heard, ought to deepen one’s attention to the latter.

I can keep my wandering mind a great deal more closely upon a conversation or a lecture if I actively re-echo to myself the words than if I simply hear them; and I find a number of my students who report benefit from voluntarily adopting a similar course.

[ 10 ] Carl Rogers and Richard Farson coined the term "active listening" in 1957 in a paper of the same title (reprinted in 1987 in the volume Communicating in Business Today ). Practicing active listening also emphasized Rogers' (1980) concept of three facilitative conditions for effective counseling ; empathy , genuineness, and unconditional positive regard .

[ 4 ] Rogers and Farson write: "Active listening is an important way to bring about changes in people. Despite the popular notion that listening is a passive approach, clinical and research evidence clearly shows that sensitive listening is a most effective agent for individual personality change and group development. Listening brings about changes in peoples' attitudes toward themselves and others; it also brings about changes in their basic values and personal philosophy. People who have been listened to in this new and special way become more emotionally mature, more open to their experiences, less defensive, more democratic, and less authoritarian." [ 11 ] The theoretical framework for active listening developed in the middle of the 20th century, most notably by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson, who launched the concept in their seminal 1957 essay "Active Listening".

[ 12 ] Rooted in therapeutic communication, this approach was earmarked by its emphasis on the transformative power of listening to promote personal and relational growth. Rogers and Farson insisted on the fact that this non-threatening, empathic environment should be created where people would feel listened to and understood; it is the primary condition for overcoming defensiveness and, therefore, the capability of reflection.

[ 12 ] Their work established active listening as an essential skill for effective interpersonal communication —extending its relevance beyond therapy to business and everyday interactions.

[ 2 ] Technique of active listening [ edit ] Active listening comprises several components by the listener, who must pay attention to what the speaker is attempting to communicate and elicit clarification where necessary for comprehension. "Many studies suggest that even the smallest improvements in a person’s listening ability can have a noticeable impact on the overall effectiveness of communication and productivity." [ 13 ] Developing this skill of active listening can positively impact the speakers and the listeners' mutual understanding and relationship.

Although most people overestimate their capacity to use this crucial negotiation skill and lack a proper knowledge of the concept, skilled active listening can reduce tensions, break the deadlock, and provide one with the information one needs to create innovative bargains.

[ 14 ] From the speakers perspective, listening is a multidimensional construct [ 15 ] [ 16 ] that includes attention, comprehension, and positive intention.

[ 17 ] Active listening includes further understanding and closeness between the listener and speaker. The more basic ways this is done are through paraphrasing, reflective emotion, and open-ended questions. Paraphrasing involves putting the speaker's message in one's words to demonstrate one's understanding and continue the discussion. Reflective emotion involves identifying the speaker's feelings, whether expressed or not, and responding to those feelings that will further validate the person's emotional state .

[ 12 ] On the other hand, open-ended questions permit the interviewee to expound on their responses, thus allowing deeper insight into their thoughts and experiences and encouraging a more inclusive dialogue.

[ 12 ] These skills find their real-life applications in their efficiency. For example, paraphrasing clarifies possible miscommunications by summarizing the speaker's words and verifying the accuracy. Emotion reflection helps to establish empathy with a speaker so that he/she feels appreciated and understood.

Open-ended questions , such as "What did you think of that?" or "Can you further explain what that felt like?" describe ideas and feelings that deepen the conversation. Active listening skills, including but not limited to eye contact, no distractions, and clarity seeking, round out these techniques by engaging in an active, respectful, and attentive way. Only by practicing these methods can listeners create a non-threatening, meaningful space for communication.

[ 5 ] Comprehension [ edit ] The first step in the active listening process is that of comprehension. Comprehension is a shared meaning between parties in communication.

[ 1 ] This can be done through top-down or bottom-up listening strategies. Top-down listening for comprehension will involve preparing for what message is likely going to be given, attempting to organize what is being communicated, and listening for summarizations or shifts in topic. Bottom-up listening for comprehension will involve an attentiveness to emphasized words such as longer or louder words. In addition, careful attention should be paid to repeated parts of the message being communicated.

[ 18 ] Attentiveness can be emphasized not just in one's ability to listen, but to listen and respond with sensitivity to particular needs or cultural norms. For example, if a person is listening to someone communicate with a disability such as autism, that person will need to pay close attention and forego common methods of organizing information as it is received. One needs to be patient with them not understanding at first. In many of today's cultures, comprehension may include a knowledge of people using neutral pronouns or preferred pronouns. In order to listen for comprehension, it will be important for a receiver to be aware and understand these cultural norms.

[ 19 ] Retaining [ edit ] Retaining is the second step in the process. Retaining memory is essential to the active listening process because the information retained when a person is involved in the listening process is how meaning is extracted from words, because everyone has different memories. The speaker and the listener may attach different meanings to the same statement. Memories are fallible meaning the mind can have errors in recalling information later on. Poor memory retaining techniques like cramming may cause information to be forgotten as our brains have a limited capacity to process more than one thing at a time this is more likely to not be retained.

[ 20 ] [ clarification needed ] This may be due to the fact that one's brain needs more time to effectively process and retain the information given in order to successfully store it into a more solidified form of memory. Retaining information from messages being received is increased with how meaningful what is being said and using repetition so the brain can retain the information. For example, information is best retained in adults experience in what is being said over and over. Communicates back and forth with another communicator about the topic, and maintains visual contact with the source of the message being sent.

[ 21 ] Responding [ edit ] There are three basic steps for responding in the following order: [ 22 ] Paraphrase: Explain what one believes has been said in one's own words.

Clarify: Ensure that one understands what has been said through asking questions.

Summarize: Offer a concise overview of what one believes the main points and intent of the message received are.

Here are the guidelines to help fine tune one's ability to follow these steps: Keep one's attention on the message being presented Refrain from thinking about one's own response to what is being presented.

Refrain from offering judgement on anything the other person says.

Observe non-verbal content. These are their own kind of communication which can be clarified by the active listener.

Applications of active listening [ edit ] Active listening is used in a wide variety of situations, including public interest advocacy, community organizing, tutoring , [ 23 ] medical workers talking to patients, [ 24 ] HIV counseling, [ 25 ] helping suicidal persons, [ 26 ] management, [ 27 ] counseling , [ 4 ] and journalistic [ 28 ] settings. In groups it may aid in reaching consensus .

[ 29 ] It may also be used in casual conversation or small talk to build understanding. Active listening plays a large role in the success of a leader. Leaders need to build trust and respect with those around them and mastering the skills of active listening will help them greatly.

[ 30 ] A listener can use several degrees of active listening, each resulting in a different quality of communication.

[ 31 ] These degrees include repeating to indicate attentiveness, paraphrasing to signify understanding, and reflecting to acknowledge perspective and application.

[ 32 ] The proper use of active listening results in getting people to open up, avoiding misunderstandings, resolving conflict, and building trust .

[ 33 ] In a medical context, benefits may include increased patient satisfaction, [ 24 ] improved cross-cultural communication , [ 34 ] improved outcomes, [ 24 ] or decreased litigation .

[ 35 ] Active listening in music [ edit ] Active listening has been developed as a concept in music and technology by François Pachet , researcher at Sony Computer Science Laboratory, Paris. Active listening in music refers to the idea that listeners can be given some degree of control on the music they listen to, by means of technological applications mainly based on artificial intelligence and information theory techniques, by opposition to traditional listening, in which the musical media is played passively by some neutral device [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Active listening in healthcare and education [ edit ] Active listening is a critical communication skill with significant applications in both healthcare and education . In healthcare, active listening enables practitioners to understand better patients’ concerns, including unspoken fears or expectations, which can lead to improved diagnoses, treatment adherence, and patient satisfaction. According to Lang, Floyd, and Beine (2000), recognizing subtle verbal and nonverbal “clues” during patient interactions enhances communication and fosters trust between patients and healthcare providers.

[ 39 ] A more recent systematic review further states that active listening plays a key role in patient satisfaction during surgeon-patient consultations, especially in building rapport and trust.

[ 40 ] In education, active listening is equally impactful, fostering collaboration between educators, students, and parents. McNaughton et al. (2008) developed the LAFF strategy, a structured method of active listening that includes empathetic engagement, asking open-ended questions, focusing on concerns, and identifying actionable steps. Teachers trained in this strategy have demonstrated improved communication skills and stronger relationships with parents, creating a more supportive learning environment .

[ 41 ] This is expanded upon by the framing of active listening as a teachable skill, a skill central also to intercultural communication education. Structured classroom approaches incorporated into education can help students develop intercultural competence and empathy through the practice of active listening.

[ 42 ] Active listening in intercultural and intersectional contexts [ edit ] Beyond formal education, active listening plays a powerful role in intercultural communication and identity-based dialogue by creating a space for empathy, reflection, and mutual understanding. In conversations where participants bring different cultural backgrounds or perspectives, active listening can help reduce assumptions and foster an environment where individuals feel heard and respected. A 2016 study based on a single-class activity demonstrated how classroom-based dialogues centered around race, ethnicity, and identity benefit from active listening practices, allowing students to explore their avowed and ascribed identities while developing greater cultural sensitivity through listening.

[ 43 ] Integrating active listening into these interactions promotes trust and encourages participants to move beyond surface-level exchanges.

Active listening in digital contexts [ edit ] With the increasing use of digital communication tools, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic , active listening has taken a new importance in remote settings. In a comprehensive 2021 study, Dr. Karin Wahl-Jorgensen found that conducting research interviews via Zoom led to deeper forms of engagement, where both the interviewer and interviewee demonstrated heightened attentiveness and emotional presence. The digital environment, with fewer distractions and more focus on verbal cues, encouraged sustained listening and reflection.

[ 44 ] Active listening remains vital, and perhaps even amplified, in virtual settings, where maintaining human connection can be even more challenging.

Active listening in social justice contexts [ edit ] In addition to digital communication contexts, active listening can also serve as a tool for fostering inclusion, empathy, and understanding in conversations about social justice and systemic inequality . A 2021 study involving an educational activity designed to challenge neoliberal assumptions found that incorporating active listening can help reduce communication barriers in emotionally charged or politically sensitive classroom discussions. Students who practiced listening without interrupting or reacting defensively were more likely to engage in opposing viewpoints and reflect on their own biases.

[ 45 ] These findings highlight how active listening can serve as a valuable communication tool in dialogue about social justice and equity.

Barriers to active listening [ edit ] There are a multitude of factors that may impede upon someone's ability to listen with purpose and intention; these factors are referred to as listening blocks.

[ 46 ] Some examples of these blocks include rehearsing, filtering, and advising. Rehearsing is when the listener is more focused on preparing their response rather than listening. Filtering is when a listener focuses only on what they expect to hear, while tuning out other aspects of what is being said, and lastly, advising is when the listener focuses on problem solving, which can create a sense of pressure to fix what the other person is doing wrong.

[ 47 ] There are three types of barriers to effective listening: Environmental, Physiological, and Psychological.

[ 48 ] Environmental barriers [ edit ] Environmental barriers are brought about by the speaker's environment. Some examples include noises , smells, bad cell reception, and any other factors that make it difficult to hear and process information.

[ 48 ] Sometimes it is due to the language the speaker uses—such as high sounding and bombastic words that can lead to ambiguity . Other barriers include distractions, trigger words , vocabulary , and limited attention span. Environmental barriers likely can not be eliminated but they can be managed.

[ 48 ] Physiological barriers [ edit ] Physiological barriers are those that are brought about by the listener's body. They can be temporary or permanent.

Hearing loss and deficiencies are usually permanent boundaries. Temporary physiological barriers include headaches , earaches, hunger or fatigue of the listener. Another physiological boundary is the difference between the slow rate of most speech and the brain's ability to process that information. Typically, the brain can process around 500 words per minute while the average rate of speech for speakers is 125 words per minute. This difference make it easy for the mind to wander.

[ 48 ] Psychological barriers [ edit ] Psychological barriers interfere with one's willingness and mental capacity for listening.

[ 48 ] Pre-existing biases can lead to listening to someone else's argument for its weaknesses, ignoring its strengths. This can lead to a competitive advantage in a political debate, or by a journalist to provoke a strong response from an interviewee, and is known as "ambushing". Individuals in conflict often blindly contradict each other. On the other hand, if one finds that the other party understands, an atmosphere of cooperation can be created.

Shift response [ edit ] Shift response is a type of conversational narcissism —the tendency of listeners to turn the topic to themselves without showing sustained interest in others.

[ 49 ] A support response is the opposite of a shift response; it is an attention giving method and a cooperative effort to focus the conversational attention on the other person. Instead of being me-oriented like shift response, it is we-oriented.

[ 50 ] It is the response a competent communicator is most likely to use.

[ 51 ] Overcoming active listening barriers [ edit ] The active listening technique is used to improve personal communications in organizations.  Listeners put aside their own emotions and ask questions and paraphrase what the speaker says to clarify and gain a better understanding of what the speaker intended to say.

[ 52 ] Distractions that disrupt the listener's attention are one of the major barriers to effective listening. These include external factors such as background noise and physical discomfort, and internal distractions, such as thoughts about other things and lack of focus. Another barrier is the use of technology, which can divide attention or introduce distractions. Misinterpretations of the speaker's intent is also a common challenge, especially when assumptions are made when listeners "read between the lines." This problem can be mitigated by asking the speaker what they mean when it is unclear, though this is not guaranteed to work every time.

[ 53 ] A strong disagreement hinders the ability to listen closely to what is being said.

[ 54 ] Eye contact and appropriate body languages are seen as important components to active listening, as they provide feedback to the speaker.

[ 55 ] The stress and intonation used by the speaker may also provide information to the listener, which is not available in the written word.

Criticisms of active listening [ edit ] While active listening is widely regarded as an effective communication technique, several scholars have highlighted potential limitations in its application. In some contexts, particularly within educational development and training, active listening can become overly procedural, prioritizing structured techniques over authentic connection.

[ 56 ] This may lead to surface-level interactions that feel performative rather than meaningful. Additionally, studies have shown that while active listening behaviors are generally received positively, they do not always result in improved relational outcomes, suggesting that its effectiveness can vary based on contexts and interpersonal dynamics.

[ 57 ] These critiques point to the importance of applying active listening with cultural awareness and genuine empathy, rather than relying solely on technique.

A Munich-based marital therapy study conducted by Dr. Kurt Hahlweg and associates found that even after employing active listening techniques in the context of couples therapy, the typical couple was still distressed.

[ 58 ] Active listening was criticized by John Gottman 's The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work as being of limited usefulness: Active listening asks couples to perform Olympic-level emotional gymnastics when their relationship can barely walk. . . . After studying some 650 couples and tracking the fate of their marriages for up to fourteen years, we now understand that this approach to counseling doesn't work, not just because it's nearly impossible for most couples to do well, but more importantly because successful conflict resolution isn't what makes marriages succeed . One of the most startling findings of our research is that most couples who have maintained happy marriages rarely do anything that even partly resembles active listening when they're upset.

[ 59 ] Robert F. Scuka defends active listening by arguing that: ...a careful reading of the Hahlweg et al. (1984) study reveals that Gottman cites only certain (one-sided) results from the study. He also overlooks several important considerations that call into question his implied dismissal of the RE model as a legitimate therapeutic intervention for distressed couples.
