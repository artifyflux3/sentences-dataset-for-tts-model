( February 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , hypercomplex analysis is the extension of complex analysis to the hypercomplex numbers . The first instance is functions of a quaternion variable , where the argument is a quaternion (in this case, the sub-field of hypercomplex analysis is called quaternionic analysis ).  A second instance involves functions of a motor variable where arguments are split-complex numbers .

In mathematical physics , there are hypercomplex systems called Clifford algebras . The study of functions with arguments from a Clifford algebra is called Clifford analysis .

A matrix may be considered a hypercomplex number. For example, the study of functions of 2 × 2 real matrices shows that the topology of the space of hypercomplex numbers determines the function theory. Functions such as square root of a matrix , matrix exponential , and logarithm of a matrix are basic examples of hypercomplex analysis.

[ 1 ] The function theory of diagonalizable matrices is particularly transparent since they have eigendecompositions .

[ 2 ] Suppose T = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N λ λ i E i {\displaystyle \textstyle T=\sum _{i=1}^{N}\lambda _{i}E_{i}} where the E i are projections . Then for any polynomial f {\displaystyle f} , f ( T ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N f ( λ λ i ) E i .

{\displaystyle f(T)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}f(\lambda _{i})E_{i}.} The modern terminology for a "system of hypercomplex numbers" is an algebra over the real numbers , and the algebras used in applications are often Banach algebras since Cauchy sequences can be taken to be convergent . Then the function theory is enriched by sequences and series . In this context the extension of holomorphic functions of a complex variable is developed as the holomorphic functional calculus .  Hypercomplex analysis on Banach algebras is called functional analysis .
