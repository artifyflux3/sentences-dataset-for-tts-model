[ 7 ] In January 2020, the network added California-based talk radio host Mike Slater [ 8 ] and Dana Loesch .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] On June 1, 2020, the network announced that Bill O'Reilly was joining the network with his show No Spin News .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] He began the online show in 2017 after being fired from Fox News Channel , in the wake of The New York Times publishing details of six sexual misconduct lawsuits O'Reilly had settled.

[ 19 ] Reception [ edit ] Tyler Hersko of IndieWire criticized ViacomCBS for their involvement in O'Reilly's show, commenting that its Pluto TV debut coincided with the date that its entertainment and youth channels were made unavailable for eight minutes 46 seconds in solidarity with Black Lives Matter . Hersko found this hypocritical in light of comments made by O'Reilly about African-Americans.

[ 2 ] A petition by ViacomCBS employees urged the company to remove The First for similar reasons.
