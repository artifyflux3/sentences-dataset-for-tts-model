Band of the electromagnetic spectrum Plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation The waterhole , or water hole , is an especially quiet band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 1420 and 1662 megahertz , corresponding to wavelengths of 18–21 centimeters. It is a popular observing frequency used by radio telescopes in radio astronomy .

[ 1 ] The strongest hydroxyl radical spectral line radiates at 18 centimeters, and atomic hydrogen at 21 centimeters (the hydrogen line ). These two molecules, which combine to form water , are widespread in interstellar gas , which means this gas tends to absorb radio noise at these frequencies. Therefore, the spectrum between these frequencies forms a relatively "quiet" channel in the interstellar radio noise background.

Bernard M. Oliver , who coined the term in 1971, theorized that the waterhole would be an obvious band for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence , [ 2 ] hence the name, which is a pun : in English, a watering hole is a vernacular reference to a common place to meet and talk. Several programs involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , including SETI@home , search in the waterhole radio frequencies.
