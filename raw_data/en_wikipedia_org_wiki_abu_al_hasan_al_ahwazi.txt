His name suggests that he was originally from Ahvaz , now in modern Iran. The Iranian scholar Al-Biruni mentioned his name in his works, an indication that Ahvazi's works were considered to be important. Ahvazi mentioned the Iranian astronomer and mathematician Abū Ja'far al-Khāzin in one of his books. Since Al-Khazin died in 360 AH ( c.

982 CE), it can be concluded that the final years of Ahvazi's life was contemporaneous to Biruni's childhood.

Ahvazi's book Sharh al-maqala al-ashira min kitab uqlidus is extant.

K. al-Amtal al-musammā bi-l-Fara'id wa-l-qala'id , a work previously attributed to another author, was probably written by Abū l-Ḥasan al-Ahwazi (d. 428/1037) It contains eight chapters of original sayings that were intended to be understood as proverbs.
