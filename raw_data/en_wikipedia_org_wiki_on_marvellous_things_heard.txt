This page contains extracts from The Situations and Names of Winds and On Marvellous Things Heard .

On Marvellous Things Heard ( Ancient Greek : Περὶ θαυμασίων ἀκουσμάτων ; Latin : De mirabilibus auscultationibus ), often called Mirabilia , [ 1 ] is a collection of thematically arranged anecdotes formerly attributed to Aristotle . The material included in the collection mainly deals with the natural world (e.g., plants, animals, minerals, weather, geography).

[ 2 ] The work consists of 178 chapters and is an example of the paradoxography genre of literature.

[ 3 ] According to the revised Oxford translation of The Complete Works of Aristotle this treatise's "spuriousness has never been seriously contested".

[ 4 ] It was denied by Desiderius Erasmus in his edition of the Corpus Aristotelicum in 1531.

[ 1 ] On Marvellous Things Heard was translated into Latin three times during the Middle Ages : first by Bartolomeo da Messina in the 13th century, then in the 14th century by Leontius Pilatus and finally in the 15th century by the humanist Antonio Beccaria [ it ] .

[ 5 ] The first edition of the Greek text was an incunabulum printed by Aldo Manuzio in 1497.

[ 6 ] Four Latin translations appeared in the 16th century based on printed editions (two anonymous, two by Domenico Montesoro and Natale Conti ).
