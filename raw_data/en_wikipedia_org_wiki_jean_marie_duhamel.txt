His studies were affected by the troubles of the Napoleonic era . He went on to form his own school École Sainte-Barbe .

Duhamel's principle , a method of obtaining solutions to inhomogeneous linear evolution equations, is named after him. He was primarily a mathematician but did studies on the mathematics of heat , mechanics , and acoustics .

[ 2 ] He also did work in calculus using infinitesimals. Duhamel's theorem for infinitesimals says that the sum of a series of infinitesimals is unchanged by replacing the infinitesimal with its principal part.

[ 3 ] In 1853 he published about an early recording device he called a vibroscope . Like other similar devices, the vibroscope was a type of measuring device similar to an oscilloscope , and could not play back the etchings it recorded.
