 An image from inside a [3-torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-torus "Three-torus"). All of the cubes in the image are the same cube, since light in the manifold wraps around into closed loops, the effect is that the cube is tiling all of space. This space has finite volume and no boundary.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **3-manifold** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") that locally looks like a [three-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Three-dimensional Euclidean space"). A 3-[manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") can be thought of as a possible [shape of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe "Shape of the universe"). Just as a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") looks like a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") (a [tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_plane "Tangent plane")) to a small and close enough observer, all 3-manifolds look like our universe does to a small enough observer. This is made more precise in the definition below.

A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")![Image 2: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) is a 3-manifold if it is a [second-countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable "Second-countable")[Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") and if every point in ![Image 3: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) has a [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to [Euclidean 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_3-space "Euclidean 3-space").

### Mathematical theory of 3-manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Mathematical theory of 3-manifolds")]

The topological, [piecewise-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_manifold "Piecewise linear manifold"), and smooth categories are all equivalent in three dimensions, so little distinction is made in whether we are dealing with say, topological 3-manifolds, or smooth 3-manifolds.

Phenomena in three dimensions can be strikingly different from phenomena in other dimensions, and so there is a prevalence of very specialized techniques that do not generalize to dimensions greater than three. This special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields, such as [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory"), [geometric group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_group_theory "Geometric group theory"), [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), [Teichmüller theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichm%C3%BCller_space "Teichmüller space"), [topological quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory "Topological quantum field theory"), [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory"), [Floer homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology "Floer homology"), and [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equations "Partial differential equations"). 3-manifold theory is considered a part of [low-dimensional topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dimensional_topology "Low-dimensional topology") or [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology").

A key idea in the theory is to study a 3-manifold by considering special [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") embedded in it. One can choose the surface to be nicely placed in the 3-manifold, which leads to the idea of an [incompressible surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_surface "Incompressible surface") and the theory of [Haken manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haken_manifold "Haken manifold"), or one can choose the complementary pieces to be as nice as possible, leading to structures such as [Heegaard splittings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heegaard_splitting "Heegaard splitting"), which are useful even in the non-Haken case.

[Thurston's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston") contributions to the theory allow one to also consider, in many cases, the additional structure given by a particular Thurston model geometry (of which there are eight). The most prevalent geometry is hyperbolic geometry. Using a geometry in addition to special surfaces is often fruitful.

The [fundamental groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of 3-manifolds strongly reflect the geometric and topological information belonging to a 3-manifold. Thus, there is an interplay between [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") and topological methods.

### Invariants describing 3-manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Invariants describing 3-manifolds")]

3-manifolds are an interesting special case of low-dimensional topology because their topological invariants give a lot of information about their structure in general. If we let ![Image 4: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) be a 3-manifold and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \pi =\pi _{1}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f52bfaea7e854392cee1f4ffa4600d52d8258c8) be its fundamental group, then a lot of information can be derived from them. For example, using [Poincaré duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_duality "Poincaré duality") and the [Hurewicz theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurewicz_theorem "Hurewicz theorem"), we have the following [homology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_group "Homology group"):

> ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}H_{0}(M)&=H^{3}(M)=&\mathbb {Z} \\H_{1}(M)&=H^{2}(M)=&\pi /[\pi ,\pi ]\\H_{2}(M)&=H^{1}(M)=&{\text{Hom}}(\pi ,\mathbb {Z} )\\H_{3}(M)&=H^{0}(M)=&\mathbb {Z} \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f2a86d64c5d4083e01d8c768c547633c5d75325)

where the last two groups are isomorphic to the [group homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohomology "Group cohomology") and cohomology of ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a), respectively; that is,

> ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}H_{1}(\pi ;\mathbb {Z} )&\cong \pi /[\pi ,\pi ]\\H^{1}(\pi ;\mathbb {Z} )&\cong {\text{Hom}}(\pi ,\mathbb {Z} )\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f901b12f564cf0240320b7b66ecee13b940ba5d)

From this information a basic homotopy theoretic classification of 3-manifolds[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-1) can be found. Note from the [Postnikov tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnikov_tower "Postnikov tower") there is a canonical map

> ![Image 9: {\displaystyle q:M\to B\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52d94ee5cb678f7f675a9c1b304892201129e7d7)

If we take the pushforward of the fundamental class ![Image 10: {\displaystyle [M]\in H_{3}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86af14ee8f6efafc612c7b0ae25e17335e7ad1c2) into ![Image 11: {\displaystyle H_{3}(B\pi )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f6af47eb5166f38a8273ee78e164743fcf63837) we get an element ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \zeta _{M}=q_{*}([M])}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f0351c40c0aae52a52fd85e5c5b7ef09ffc1e8c). It turns out the group ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a) together with the group homology class ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \zeta _{M}\in H_{3}(\pi ,\mathbb {Z} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc44e5f30c9f75b81e96621a9f1487ee35e05c1f) gives a complete algebraic description of the [homotopy type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type "Homotopy type") of ![Image 15: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd).

One important topological operation is the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of two 3-manifolds ![Image 16: {\displaystyle M_{1}\#M_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/311120fc261464558bc2af7c59f52d88ff50ffc0). In fact, from general theorems in topology, we find for a three manifold with a connected sum decomposition ![Image 17: {\displaystyle M=M_{1}\#\cdots \#M_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4912288b8f519a75c28f896e24cb0ffa95848593) the invariants above for ![Image 18: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) can be computed from the ![Image 19: {\displaystyle M_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eda8fd06f1cd5de22ed07385a0f8aa19773b2de9). In particular

> ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}H_{1}(M)&=H_{1}(M_{1})\oplus \cdots \oplus H_{1}(M_{n})\\H_{2}(M)&=H_{2}(M_{1})\oplus \cdots \oplus H_{2}(M_{n})\\\pi _{1}(M)&=\pi _{1}(M_{1})*\cdots *\pi _{1}(M_{n})\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a9049cd2222f3370fba9f8657d0aecc69767661)

Moreover, a 3-manifold ![Image 21: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) which cannot be described as a connected sum of two 3-manifolds is called **prime**.

#### Second homotopy groups

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Second homotopy groups")]

For the case of a 3-manifold given by a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds, it turns out there is a nice description of the second fundamental group as a ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [\pi ]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/343e4f37a7355bdb8ba93cbbffbecf263af9d9ef)-module.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-2) For the special case of having each ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(M_{i})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb265fb0bb9b80241c46ac5b1bd0fba214336f73) is infinite but not cyclic, if we take based embeddings of a 2-sphere

> ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}:S^{2}\to M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c6b7f8bdb84b889c9cf14d8d7ebd347b9c058e8) where ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}(S^{2})\subset M_{i}-\{B^{3}\}\subset M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cd7e656d377260770891c3368afa920060accf1)

then the second fundamental group has the presentation

> ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \pi _{2}(M)={\frac {\mathbb {Z} [\pi ]\{\sigma _{1},\ldots ,\sigma _{n}\}}{(\sigma _{1}+\cdots +\sigma _{n})}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07a2b4c538afa0a9afb908152cf168c7033ebb86)

giving a straightforward computation of this group.

Important examples of 3-manifolds
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Important examples of 3-manifolds")]

Euclidean 3-space is the most important example of a 3-manifold, as all others are defined in relation to it. This is just the standard 3-dimensional [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over the real numbers.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Hypersphere_coord.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypersphere_coord.PNG)

[Stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection "Stereographic projection") of the hypersphere's parallels (red), [meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(perimetry,_visual_field) "Meridian (perimetry, visual field)") (blue) and hypermeridians (green). Because this projection is [conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map "Conformal map"), the curves intersect each other orthogonally (in the yellow points) as in 4D. All curves are circles: the curves that intersect <0,0,0,1> have infinite radius (= straight line). 

A 3-sphere is a higher-dimensional analogue of a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). It consists of the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point in 4-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). Just as an ordinary sphere (or 2-sphere) is a two-dimensional [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") that forms the boundary of a [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(mathematics) "Ball (mathematics)") in three dimensions, a 3-sphere is an object with three [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") that forms the boundary of a ball in four dimensions. Many examples of 3-manifolds can be constructed by taking quotients of the 3-sphere by a finite group ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9be4ba0bb8df3af72e90a0535fabcc17431e540a) acting freely on ![Image 29: {\displaystyle S^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01e57c690f890937838c10ba57853ff21bf30ec8) via a map ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \pi \to {\text{SO}}(4)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/279008215a9d2328364e4da99b37c9cb6a5595e5), so ![Image 31: {\displaystyle M=S^{3}/\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4489f4a90b871c16201fee194b631345c474122).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-3)

### Real projective 3-space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Real projective 3-space")]

Real projective 3-space, or **RP**_3_, is the [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of lines passing through the origin 0 in **R**4. It is a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") of dimension _3_, and is a special case **Gr**(1, **R**4) of a [Grassmannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian") space.

**RP**3 is ([diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphic "Diffeomorphic") to) [SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3) "SO(3)"), hence admits a group structure; the covering map _S_ 3 → **RP**3 is a map of groups Spin(3) → SO(3), where [Spin(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") is a [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") that is the [universal cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_cover "Universal cover") of SO(3).

The 3-dimensional torus is the product of 3 circles. That is:

![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} ^{3}=S^{1}\times S^{1}\times S^{1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6ee96d3716637c3ef57733cfc9002a74e19b835)
The 3-torus, **T**3 can be described as a quotient of **R**3 under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the 3-torus is **R**3 modulo the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") of the integer [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group) "Lattice (group)")**Z**3 (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the 3-torus is obtained from the 3-dimensional [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube") by gluing the opposite faces together.

A 3-torus in this sense is an example of a 3-dimensional [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space")[manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). It is also an example of a compact [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group")[Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"). This follows from the fact that the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") is a compact abelian Lie group (when identified with the unit [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") with multiplication). Group multiplication on the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication.

[![Image 33](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Hyperbolic_orthogonal_dodecahedral_honeycomb.png/250px-Hyperbolic_orthogonal_dodecahedral_honeycomb.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperbolic_orthogonal_dodecahedral_honeycomb.png)

A perspective projection of a [dodecahedral tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_small_dodecahedral_honeycomb "Hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb") in **[H 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold")**.

Four [dodecahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron "Dodecahedron") meet at each edge, and eight meet at each vertex, like the cubes of a [cubic tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_honeycomb "Cubic honeycomb") in _[E 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_space "Euclidean space")_

Hyperbolic space is a [homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space "Homogeneous space") that can be characterized by a [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function "Constant function") negative [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds "Curvature of Riemannian manifolds"). It is the model of [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). It is distinguished from [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") with [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero") curvature that define the [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), and models of [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") (like the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere")) that have a constant positive curvature. When embedded to a Euclidean space (of a higher dimension), every point of a hyperbolic space is a [saddle point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point "Saddle point"). Another distinctive property is the [amount of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_volume_form "Riemannian volume form") covered by the [3-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-ball "3-ball") in hyperbolic 3-space: it increases [exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth") with respect to the radius of the ball, rather than polynomially.

### Poincaré dodecahedral space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Poincaré dodecahedral space")]

The [Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") homology sphere (also known as Poincaré dodecahedral space) is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a [spherical 3-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_3-manifold "Spherical 3-manifold"), it is the only homology 3-sphere (besides the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") itself) with a finite [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group"). Its fundamental group is known as the [binary icosahedral group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_icosahedral_group "Binary icosahedral group") and has order 120. This shows the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture") cannot be stated in homology terms alone.

In 2003, lack of structure on the largest scales (above 60 degrees) in the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") as observed for one year by the [WMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") spacecraft led to the suggestion, by [Jean-Pierre Luminet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Luminet "Jean-Pierre Luminet") of the [Observatoire de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatoire_de_Paris "Observatoire de Paris") and colleagues, that the [shape of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe "Shape of the universe") is a Poincaré sphere.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-physwebLum03-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-Nat03-5) In 2008, astronomers found the best orientation on the sky for the model and confirmed some of the predictions of the model, using three years of observations by the WMAP spacecraft.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-RBSG08-6) However, there is no strong support for the correctness of the model, as yet.

### Seifert–Weber space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Seifert–Weber space")]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **Seifert–Weber space** (introduced by [Herbert Seifert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Seifert "Herbert Seifert") and Constantin Weber) is a [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold")[hyperbolic 3-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold"). It is also known as **Seifert–Weber dodecahedral space** and **hyperbolic dodecahedral space**. It is one of the first discovered examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

It is constructed by gluing each face of a [dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron "Dodecahedron") to its opposite in a way that produces a closed 3-manifold. There are three ways to do this gluing consistently. Opposite faces are misaligned by 1/10 of a turn, so to match them they must be rotated by 1/10, 3/10 or 5/10 turn; a rotation of 3/10 gives the Seifert–Weber space. Rotation of 1/10 gives the [Poincaré homology sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_homology_sphere "Poincaré homology sphere"), and rotation by 5/10 gives 3-dimensional [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space").

With the 3/10-turn gluing pattern, the edges of the original dodecahedron are glued to each other in groups of five. Thus, in the Seifert–Weber space, each edge is surrounded by five pentagonal faces, and the [dihedral angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle "Dihedral angle") between these pentagons is 72°. This does not match the 117° dihedral angle of a regular dodecahedron in Euclidean space, but in [hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space") there exist regular dodecahedra with any dihedral angle between 60° and 117°, and the hyperbolic dodecahedron with dihedral angle 72° may be used to give the Seifert–Weber space a geometric structure as a hyperbolic manifold. It is a [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)") of the [order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-5_dodecahedral_honeycomb "Order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb"), a [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope "Regular polytope")[tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") of [hyperbolic 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-space "Hyperbolic 3-space") by dodecahedra with this dihedral angle.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **Gieseking manifold** is a [cusped hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold") 3-manifold of finite volume. It is [non-orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") and has the smallest volume among non-compact hyperbolic manifolds, having volume approximately 1.01494161. It was discovered by Hugo Gieseking([1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#CITEREFGieseking1912)).

The Gieseking manifold can be constructed by removing the vertices from a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron"), then gluing the faces together in pairs using affine-linear maps. Label the vertices 0, 1, 2, 3. Glue the face with vertices 0,1,2 to the face with vertices 3,1,0 in that order. Glue the face 0,2,3 to the face 3,2,1 in that order. In the hyperbolic structure of the Gieseking manifold, this ideal tetrahedron is the canonical polyhedral decomposition of [David B. A. Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_B._A._Epstein "David B. A. Epstein") and Robert C. Penner.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-7) Moreover, the angle made by the faces is ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \pi /3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56c1a0cd8279cea58b0ccb583e75a0ee93975883). The triangulation has one tetrahedron, two faces, one edge and no vertices, so all the edges of the original tetrahedron are glued together.

### Hyperbolic link complements

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Hyperbolic link complements")]

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/BorromeanRings.svg/250px-BorromeanRings.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BorromeanRings.svg)

[Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings") are a hyperbolic link.

A **hyperbolic link** is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory) "Link (knot theory)") in the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") with [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_complement "Knot complement") that has a complete [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") of constant negative [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"), i.e. has a [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). A **hyperbolic knot** is a hyperbolic link with one [component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space").

The following examples are particularly well-known and studied.

*   [Figure eight knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics) "Figure-eight knot (mathematics)")
*   [Whitehead link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_link "Whitehead link")
*   [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings")

The classes are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

Some important structures on 3-manifolds
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Some important structures on 3-manifolds")]

**Contact geometry** is the study of a geometric structure on [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") given by a hyperplane [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(differential_geometry) "Distribution (differential geometry)") in the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") and specified by a [one-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"), both of which satisfy a 'maximum non-degeneracy' condition called 'complete non-integrability'. From the [Frobenius theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_theorem_(differential_topology) "Frobenius theorem (differential topology)"), one recognizes the condition as the opposite of the condition that the distribution be determined by a codimension one [foliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliation "Foliation") on the manifold ('complete integrability').

Contact geometry is in many ways an odd-dimensional counterpart of [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry"), which belongs to the even-dimensional world. Both contact and symplectic geometry are motivated by the mathematical formalism of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), where one can consider either the even-dimensional [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") of a mechanical system or the odd-dimensional [extended phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extended_phase_space&action=edit&redlink=1 "Extended phase space (page does not exist)") that includes the time variable.

A **Haken manifold** is a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), [P²-irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C2%B2-irreducible "P²-irreducible") 3-manifold that is **sufficiently large**, meaning that it contains a properly embedded [two-sided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-sided "2-sided")[incompressible surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_surface "Incompressible surface"). Sometimes one considers only orientable Haken manifolds, in which case a Haken manifold is a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold that contains an orientable, incompressible surface.

A 3-manifold finitely covered by a Haken manifold is said to be **virtually Haken**. The [Virtually Haken conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtually_Haken_conjecture "Virtually Haken conjecture") asserts that every compact, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken.

Haken manifolds were introduced by Wolfgang Haken. Haken proved that Haken manifolds have a **hierarchy**, where they can be split up into 3-balls along incompressible surfaces. Haken also showed that there was a finite procedure to find an incompressible surface if the 3-manifold had one. Jaco and Oertel gave an algorithm to determine if a 3-manifold was Haken.

### Essential lamination

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Essential lamination")]

An **essential lamination** is a [lamination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamination_(topology) "Lamination (topology)") where every leaf is incompressible and end incompressible, if the complementary regions of the lamination are irreducible, and if there are no spherical leaves.

Essential laminations generalize the incompressible surfaces found in Haken manifolds.

A **Heegaard splitting** is a decomposition of a compact oriented 3-manifold that results from dividing it into two [handlebodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebody "Handlebody").

Every closed, [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable "Orientable") three-manifold may be so obtained; this follows from deep results on the triangulability of three-manifolds due to [Moise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_E._Moise "Edwin E. Moise"). This contrasts strongly with higher-dimensional manifolds which need not admit smooth or piecewise linear structures. Assuming smoothness the existence of a Heegaard splitting also follows from the work of [Smale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smale "Smale") about handle decompositions from Morse theory.

A **taut foliation** is a [codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension "Codimension") 1 [foliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliation "Foliation") of a 3-manifold with the property that there is a single transverse circle intersecting every leaf. By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the tangent field of the foliation. Equivalently, by a result of [Dennis Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Sullivan "Dennis Sullivan"), a codimension 1 foliation is taut if there exists a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") that makes each leaf a [minimal surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface "Minimal surface").

Taut foliations were brought to prominence by the work of [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston") and [David Gabai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gabai "David Gabai").

Foundational results
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Foundational results")]

Some results are named as conjectures as a result of historical artifacts.

We begin with the purely topological:

In [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology"), **Moise's theorem**, proved by [Edwin E. Moise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_E._Moise "Edwin E. Moise") in, states that any topological 3-manifold has an essentially unique [piecewise-linear structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise-linear_structure "Piecewise-linear structure") and [smooth structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_structure "Smooth structure").

As corollary, every compact 3-manifold has a [Heegaard splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heegaard_splitting "Heegaard splitting").

### Prime decomposition theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Prime decomposition theorem")]

The **prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds** states that every [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") 3-manifold is the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of a unique ([up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to")[homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism")) collection of [prime 3-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_manifold "Prime manifold").

A manifold is _prime_ if it cannot be presented as a connected sum of more than one manifold, none of which is the sphere of the same dimension.

### Kneser–Haken finiteness

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Kneser–Haken finiteness")]

Kneser-Haken finiteness says that for each compact 3-manifold, there is a constant **C** such that any collection of disjoint incompressible embedded surfaces of cardinality greater than **C** must contain parallel elements.

### Loop and Sphere theorems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Loop and Sphere theorems")]

The **loop theorem** is a generalization of [Dehn's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn%27s_lemma "Dehn's lemma") and should more properly be called the "disk theorem". It was first proven by [Christos Papakyriakopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christos_Papakyriakopoulos "Christos Papakyriakopoulos") in 1956, along with Dehn's lemma and the [Sphere theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_theorem_(3-manifolds) "Sphere theorem (3-manifolds)").

A simple and useful version of the loop theorem states that if there is a map

![Image 36: {\displaystyle f\colon (D^{2},\partial D^{2})\to (M,\partial M)\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e0b1862eb31683ce1b05b1572fdcc7e6d865d46)
with ![Image 37: {\displaystyle f|\partial D^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3a4d9845350c762e50335115ee9215266580169) not nullhomotopic in ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \partial M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8456299e2b600f44f5aa08920be090af1b35e013), then there is an embedding with the same property.

The **sphere theorem** of [Papakyriakopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christos_Papakyriakopoulos "Christos Papakyriakopoulos")([1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#CITEREFPapakyriakopoulos1957)) gives conditions for elements of the second homotopy group of a 3-manifold to be represented by embedded spheres.

One example is the following:

Let ![Image 39: {\displaystyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82cade9898ced02fdd08712e5f0c0151758a0dd) be an [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable "Orientable") 3-manifold such that ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \pi _{2}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d076b2a0a5414640d695939c1d0dc4b010efe45f) is not the trivial group. Then there exists a non-zero element of ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \pi _{2}(M)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d076b2a0a5414640d695939c1d0dc4b010efe45f) having a representative that is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding")![Image 42: {\displaystyle S^{2}\to M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8c1f092d35e400340674f5955ebfbd35b504e62).

### Annulus and Torus theorems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Annulus and Torus theorems")]

The **annulus theorem** states that if a pair of disjoint simple closed curves on the boundary of a three manifold are freely homotopic then they cobound a properly embedded annulus. This should not be confused with the high dimensional theorem of the same name.

The **torus theorem** is as follows: Let M be a compact, irreducible 3-manifold with nonempty boundary. If M admits an essential map of a torus, then M admits an essential embedding of either a torus or an annulus[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-8)

The **JSJ decomposition**, also known as the **toral decomposition**, is a [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological "Topological") construct given by the following theorem:

[Irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_(mathematics) "Irreducible (mathematics)")[orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") closed (i.e., compact and without boundary) 3-manifolds have a unique (up to [isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy")) minimal collection of disjointly [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding")[incompressible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_surface "Incompressible surface")[tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") such that each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either [atoroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoroidal "Atoroidal") or [Seifert-fibered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert-fibered "Seifert-fibered").
The acronym JSJ is for [William Jaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jaco "William Jaco"), [Peter Shalen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shalen "Peter Shalen"), and [Klaus Johannson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Klaus_Johannson&action=edit&redlink=1 "Klaus Johannson (page does not exist)"). The first two worked together, and the third worked independently.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-10)

The **Scott core theorem** is a theorem about the finite presentability of [fundamental groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of 3-manifolds due to [G. Peter Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Peter_Scott "G. Peter Scott").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-11) The precise statement is as follows:

Given a 3-manifold (not necessarily [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_manifold "Compact manifold")) with [finitely generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_generated_group "Finitely generated group") fundamental group, there is a compact three-dimensional [submanifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold"), called the **compact core** or **Scott core**, such that its [inclusion map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_map "Inclusion map") induces an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") on fundamental groups. In particular, this means a finitely generated 3-manifold group is [finitely presentable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group "Presentation of a group").

A simplified proof is given in,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-12) and a stronger uniqueness statement is proven in.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-13)

### Lickorish–Wallace theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Lickorish–Wallace theorem")]

The **Lickorish–Wallace theorem** states that any [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold"), [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable "Orientable"), connected 3-manifold may be obtained by performing [Dehn surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_surgery "Dehn surgery") on a [framed link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framed_link "Framed link") in the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") with ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \pm 1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bfeaa85da53ad1947d8000926cfea33827ef1e0) surgery coefficients. Furthermore, each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted.

### Waldhausen's theorems on topological rigidity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Waldhausen's theorems on topological rigidity")]

[Friedhelm Waldhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedhelm_Waldhausen "Friedhelm Waldhausen")'s theorems on topological rigidity say that certain 3-manifolds (such as those with an incompressible surface) are homeomorphic if there is an isomorphism of fundamental groups which respects the boundary.

### Waldhausen conjecture on Heegaard splittings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Waldhausen conjecture on Heegaard splittings")]

Waldhausen conjectured that every closed orientable 3-manifold has only finitely many Heegaard splittings (up to homeomorphism) of any given genus.

The **Smith conjecture** (now proven) states that if _f_ is a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") of the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") of [finite order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(group_theory) "Order (group theory)"), then the [fixed point set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_set "Fixed point set") of _f_ cannot be a nontrivial [knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)").

### Cyclic surgery theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Cyclic surgery theorem")]

The **cyclic surgery theorem** states that, for a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space"), [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability"), [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducibility_(mathematics) "Irreducibility (mathematics)") three-manifold _M_ whose boundary is a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus")_T_, if _M_ is not a [Seifert-fibered space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert-fibered_space "Seifert-fibered space") and _r,s_ are slopes on _T_ such that their [Dehn fillings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_surgery "Dehn surgery") have cyclic fundamental group, then the distance between _r_ and _s_ (the minimal number of times that two simple closed curves in _T_ representing _r_ and _s_ must intersect) is at most 1. Consequently, there are at most three Dehn fillings of _M_ with cyclic fundamental group.

### Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem and the Jørgensen–Thurston theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem and the Jørgensen–Thurston theorem")]

**Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem** states: ![Image 44: {\displaystyle M(u_{1},u_{2},\dots ,u_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2000d5792c0e5c0810e1b9bb5cffbcb57fbf4e65) is hyperbolic as long as a finite set of _exceptional slopes_![Image 45: {\displaystyle E_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ba9f6e3041b052cf13a0ede4ecf35fb4c9cd16c) is avoided for the _i_-th cusp for each _i_. In addition, ![Image 46: {\displaystyle M(u_{1},u_{2},\dots ,u_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2000d5792c0e5c0810e1b9bb5cffbcb57fbf4e65) converges to _M_ in _H_ as all ![Image 47: {\displaystyle p_{i}^{2}+q_{i}^{2}\rightarrow \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfb6ec7890d17a67a4134fec97af674b01c41d15) for all ![Image 48: {\displaystyle p_{i}/q_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5f158063a80ba2432bd50062d833318b84f72b7) corresponding to non-empty Dehn fillings ![Image 49: {\displaystyle u_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/14f13cb025ff2e136dcbd2fc81ddf965b728e3d7).

This theorem is due to [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston") and fundamental to the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It shows that nontrivial limits exist in _H_. Troels Jorgensen's study of the geometric topology further shows that all nontrivial limits arise by Dehn filling as in the theorem.

Another important result by Thurston is that volume decreases under hyperbolic Dehn filling. In fact, the theorem states that volume decreases under topological Dehn filling, assuming of course that the Dehn-filled manifold is hyperbolic. The proof relies on basic properties of the [Gromov norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromov_norm "Gromov norm").

Jørgensen also showed that the volume function on this space is a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), [proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_map "Proper map") function. Thus by the previous results, nontrivial limits in _H_ are taken to nontrivial limits in the set of volumes. In fact, one can further conclude, as did Thurston, that the set of volumes of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds has [ordinal type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number")![Image 50: {\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9aa5636cabcea62c44c8b91fd9095e06054a6fa4). This result is known as the **Thurston-Jørgensen theorem**. Further work characterizing this set was done by [Gromov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gromov_(mathematician) "Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)").

Also, Gabai, Meyerhoff & Milley showed that the [Weeks manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeks_manifold "Weeks manifold") has the smallest volume of any closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold.

### Thurston's hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Thurston's hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds")]

One form of Thurston's geometrization theorem states: If _M_ is a compact irreducible atoroidal Haken manifold whose boundary has zero Euler characteristic, then the interior of _M_ has a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume.

The [Mostow rigidity theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostow_rigidity_theorem "Mostow rigidity theorem") implies that if a manifold of dimension at least 3 has a hyperbolic structure of finite volume, then it is essentially unique.

The conditions that the manifold _M_ should be irreducible and atoroidal are necessary, as hyperbolic manifolds have these properties. However the condition that the manifold be Haken is unnecessarily strong. Thurston's hyperbolization conjecture states that a closed irreducible atoroidal 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is hyperbolic, and this follows from Perelman's proof of the Thurston geometrization conjecture.

### Tameness conjecture, also called the Marden conjecture or tame ends conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Tameness conjecture, also called the Marden conjecture or tame ends conjecture")]

The **tameness theorem** states that every complete [hyperbolic 3-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold") with finitely generated [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") is [topologically tame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_tame "Topologically tame"), in other words [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to the interior of a [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") 3-manifold.

The tameness theorem was conjectured by Marden. It was proved by Agol and, independently, by [Danny Calegari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Calegari "Danny Calegari") and [David Gabai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gabai "David Gabai"). It is one of the fundamental properties of geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, together with the [density theorem for Kleinian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_theorem_for_Kleinian_groups "Density theorem for Kleinian groups") and the [ending lamination theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending_lamination_theorem "Ending lamination theorem"). It also implies the [Ahlfors measure conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahlfors_measure_conjecture "Ahlfors measure conjecture").

### Ending lamination conjecture

The **ending lamination theorem**, originally conjectured by William Thurston and later proven by [Jeffrey Brock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Brock "Jeffrey Brock"), [Richard Canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Canary "Richard Canary"), and Yair Minsky, states that [hyperbolic 3-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold") with [finitely generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely-generated_group "Finitely-generated group")[fundamental groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") are determined by their topology together with certain "end invariants", which are geodesic [laminations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamination_(topology) "Lamination (topology)") on some surfaces in the boundary of the manifold.

### Poincaré conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Poincaré conjecture")]

The 3-sphere is an especially important 3-manifold because of the now-proven [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture"). Originally conjectured by [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré"), the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold") 3-manifold). The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(topology) "Path (topology)") in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. An [analogous result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Generalized Poincaré conjecture") has been known in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "Grigori Perelman") presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv "ArXiv"). The proof followed on from the program of [Richard S. Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Hamilton "Richard S. Hamilton") to use the [Ricci flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_flow "Ricci flow") to attack the problem. Perelman introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called _Ricci flow with surgery_ to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.

### Thurston's geometrization conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Thurston's geometrization conjecture")]

**Thurston's geometrization conjecture** states that certain three-dimensional [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem") for two-dimensional [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)"), which states that every [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected")[Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface") can be given one of three geometries ([Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry "Spherical geometry"), or [hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry")). In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure. The conjecture was proposed by William [Thurston (1982)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#CITEREFThurston1982), and implies several other conjectures, such as the [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture") and Thurston's [elliptization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptization_conjecture "Elliptization conjecture").

Thurston's [hyperbolization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolization_theorem "Hyperbolization theorem") implies that [Haken manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haken_manifold "Haken manifold") satisfy the geometrization conjecture. Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s and since then several complete proofs have appeared in print.

[Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman "Grigori Perelman") sketched a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 using [Ricci flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_flow "Ricci flow") with [surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory"). There are now several different manuscripts (see below) with details of the proof. The Poincaré conjecture and the [spherical space form conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_space_form_conjecture "Spherical space form conjecture") are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.

### Virtually fibered conjecture and Virtually Haken conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Virtually fibered conjecture and Virtually Haken conjecture")]

The **virtually fibered conjecture**, formulated by [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")[mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician")[William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston"), states that every [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold"), [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_manifold "Irreducible manifold"), [atoroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoroidal "Atoroidal") 3-manifold with infinite [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") has a finite [cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space "Covering space") which is a [surface bundle over the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_bundle_over_the_circle "Surface bundle over the circle").

The **virtually Haken conjecture** states that every [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_manifold "Compact manifold"), [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable_manifold "Orientable manifold"), [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_manifold "Irreducible manifold") three-dimensional manifold with infinite [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") is _virtually Haken_. That is, it has a finite cover (a [covering space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space "Covering space") with a finite-to-one covering map) that is a [Haken manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haken_manifold "Haken manifold").

In a posting on the ArXiv on 25 Aug 2009,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-arxiv.org-14)[Daniel Wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wise_(mathematician) "Daniel Wise (mathematician)") implicitly implied (by referring to a then unpublished longer manuscript) that he had proven the Virtually fibered conjecture for the case where the 3-manifold is closed, hyperbolic, and Haken. This was followed by a survey article in Electronic Research Announcements in Mathematical Sciences.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-15) Several more preprints[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-16) have followed, including the aforementioned longer manuscript by Wise.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-docs.google.com-17) In March 2012, during a conference at [Institut Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Institut Henri Poincaré") in Paris, [Ian Agol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Agol "Ian Agol") announced he could prove the [virtually Haken conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtually_Haken_conjecture "Virtually Haken conjecture") for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-18) The proof built on results of Kahn and Markovic[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-20) in their proof of the [Surface subgroup conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_subgroup_conjecture "Surface subgroup conjecture") and results of Wise in proving the Malnormal Special Quotient Theorem[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-docs.google.com-17) and results of Bergeron and Wise for the cubulation of groups.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-arxiv.org-14) Taken together with Wise's results, this implies the virtually fibered conjecture for all closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

### Simple loop conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: Simple loop conjecture")]

If ![Image 51: {\displaystyle f\colon S\rightarrow T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d80289dde6fdbc291452ee9ebc6098da8253d569) is a map of closed connected surfaces such that ![Image 52: {\displaystyle f_{\star }\colon \pi _{1}(S)\rightarrow \pi _{1}(T)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ee15e43bdbda00ce9e0c666cb24057189ed7aac) is not injective, then there exists a non-contractible simple closed curve ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \alpha \subset S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f61ac653602a2ba0eb98ef57e00a55fcc4090b93) such that ![Image 54: {\displaystyle f|_{a}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9ef58f3ecbc43819f3b34494b0b3820d9b5342bf) is homotopically trivial. This conjecture was proven by [David Gabai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gabai "David Gabai").

### Surface subgroup conjecture

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3-manifold&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Surface subgroup conjecture")]

The **surface subgroup conjecture** of [Friedhelm Waldhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedhelm_Waldhausen "Friedhelm Waldhausen") states that the fundamental group of every closed, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") has a surface subgroup. By "surface subgroup" we mean the fundamental group of a closed surface not the 2-sphere. This problem is listed as Problem 3.75 in [Robion Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robion_Kirby "Robion Kirby")'s problem list.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-21)

Assuming the [geometrization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture "Geometrization conjecture"), the only open case was that of closed [hyperbolic 3-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_3-manifold "Hyperbolic 3-manifold"). A proof of this case was announced in the Summer of 2009 by [Jeremy Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Kahn "Jeremy Kahn") and [Vladimir Markovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Markovic "Vladimir Markovic") and outlined in a talk August 4, 2009 at the FRG (Focused Research Group) Conference hosted by the University of Utah. A preprint appeared on the arxiv in October 2009.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-22) Their paper was published in the [Annals of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Mathematics "Annals of Mathematics") in 2012.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-23) In June 2012, Kahn and Markovic were given the [Clay Research Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Research_Award "Clay Research Award") by the [Clay Mathematics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Mathematics_Institute "Clay Mathematics Institute") at a ceremony in [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold#cite_note-24)
