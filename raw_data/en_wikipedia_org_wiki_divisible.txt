( June 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The divisors of 10 illustrated with Cuisenaire rods : 1, 2, 5, and 10 In mathematics , a divisor of an integer n , {\displaystyle n,} also called a factor of n , {\displaystyle n,} is an integer m {\displaystyle m} that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n .

{\displaystyle n.} [ 1 ] In this case, one also says that n {\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m .

{\displaystyle m.} An integer n {\displaystyle n} is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer m {\displaystyle m} if m {\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n {\displaystyle n} ; this implies dividing n {\displaystyle n} by m {\displaystyle m} leaves no remainder.

Definition [ edit ] An integer n {\displaystyle n} is divisible by a nonzero integer m {\displaystyle m} if there exists an integer k {\displaystyle k} such that n = k m .

{\displaystyle n=km.} This is written as m ∣ ∣ n .

{\displaystyle m\mid n.} This may be read as that m {\displaystyle m} divides n , {\displaystyle n,} m {\displaystyle m} is a divisor of n , {\displaystyle n,} m {\displaystyle m} is a factor of n , {\displaystyle n,} or n {\displaystyle n} is a multiple of m .

{\displaystyle m.} If m {\displaystyle m} does not divide n , {\displaystyle n,} then the notation is m ∤ n .

{\displaystyle m\not \mid n.} [ 2 ] [ 3 ] There are two conventions, distinguished by whether m {\displaystyle m} is permitted to be zero: With the convention without an additional constraint on m , {\displaystyle m,} m ∣ ∣ 0 {\displaystyle m\mid 0} for every integer m .

{\displaystyle m.} [ 2 ] [ 3 ] With the convention that m {\displaystyle m} be nonzero, m ∣ ∣ 0 {\displaystyle m\mid 0} for every nonzero integer m .

{\displaystyle m.} [ 4 ] [ 5 ] General [ edit ] Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although often the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.

1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called even , and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd .

1, −1, n {\displaystyle n} and − − n {\displaystyle -n} are known as the trivial divisors of n .

{\displaystyle n.} A divisor of n {\displaystyle n} that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor (or strict divisor [ 6 ] ). A nonzero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number , while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.

There are divisibility rules that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.

Examples [ edit ] Plot of the number of divisors of integers from 1 to 1000.

Prime numbers have exactly 2 divisors, and highly composite numbers are in bold.

7 is a divisor of 42 because 7 × × 6 = 42 , {\displaystyle 7\times 6=42,} so we can say 7 ∣ ∣ 42.

{\displaystyle 7\mid 42.} It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42.

The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, −2, 3, −3.

The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

The set of all positive divisors of 60, A = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 60 } , {\displaystyle A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\},} partially ordered by divisibility, has the Hasse diagram : Further notions and facts [ edit ] There are some elementary rules: If a ∣ ∣ b {\displaystyle a\mid b} and b ∣ ∣ c , {\displaystyle b\mid c,} then a ∣ ∣ c ; {\displaystyle a\mid c;} that is, divisibility is a transitive relation .

If a ∣ ∣ b {\displaystyle a\mid b} and b ∣ ∣ a , {\displaystyle b\mid a,} then a = b {\displaystyle a=b} or a = − − b .

{\displaystyle a=-b.} (That is, a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are associates .) If a ∣ ∣ b {\displaystyle a\mid b} and a ∣ ∣ c , {\displaystyle a\mid c,} then a ∣ ∣ ( b + c ) {\displaystyle a\mid (b+c)} holds, as does a ∣ ∣ ( b − − c ) .

{\displaystyle a\mid (b-c).} [ a ] However, if a ∣ ∣ b {\displaystyle a\mid b} and c ∣ ∣ b , {\displaystyle c\mid b,} then ( a + c ) ∣ ∣ b {\displaystyle (a+c)\mid b} does not always hold (for example, 2 ∣ ∣ 6 {\displaystyle 2\mid 6} and 3 ∣ ∣ 6 {\displaystyle 3\mid 6} but 5 does not divide 6).

a ∣ ∣ b ⟺ ⟺ a c ∣ ∣ b c {\displaystyle a\mid b\iff ac\mid bc} for nonzero c {\displaystyle c} . This follows immediately from writing k a = b ⟺ ⟺ k a c = b c {\displaystyle ka=b\iff kac=bc} .

If a ∣ ∣ b c , {\displaystyle a\mid bc,} and gcd ( a , b ) = 1 , {\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)=1,} then a ∣ ∣ c .

{\displaystyle a\mid c.} [ b ] This is called Euclid's lemma .

If p {\displaystyle p} is a prime number and p ∣ ∣ a b {\displaystyle p\mid ab} then p ∣ ∣ a {\displaystyle p\mid a} or p ∣ ∣ b .

{\displaystyle p\mid b.} A positive divisor of n {\displaystyle n} that is different from n {\displaystyle n} is called a proper divisor or an aliquot part of n {\displaystyle n} (for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3). A number that does not evenly divide n {\displaystyle n} but leaves a remainder is sometimes called an aliquant part of n .

{\displaystyle n.} An integer n > 1 {\displaystyle n>1} whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a prime number . Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.

Any positive divisor of n {\displaystyle n} is a product of prime divisors of n {\displaystyle n} raised to some power. This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic .

A number n {\displaystyle n} is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n , {\displaystyle n,} and abundant if this sum exceeds n .

{\displaystyle n.} The total number of positive divisors of n {\displaystyle n} is a multiplicative function d ( n ) , {\displaystyle d(n),} meaning that when two numbers m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} are relatively prime , then d ( m n ) = d ( m ) × × d ( n ) .

{\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n).} For instance, d ( 42 ) = 8 = 2 × × 2 × × 2 = d ( 2 ) × × d ( 3 ) × × d ( 7 ) {\displaystyle d(42)=8=2\times 2\times 2=d(2)\times d(3)\times d(7)} ; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} share a common divisor, then it might not be true that d ( m n ) = d ( m ) × × d ( n ) .

{\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n).} The sum of the positive divisors of n {\displaystyle n} is another multiplicative function σ σ ( n ) {\displaystyle \sigma (n)} (for example, σ σ ( 42 ) = 96 = 3 × × 4 × × 8 = σ σ ( 2 ) × × σ σ ( 3 ) × × σ σ ( 7 ) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 14 + 21 + 42 {\displaystyle \sigma (42)=96=3\times 4\times 8=\sigma (2)\times \sigma (3)\times \sigma (7)=1+2+3+6+7+14+21+42} ). Both of these functions are examples of divisor functions .

If the prime factorization of n {\displaystyle n} is given by n = p 1 ν ν 1 p 2 ν ν 2 ⋯ ⋯ p k ν ν k {\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{\nu _{1}}\,p_{2}^{\nu _{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{\nu _{k}}} then the number of positive divisors of n {\displaystyle n} is d ( n ) = ( ν ν 1 + 1 ) ( ν ν 2 + 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( ν ν k + 1 ) , {\displaystyle d(n)=(\nu _{1}+1)(\nu _{2}+1)\cdots (\nu _{k}+1),} and each of the divisors has the form p 1 μ μ 1 p 2 μ μ 2 ⋯ ⋯ p k μ μ k {\displaystyle p_{1}^{\mu _{1}}\,p_{2}^{\mu _{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{\mu _{k}}} where 0 ≤ ≤ μ μ i ≤ ≤ ν ν i {\displaystyle 0\leq \mu _{i}\leq \nu _{i}} for each 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ k .

{\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq k.} For every natural n , {\displaystyle n,} d ( n ) < 2 n .

{\displaystyle d(n)<2{\sqrt {n}}.} Also, [ 7 ] d ( 1 ) + d ( 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + d ( n ) = n ln ⁡ ⁡ n + ( 2 γ γ − − 1 ) n + O ( n ) , {\displaystyle d(1)+d(2)+\cdots +d(n)=n\ln n+(2\gamma -1)n+O({\sqrt {n}}),} where γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is Euler–Mascheroni constant .
One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer n has an average
number of divisors of about ln ⁡ ⁡ n .

{\displaystyle \ln n.} However, this is a result from the contributions of numbers with "abnormally many" divisors .

In abstract algebra [ edit ] Ring theory [ edit ] Main article: Divisibility (ring theory) Division lattice [ edit ] Main article: Division lattice In definitions that allow the divisor to be 0, the relation of divisibility turns the set N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } of non-negative integers into a partially ordered set that is a complete distributive lattice . The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation ∧ is given by the greatest common divisor and the join operation ∨ by the least common multiple . This lattice is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group Z.
