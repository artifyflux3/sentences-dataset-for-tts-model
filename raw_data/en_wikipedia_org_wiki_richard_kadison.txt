Career [ edit ] Born in New York City in 1925, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Kadison was a Gustave C. Kuemmerle Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Pennsylvania .

[ 4 ] Kadison was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (elected in 1996), [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters (elected 1974) [ 2 ] and of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters .

[ 7 ] He was a 1969 Guggenheim Fellow .

[ 8 ] Kadison was awarded the 1999 Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement by the American Mathematical Society .

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

[ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] Kadison was a skilled gymnast with a specialty in rings, making the 1952 US Olympic Team but later withdrawing due to an injury.

[ 11 ] He married Karen M. Holm on June 5, 1956, and they had one son, Lars.

[ 11 ] Kadison died after a short illness on August 22, 2018.
