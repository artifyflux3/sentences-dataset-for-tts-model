Robertson is an American information visualization expert and senior researcher, Visualization and Interaction (VIBE) Research Group, Microsoft Research. With Stuart K. Card , Jock D. Mackinlay and others he invented a number of Information Visualization techniques.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Robertson has worked as a faculty member of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie-Mellon University , a senior scientist at Thinking Machines , and a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman .

[ 2 ] Before his current position at Microsoft he was principal scientist at Xerox PARC . Since 1996 he is a principal researcher in the Visualization and Interaction group at Microsoft Research.

He is an ACM Fellow and manages a project on 3D User Interfaces and Information Visualization. He is associate editor of the Journal of Information Visualization .

Robertson's research interests are "user interfaces, 3D interactive animation, 3D graphics, information visualization, intelligent information access, multimedia, and hypermedia", [ 2 ] see also: Connection Machine and Gender HCI Publications [ edit ] Articles, a selection: 1972.
