For the suborbital flight tests of the upper stage, see List of Starship upper stage flight tests .

SpaceX Starship during Starship flight test 2 Since April 2023, the SpaceX Starship has been launched 9 times, with 4 successes and 5 failures. The American company has developed Starship with the intention of lowering launch costs using economies of scale .

[ 1 ] It aims to achieve this by reusing both rocket stages , increasing payload mass to orbit, increasing launch frequency, creating a mass-manufacturing pipeline and adapting it to a wide range of space missions.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Starship is the latest project in SpaceX 's reusable launch system development program and plan to colonize Mars , and also one of two landing systems selected by NASA for the Artemis program's crewed Lunar missions.

SpaceX calls the entire launch vehicle "Starship", which consists of the Super Heavy first stage (booster) and the ambiguously-named Starship second stage (ship).

[ 4 ] There are three versions of Starship: Block 1 , (also known as Starship 1, Version 1, or V1) which is retired, Block 2 , which first flew in Starship flight test 7 , and Block 3 , which is still in development. As of January 2025, 6 Block 1 vehicles and 3 Block 2 vehicles have flown; [ 5 ] with the last Block 1 ship completing its mission in November 2024 ( Starship flight test 6 ).

[ 6 ] Both Starship's first and second stages are planned to be reusable , and are planned to be caught by the tower arms used to assemble the rocket at the pad.

[ 7 ] This capability was first demonstrated during Starship's fifth flight test, using a Block 1 booster.

[ 8 ] Launch statistics [ edit ] Starship vehicles have been launched 9 times, resulting in 4 successes ( 44%) and 5 failures ( 56%). Starship Block 1 was launched six times between April 2023 and November 2024, with Block 1 vehicles being retired ahead of the seventh flight.

[ 9 ] Block 2 boosters are expected to fly further into the future.

Date and time ( UTC ) Version, booster [ a ] Version, ship [ a ] Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome Booster landing Ship landing 1 April 20, 2023 13:33:09 [ 11 ] Block 1 B7 Block 1 S24 Starbase , OLP-1 — — Transatmospheric [ 12 ] SpaceX Failure Precluded Precluded For the first flight test with a ship integrated with the Super Heavy booster , the booster was planned to make a powered splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, and the ship would enter a transatmospheric Earth orbit before reentering and impacting the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii. Three engines were shut down before the booster lifted off the launch mount, with at least three more engines shutting down during booster powered flight. The vehicle eventually entered an uncontrolled spin before stage separation due to loss of thrust vector control . The flight termination system activated with the intent to destroy the vehicle immediately, but the vehicle remained intact until T+3:59, more than 40 seconds after activation of the flight termination system.

[ 13 ] SpaceX declared this flight a success, as their primary goal was to only clear the pad.

[ 14 ] The launch resulted in extensive damage to the orbital launch mount and the infrastructures around it, including the propellant tank farm.

[ 15 ] 2 November 18, 2023 13:02:50 [ 16 ] Block 1 B9 Block 1 S25 Starbase , OLP-1 — — Transatmospheric [ 17 ] SpaceX Failure Failure (gulf) Precluded The second flight test of Starship had a test flight profile similar to the first flight, with the addition of a new hot-staging technique and the introduction of a water deluge system as part of the ground support equipment at the launch pad. During the first stage ascent, all 33 engines fired to full duration. Starship and Super Heavy successfully accomplished a hot-staging separation . After initiating a flip maneuver and initiating boostback burn, several booster engines began shutting down due to filter blockage.

[ 18 ] An energetic failure of one engine caused the booster to explode.

[ 18 ] The upper stage ascended nominally for another six minutes.

[ 19 ] A leak in the aft section developed during a planned liquid oxygen venting, resulting in a combustion event that interrupted communication between the craft’s flight computers, causing full engine shutdown, [ 18 ] after which the flight termination system successfully destroyed the ship as it reached an altitude of ~148 km and velocity of ~24,000 km/h.

[ 18 ] 2024 [ edit ] Flight No.

Date and time ( UTC ) Version, booster [ a ] Version, ship [ a ] Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome Booster landing Ship landing 3 March 14, 2024 13:25:00 [ 20 ] Block 1 B10 Block 1 S28 Starbase , OLP-1 — — Suborbital [ 21 ] SpaceX Success Failure (gulf) Failure (ocean) The third flight test of Starship included a full-duration burn of the second-stage engines, an internal propellant-transfer demonstration, and a test of the Starlink dispenser door. If the test sequence had progressed further, additional tests would have included an in-space relight followed by a hard splashdown of the ship in the Indian Ocean, approximately 1 hour, 4 minutes after launch.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] The booster successfully propelled the spacecraft to staging, with 13 engines successfully ignited for a boostback burn, though 6 engines failed a few seconds before the end of the burn. However, several minutes later, during the landing burn ignition, only three engines ignited, and the booster was destroyed at an altitude of 462 meters above the ocean.

[ 23 ] The booster malfunctions were attributed to continuing filter blockage issues.

[ 24 ] The spacecraft trajectory was suborbital, with a 234 km (145 mi) apogee and −50 km (−31 mi) perigee, [ 25 ] although the ship did reach orbital speed .

[ 26 ] A scheduled restart of a Raptor engine for a prograde burn test did not occur, which would have resulted in a 50 km (31 mi) perigee and somewhat later entry into the atmosphere .

[ 25 ] At reentry, Ship had an uncontrolled roll. Minutes into atmospheric re-entry, Ship 28's telemetry cut off, leading SpaceX to conclude the ship had disintegrated prior to its planned splashdown.

4 June 6, 2024 12:50:00 [ 27 ] Block 1 B11 Block 1 S29 Starbase , OLP-1 — — Suborbital [ 28 ] SpaceX Success Controlled (gulf) Controlled (ocean) The fourth flight test of Starship flew a similar trajectory to Flight 3, with the addition of a ship landing burn and soft splashdown. One Raptor engine was lost shortly after liftoff, but the booster still managed to perform in accordance to its flight profile and conduct a successful controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico [ 29 ] on a "virtual tower", in preparation for a catch by the launch tower during Flight 5.

[ 30 ] The spacecraft performed a successful reentry despite severe forward flap damage and conducted a successful controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean, [ 31 ] within the target region but 6 kilometers from the center.

[ 32 ] 5 October 13, 2024 12:25:00 [ 33 ] Block 1 B12 Block 1 S30 Starbase , OLP-1 — — Suborbital [ 34 ] SpaceX Success Success (OLP-1) Controlled (ocean) The fifth flight test was the first to achieve booster recovery and complete a flight without engine failures. After stage separation, the booster returned to the launch site and was successfully caught by the launch tower arms despite damage to a chine during descent. Following a coast phase, Ship 30 reentered the atmosphere, performed a successful reentry despite forward flap damage, and executed a landing burn, splashing down precisely at its target in the Indian Ocean. A buoy camera captured Ship 30 exploding shortly after contact with the water.

[ 8 ] 6 November 19, 2024 22:00:00 [ 35 ] Block 1 B13 Block 1 S31 Starbase , OLP-1 Plush banana Un­known Transatmospheric [ 36 ] SpaceX Success Controlled (gulf) Abort (OLP‑1) Controlled (ocean) The sixth flight test was the second attempt at booster recovery and the final use of a Block 1 upper stage. Heat shield tiles were removed from key areas of Ship 31, which also lacked the ablative backup layer from Flight 5. Following stage separation, the booster was diverted to the ocean near the launch site due to damage to the catch tower during liftoff. The ship completed an in-space engine relight test and re-entered, splashing down in the Indian Ocean during daylight—a first for Starship. Despite a reduced heat shield and steeper re-entry trajectory, Ship 31 sustained minimal flap damage. The flight also carried Starship's first payload, a stuffed banana serving as the zero-gravity indicator, which remained onboard throughout the mission.

[ 37 ] 2025 [ edit ] Flight No.

Date and time ( UTC ) Version, booster [ a ] Version, ship [ a ] Launch site Payload Payload mass Orbit Customer Launch outcome Booster landing Ship landing 7 January 16, 2025 22:37:00 [ 38 ] Block 2 B14‑1 [ 39 ] Block 2 S33 [ 9 ] Starbase , OLP-1 10 Starlink simulator satellites [ 40 ] ~20,000 kg (44,000 lb) [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Transatmospheric [ 43 ] SpaceX Failure Success (OLP-1) Precluded The seventh flight test of Starship was to follow a trajectory similar to the previous mission, with a planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean approximately one hour post-launch.

[ 44 ] It marked the inaugural flight of a Block 2 Ship, featuring structural, avionics, and other upgrades.

[ 9 ] The mission also aimed to test the deployment system for 10 Starlink mass simulator satellites. During the Ship's initial burn, its engines experienced premature shutdowns due to a propellant leak larger than the Ship's systems could handle, followed by a total loss of telemetry. This was attributed to a "harmonic response" of a magnitude greater than was seen during testing.

[ 45 ] The vehicle subsequently exploded over the Turks and Caicos Islands , prompting airspace closures in the region for over an hour.

[ 46 ] SpaceX later concluded that the autonomous flight safety system destroyed the Ship about three minutes after loss of telemetry, and claimed that none of its remains left the pre-determined safety corridor for the launch.

[ 45 ] The booster successfully returned to the launch site, where it was caught by the launch tower arms on OLP-1, becoming the second booster recovered after B12, as well as the first booster to be recovered without noticeable damage to the chines.

[ 46 ] 8 March 6, 2025 23:31:02 [ 47 ] Block 2 B15‑1 [ 44 ] Block 2 S34 [ 39 ] Starbase , OLP-1 4 Starlink simulator satellites [ 47 ] ~8,000 kg (18,000 lb) [ 47 ] Transatmospheric SpaceX Failure Success (OLP-1) Precluded The eighth flight test of Starship was to follow a trajectory similar to the previous mission, with a planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean. During the Ship's initial burn, its engines experienced premature shutdowns due to hardware failure on one of the center engines, [ 48 ] causing it to spin out of control and eventually lose communications. The booster was successfully commanded to return to the launch site despite having two engines fail to relight for its boostback burn. To compensate the booster performed a two second longer boostback burn than seen on the previous flight. One of the failed engines managed to reignite for the catch, which was successful.

[ 47 ] 9 May 27, 2025 23:36:28 [ 49 ] Block 2 B14-2 [ 50 ] Block 2 S35 [ 51 ] Starbase , OLP-1 8 Starlink simulator satellites [ 49 ] ~16,000 kg (35,000 lb) [ 49 ] Transatmospheric SpaceX Failure Failure (gulf) Failure (ocean) The ninth flight test of Starship was the first to reuse a Super Heavy booster, which completed ascent and boostback into a high angle of attack but was lost before splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.

[ 52 ] The ship reached engine cutoff but failed to deploy its payload of eight Starlink simulator satellites [ 49 ] and experienced a fuel leak, resulting in a loss of control. The ship was passivated before reentry and broke up over the Indian Ocean.

[ 52 ] Future launches [ edit ] Future launches are listed chronologically when firm plans are in place. Launches are expected to take place "no earlier than" (NET) the listed date.
