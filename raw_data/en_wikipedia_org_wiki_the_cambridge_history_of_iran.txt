Fisher , Ilya Gershevitch , Ehsan Yarshater , Richard Nelson Frye , John Andrew Boyle , Peter Jackson , Laurence Lockhart , Peter Avery , Gavin Hambly, Charles P. Melville (eds.) Country United Kingdom Language English Discipline History of Iran Publisher Cambridge University Press Published 1968–1989 No. of books 8 OCLC 159881392 The Cambridge History of Iran is a multi-volume survey of Iranian history published in the United Kingdom by Cambridge University Press . The seven volumes cover "the history and historical geography of the land which is present-day Iran, as well as other territories inhabited by peoples of Iranian descent, from prehistoric times up to the present.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The publication started in 1968 and in 1989 the last volume was published. The idea of publishing such a survey of Iranian history and culture was conceived in 1959 by Arthur J. Arberry . According to the scholar Hubert Darke, who served as editorial secretary to the project between 1970 and 1993, "The series was planned to be not simply a political history of Iran but to survey the culture which has flourished in the Iranian region and this culture's contribution to the civilization of the world. All aspects of the religious, philosophical, economic, scientific, and artistic elements in Iranian civilization have been studied, but with some emphasis on the geographical and ecological factors that have contributed to its special character." [ 1 ] The series consists of seven volumes. Volume 3 was published in two parts.
