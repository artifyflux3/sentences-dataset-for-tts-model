Math ability is passed from parent to child [ 1 ] with the most famous example being the Bernoulli family .

[ 2 ] This second generation phenomenon also holds in physics [ 3 ] but in that field the Nobel Prize in Physics gives a tool for tracking it, since it has been given out for more than 120 years, and there are on average more than two Nobel Prizes in Physics given each year.

[ 4 ] There is no comparable award in mathematics [ 5 ] but perusing (for example) the MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive [ 6 ] list of biographies enables the construction of a similar list of notable two-generation pairs of mathematicians.

The following is a list of parent-child pairs who both made contributions to mathematics significant enough to be noted in the citation for a prestigious prize, in an obituary in a major math journal, or in a similarly authoritative source. All are father-son except for Emmy Noether and Cathleen Morawetz .  The list is in chronological order by birth date of the parent.
