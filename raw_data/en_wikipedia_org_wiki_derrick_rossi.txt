Rossi (born 5 February 1966), [ 1 ] is a Canadian stem cell biologist and entrepreneur . He is a co-founder of the pharmaceutical company Moderna .

Early life and education [ edit ] Rossi was born in Toronto as the youngest of five children of a Maltese immigrant family.

[ 2 ] His father Fred worked in auto body shops for 50 years [ 3 ] and his mother Agnes co-owned a Maltese bakery.

[ 2 ] Rossi attended the Dr. Norman Bethune High School in Scarborough where he early discovered his passion for molecular biology .

[ 2 ] He then did his undergraduate and master's degrees in molecular genetics at the University of Toronto .

[ 4 ] He earned his Ph.D.

from the University of Helsinki in 2003 and held a post-doc position from 2003 to 2007 at Stanford University in Irving Weissman ’s lab.

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Rossi in 2007 [ 6 ] was appointed Associate Professor at the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University .

[ 7 ] At the same time he was a principal faculty member of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an investigator at the Immune Disease Institute (IDI), [ 8 ] as well as in the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the Children’s Hospital Boston .

[ 9 ] Moderna was founded in 2010, based on discovery that pluripotent stem cells can be transformed and reprogrammed.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Time magazine cited this pluripotent discovery as one of the top ten medical breakthroughs of the year.

[ 12 ] In 2013 Rossi, Chien and their team reported that they "were able to improve heart function in mice and enhance their long-term survival with a "redirection of their [stem cell] differentiation toward cardiovascular cell types" in a significant step towards regenerative therapeutics for Moderna.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] In the same year and on the strength of the same paper Moderna was able to partner with AstraZeneca in exchange for $240 million "in upfront cash (plus much more in potential milestone payments)", and then received from other investors $110 million.

[ 13 ] In 2014 Rossi retired from his functions at the board and as a scientific advisor at Moderna.

[ 2 ] In 2015 Rossi was scientific co-founder of Intellia Therapeutics . In 2016 Rossi co-founded Magenta Therapeutics.

[ 4 ] Rossi was involved in the foundation of Stelexis Therapeutics in 2017, [ 15 ] which develops new medication for treating cancerous stem cells.

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In 2018 Rossi retired from all of his Harvard positions in order to focus on his activities as an entrepreneur.

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] Rossi served as the interim CEO of the New York Stem Cell Foundation from October 2022 to January 2024.

[ 7 ] Rossi is also CEO of Convelo Therapeutics .

[ 17 ] Scientific contributions [ edit ] Rossi develops and promotes new therapies using biotechnological methods thus contributing to novel approaches in regenerative medicine .

[ 7 ] His research focussed on different aspects of stem cell biology.

[ 4 ] In order to avoid ethical issues related to the use and exploitation of human stem cells, Rossi based his developments on the results of Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman on mRNA . He succeeded in finding investors for his plans to transfer these findings into new medications and vaccinations by founding Moderna.

[ 18 ] Rossi is on record as writing of his synthetic modified mRNA: "because our technology is RNA based, it completely eliminates the risk of genomic integration and insertional mutagenesis inherent to all DNA-based methodologies." [ 19 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] In 2021 he was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award in the category "Scientific Research".
