Not to be confused with another name for a Gröbner basis .

Every vector a in three dimensions is a linear combination of the standard basis vectors i , j and k .

In mathematics , the standard basis (also called natural basis or canonical basis ) of a coordinate vector space (such as R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} or C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} ) is the set of vectors, each of whose components are all zero, except one that equals 1.

[ 1 ] For example, in the case of the Euclidean plane R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} formed by the pairs ( x , y ) of real numbers , the standard basis is formed by the vectors e x = ( 1 , 0 ) , e y = ( 0 , 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{x}=(1,0),\quad \mathbf {e} _{y}=(0,1).} Similarly, the standard basis for the three-dimensional space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is formed by vectors e x = ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , e y = ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , e z = ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{x}=(1,0,0),\quad \mathbf {e} _{y}=(0,1,0),\quad \mathbf {e} _{z}=(0,0,1).} Here the vector e x points in the x direction, the vector e y points in the y direction, and the vector e z points in the z direction.  There are several common notations for standard-basis vectors, including { e x , e y , e z }, { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 }, { i , j , k }, and { x , y , z }. These vectors are sometimes written with a hat to emphasize their status as unit vectors ( standard unit vectors ).

These vectors are a basis in the sense that any other vector can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of these.

[ 2 ] For example, every vector v in three-dimensional space can be written uniquely as v x e x + v y e y + v z e z , {\displaystyle v_{x}\,\mathbf {e} _{x}+v_{y}\,\mathbf {e} _{y}+v_{z}\,\mathbf {e} _{z},} the scalars v x {\displaystyle v_{x}} , v y {\displaystyle v_{y}} , v z {\displaystyle v_{z}} being the scalar components of the vector v .

In the n - dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the standard basis consists of n distinct vectors { e i : 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ n } , {\displaystyle \{\mathbf {e} _{i}:1\leq i\leq n\},} where e i denotes the vector with a 1 in the i th coordinate and 0's elsewhere.

Standard bases can be defined for other vector spaces , whose definition involves coefficients , such as polynomials and matrices .  In both cases, the standard basis consists of the elements of the space such that all coefficients but one are 0 and the non-zero one is 1. For polynomials, the standard basis thus consists of the monomials and is commonly called monomial basis . For matrices M m × × n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}_{m\times n}} , the standard basis consists of the m × n -matrices with exactly one non-zero entry, which is 1. For example, the standard basis for 2×2 matrices is formed by the 4 matrices e 11 = ( 1 0 0 0 ) , e 12 = ( 0 1 0 0 ) , e 21 = ( 0 0 1 0 ) , e 22 = ( 0 0 0 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{11}={\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}},\quad \mathbf {e} _{12}={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}},\quad \mathbf {e} _{21}={\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&0\end{pmatrix}},\quad \mathbf {e} _{22}={\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}.} Properties [ edit ] By definition, the standard basis is a sequence of orthogonal unit vectors . In other words, it is an ordered and orthonormal basis.

However, an ordered orthonormal basis is not necessarily a standard basis. For instance the two vectors representing a 30° rotation of the 2D standard basis described above, i.e. , v 1 = ( 3 2 , 1 2 ) {\displaystyle v_{1}=\left({{\sqrt {3}} \over 2},{1 \over 2}\right)\,} v 2 = ( 1 2 , − − 3 2 ) {\displaystyle v_{2}=\left({1 \over 2},{-{\sqrt {3}} \over 2}\right)\,} are also orthogonal unit vectors, but they are not aligned with the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system , so the basis with these vectors does not meet the definition of standard basis.

Generalizations [ edit ] There is a standard basis also for the ring of polynomials in n indeterminates over a field , namely the monomials .

All of the preceding are special cases of the indexed family ( e i ) i ∈ ∈ I = ( ( δ δ i j ) j ∈ ∈ I ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle {(e_{i})}_{i\in I}=((\delta _{ij})_{j\in I})_{i\in I}} where I {\displaystyle I} is any set and δ δ i j {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}} is the Kronecker delta , equal to zero whenever i ≠ j and equal to 1 if i = j .
This family is the canonical basis of the R -module ( free module ) R ( I ) {\displaystyle R^{(I)}} of all families f = ( f i ) {\displaystyle f=(f_{i})} from I into a ring R , which are zero except for a finite number of indices , if we interpret 1 as 1 R , the unit in R .

[ 3 ] Other usages [ edit ] The existence of other 'standard' bases has become a topic of interest in algebraic geometry , beginning with work of Hodge from 1943 on Grassmannians . It is now a part of representation theory called standard monomial theory . The idea of standard basis in the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is established by the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem .

Gröbner bases are also sometimes called standard bases.

In physics , the standard basis vectors for a given Euclidean space are sometimes referred to as the versors of the axes of the corresponding Cartesian coordinate system.
