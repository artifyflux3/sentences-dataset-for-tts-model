The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the governing document of India, thus turning the nation from a dominion into a republic , following its independence from the British Raj in 1947. The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950. The date was chosen because the Indian National Congress had proclaimed Purna Swaraj ( complete independence ) on that date in 1930.

Republic Day is commonly associated with parades , political speeches, cultural events and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history , government , and the traditions of India.

Background [ edit ] India achieved independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the success of the Indian independence movement which was led by Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi . This was enacted through the Indian Independence Act 1947 , an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of the British Commonwealth .

[ 1 ] India became a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general . Without a standalone constitution, its laws were based on the Government of India Act 1935 and governed by the Constituent Assembly of India .

[ 2 ] On 29 August 1947, a seven-member drafting committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr.

B R Ambedkar as chairman.

[ 3 ] A draft constitution prepared by the committee was submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948.

[ 4 ] After the draft was discussed and debated, the constituent assembly adopted the constitution on 26 November 1949.

[ 5 ] The major part of the constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950 with Rajendra Prasad becoming the first President of India and the constituent assembly became the Parliament of India under the transitional provisions of the new constitution.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The date was chosen as the Indian National Congress proclaimed Purna Swaraj (complete independence) on this day in 1930.

[ 8 ] Customs and celebrations [ edit ] On the eve of Republic Day, the President addresses the nation.

[ 9 ] On Republic Day, the President of India unfurls the national flag in the national capital New Delhi with the Governors and Lieutenant Governors unfurling the flag at the respective states and union territories .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Parade [ edit ] Further information: Delhi Republic Day parade First president Rajendra Prasad readies to take part in the first Republic Day parade on Rajpath in New Delhi, in 1950 The main Republic Day celebrations are held in New Delhi, at the Kartavya Path , a ceremonial boulevard that runs from Rashtrapati Bhavan on Raisina Hill through India Gate .

[ 13 ] The event is hosted by the President of India with ceremonious parades and cultural events.

[ 15 ] The President who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces , takes the salute from various units of the army , navy , air force , para-military and police forces.

[ 16 ] Flypast [ edit ] One of the most anticipated features of the Republic Day celebrations is the Indian Air Force flypast, which symbolically concludes the parade. The Indian Air Force’s Republic Day flypast has evolved dramatically since it first took shape. What began with Dakotas and Harvards has expanded to include formations of MiG-21s, Jaguars, Su-30MKIs, and Rafales. Special segments such as "Trishul," "Arrowhead," and "Brahmastra" formations reflect doctrinal and technological advancements. The flypast is now a highlight of the parade, often showcasing the IAF’s newest acquisitions and combat capabilities.

[ 17 ] Chief-guest [ edit ] Main article: List of chief guests at Delhi Republic Day parade Every year, a head of state or government of another country is invited as the state guest of honor for the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi. The guest country is often chosen on the basis of strategic, economic and political interests. French President Emmanuel Macron was the chief guest at the celebrations that marked India's 75th Republic Day.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 2025, Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto was the chief guest of the Republic day.

[ 20 ] Beating retreat [ edit ] The Beating Retreat ceremony, conducted on the evening of 29 January, marks the end of Republic Day festivities. It is performed by the bands of the three wings of the Indian armed forces at Vijay Chowk .

[ 21 ] The President of India is escorted by the President's Bodyguard and post a ceremonial salute, the Indian National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana is played. Military bands then play popular tunes like Abide With Me , Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo and Saare Jahan Se Achcha at the end.
