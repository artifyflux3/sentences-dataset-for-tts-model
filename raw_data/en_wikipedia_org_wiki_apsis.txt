The apsides refer to the farthest (2) and nearest (3) points reached by an orbiting [planetary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary-mass_object "Planetary-mass object") (2 and 3) with respect to a [primary, or host, body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_body "Primary body") (1)

An **apsis** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[ἁψίς](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%81%CF%88%CE%AF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ἁψίς")_(\_hapsís\_)_'arch, vault' ([third declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_declension "Third declension")); pl.**apsides**[_AP-sih-deez_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"))[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-2) is the farthest or nearest point in the [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") of a [planetary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary-mass_object "Planetary-mass object") about its [primary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_body "Primary body"). The **line of apsides** (also called **apse line,** or **major axis of the orbit**) is the line connecting the two [extreme values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_and_minimum "Maximum and minimum").

Apsides pertaining to orbits around different bodies have distinct names to differentiate themselves from other apsides. Apsides pertaining to [geocentric orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit"), orbits around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), are at the farthest point called the _**apogee**_, and at the nearest point the _**perigee**_, as with orbits of satellites and the Moon around Earth. Apsides pertaining to orbits around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") are named _**aphelion**_ for the farthest and _**perihelion**_ for the nearest point in a [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-3) Earth's two apsides are the farthest point, _aphelion_, and the nearest point, _perihelion_, of its orbit around the host Sun. The terms _aphelion_ and _perihelion_ apply in the same way to the orbits of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") and the other [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), the [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"), and the [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").

General description
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: General description")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Periapsis_apoapsis.png/330px-Periapsis_apoapsis.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Periapsis_apoapsis.png)

The two-body system of interacting [elliptic orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit"): The smaller, satellite body (blue) orbits the [primary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)") (yellow); both are in elliptic orbits around their [common center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") (or [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter")), (red +).

 ∗Periapsis and apoapsis as distances: the smallest and largest distances between the orbiter and its host body.

There are two apsides in any [elliptic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit"). The name for each apsis is created from the prefixes _ap-_, _apo-_ (from ἀπ(ό)_, (ap(o)-)_'away from') for the farthest or _peri-_ (from περί _(peri-)_'near') for the closest point to the [primary body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_body "Primary body"), with a suffix that describes the primary body. The suffix for Earth is _-gee_, so the apsides' names are _apogee_ and _perigee_. For the Sun, the suffix is _-helion_, so the names are _aphelion_ and _perihelion_.

According to [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"), all periodic orbits are ellipses. The barycenter of the two bodies may lie well within the bigger body—e.g., the Earth–Moon barycenter is about 75% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-4) If, compared to the larger mass, the smaller mass is negligible (e.g., for satellites), then the [orbital parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements") are independent of the smaller mass.

When used as a suffix—that is, _-apsis_—the term can refer to the two distances from the primary body to the orbiting body when the latter is located: 1) at the _periapsis_ point, or 2) at the _apoapsis_ point (compare both graphics, second figure). The line of apsides denotes the distance of the line that joins the nearest and farthest points across an orbit; it also refers simply to the extreme range of an object orbiting a host body (see top figure; see third figure).

In [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics "Orbital mechanics"), the apsides technically refer to the distance measured between the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") of the 2-body system and the center of mass of the orbiting body. However, in the case of a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), the terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") of the spacecraft above the surface of the central body (assuming a constant, standard reference radius).

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Angular_Parameters_of_Elliptical_Orbit.png/330px-Angular_Parameters_of_Elliptical_Orbit.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Angular_Parameters_of_Elliptical_Orbit.png)

[Keplerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_orbit "Kepler orbit")[orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements"): point _G_, the nearest point of approach of an orbiting body, is the pericenter (also periapsis) of an orbit; point _H_, the farthest point of the orbiting body, is the apocenter (also apoapsis) of the orbit; and the red line between them is the line of apsides.

The words "pericenter" and "apocenter" are often seen, although periapsis/apoapsis are preferred in technical usage.

*   For generic situations where the primary is not specified, the terms _pericenter_ and _apocenter_ are used for naming the extreme points of orbits (see table, top figure); _periapsis_ and _apoapsis_ (or _apapsis_) are equivalent alternatives, but these terms also frequently refer to distances—that is, the smallest and largest distances between the orbiter and its host body (see second figure).
*   For a body orbiting the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), the point of least distance is the _perihelion_ (), and the point of greatest distance is the _aphelion_ ();[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Sun-5) when discussing orbits around other stars the terms become _periastron_ and _apastron_.
*   When discussing a satellite of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), including the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), the point of least distance is the _perigee_ (), and of greatest distance, the _apogee_ (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"): Γῆ (_Gē_), "land" or "earth").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-6)
*   For objects in [lunar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit"), the point of least distance are called the _pericynthion_ () and the greatest distance the _apocynthion_ (). The terms _perilune_ and _apolune_, as well as _periselene_ and _aposelene_ are also used.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-nasaglossary-7) Since the Moon has no natural satellites this only applies to man-made objects.

The words _perihelion_ and _aphelion_ were coined by [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler")[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-8) to describe the orbital motions of the planets around the Sun. The words are formed from the prefixes _peri-_ (Greek: _περί_, near) and _apo-_ (Greek: _ἀπό_, away from), affixed to the Greek word for the Sun, (_ἥλιος_, or _hēlíos_).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Sun-5)

Various related terms are used for other [celestial objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_body "Celestial body"). The suffixes _-gee_, _-helion_, _-astron_ and _-galacticon_ are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the Earth, Sun, stars, and the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center") respectively. The suffix _-jove_ is occasionally used for Jupiter, but _-saturnium_ has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for Saturn. The _-gee_ form is also used as a generic closest-approach-to "any planet" term—instead of applying it only to Earth.

During the [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program"), the terms _pericynthion_ and _apocynthion_ were used when referring to [orbiting the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit"); they reference Cynthia, an alternative name for the Greek Moon goddess [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis "Artemis").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-9) More recently, during the [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program "Artemis program"), the terms _perilune_ and _apolune_ have been used.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-10)

Regarding black holes, the term peribothron was first used in a 1976 paper by J. Frank and M. J. Rees,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-11) who credit W. R. Stoeger for suggesting creating a term using the greek word for pit: "bothron". The terms _perimelasma_ and _apomelasma_ (from a Greek root) were used by physicist and science-fiction author [Geoffrey A. Landis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_A._Landis "Geoffrey A. Landis") in a story published in 1998,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Asimov's-12) thus appearing before _perinigricon_ and _aponigricon_ (from Latin) in the scientific literature in 2002.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-13)

### Terminology summary

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Terminology summary")]

The suffixes shown below may be added to prefixes _peri-_ or _apo-_ to form unique names of apsides for the orbiting bodies of the indicated host/[(primary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)") system. However, only for the Earth, Moon and Sun systems are the unique suffixes commonly used. [Exoplanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") studies commonly use _-astron_, but typically, for other host systems the generic suffix, _-apsis_, is used instead.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-14)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

Perihelion and aphelion
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Perihelion and aphelion")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Perihelion-Aphelion.svg/250px-Perihelion-Aphelion.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perihelion-Aphelion.svg)

Diagram of a body's direct [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") with its nearest (perihelion) and farthest (aphelion) points

The perihelion (q) and aphelion (Q) are the nearest and farthest points respectively of a body's direct [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").

Comparing [osculating elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_elements "Osculating elements") at a specific [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)") to those at a different epoch will generate differences. The time-of-perihelion-passage as one of six osculating elements is not an exact prediction (other than for a generic [two-body model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem")) of the actual minimum distance to the Sun using the [full dynamical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem"). Precise predictions of perihelion passage require [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration "Numerical integration").

### Inner planets and outer planets

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Inner planets and outer planets")]

The two images below show the orbits, [orbital nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node "Orbital node"), and positions of perihelion (q) and aphelion (Q) for the planets of the Solar System[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-:0-18) as seen from above the northern pole of [Earth's ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic"), which is [coplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar "Coplanar") with [Earth's orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)"). The planets travel counterclockwise around the Sun and for each planet, the blue part of their orbit travels north of the ecliptic plane, the pink part travels south, and dots mark perihelion (green) and aphelion (orange).

The first image (below-left) features the _inner_ planets, situated outward from the Sun as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The _reference_ Earth-orbit is colored yellow and represents the [orbital plane of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)"). At the time of vernal equinox, the Earth is at the bottom of the figure. The second image (below-right) shows the _outer_ planets, being Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The orbital nodes are the two end points of the ["line of nodes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node#Node_distinction "Orbital node") where a planet's tilted orbit intersects the plane of reference;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-darlinglon-19) here they may be 'seen' as the points where the blue section of an orbit meets the pink.

The perihelion (green) and aphelion (orange) points of the [outer planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_planets "Outer planets") of the Solar System

The chart shows the extreme range—from the closest approach (perihelion) to farthest point (aphelion)—of several orbiting [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_bodies "Celestial bodies") of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"): the planets, the known dwarf planets, including [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)"), and [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet"). The length of the horizontal bars correspond to the extreme range of the orbit of the indicated body around the Sun. These extreme distances (between perihelion and aphelion) are _the lines of apsides_ of the orbits of various objects around a host body.

Distances of selected bodies of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") from the Sun. The left and right edges of each bar correspond to the [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion") and [aphelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion "Aphelion") of the body, respectively, hence long bars denote high [orbital eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity"). The radius of the Sun is 0.7 million km, and the radius of Jupiter (the largest planet) is 0.07 million km, both too small to resolve on this image.

### Earth perihelion and aphelion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Earth perihelion and aphelion")]

In the 21st century, the Earth reaches perihelion in early January, approximately 14 days after the [December solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_solstice "December solstice"). At perihelion, the Earth's center is about 0.9833[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (147,100,000[km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre"); 91,400,000[mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile"))[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Tanner-20) from the Sun's center. In contrast, the Earth reaches aphelion currently in early July, approximately 14 days after the [June solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_solstice "June solstice"). The aphelion distance between the Earth's and Sun's centers is currently about 1.01664[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (152,087,000[km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre"); 94,503,000[mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Tanner-20)

The dates of perihelion and aphelion change over a century due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles "Milankovitch cycles"). In the short-term, such dates can vary up to 3 days from one year to another as with aphelion on 3 July 2025 and 6 July 2026. This short-term variation is due to the presence of the Moon: while the Earth–Moon [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") is moving on a stable orbit around the Sun, the position of the Earth's center which is on average about 4,700 kilometres (2,900 mi) from the barycenter, could be shifted in any direction from it—and this affects the timing of the actual closest approach between the Sun's and the Earth's centers (which in turn defines the timing of perihelion in a given year).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-21) On a longer time scale, the last July 3 aphelion is in 2060, and the last January 2 perihelion is in 2089.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Espenak1998-22) The first July 7 aphelion is in 2067.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Espenak1998-22)

Because of the increased distance at aphelion, only 93.55% of the radiation from the Sun falls on a given area of Earth's surface as does at perihelion, but this does not account for the [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season"), which result instead from the [tilt of Earth's axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") of 23.4° away from perpendicular to the plane of Earth's orbit.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-23) Indeed, at both perihelion and aphelion it is [summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer "Summer") in one hemisphere while it is [winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter "Winter") in the other one. Winter falls on the hemisphere where sunlight strikes least directly, and summer falls where sunlight strikes most directly, regardless of the Earth's distance from the Sun.

In the northern hemisphere, summer occurs at the same time as aphelion, when solar radiation is lowest. Despite this, summers in the northern hemisphere are on average 2.3°C (4°F) warmer than in the southern hemisphere, because the northern hemisphere contains larger land masses, which are easier to heat than the seas.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Earth_at_Aphelion-24)

Perihelion and aphelion do however have an indirect effect on the seasons: because Earth's [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") is minimum at aphelion and maximum at perihelion, the planet takes longer to orbit from June solstice to September equinox than it does from December solstice to March equinox. Therefore, summer in the northern hemisphere lasts slightly longer (93 days) than summer in the southern hemisphere (89 days).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-25)

Astronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the [First Point of Aries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Point_of_Aries "First Point of Aries") not in terms of days and hours, but rather as an angle of orbital displacement, the so-called [longitude of the periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis "Longitude of the periapsis") (also called longitude of the pericenter). For the orbit of the Earth, this is called the _longitude of perihelion_, and in 2000 it was about 282.895°; by 2010, this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067°,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-26) i.e. a mean increase of 62" per year.

For the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons, since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations. The variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the Sun, which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the Earth measured from the [plane of the ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_the_ecliptic "Plane of the ecliptic"). The Earth's [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") and other orbital elements are not constant, but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system (Milankovitch cycles).

On a very long time scale, the dates of perihelion and of aphelion progress through the seasons, and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years. By the year 3800, perihelion will regularly occur in February.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Tanner-20) There is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from Earth, called the [apsidal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession"). (This is closely related to the [precession of the axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_(astronomy) "Axial precession (astronomy)").) The dates and times of perihelion and aphelion for several past and future years are listed in the following table:[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Espenak1998-22)

Mathematical formulae
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Mathematical formulae")]

These [formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula "Formula") characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbit:

Pericenter Maximum speed, ![Image 8: {\textstyle v_{\text{per}}={\sqrt {\frac {(1+e)\mu }{(1-e)a}}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88f258a76779781e8fbbde3f8f4426d1f1cf4810), at minimum (pericenter) distance, ![Image 9: {\textstyle r_{\text{per}}=(1-e)a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f32b1f5d8a14ce2ea8b8cc8b8f7da5139e299410).Apocenter Minimum speed, ![Image 10: {\textstyle v_{\text{ap}}={\sqrt {\frac {(1-e)\mu }{(1+e)a}}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55d6417052779b0bffbf04e23d5ead50dd1b8456), at maximum (apocenter) distance, ![Image 11: {\textstyle r_{\text{ap}}=(1+e)a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77eb6f3ff6c7035fb4eeb96d86e078f0cf5cce31).
While, in accordance with [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") (based on the conservation of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")) and the conservation of energy, these two quantities are constant for a given orbit:

[Specific relative angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_relative_angular_momentum "Specific relative angular momentum")![Image 12: {\displaystyle h={\sqrt {\left(1-e^{2}\right)\mu a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7091ebb873ea5effa0f170847158553cfa854b85)[Specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy")![Image 13: {\displaystyle \varepsilon =-{\frac {\mu }{2a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82b2540426831a23225bb6291fcaedf2034222ff)
where:

Note that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary, the radius of the central body has to be added, and conversely.

The [arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean "Arithmetic mean") of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis _a_. The [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean "Geometric mean") of the two distances is the length of the [semi-minor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-minor_axis "Semi-minor axis")_b_.

The geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is

![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-2\varepsilon }}={\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{a}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2dba469e21d7807410a198414ab3fd861eedc068)
which is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is ![Image 15: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc).

[Orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements") such as the _time of perihelion passage_ are defined at the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy) "Epoch (astronomy)") chosen using an unperturbed [two-body solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem") that does not account for the [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem"). To get an accurate time of perihelion passage you need to use an epoch close to the perihelion passage. For example, using an epoch of 1996, [Comet Hale–Bopp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hale%E2%80%93Bopp "Comet Hale–Bopp") shows perihelion on 1 April 1997.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-30) Using an epoch of 2022 shows a less accurate perihelion date of 29 March 1997.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-31)[Short-period comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-period_comet "Short-period comet") can be even more sensitive to the epoch selected. Using an epoch of 2005 shows [101P/Chernykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101P/Chernykh "101P/Chernykh") coming to perihelion on 25 December 2005,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-32) but using an epoch of 2012 produces a less accurate unperturbed perihelion date of 20 January 2006.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-33)

[4 Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta "4 Vesta") came to perihelion on 26 December 2021,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-Horizons2021-37) but using a two-body solution at an epoch of July 2021 less accurately shows Vesta came to perihelion on 25 December 2021.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-38)

### Short observation periods

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apsis&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Short observation periods")]

[Trans-Neptunian objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object "Trans-Neptunian object") that are discovered when they are more than 80 AU from the Sun present a major challenge for astronomers. Because these objects move extremely slowly across the sky, scientists need many observations taken over several years to accurately determine their orbital paths.

When astronomers have only limited data—like when there were only 8 observations of object [2015 TH 367](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_TH367 "2015 TH367") collected over just one year—the uncertainty becomes enormous. For objects that won’t reach their closest point to the Sun (perihelion) for roughly 100 years, this limited data can lead to massive uncertainties. In the case of [2015 TH 367](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_TH367 "2015 TH367"), scientists originally estimated the perihelion date could be off by plus or minus 77.3 years (28,220 days) (a [1-sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule "68–95–99.7 rule") uncertainty) —that’s nearly an entire human lifetime of uncertainty.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-39)

This demonstrates why tracking these distant objects requires patience and long-term observation campaigns to pin down their true orbital characteristics.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#cite_note-40)
