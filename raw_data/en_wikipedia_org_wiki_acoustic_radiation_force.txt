Generally, the force exerted on the obstacle is evaluated by integrating the acoustic radiation pressure (due to the presence of the sonic wave) over its time-varying surface.

The magnitude of the force exerted by an acoustic plane wave at any given location can be calculated as: | F r a d | = 2 α α I c {\displaystyle |F^{\rm {rad}}|={\frac {2\alpha I}{c}}} where | F r a d | {\displaystyle |F^{\rm {rad}}|} is a force per unit volume, here expressed in kg/(s 2 cm 2 ); α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is the absorption coefficient in Np /cm (nepers per cm); I {\displaystyle I} is the temporal average intensity of the acoustic wave at the given location in W /cm 2 ; and c {\displaystyle c} is the speed of sound in the medium in cm/s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The effect of frequency on acoustic radiation force is taken into account via intensity (higher pressures are more difficult to attain at higher frequencies) and absorption (higher frequencies have a higher absorption rate). As a reference, water has an acoustic absorption of 0.002 dB /(MHz 2 cm).

[ 3 ] (page number?) Acoustic radiation forces on compressible particles such as bubbles are also known as Bjerknes forces , and are generated through a different mechanism, which does not require sound absorption or reflection .

[ 4 ] Acoustic radiation forces can also be controlled through sub-wavelength patterning of the surface of the object.

[ 5 ] When a particle is exposed to an acoustic standing wave it will experience a time-averaged force known as the primary acoustic radiation force ( F p r {\displaystyle F_{pr}} ) .

[ 6 ] In a rectangular microfluidic channel with coplanar walls which acts as a resonance chamber , the incoming acoustic wave can be approximated as a resonant , standing pressure wave of the form: p 1 = p a cos ⁡ ⁡ k z {\displaystyle p_{1}=p_{a}\cos {kz}} .

where k {\displaystyle k} is the wave number .
For a compressible , spherical and micrometre-sized particle (of radius a {\displaystyle a} ) suspended in an inviscid fluid in a rectangular micro-channel with a 1D planar standing ultrasonic wave of wavelength λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } , the expression for the primary radiation force (at the far-field region where a ≪ ≪ λ λ {\displaystyle a\ll \lambda } ）becomes then [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 6 ] : F p r 1 D = 4 π π Φ Φ ( κ κ ~ ~ , ρ ρ ~ ~ ) a 3 k E a c sin ⁡ ⁡ 2 k z {\displaystyle F_{pr}^{\rm {1D}}=4\pi \Phi ({\tilde {\kappa }},{\tilde {\rho }})a^{3}kE_{ac}\sin {2kz}} Φ Φ ( κ κ ~ ~ , ρ ρ ~ ~ ) = 1 3 [ 5 ρ ρ ~ ~ − − 2 2 ρ ρ ~ ~ + 1 − − κ κ ~ ~ ] {\displaystyle \Phi ({\tilde {\kappa }},{\tilde {\rho }})={1 \over 3}\left[{5{\tilde {\rho }}-2 \over 2{\tilde {\rho }}+1}-{\tilde {\kappa }}\right]} E a c = 1 4 κ κ f p a 2 = p a 2 4 ρ ρ f c f 2 {\displaystyle E_{\rm {ac}}={1 \over 4}\kappa _{f}p_{a}^{2}={p_{a}^{2} \over 4\rho _{f}c_{f}^{2}}} where Φ Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } is the acoustic contrast factor κ κ ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\kappa }}} is relative compressibility between the particle κ κ p {\displaystyle \kappa _{p}} and the surrounding fluid κ κ f {\displaystyle \kappa _{f}} : κ κ ~ ~ = κ κ p / κ κ f {\displaystyle {\tilde {\kappa }}=\kappa _{p}/\kappa _{f}} ρ ρ ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\rho }}} is relative density between the particle ρ ρ p {\displaystyle \rho _{p}} and the surrounding fluid ρ ρ f {\displaystyle \rho _{f}} : ρ ρ ~ ~ = ρ ρ p / ρ ρ f {\displaystyle {\tilde {\rho }}=\rho _{p}/\rho _{f}} E a c {\displaystyle E_{\rm {ac}}} is the acoustic energy density The factor sin ⁡ ⁡ 2 k z {\displaystyle \sin {2kz}} makes the radiation force period doubled and phase shifted relative to the pressure wave p a cos ⁡ ⁡ k z {\displaystyle p_{a}\cos {kz}} c f {\displaystyle c_{f}} is the speed of sound in the fluid See also [ edit ] Acoustic tweezers Radiation pressure References [ edit ] ^ Palmeri, Mark; Sharma, Amy; Bouchard, Richard; Nightingale, Roger; Nightingale, Kathryn (October 2005).
