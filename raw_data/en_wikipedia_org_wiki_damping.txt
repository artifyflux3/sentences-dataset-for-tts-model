Underdamped [spring–mass system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring%E2%80%93mass_system "Spring–mass system") with _ζ_< 1

In [physical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system"), **damping** is the loss of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") of an [oscillating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillating_system "Oscillating system") by [dissipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipation "Dissipation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-:1-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-2) Damping is an influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing or preventing its oscillation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-3) Examples of damping include [viscous damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscous_damping "Viscous damping") in a fluid (see [viscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity")[drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)")), [surface friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"), [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-:1-1)[resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance "Electrical resistance and conductance") in [electronic oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillators "Electronic oscillators"), and absorption and scattering of light in [optical oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_oscillator "Optical oscillator"). Damping not based on energy loss can be important in other oscillating systems such as those that occur in [biological systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology") and [bikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics#Lateral_motion_theory "Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-MPRS-4) (ex. [Suspension (mechanics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(mechanics) "Suspension (mechanics)")). Damping is not to be confused with [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"), which is a type of dissipative force acting on a system. Friction can cause or be a factor of damping.

Many systems exhibit oscillatory behavior when they are disturbed from their position of [static equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_equilibrium "Static equilibrium"). A mass suspended from a spring, for example, might, if pulled and released, bounce up and down. On each bounce, the system tends to return to its equilibrium position, but overshoots it. Sometimes losses (e.g. frictional) damp the system and can cause the oscillations to gradually decay in amplitude towards zero or [attenuate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation "Attenuation").

The **damping ratio** is a [dimensionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless "Dimensionless") measure, amongst other measures, that characterises how damped a system is. It is denoted by ζ ("[zeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta "Zeta")") and varies from **undamped** (_ζ_ = 0), **underdamped** (_ζ_< 1) through **critically damped** (_ζ_ = 1) to **overdamped** (_ζ_> 1).

The behaviour of oscillating systems is often of interest in a diverse range of disciplines that include [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "Control engineering"), [chemical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "Chemical engineering"), [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [structural engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering "Structural engineering"), and [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"). The physical quantity that is oscillating varies greatly, and could be the swaying of a tall building in the wind, or the speed of an [electric motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"), but a normalised, or non-dimensionalised approach can be convenient in describing common aspects of behavior.

Depending on the amount of damping present, a system exhibits different oscillatory behaviors and speeds.

*   Where the spring–mass system is completely lossless, the mass would oscillate indefinitely, with each bounce of equal height to the last. This hypothetical case is called _undamped_.
*   If the system contained high losses, for example if the spring–mass experiment were conducted in a [viscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscous "Viscous") fluid, the mass could slowly return to its rest position without ever overshooting. This case is called _overdamped_.
*   Commonly, the mass tends to overshoot its starting position, and then return, overshooting again. With each overshoot, some energy in the system is dissipated, and the oscillations die towards zero. This case is called _underdamped._
*   Between the overdamped and underdamped cases, there exists a certain level of damping at which the system will just fail to overshoot and will not make a single oscillation. This case is called _critical damping_. The key difference between critical damping and overdamping is that, in critical damping, the system returns to equilibrium in the minimum amount of time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-5)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/DampedCosine.svg/500px-DampedCosine.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DampedCosine.svg)

Plot of a damped sinusoidal wave represented as the function ![Image 3: {\displaystyle y(t)=e^{-t}\cos(2\pi t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a44e4c3c3e20ba7c96d9834c1f49ded9e40c30dd)

A **damped sine wave** or **damped sinusoid** is a [sinusoidal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave "Sine wave") whose amplitude approaches zero as time increases. It corresponds to the _underdamped_ case of damped second-order systems, or underdamped second-order differential equations.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-6) Damped sine waves are commonly seen in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), wherever a [harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator") is losing [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") faster than it is being supplied. A true sine wave starting at time = 0 begins at the origin (amplitude = 0). A cosine wave begins at its maximum value due to its phase difference from the sine wave. A given sinusoidal waveform may be of intermediate phase, having both sine and cosine components. The term "damped sine wave" describes all such damped waveforms, whatever their initial phase.

The most common form of damping, which is usually assumed, is the form found in linear systems. This form is exponential damping, in which the outer envelope of the successive peaks is an exponential decay curve. That is, when you connect the maximum point of each successive curve, the result resembles an exponential decay function. The general equation for an exponentially damped sinusoid may be represented as: ![Image 4: {\displaystyle y(t)=Ae^{-\lambda t}\cos(\omega t-\varphi )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/125c25eff1e26319cd2646afd82c90c8c3d17842) where:

Other important parameters include:

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/2nd_Order_Damping_Ratios.svg/500px-2nd_Order_Damping_Ratios.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2nd_Order_Damping_Ratios.svg)

The effect of varying damping ratio on a second-order system.

The _damping ratio_ is a dimensionless parameter, usually denoted by _ζ_ (Greek letter zeta),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-7) that characterizes the extent of damping in a second-order ordinary [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"). It is particularly important in the study of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"). It is also important in the [harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator"). The greater the damping ratio, the more damped a system is.

*   _Undamped_ systems have a damping ratio of 0.
*   _Underdamped_ systems have a value of less than one.
*   _Critically damped_ systems have a damping ratio of 1.
*   _Overdamped_ systems have a damping ratio greater than 1.

The damping ratio expresses the level of damping in a system relative to critical damping and can be defined using the damping coefficient:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {c}{c_{c}}}={\frac {\text{actual damping}}{\text{critical damping}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b555b97638ff9ebf618203bf0188a2babe51c01a)
The damping ratio is dimensionless, being the ratio of two coefficients of identical units.

Taking the simple example of a [mass-spring-damper model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-spring-damper_model "Mass-spring-damper model") with mass _m_, damping coefficient _c_, and [spring constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_constant "Spring constant")_k_, where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) represents the [degree of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_freedom_(mechanics) "Degree of freedom (mechanics)"), the system's [equation of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion "Equation of motion") is given by:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+c{\dot {x}}+kx=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94204a6eb83dcdc6550e0f4cad8b127dab620f4f).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-8)
The corresponding critical damping coefficient is: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle c_{c}=2{\sqrt {km}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0659bfe2cdbb096ea96cc6122b3da446032f6a01)

and the [natural frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_frequency "Natural frequency") of the system is: ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \omega _{n}={\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed6eeb00850f6c6d20f76fca2bb678966664b000)

Using these definitions, the equation of motion can then be expressed as:

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+2\zeta \omega _{n}{\dot {x}}+\omega _{n}^{2}x=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72a33906b05a52a5c54497b925db410fed1fbe54)
This equation is more general than just the mass-spring-damper system and applies to electrical circuits and to other domains. It can be solved with the approach

![Image 12: {\displaystyle x(t)=Ce^{st},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74e1ce9da68248a44010bf030da4e4b13f2678ef)
where _C_ and _s_ are both [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") constants, with _s_ satisfying

![Image 13: {\displaystyle s=-\omega _{n}\left(\zeta \pm i{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65a08ea55a4b61e83cd4297da208b6d6e34b5c5d)
Two such solutions, for the two values of _s_ satisfying the equation, can be combined to make the general real solutions, with oscillatory and decaying properties in several regimes:

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Phase_portrait_of_damped_oscillator%2C_with_increasing_damping_strength.gif/250px-Phase_portrait_of_damped_oscillator%2C_with_increasing_damping_strength.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phase_portrait_of_damped_oscillator,_with_increasing_damping_strength.gif)

Phase portrait of damped oscillator, with increasing damping strength. It starts at undamped, proceeds to underdamped, then critically damped, then overdamped.

Undamped Is the case where ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \zeta =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8cb1144b522757105b43c2b17cac8dcfc4fd8ce) corresponds to the undamped simple harmonic oscillator, and in that case the solution looks like ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \exp(i\omega _{n}t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/354cff559aef3483b609ac9117cd7deffcc8ab98), as expected. This case is extremely rare in the natural world with the closest examples being cases where friction was purposefully reduced to minimal values.Underdamped If _s_ is a pair of complex values, then each complex solution term is a decaying exponential combined with an oscillatory portion that looks like ![Image 17: {\textstyle \exp \left(i\omega _{n}{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}t\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b221ebc1c49efffa26eefea34488dd2829aa7529). This case occurs for ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \ 0\leq \zeta <1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3ac70239e4b5e7712165fb1afe087426373af37), and is referred to as _underdamped_ (e.g., bungee cable).Overdamped If _s_ is a pair of real values, then the solution is simply a sum of two decaying exponentials with no oscillation. This case occurs for ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \zeta >1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9118241d7cfd653b3d887a8c23b11f98747e5f05), and is referred to as _overdamped_. Situations where overdamping is practical tend to have tragic outcomes if overshooting occurs, usually electrical rather than mechanical. For example, landing a plane in autopilot: if the system overshoots and releases landing gear too late, the outcome would be a disaster.Critically damped The case where ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \zeta =1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63f7f0a961df774bd3db35e02af655591ad23c1c) is the border between the overdamped and underdamped cases, and is referred to as _critically damped_. This turns out to be a desirable outcome in many cases where engineering design of a damped oscillator is required (e.g., a door closing mechanism).

_Q_ factor and decay rate
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Q factor and decay rate")]

The [_Q_ factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor "Q factor"), damping ratio _ζ_, and exponential decay rate α are related such that[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-Siebert-9)

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {1}{2Q}}={\alpha  \over \omega _{n}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a967353a09e7b9816e0cf96ceea0c1960e7036f)
When a second-order system has ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \zeta <1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74e0a7f113520f82edfdfaef0ed13ab5224f18ff) (that is, when the system is underdamped), it has two [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate "Complex conjugate") poles that each have a [real part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_part "Real part") of ![Image 23: {\displaystyle -\alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6807df17ce845a127ca43612e2ffd5cf62b7adc6); that is, the decay rate parameter represents the rate of [exponential decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay "Exponential decay") of the oscillations. A lower damping ratio implies a lower decay rate, and so very underdamped systems oscillate for long times.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-10) For example, a high quality [tuning fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_fork "Tuning fork"), which has a very low damping ratio, has an oscillation that lasts a long time, decaying very slowly after being struck by a hammer.

Logarithmic decrement
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Logarithmic decrement")]

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Dampingratio111.svg/500px-Dampingratio111.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dampingratio111.svg)

For underdamped vibrations, the damping ratio is also related to the [logarithmic decrement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_decrement "Logarithmic decrement")![Image 25: {\displaystyle \delta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5321cfa797202b3e1f8620663ff43c4660ea03a). The damping ratio can be found for any two peaks, even if they are not adjacent.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-11) For adjacent peaks:[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-12)

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {\delta }{\sqrt {\delta ^{2}+\left(2\pi \right)^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ffc022e8a082268002eeedc16f39b876302a3ee) where ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \delta =\ln {\frac {x_{0}}{x_{1}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91955b6752b8e7e19d6d78004b92a77c44f31467)
where _x_ 0 and _x_ 1 are amplitudes of any two successive peaks.

As shown in the right figure:

![Image 28: {\displaystyle \delta =\ln {\frac {x_{1}}{x_{3}}}=\ln {\frac {x_{2}}{x_{4}}}=\ln {\frac {x_{1}-x_{2}}{x_{3}-x_{4}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33439f49c5af826ee7c8a71aae87497b8a95794d)
where ![Image 29: {\displaystyle x_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a8788bf85d532fa88d1fb25eff6ae382a601c308), ![Image 30: {\displaystyle x_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/766d09a498699be10e276ad49145c921f8cbe335) are amplitudes of two successive positive peaks and ![Image 31: {\displaystyle x_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7af1b928f06e4c7e3e8ebfd60704656719bd766), ![Image 32: {\displaystyle x_{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb828766e82e496666b179ff70d8e2fd24a79e5f) are amplitudes of two successive negative peaks.

Percentage overshoot
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Percentage overshoot")]

In [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"), [overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(signal) "Overshoot (signal)") refers to an output exceeding its final, steady-state value.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-Kuo-13) For a [step input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_response "Step response"), the **percentage overshoot** (PO) is the maximum value minus the step value divided by the step value. In the case of the unit step, the _overshoot_ is just the maximum value of the step response minus one.

The percentage overshoot (PO) is related to damping ratio (_ζ_) by:

![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathrm {PO} =100\exp \left({-{\frac {\zeta \pi }{\sqrt {1-\zeta ^{2}}}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bfd043789018e4af231b4e86fc9ed9ee597db7f)
Conversely, the damping ratio (_ζ_) that yields a given percentage overshoot is given by:

![Image 34: {\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {-\ln \left({\frac {\rm {PO}}{100}}\right)}{\sqrt {\pi ^{2}+\ln ^{2}\left({\frac {\rm {PO}}{100}}\right)}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eceab6557753ac343d901b57866e3c471c029274)

Examples and applications
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Examples and applications")]

When an object is falling through the air, the only force opposing its freefall is air resistance. An object falling through water or oil would slow down at a greater rate, until eventually reaching a steady-state velocity as the drag force comes into equilibrium with the force from gravity. This is the concept of [viscous drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)"), which for example is applied in automatic doors or anti-slam doors.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-:0-14)

### Damping in electrical systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Damping in electrical systems")]

Electrical systems that operate with [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") (AC) use resistors to damp LC resonant circuits.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-:0-14)

Kinetic energy that causes oscillations is dissipated as heat by electric [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current "Eddy current") which are induced by passing through a magnet's poles, either by a coil or aluminum plate. Eddy currents are a key component of [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") where they set up a [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux") directly opposing the oscillating movement, creating a resistive force.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-15) In other words, the resistance caused by magnetic forces slows a system down. An example of this concept being applied is the [brakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake "Eddy current brake") on roller coasters.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-16)

### Magnetorheological damping

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damping&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Magnetorheological damping")]

Magnetorheological dampers (MR Dampers) use [Magnetorheological fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorheological_fluid "Magnetorheological fluid"), which changes viscosity when subjected to a magnetic field. In this case, Magnetorheological damping may be considered an interdisciplinary form of damping with both viscous and magnetic damping mechanisms.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-18)

Materials have varying degrees of internal damping properties due to microstructural mechanisms within them. This property is sometimes known as [damping capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_capacity "Damping capacity"). In metals, this arises due to movements of dislocations, as demonstrated nicely in this video:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping#cite_note-19) Metals, as well as ceramics and glass, are known for having very light material damping. By contrast, polymers have a much higher material damping that arises from the energy loss required to contiually break and reform the [Van der Waals forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_forces "Van der Waals forces") between polymer chains. The cross-linking in [thermoset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoset "Thermoset") plastics causes less movement of the polymer chains and so the damping is less.

Material damping is best characterized by the loss factor ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \eta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4d701857cf5fbec133eebaf94deadf722537f64), given by the equation below for the case of very light damping, such as in metals or ceramics:

![Image 36: {\displaystyle \eta =2\zeta {\frac {\omega }{\omega _{n}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7167f81ff2e5f0d773d241345a6af9881955eb39)
This is because many microstructural processes that contribute to material damping are not well modelled by viscous damping, and so the damping ratio varies with frequency. Adding the frequency ratio as a factor typically makes the loss factor constant over a wide frequency range.
