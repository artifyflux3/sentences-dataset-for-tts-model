It is the western part of the Fertile Crescent , the eastern part of the latter being Mesopotamia . This corridor is a land route of migrations of animals between Eurasia and Africa. In particular, it is believed that early hominins spread from Africa to Eurasia via the Levantine corridor and Horn of Africa .

[ 2 ] The corridor is named after the Levant .

Dispersal route for plants [ edit ] Botanists recognize this area as a dispersal route of plant species.

[ 3 ] Migration route for humans [ edit ] Further information: Prehistory of the Levant and Genetic history of the Middle East The distribution of Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups suggests that during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, the Levantine corridor was more important for bi-directional human migrations between Africa and Eurasia than was the Horn of Africa.

[ 4 ] The term is used frequently by archaeologists as an area that includes Cyprus , where important developments occurred during the Neolithic Revolution .

[ 5 ] The first sedentary villages were established around fresh water springs and lakes in the Levantine corridor by the Natufian culture.
