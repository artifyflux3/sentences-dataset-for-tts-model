[ 1 ] In the context of abiogenesis , the lipid-world [ 2 ] suggests assemblies of simple molecules, such as lipids , can store and propagate information, and thus undergo evolution .

These 'compositional assemblies' have been suggested to play a role in the origin of life. The idea is the information being transferred throughout the generations is compositional information – the different types and quantities of molecules within an assembly. This is different from the information encoded in RNA or DNA , which is the specific sequence of bases in such molecule. Thus, the model is viewed as an alternative or an ancestor to the RNA world hypothesis.

The model [ edit ] The composition vector of an assembly is written as: v = n 1 ⋯ ⋯ n N G {\displaystyle v=n_{1}\cdots n_{N_{G}}} . Where n 1 ⋯ ⋯ n N G {\displaystyle n_{1}\cdots n_{N_{G}}} are the molecular counts of lipid type i within the assembly, and NG is how many different lipid types exist ( repertoire size ).

The change in the count of molecule type i is described by: d n i d t = ( k f ρ ρ i N − − k b n i ) ( 1 + ∑ ∑ j = 1 N G β β i j n j N ) {\displaystyle {\frac {dn_{i}}{dt}}=(k_{f}\rho _{i}N-k_{b}n_{i})\left(1+\sum _{j=1}^{N_{G}}\beta _{ij}{\frac {n_{j}}{N}}\right)} k f {\displaystyle k_{f}} and k b {\displaystyle k_{b}} are the basal forward (joining) and backward (leaving) rate constants, β ij is a non-negative rate enhancement exerted by molecule type j within the assembly on type i from the environment, and ρ is the environmental concentration of each molecule type.

β is viewed as a directed, weighted, complex network .

The assembly current size is N = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N G n i {\displaystyle N=\sum _{i=1}^{N_{G}}n_{i}} . The system is kept away from equilibrium by imposing a fission action once the assembly reaches a maximal size, Nmax, usually in the order of NG. This splitting action produces two progeny of same size, and one of which is grown again.

The model is subjected to a Monte Carlo algorithm based simulations, using Gillespie algorithm .

Selection [ edit ] In 2010, Eors Szathmary and collaborators chose GARD as an archetypal metabolism-first realization. They introduced into the model a selection coefficient which increases or decreases the growth rate of assemblies depending on how similar or dissimilar they are to a given target. They found that the ranking of the assemblies is unaffected by the selection pressure and concluded that GARD does not exhibit Darwinian evolution.

[ 3 ] In 2012, Doron Lancet and Omer Markovitch disputed this. Two major drawbacks of the 2010 paper were: (1) the authors focused on a general assembly and not on a composome or compotype (faithfully replicating and quasispecies , respectively); (2) they performed only a single, random simulation to test the selectability.

[ 4 ] Quasispecies [ edit ] The quasispecies model describes a population of replicators that replicate with relatively high mutations. Due to mutations and back mutations the population eventually centres around a master-replicator (master sequence). GARD's populations were shown to form a quasispecies around a master-compotype and to exhibit an error catastrophe , similarly to classical quasispecies such as RNA viruses.
