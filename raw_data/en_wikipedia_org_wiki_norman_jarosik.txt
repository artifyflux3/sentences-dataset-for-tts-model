Jarosik is a US astrophysicist . He has worked on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) whose observations of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) have provided significant insights into cosmology .

Jarosik studied physics at the State University of New York in Buffalo , receiving his doctorate in 1986.

[ 1 ] After two years at Bell Laboratories he began work at Princeton University , where as of 2018 he holds the position of Senior Research Physicist/Lecturer.

[ 2 ] At Princeton, Jarosik specializes in measurements of CMBR from both ground-based and high-altitude probes. He was a member of the WMAP science team where he worked on the design, construction and testing of the microwave radiometer systems and contributed to the calibration and analysis of flight data.

[ 1 ] He is also involved with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope .

[ 3 ] Awards [ edit ] Jarosik was awarded the 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics together with Charles L. Bennett , Gary Hinshaw , Lyman Page Jr., David Spergel and the WMAP research team.

[ 4 ] The Prize was $3,000,000 split amongst the researchers.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber stated that Jarosik and his team's "Research has transformed our understanding of the age, shape, and evolution of the universe." [ 5 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b "Norman Jarosik" .
