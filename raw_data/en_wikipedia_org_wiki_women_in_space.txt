A record four women simultaneously in space aboard the International Space Station in 2010 ([Expedition 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_23 "Expedition 23") and [STS-131](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-131 "STS-131")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-1) Clockwise from lower left: [Tracy Caldwell Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson "Tracy Caldwell Dyson"), [Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Metcalf-Lindenburger "Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger"), [Naoko Yamazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoko_Yamazaki "Naoko Yamazaki"), and [Stephanie Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Wilson "Stephanie Wilson")

Women have flown and worked in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") since almost the beginning of [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight"). A number of women from a range of countries have worked in space, though overall women are still significantly less often chosen to go to space than men, and by June, 2020 constitute only 12% of all astronauts who have been to space.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-12percent-2) Yet, the proportion of women among space travelers has been increasing substantially over time.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-3)

Women were not qualified as space pilots and workers co-equal to their male counterparts until 1982. By October 2021, most of the 70 women who have been to space have been [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") citizens, with missions on the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") and on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"). Other countries ([USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus "Belarus")) have flown one, two or three women in [human spaceflight programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight_programs "Human spaceflight programs"). Additionally one woman of dual [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran")-US citizenship has participated as a tourist on a US spaceflight.

The first woman to fly in space was [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")[Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova"), aboard the [Vostok 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_6 "Vostok 6")[space capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule "Space capsule") on June 16–19, 1963. Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly worker, rather than a pilot like the male [cosmonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonaut "Cosmonaut") flying at the time, chosen for propaganda value, her devotion to the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), and her years of experience in sport parachuting, which she used on landing after ejecting from her capsule.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-4)

Women face many of the same [physical and psychological difficulties of spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body "Effect of spaceflight on the human body") as men. Scientific studies generally show no particular adverse effect from short space missions. It has even been suggested by some that women might be better suited for longer space missions.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-National_Geographic_2019-5) Studies have continually indicated that the main obstacle for women to go to space remains [gender discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_discrimination "Gender discrimination").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Davenport_2019-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-TASS_2019-7)

### Early Space Race struggle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early Space Race struggle")]

In the competition between the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") (USSR) and the United States known as the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"), both nations chose their first space pilots (known as [cosmonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonaut "Cosmonaut") in the USSR and [astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronauts "Astronauts") in the US) in the late 1950s and early 1960s from the ranks of their military high-speed jet [test pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilots "Test pilots"), who were exclusively men.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-8)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/JerrieCobb_MercuryCapsule.jpg/250px-JerrieCobb_MercuryCapsule.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JerrieCobb_MercuryCapsule.jpg)

[Jerrie Cobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrie_Cobb "Jerrie Cobb") with a Mercury capsule (c. early 1960s)

In 1959, after their research project _Woman in Space Earliest_ of the Air Force Air Research and Development Command was not permitted, [Don Flickinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Flickinger "Don Flickinger") and [William Randolph Lovelace II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Lovelace_II "William Randolph Lovelace II") subsequently formed a group of thirteen women US pilots,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-SpaceRef_2009-9) dubbed by the American press as the "[Mercury 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_13 "Mercury 13")". Wanting the chance to become astronauts the women took and passed the health screening tests as the men, supervised by Lovelace Clinic staff. This was funded privately (e.g. by aviation pioneer [Jacqueline Cochran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Cochran "Jacqueline Cochran")) and not by the government; the idea of female astronauts faced a great deal of resistance in the military command and NASA, leaving these women no chance of becoming astronauts.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-flats-11)[Jerrie Cobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrie_Cobb "Jerrie Cobb") of the "Mercury 13" became a consultant to NASA in 1961 and testified before Congress in July 1962 about the "Mercury 13"'s positive medical results and [gender discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_discrimination "Gender discrimination").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10)

Meanwhile, the USSR's director of cosmonaut training, [Nikolai Kamanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kamanin "Nikolai Kamanin"), lobbied for having women as cosmonauts, after being inspired in 1961 by repeated questions from the foreign press about women in space.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10) Subsequently, Kamanin crucially gained space program leader [Sergey Korolev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Korolev "Sergey Korolev") as a supporter, getting approval six months later for women cosmonauts.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10) During a visit to the US in 1962 Kamanin got to know [Jerrie Cobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrie_Cobb "Jerrie Cobb") of the then rejected "Mercury 13".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10) At one point Kamanin noted in his diary, "We cannot allow that the first woman in space will be American. This would be an insult to the patriotic feelings of Soviet women."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgessHall2009229-12) The Soviet government generally had no interest in using women as cosmonaut pilots,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-14) but Premier [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev") was extremely interested in the propaganda value of proving Soviet superiority over the US in women's equality.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgessHall2009236-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-16) In February 1962 from over 400 applicants a [group of five female cosmonauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronauts_by_selection#1962 "List of astronauts by selection") were chosen to be trained for a solo spaceflight in a [Vostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_programme "Vostok programme") spacecraft.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-17) To increase the odds of sending a Soviet woman into space first, the women cosmonauts began their training before the men.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgessHall2009229-12)

#### First Woman in Space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: First Woman in Space")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/The_Soviet_Union_1963_CPA_2890_stamp_%28Second_%27Team%27_Manned_Space_Flight._Portrait_of_Valentina_Tereshkova%29.jpg/250px-The_Soviet_Union_1963_CPA_2890_stamp_%28Second_%27Team%27_Manned_Space_Flight._Portrait_of_Valentina_Tereshkova%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Soviet_Union_1963_CPA_2890_stamp_(Second_%27Team%27_Manned_Space_Flight._Portrait_of_Valentina_Tereshkova).jpg)

[Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")[Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova") was the first woman in space, launched in 1963 aboard the [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")[Vostok 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_6 "Vostok 6")

The first woman to fly in space was [Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova"), a textile factory worker who was an avid amateur [parachutist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting#Competition "Parachuting"), as parachuting was necessary for the Earth landing which was made outside the [reentry capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentry_capsule "Reentry capsule").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-18) Tereshkova flew aboard [Vostok 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_6 "Vostok 6") on June 16, 1963, completing a 70.8 hour flight making a total of 48 [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") before returning to Earth.

Kamanin framed her as "Gagarin in a skirt".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurgessHall2009236-15) Tereshkova married [Vostok 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_3 "Vostok 3") cosmonaut [Andriyan Nikolayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriyan_Nikolayev "Andriyan Nikolayev") on November 3, 1963, at the Moscow Wedding Palace, with Khrushchev presiding at the wedding party together with top government and space program leaders.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-19) The occasion was described by Kamanin as "probably useful for politics and science".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-21) Tereshkova gave birth on 8 June 1964, nearly one year after her space flight, to the first person with a mother and father who had both traveled into space, their daughter Elena Andrianovna Nikolaeva-Tereshkova.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-22)

#### Further female missions cancelled

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Further female missions cancelled")]

Kamanin hoped to fly two other women on the [Voskhod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_programme "Voskhod programme") 3 and 4 flights, despite the opposition of [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin") and the other male cosmonauts.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-23) These plans were canceled in 1965, leaving the women with Soviet Air Force officer commissions.

The American [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") to land a man on the Moon included only male astronauts. Neither the USSR nor US launched another woman into space until women were admitted to the astronaut and cosmonaut corps in the late 1970s.

### Later Space Race advances

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Later Space Race advances")]

By 1971 NASA had hired staff tasked to address issues of adhering to legal ramifications to include underrepresented people of society. In 1973 staff such as [Ruth Bates Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ruth_Bates_Harris&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruth Bates Harris (page does not exist)") criticized NASA's poor inclusion of women and minorities. Subsequently, the [NASA Astronaut Group 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_8 "NASA Astronaut Group 8") was to include women and people of minorities.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-DC_Historic_Sites_1973-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-History_2011-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-The_New_York_Times_1973-26) To assist finding candidates the milestone [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek "Star Trek") star [Nichelle Nichols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols "Nichelle Nichols") was hired, after she spoke at the [National Space Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Space_Institute "National Space Institute")[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Swanson_2022-27) for the inclusion of women and minorities as astronauts.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Nichols-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-smithsonian-29)

On January 16, 1978, NASA announced the selection of its eighth group of astronaut candidates, which included the first women, six [Mission specialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_specialist "Mission specialist") (not pilots): [Anna L. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Lee_Fisher "Anna Lee Fisher"), [Shannon Lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Lucid "Shannon Lucid"), [Judith A. Resnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_A._Resnik "Judith A. Resnik"), [Sally K. Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_K._Ride "Sally K. Ride"), [Margaret Rhea Seddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Rhea_Seddon "Margaret Rhea Seddon"), and [Kathryn D. Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan "Kathryn D. Sullivan").

**Left:** NASA's first six women astronauts chosen in the 1970s: Seddon, Sullivan, Resnik, Ride, Fisher, and Lucid. 

**Right:**[Svetlana Savitskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Savitskaya "Svetlana Savitskaya") the second woman in space (1982), first to return to space, and the first to conduct an EVA (1984).

Similarly, in 1978 Tereshkova and her colleague [Tatyana Kuznetsova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatyana_Kuznetsova "Tatyana Kuznetsova") pushed for a new cosmonaut program for women,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Malashenko_2019-10) with the USSR in July 1980 choosing a cosmonaut group which included nine women in addition to four men. The women were: [Svetlana Savitskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Savitskaya "Svetlana Savitskaya"), Galina Amelkina, Yelena Dobrokvashina, Larisa Pozharskaya, Tamara Zakharova, Yekaterina Ivanova, Natalya Kuleshova, Irina Pronina, and Irina Latysheva.

Of the nine women only Savitskaya got to fly to space. As a research cosmonaut she flew aboard the [Soyuz T-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_T-7 "Soyuz T-7") to the [space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station")[Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7") in August 1982.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-WomenInSpace-NASA-30) Savitskaya became the first woman to fly in space twice, on the [Soyuz T-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_T-12 "Soyuz T-12") mission on July 25, 1984 and became the first woman to walk in space ([extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity"), EVA) outside the [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7") space station on that mission.

Of NASA's first women astronaut group all flew in space at least once, with mission specialist [Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride "Sally Ride") becoming in 1983 the first US woman to fly in space, with the [seventh Space Shuttle mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-7 "STS-7"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-WomenInSpace-NASA-30) and third woman altogether to fly in space.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-WomenInSpace-NASA-30)

### After the Space Race

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: After the Space Race")]

Since the final years of the Space Race most of the women who have been to space have been American women, outnumbering all other countries combined. But the more than 50 American women astronauts, contrasted by the several hundred astronauts who have entered space, women still only make up about 12% of all people who have gone to space, still being less chosen and enabled.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-12percent-2) NASA only in 2013 enabled the first time an equal number of women as part of an astronaut class, the [NASA Astronaut Group 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_21 "NASA Astronaut Group 21"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Dunbar_2018-31) a short lived situation since the subsequently and current [Group 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_22 "NASA Astronaut Group 22") has yet again a lower number.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-National_Geographic_2021-32)

[Mae Jemison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Jemison "Mae Jemison"), the first woman of color in space, aboard [STS-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-47 "STS-47") in 1992

In 1992 [Mae Jemison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Jemison "Mae Jemison") became the first woman of color in space. [Susan Helms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Helms "Susan Helms") became the first woman on an ISS expedition crew on [Expedition 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_2 "Expedition 2"), lasting from March 2001 until August 2001.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-WomenInSpace-NASA-30)[Peggy Whitson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Whitson "Peggy Whitson") became in 2007 the first woman to command the International Space Station,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:2-33) and in October 2009 NASA's first female [Chief of the Astronaut Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Astronaut_Office "Chief of the Astronaut Office"). On October 18, 2019, the first all female spacewalk was conducted by [Jessica Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Meir "Jessica Meir") and [Christina Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Koch "Christina Koch").

Only 12 human beings, all men, have walked on the Moon.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-CNN-35) In 2020, NASA's communication director reported that NASA planned to land astronauts on the Moon, including possibly a woman astronaut or astronauts, as part of the U.S. [Artemis program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program "Artemis program").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-CNN-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Drake-36) Of the 18 candidates in the Artemis program, nine are women: [Nicole Aunapu Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Aunapu_Mann "Nicole Aunapu Mann"), [Kayla Barron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayla_Barron "Kayla Barron"), [Christina Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Koch "Christina Koch"), [Kate Rubins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Rubins "Kate Rubins"), [Stephanie Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Wilson "Stephanie Wilson"), [Jessica Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Meir "Jessica Meir"), [Jasmin Moghbeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmin_Moghbeli "Jasmin Moghbeli"), [Anne McClain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_McClain "Anne McClain") and [Jessica Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Watkins "Jessica Watkins").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Drake-36) Furthermore, the European Space Agency (ESA) has six astronauts, of whom one is a woman ([Samantha Cristoforetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Cristoforetti "Samantha Cristoforetti")), training for Artemis.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Phys.org_2022-37) This group is later to be joined by members of the [2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Space_Agency_Astronaut_Group "2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group"), which includes two women, ([Sophie Adenot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Adenot "Sophie Adenot") and [Rosemary Coogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Coogan "Rosemary Coogan")), plus history's first parastronaut.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-auto-38)

In April 2023 NASA, together with the [Canadian Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency "Canadian Space Agency"), announced their selection of the [Artemis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_II "Artemis II") crew, the first since the Apollo program to go around the Moon.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Donaldson_2023-39) The crew will include [Christina Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Koch "Christina Koch").

Space programs allowed women generally only well into the [space age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_age "Space age"), with [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") opening its space program in 1976. When [Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride "Sally Ride") became the first female US astronaut to go into space in 1983, the press asked her questions about her reproductive organs and whether she would cry if things went wrong on the job.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-autogenerated1-40)

Women with children have also been faced with questions about how they would compare to traditional expectations of motherhood.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-spacemom-41)[Shannon Lucid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Lucid "Shannon Lucid"), one of the first group of female US astronauts, remembers questions by the press on how her children would handle her being a mother in space.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Foster-146-42) Women are often expected to be the ones mainly responsible for child-rearing, which can impact their career.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-kramer-43)

According to the [historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian "Historian") Kim McQuaid the American [space agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_space_agencies "List of government space agencies") NASA ignored gender issues at the beginning of the space era, and women were not normally allowed to enter [technical schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_school "Technical school") or undergraduate/graduate training in [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") and the physical sciences until changes started happening in the end of the 1960s.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-44) Particularly in the period between 1972 and 1974 the focus on women became more prominent.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-45) In 1967, NASA changed its [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy "Policy") to make it easier for women to join and 17 women applied for the role to join a space travel mission, but all 17 job applications were declined.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) NASA did employ thousands of women in jobs where space travel was not included in the 1960s, but there was still hierarchical differences between women and men.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-47) The women employed in the space agency NASA are also still more likely to work in lower-ranked jobs, while men are more often employed in higher-ranked occupations, particularly in space crew settings, despite women having similar qualifications to those of men.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) There has also been found a larger gender gap in certain jobs such as manufacturing, while downstream application and service jobs have a higher representation of women employees.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-48)

In 2023, numbers released by [UNOOSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Outer_Space_Affairs "United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs") showed that only 11 percent of the world's astronauts are women, 6.6 percent are spacewalkers and 20 percent are in the space workforce.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:1-49) In March 2023, the Director of Space Technology of the Australian Space Agency, [Katherine Bennell-Pegg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Bennell-Pegg "Katherine Bennell-Pegg"), said that women are still in the minority in the space industry and that ‘[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics") is for everyone’ whilst adding that inclusivity is important.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-50)[The UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals") suggests that an increase of women being involved in the space industry is important to achieve the SDGs and gender equality, since 90 percent of future jobs will probably require STEM related skills.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-51) The promotion of [space technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_technology "Space technology") in an inclusive manner is also an important step towards achieving the [SDG 5B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_5 "Sustainable Development Goal 5").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:1-49) In 2022, the American astronaut [Nicole Aunapu Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Aunapu_Mann "Nicole Aunapu Mann"), who studied [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering") at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") and also has [military combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War") background in [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq") and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan"), became the first [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States") woman in space and she went on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-52) On the 2023 International Women's Day, Mann stated that "inequality does stifle success" and that it is important to continue to break barriers and inspire and empower the youth to achieve their dreams.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-published-53)

In 1995, an academic journal stated that outer space occupations was regarded as a male dominated arena where the male body was the standard while the female body was seen as ‘[contamination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination "Contamination")’ or uncertainty in an otherwise stable environment, and women have previously said that they have struggled to be taken seriously in outer space environments.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-54) Some women in the space industry have also reported that they feel like they have to express typically [masculine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity "Masculinity") traits like [assertiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertiveness "Assertiveness") and dominance in outer space occupations, since '[feminine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femininity "Femininity")' traits are looked down upon.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) For example, men are thought to be more [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), which is beneficial in the space industry, while femininity is associated with being [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion "Emotion") which is viewed as 'negative' in the context of outer space travel.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) The American [scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist "Scientist") and former [government official](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official "Official")[Carloyn Huntoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Huntoon "Carolyn Huntoon"), has previously said in an [interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview "Interview") in 2002 that if the women did not behave in the same way as the guys, it would mean that they were not doing the job properly.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-55)

Chris Pesterfield, a [lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer "Lecturer") at the [University of Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bristol "University of Bristol"), has stated that legal and [political changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change "Social change") have been made to allow for women to enter outer space occupations, but that these changes do not seem to have been as effective as one might have expected.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) Pesterfield has argued that the unequal number of women and men in space might be an outcome of the [socialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization "Socialization") process, starting already in [child years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child "Child").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) For example, boys are more often encouraged to have interests in STEM subjects such as [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") than girls and there may be societal expectations that gender will influence what a person is good at.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:0-46) The [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD") found that the majority of women employed by NASA have studied [biological sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") (48 percent), while they are underrepresented in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") (25 percent), physical sciences (25 percent) and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") (22 percent).[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-56) Rebecca Spyke Keiser, who is a special assistant to the NASA administrator for innovation and public-private partnership, has stated that the lack of woman [role models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model "Role model") in [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace "Aerospace") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") might also have contributed to the low number of women in space-related work as well as [perceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception") about women only being good at certain things.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-57)

There have been attempts at combating gender discrimination within the space sector. For example, the United Nations has made the Space4Women project which is intended to focus on gender related issues in space and find reasons why gender inequality is still an issue in the outer space sector.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:3-58) The project includes women from different backgrounds, [professions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession "Profession") and [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country "Country").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:3-58) One of the [mentees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship "Mentorship") in the programme stated that "working for girls and women in science has been empowering, encouraging me to persist in a work environment that is sometimes so hostile and not inclusive".[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:3-58) In October 2017, UNOOSA and UN women also cooperated to organise a ‘Space for Women’ Expert Meeting with the goal of empowering women in space industry jobs.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-:1-49)[Commercial spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight "Private spaceflight") and more focus on [diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion "Diversity, equity, and inclusion") are also factors that play a role in boosting participation by women.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-published-53)

Physical effects of space on women
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Physical effects of space on women")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Kathy_Sullivan_dons_her_suit_-_GPN-2006-000014.jpg/250px-Kathy_Sullivan_dons_her_suit_-_GPN-2006-000014.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kathy_Sullivan_dons_her_suit_-_GPN-2006-000014.jpg)

[Kathryn D. Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan "Kathryn D. Sullivan") poses for a picture before donning her space suit and extravehicular mobility unit in the airlock on board the April 25, 1990 Space Shuttle mission that deployed the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope").

Female astronauts are subject to the same general physical effects of space travel as male astronauts. These include physiological changes due to weightlessness such as [loss of bone and muscle mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia "Spaceflight osteopenia"), [health threats from cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays "Health threat from cosmic rays"), dangers due to vacuum and temperature, and psychological stress.

NASA reports initially argued that [menstruation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation "Menstruation") could pose serious health risks or have a negative effect on performance, although it is now dealt with as a matter of routine.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-popsci.com-59)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-theatlantic.com-60)

Since women have been sent to space, the previously male focused clothing has been reconsidered addressing the issues and needs for clothing like [space suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suits "Space suits") for [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") (EVA) and bras, e.g. for exercise in [micro-g environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-g_environment "Micro-g environment").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-clothing-61)

Furthermore, [space toilet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_toilet "Space toilet") designs did not have women in mind, until October 2020 when the first toilet with better design for women (as well as men) was delivered to the ISS.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-62)

### Radiation and uterine and breast cancer

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Radiation and uterine and breast cancer")]

Both men and women are affected by radiation. Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") who receive solar particles from [solar proton events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_proton_event "Solar proton event") (SPE) and [galactic cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_cosmic_rays "Galactic cosmic rays") from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a [major health concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays "Health threat from cosmic rays") for astronauts traveling to the Moon and to any distant location beyond Earth orbit. Evidence indicates past [solar particle event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_particle_event "Solar particle event") (SPE) radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-63)

However, due to the currently used risk models for endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer, women at NASA can currently only spend half as much time on missions as men, which limits their career options compared to men.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-64)

Astronauts on [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Apollo "Project Apollo") and [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab") missions received on average 1.2 mSv/day and 1.4 mSv/day respectively.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-historicalexposure-65) Exposures on the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") average 0.4 mSv per day[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-historicalexposure-65) (150 mSv per year), although frequent crew rotations minimize risk to individuals.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-66) A trip to Mars with current technology might be related to measurements by the [Mars Science Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory "Mars Science Laboratory") which for a 180-day journey estimated an exposure approximately 300 mSv, which would be equivalent of 24 [CAT scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan") or "15 times an annual radiation limit for a worker in a nuclear power plant".[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-67)

A study published in 2005 in the _International Journal of Impotence Research_ reported that short-duration missions (no longer than nine days) did not affect "the ability of astronauts to conceive and bear healthy children to term."[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-china-68) In another experiment, the frog [Xenopus laevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenopus_laevis "Xenopus laevis") successfully ovulated in space.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-69)

Astronauts [Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova") (the first woman in space) and [Andriyan Nikolayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriyan_Nikolayev "Andriyan Nikolayev") became the first married astronauts and the first having a child after both being in space.

NASA has not permitted [pregnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy "Pregnancy") astronauts to fly in space,[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Foster-139-70) and there have been no pregnant women in space.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-stier-71) However, various science experiments have dealt with some aspects of pregnancy.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-stier-71)

For air travel, the United States' [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") recommends a limit of 1 mSv total for a pregnancy, and no more than 0.5 mSv per month.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-davis-72)

For fetus radiation increases the risk of childhood cancers.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-73) Additionally children of female astronauts could be sterile if the astronaut were exposed to too much ionizing radiation during the later stages of a pregnancy.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-tay-74) Ionizing radiation may destroy the egg cells of a female fetus inside a pregnant woman, rendering the offspring infertile even when grown.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-tay-74)

While no human had [gestated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestate "Gestate") in space as of 2003, scientists have conducted experiments on non-human mammalian gestation.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-75) Space missions that have studied "reproducing and growing mammals" include [Kosmos 1129](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1129 "Kosmos 1129") and 1154, as the Shuttle missions [STS-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-66 "STS-66"), [70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-70 "STS-70"), [72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-72 "STS-72"), and [90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-90 "STS-90").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-76) A Soviet experiment in 1983 showed that a rat that orbited while pregnant later gave birth to healthy babies; the babies were "thinner and weaker than their Earth-based counterparts and lagged behind a bit in their mental development," although the developing pups eventually caught up.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-stier-71)

The lack of knowledge about pregnancy and birth control in micro-gravity has been noted in regards to conducting long-term space missions.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Foster-139-70)

A [1998 Space Shuttle mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-90 "STS-90") showed that rodent _[Rattus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattus "Rattus")_ mothers were either not producing enough milk or not feeding their offspring in space.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-77) However, a later study on pregnant rats showed that the animals successfully gave birth and lactated normally.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-stier-71)

[Anna Lee Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Lee_Fisher "Anna Lee Fisher") was in 1984 the first biological mother going into space.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Contrera_2019_i376-78)

To date no human children have been born in space; neither have children gone into space.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-stier-71) Nevertheless, the idea of children in space is taken seriously enough that some have discussed how to raise children in space.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-79)

The US has since the 1980s the largest group of women of all countries, more than all other that have ever gone to space combined.

[Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride "Sally Ride") became the first American woman in space, when she flew in June 1983 on the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") mission [STS-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-7 "STS-7") to space.

The first US woman to perform [Extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") (EVA) was [Kathryn D. Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_D._Sullivan "Kathryn D.

Although not a NASA astronaut, Millie Hughes-Fulford of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs flew on the STS-40 Space Shuttle mission in June 1991 as the first female payload specialist from outside the space agency.

Russia has sent three women since its [Roscosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos "Roscosmos") state corporation inherited in 1991 the [Soviet space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program "Soviet space program"), which had sent two, the very first women altogether from Russia to space.

Originally chosen as cosmonaut during Soviet times, [Yelena V. Kondakova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelena_V._Kondakova "Yelena V. Kondakova") became the first woman cosmonaut for the Russian Federation in 1994, and the first woman to travel for both the [Soyuz program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_program "Soyuz program") and on the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"). Twenty years later, [Yelena Serova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelena_Serova "Yelena Serova") became the first Russian woman cosmonaut to visit the International Space Station on September 26, 2014.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-88)

### European Space Agency (ESA)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_space&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: European Space Agency (ESA)")]

The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") has sent two women to space, while it has sent many more men.

The first woman sent by ESA, as well as [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") and its state space agency [CNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNES "CNES"), was [Claudie Haigneré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudie_Haigner%C3%A9 "Claudie Haigneré"), who went to the Russian space station Mir in 1996. She flew again in 2001 as the first European woman to visit the International Space Station.

Since then the only other woman sent by a European agency [ASI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Space_Agency "Italian Space Agency") and ESA has been Italian [Samantha Cristoforetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Cristoforetti "Samantha Cristoforetti") launched on [Soyuz TMA-15M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-15M "Soyuz TMA-15M") in November 2014. She returned to space in April 2021 on the SpaceX Crew-4 mission to the International Space Station.

[Liu Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yang_(astronaut) "Liu Yang (astronaut)"), the first Chinese woman in space

China has sent three women to space.

In 2012, the [Chinese space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_space_program "Chinese space program") sent their first woman [Liu Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yang_(astronaut) "Liu Yang (astronaut)") to space aboard [Shenzhou 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_9 "Shenzhou 9") to dock with [Tiangong-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong-1 "Tiangong-1").

China's first female [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut") candidates, chosen in 2010 from the ranks of fighter pilots, were required to be married mothers.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-china-68) The Chinese stated that married women were "more physically and psychologically mature" and that the rule that they had have had children was because of concerns that spaceflight would harm their reproductive organs (including unreleased ova).[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-china-68) The unknown nature of the effects of spaceflight on women was also noted.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-china-68) However, the director of the China Astronaut Centre has stated that marriage is a preference but not a strict limitation.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Wu_Bin_interview-100) Part of why they were so strict was because it was their first astronaut selection and they were trying be "extra cautious".[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-china-68) China's first woman astronaut, [Liu Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yang_(astronaut) "Liu Yang (astronaut)"), was married but had no children at the time of her flight in June 2012.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-101)[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-BBC-102) Her second mission launched in June 2022 on [Shenzhou 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_14 "Shenzhou 14").

[Wang Yaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yaping "Wang Yaping") became the second Chinese female astronaut as a member of the [Shenzhou 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_10 "Shenzhou 10") spaceship crew, which orbited the Earth in June 2013, and of the [Tiangong-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong-1 "Tiangong-1") orbiting space station with which it docked. In October 2021, Wang again flew on [Shenzhou 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_13 "Shenzhou 13"), this time to the [Tiangong Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station "Tiangong space station"), where she became the first Chinese female astronaut to perform a spacewalk.

[Wang Haoze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Haoze "Wang Haoze"), who served on the [Shenzhou 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_19 "Shenzhou 19") mission aboard the [Tiangong Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station "Tiangong space station"), was the third Chinese woman to travel to space and the first female [aerospace engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") in the Chinese Space Program. Being ethnically [Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people "Manchu people"), she was also China's first female astronaut from an ethnic minority and second overall.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-103)

[Yi So-yeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_So-yeon "Yi So-yeon") from [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea") was launched into space as a [space flight participant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_flight_participant "Space flight participant") with [Roscosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos "Roscosmos"), alongside two Russian cosmonauts.

[Rayyanah Barnawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayyanah_Barnawi "Rayyanah Barnawi") became the first female astronaut from [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") in May 2023 on the [Axiom-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom-2 "Axiom-2") mission to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").

[Maryna Vasileuskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryna_Vasileuskaya "Maryna Vasileuskaya") was launched to the International Space Station with the [Soyuz MS-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_MS-25 "Soyuz MS-25") mission in March 2024, making her the first woman and astronaut in general from the [Republic of Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Belarus "Republic of Belarus"). However, she is not the first [Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusians "Belarusians") to travel to space, with two previous ones, both male, being from the [Byelorussian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byelorussian_SSR "Byelorussian SSR") and hence travelling as citizens of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union").[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-104)

In May 1991 [Helen Sharman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Sharman "Helen Sharman") went into space on a flight to the [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") space station as a [spaceflight participant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_participant "Spaceflight participant"). Her flight was privately funded by [Project Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Juno "Project Juno"), a British-Soviet collaboration. She was the second person and first woman to be funded privately to go to space. Sharman was the first citizen of the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") to go into space, making the United Kingdom the first of two countries (the other being [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea")) to have a woman as its first person in space.

[Anousheh Ansari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anousheh_Ansari "Anousheh Ansari") was the fourth overall, second woman who went privately funded and first self-funded to space. As well as the first privately funded woman to fly to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") she was also the first [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") woman citizen (dual citizenship with the US) to go to space. She flew to the station in 2006 on the [Soyuz TMA-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-9 "Soyuz TMA-9") spacecraft.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-105) Her mission launched from the [Baikonur Cosmodrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome "Baikonur Cosmodrome") on September 18, 2006. Soyuz TMA-9 transported two-thirds of ISS [Expedition 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_14 "Expedition 14") to the space station along with Ansari.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Ansari-ESA-106) Ansari performed several experiments on behalf of the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-Ansari-ESA-106)

Ansari holds a plant grown in the _[Zvezda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda\_(ISS\_module) "Zvezda (ISS module)")_ Service Module of the International Space Station.

In February 2019 [Beth Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Moses "Beth Moses") of Virgin Galactic became the first [commercial astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut "Commercial astronaut") woman to go to space (sub-orbital). [Sirisha Bandla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirisha_Bandla "Sirisha Bandla") also flew on Virgin Galactic in July 2021.

[Wally Funk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Funk "Wally Funk"), member of the [Mercury 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_13 "Mercury 13"), became the oldest woman in space when she flew on Blue Origin's [New Shephard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard "New Shepard") sub-orbital flight on 20 July 2021.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-107) In addition to being the only member of the Mercury 13 to ever fly in space, she also broke the record for oldest person in space at the age of 82, though her record was broken by [William Shatner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner "William Shatner"), age 90, in October that same year.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_space#cite_note-108)

Ten years after "Star Trek" was cancelled, almost to the day, I was invited to join the board of directors of the newly formed National Space Society. They flew me to Washington and I gave a speech called "New Opportunities for the Humanization of Space" or "Space, What's in it for me?" In [the speech], I'm going where no man or woman dares go. I took NASA on for not including women and I gave some history of the powerful women who had applied and, after five times applying, felt disenfranchised and backed off. [At that time] NASA was having their fifth or sixth recruitment and women and ethnic people [were] staying away in droves. I was asked to come to headquarters the next day and they wanted me to assist them in persuading women and people of ethnic backgrounds that NASA was serious [about recruiting them]. And I said you've got to be joking; I didn't take them seriously. . . . John Yardley, who I knew from working on a previous project, was in the room and said 'Nichelle, we are serious.' I said OK. I will do this and I will bring you the most qualified people on the planet, as qualified as anyone you've ever had and I will bring them in droves. And if you do not pick a person of color, if you do not pick a woman, if it's the same old, same old, all-white male astronaut corps, that you've done for the last five years, and I'm just another dupe, I will be your worst nightmare.
