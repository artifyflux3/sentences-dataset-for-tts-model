[ 1 ] The processes that are used in carbochemistry include degasification processes such as carbonization and coking , gasification processes, and liquefaction processes.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The beginning of carbochemistry goes back to the 16th century. At that time, large quantities of charcoal were needed for the smelting of iron ores . Since the production of charcoal required large amounts of slowly-regenerating wood, the use of coal was studied. The use of pure coal was difficult because of the amount of liquid and solid by-products that were generated. In order to improve the handling the coal was initially treated as wood in kilns to produce coke .

Around 1684, John Clayton discovered that coal gas generated from coal was combustible. He described his discovery in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .
