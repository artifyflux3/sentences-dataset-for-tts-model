Biography [ edit ] He was born at Löwenberg , Silesia , into a Jewish family, [ 1 ] and educated at Leipzig and Halle . He was made professor at Strassburg (1872) and went to Jena in 1882. He died at Jena . The mathematician Heinrich Liebmann was his son and the physician Otto Liebmann is his eponymous great-grandson.

Philosophical work [ edit ] A forerunner of neo-Kantianism , in his best-known book, Kant und die Epigonen , he deals with the philosophy after Kant , discussing Fichte , Schelling , Hegel , Fries , Herbart and Schopenhauer . Having credited Kant's philosophy (though criticizing it on the vital point of accepting a thing-in-itself ), he focuses on what he sees as the shortcomings in the approaches of Kants successors. He frequently ends a section with the statement that one should return to Kant.

Liebmann's work also influenced his Jena colleague Gottlob Frege .
