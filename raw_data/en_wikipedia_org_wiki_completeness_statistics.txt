It is opposed to the concept of an ancillary statistic . While an ancillary statistic contains no information about the model parameters, a complete statistic contains only information about the parameters, and no ancillary information. It is closely related to the concept of a sufficient statistic which contains all of the information that the dataset provides about the parameters.

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] Consider a random variable X whose probability distribution belongs to a parametric model P θ parametrized by θ .

Say T is a statistic ; that is, the composition of a measurable function with a random sample X 1 ,..., X n .

The statistic T is said to be complete for the distribution of X if, for every measurable function g, [ 1 ] if E θ θ ⁡ ⁡ ( g ( T ) ) = 0 for all θ θ then P θ θ ( g ( T ) = 0 ) = 1 for all θ θ .

{\displaystyle {\text{if }}\operatorname {E} _{\theta }(g(T))=0{\text{ for all }}\theta {\text{ then }}\mathbf {P} _{\theta }(g(T)=0)=1{\text{ for all }}\theta .} The statistic T is said to be boundedly complete for the distribution of X if this implication holds for every measurable function g that is also bounded.

Examples [ edit ] Bernoulli model [ edit ] The Bernoulli model admits a complete statistic.

[ 1 ] Let X be a random sample of size n such that each X i has the same Bernoulli distribution with parameter p . Let T be the number of 1s observed in the sample, i.e.

T = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n X i {\displaystyle \textstyle T=\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}} .

T is a statistic of X which has  a binomial distribution with parameters ( n , p ). If the parameter space for p is (0,1), then T is a complete statistic. To see this, note that E p ⁡ ⁡ ( g ( T ) ) = ∑ ∑ t = 0 n g ( t ) ( n t ) p t ( 1 − − p ) n − − t = ( 1 − − p ) n ∑ ∑ t = 0 n g ( t ) ( n t ) ( p 1 − − p ) t .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} _{p}(g(T))=\sum _{t=0}^{n}{g(t){n \choose t}p^{t}(1-p)^{n-t}}=(1-p)^{n}\sum _{t=0}^{n}{g(t){n \choose t}\left({\frac {p}{1-p}}\right)^{t}}.} Observe also that neither p nor 1 − p can be 0. Hence E p ( g ( T ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle E_{p}(g(T))=0} if and only if: ∑ ∑ t = 0 n g ( t ) ( n t ) ( p 1 − − p ) t = 0.

{\displaystyle \sum _{t=0}^{n}g(t){n \choose t}\left({\frac {p}{1-p}}\right)^{t}=0.} On denoting p /(1 − p ) by r , one gets: ∑ ∑ t = 0 n g ( t ) ( n t ) r t = 0.

{\displaystyle \sum _{t=0}^{n}g(t){n \choose t}r^{t}=0.} First, observe that the range of r is the positive reals . Also, E( g ( T )) is a polynomial in r and, therefore, can only be identical to 0 if all coefficients are 0, that is, g ( t ) = 0 for all t .

It is important to notice that the result that all coefficients must be 0 was obtained because of the range of r . Had the parameter space been finite and with a number of elements less than or equal to n , it might be possible to solve the linear equations in g ( t ) obtained by substituting the values of r and get solutions different from 0. For example, if n = 1 and the parameter space is {0.5}, a single observation and a single parameter value, T is not complete. Observe that, with the definition: g ( t ) = 2 ( t − − 0.5 ) , {\displaystyle g(t)=2(t-0.5),\,} then, E( g ( T )) = 0 although g ( t ) is not 0 for t = 0 nor for t = 1.

Gaussian model with fixed variance [ edit ] This example will show that, in a sample X 1 , X 2 of size 2 from a normal distribution with known variance, the statistic X 1 + X 2 is complete and sufficient. Suppose X 1 , X 2 are independent , identically distributed random variables, normally distributed with expectation θ and variance 1.
The sum s ( ( X 1 , X 2 ) ) = X 1 + X 2 {\displaystyle s((X_{1},X_{2}))=X_{1}+X_{2}} is a complete statistic for θ .

To show this, it is sufficient to demonstrate that there is no non-zero function g {\displaystyle g} such that the expectation of g ( s ( X 1 , X 2 ) ) = g ( X 1 + X 2 ) {\displaystyle g(s(X_{1},X_{2}))=g(X_{1}+X_{2})} remains zero regardless of the value of θ .

That fact may be seen as follows. The probability distribution of X 1 + X 2 is normal with expectation 2 θ and variance 2. Its probability density function in x {\displaystyle x} is therefore proportional to exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ( x − − 2 θ θ ) 2 / 4 ) .

{\displaystyle \exp \left(-(x-2\theta )^{2}/4\right).} The expectation of g above would therefore be a constant times ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ g ( x ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ( x − − 2 θ θ ) 2 / 4 ) d x .

{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }g(x)\exp \left(-(x-2\theta )^{2}/4\right)\,dx.} A bit of algebra reduces this to k ( θ θ ) ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ h ( x ) e x θ θ d x , {\displaystyle k(\theta )\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }h(x)e^{x\theta }\,dx,} where k ( θ ) is nowhere zero and h ( x ) = g ( x ) e − − x 2 / 4 .

{\displaystyle h(x)=g(x)e^{-x^{2}/4}.} As a function of θ this is a two-sided Laplace transform of h , and cannot be identically zero unless h is zero almost everywhere.

[ 2 ] The exponential is not zero, so this can only happen if g is zero almost everywhere.

By contrast, the statistic ( X 1 , X 2 ) {\textstyle (X_{1},X_{2})} is sufficient but not complete. It admits a non-zero unbiased estimator of zero, namely X 1 − − X 2 {\textstyle X_{1}-X_{2}} .

Sufficiency does not imply completeness [ edit ] Most parametric models have a sufficient statistic which is not complete. This is important because the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem cannot be applied to such models. Galili and Meilijson 2016 [ 3 ] propose the following didactic example.

Consider n {\displaystyle n} independent samples from the uniform distribution: X i ∼ ∼ U ( ( 1 − − k ) θ θ , ( 1 + k ) θ θ ) 0 < k < 1 {\displaystyle X_{i}\sim U{\big (}(1-k)\theta ,(1+k)\theta {\big )}\qquad \qquad 0<k<1} k {\displaystyle k} is a known design parameter. This model is a scale family (a specific case of a location-scale family ) model: scaling the samples by a multiplier c {\displaystyle c} multiplies the parameter θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } .

Galili and Meilijson show that the minimum and maximum of the samples are together a sufficient statistic: X ( 1 ) , X ( n ) {\displaystyle X_{(1)},X_{(n)}} (using the usual notation for order statistics ). Indeed, conditional on these two values, the distribution of the rest of the sample is simply uniform on the range they define: [ X ( 1 ) , X ( n ) ] {\displaystyle \left[X_{(1)},X_{(n)}\right]} .

However, their ratio has a distribution which does not depend on θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } . This follows from the fact that this is a scale family: any change of scale impacts both variables identically. Subtracting the mean m {\displaystyle m} from that distribution, we obtain: E [ X ( n ) X ( 1 ) ] − − m = 0 {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \left[{\frac {X_{(n)}}{X_{(1)}}}\right]-m=0} We have thus shown that there exists a function g ( X ( 1 ) , X ( n ) ) {\displaystyle g\left(X_{(1)},X_{(n)}\right)} which is not 0 {\displaystyle 0} everywhere but which has expectation 0 {\displaystyle 0} . The pair is thus not complete.

Importance of completeness [ edit ] The notion of completeness has many applications in statistics, particularly in the following theorems of mathematical statistics.

Lehmann–Scheffé theorem [ edit ] Completeness occurs in the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem , [ 1 ] which states that if a statistic that is unbiased, complete and sufficient for some parameter θ , then it is the best mean-unbiased estimator for θ . In other words, this statistic has a smaller expected loss for any convex loss function; in many practical applications with the squared loss-function, it has a smaller mean squared error among any estimators with the same expected value .

Examples exists that when the minimal sufficient statistic is not complete then several alternative statistics exist for unbiased estimation of θ , while some of them have lower variance than others.

[ 3 ] See also minimum-variance unbiased estimator .

Basu's theorem [ edit ] Bounded completeness occurs in Basu's theorem , [ 1 ] which states that a statistic that is both boundedly complete and sufficient is independent of any ancillary statistic .

Bahadur's theorem [ edit ] Bounded completeness also occurs in Bahadur's theorem. In the case where there exists at least one minimal sufficient statistic, a statistic which is sufficient and boundedly complete, is necessarily minimal sufficient.
