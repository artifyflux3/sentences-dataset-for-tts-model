It was a term used in contrast to anagenesis , which in present usage denotes the evolution of a single population into a new form without branching lines of descent.

The earliest written reference to catagenesis comes from Edward Drinker Cope , [ 1 ] in his article, On Catagenesis, published in The American Naturalist in 1884. In this article, he defines the "primitive energy", which evolution through time has specialized. He defines catagenesis as a return to the "primitive energy".
