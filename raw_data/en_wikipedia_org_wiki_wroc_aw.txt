M.P., 1994, vol. 50, No. 425 [ 3 ] Wrocław ( Polish: [ˈvrɔt͡swaf] ⓘ ; [ a ] German : Breslau [ˈbʁɛslaʊ] ⓘ ; also known by other names ) is a city in southwestern Poland , and the capital of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship . It is the largest city and historical capital of the region of Silesia .

[ 7 ] It lies on the banks of the Oder River in the Silesian Lowlands of Central Europe , roughly 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the north of the Sudetic Mountains . In 2023, the official population of Wrocław was 674,132, making it the third-largest city in Poland. The population of the Wrocław metropolitan area is around 1.25 million.

Wrocław is the historical capital of Silesia and Lower Silesia . The history of the city dates back over 1,000 years; [ 8 ] throughout history it has been part of, chronologically: the Duchy of Poland , the Kingdom of Poland , the Duchy of Silesia , the Kingdom of Bohemia , the Kingdom of Hungary , the Habsburg monarchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany , until it became again part of Poland in 1945 immediately after World War II .

Wrocław is a university city with a student population of over 130,000, making it one of the most youth-oriented cities in the country.

[ 9 ] Wrocław has numerous historical landmarks, including the Main Market Square , Cathedral Island , Bridge of Love , Wrocław Opera , the National Museum and the Centennial Hall , which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The Wrocław's dwarfs are a major tourist attraction and have become a symbol of Wrocław. The city is home to the Wrocław Zoo , the oldest zoological garden in Poland.

Wrocław is classified as a Sufficiency global city by GaWC .

[ 10 ] It is often featured in lists of the most livable places in the world, [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and was ranked 1st among all medium and small cities by fDi Intelligence in 2021.

[ 13 ] The city is home to Śląsk Wrocław football club and hosted the 2012 European Football Championship . In 2016, the city was a European Capital of Culture and the World Book Capital , [ 14 ] and hosted the Theatre Olympics and the European Film Awards . In 2017, the city was host to the World Games . In 2019, it was named a UNESCO City of Literature .

Etymology [ edit ] The Coat of arms of Wrocław , with the inscription Civitas Wratislaviensis , in Lauf Castle , c.

1360 The origin of the city's name remains a matter of debate. It was long believed that the city was named after Duke Vratislav I of Bohemia from the Czech Přemyslid dynasty , who was ruling between 915 and 921.

[ 15 ] This thesis is contradicted, however, by the fact that the Czechs only took control of the Wrocław gród around the year 945.

[ 16 ] The earliest recorded mentions of the city's name, found in Thietmar's Chronicle ( Wrotizla , Wordisclavia , Wortizlania , Vaurtizlau ), written around the year 1000, indicate the phonetic form of the original name of the city as Wrocisław , derived from the Old Polish given name Wrocisław/Warcisław.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] According to researchers, this was the name of the city's founder, whom Edmund Małachowicz identified as a duke from the Włost family of Niemcza.

[ 16 ] As a result of phonetic changes, the name was later shortened to Wrocław , first recorded in 1175 in the Latinized form Wrezlaw , and it became widespread in the 13th century.

[ 19 ] Also in the 12th century, a Czech-influenced and Latinized form, Vratislavia , began to appear.

[ 20 ] The city's first municipal seal was inscribed with Sigillum civitatis Wratislavie .

[ 21 ] By the 15th century, the Early New High German variations of the name, Breslau , first began to be used. Despite the noticeable differences in spelling, the numerous German forms were still based on the original West Slavic name of the city, with the -Vr- sound being replaced over time by -Br- , [ 22 ] and the suffix -slav- replaced with -slau- . These variations included Wrotizla , Vratizlau , Wratislau , Wrezlau , Breßlau or Bresslau among others.

[ 23 ] A Prussian description from 1819 mentions two names of the city – Polish and German – stating "Breslau (polnisch Wraclaw)".

[ 24 ] In other languages, the city's name is: German : Breslau [ˈbʁɛslaʊ] ⓘ ; Silesian German : Brassel ; Yiddish : ברעסלוי , romanized : Bresloy ; Silesian : Wrocław ; modern Czech : Vratislav [ˈvracɪslaf] ; Hungarian : Boroszló [ˈborosloː] ; and Latin : Wratislavia or Vratislavia .

[ 25 ] People born or resident in the city are known as " Wrocławians " or "Vratislavians" ( Polish : wrocławianie ). The now little-used German equivalent is " Breslauer ".

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Wrocław and Timeline of Wrocław In ancient times, there was a place called Budorigum at or near the site of Wrocław. It was already mapped on Claudius Ptolemy 's map of AD 142–147.

[ 26 ] Settlements in the area existed from the 6th century onward during the migration period . The Ślężans , a West Slavic tribe, settled on the Oder river and erected a fortified gord on Ostrów Tumski .

Wrocław originated at the intersection of two trade routes , the Via Regia and the Amber Road . Archeological research conducted in the city indicates that it was founded around 940.

[ 27 ] In 985, Duke Mieszko I of Poland conquered Silesia, and constructed new fortifications on Ostrów.

[ 28 ] The town was mentioned by Thietmar explicitly in the year 1000 AD in connection with its promotion to an episcopal see during the Congress of Gniezno .

[ 29 ] Middle Ages [ edit ] St Martin's Church , the only remaining part of the medieval Piast castle that once stood in Wrocław During Wrocław's early history, control over it changed hands between the Duchy of Bohemia (1038–1054), the Duchy of Poland and the Kingdom of Poland (985–1038 and 1054–1320). Following the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Poland , the Piast dynasty ruled the Duchy of Silesia . One of the most important events during this period was the foundation of the Diocese of Wrocław in 1000. Along with the Bishoprics of Kraków and Kołobrzeg , Wrocław was placed under the Archbishopric of Gniezno in Greater Poland , founded by Pope Sylvester II through the intercession of Polish duke (and later king) Bolesław I the Brave and Emperor Otto III , during the Gniezno Congress.

[ 30 ] In the years 1034–1038 the city was affected by the pagan reaction in Poland .

[ 31 ] The city became a commercial centre and expanded to Wyspa Piasek (Sand Island), and then onto the left bank of the River Oder . Around 1000, the town had about 1,000 inhabitants.

[ 32 ] In 1109 during the Polish-German war , Prince Bolesław III Wrymouth defeated the King of Germany Henry V at the Battle of Hundsfeld , stopping the German advance into Poland. The medieval chronicle, Gesta principum Polonorum (1112–1116) by Gallus Anonymus , named Wrocław, along with Kraków and Sandomierz , as one of three capitals of the Polish Kingdom. Also, the Tabula Rogeriana , a book written by the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi in 1154, describes Wrocław as one of the Polish cities, alongside Kraków, Gniezno , Sieradz , Łęczyca and Santok .

[ 33 ] By 1139, a settlement belonging to Governor Piotr Włostowic (also known as Piotr Włast Dunin ) was built, and another on the left bank of the River Oder, near the present site of the university. While the city was largely Polish, it also had communities of Bohemians (Czechs), Germans , Walloons and Jews .

[ 34 ] [ 31 ] [ 35 ] Church of Saint Giles (pl) erected in the 1220s at Ostrów Tumski , the oldest section of Wrocław In the 13th century, Wrocław was the political centre of the divided Polish kingdom.

[ 36 ] In April 1241, during the first Mongol invasion of Poland , the city was abandoned by its inhabitants and burnt down for strategic reasons. During the battles with the Mongols Wrocław Castle was successfully defended by Henry II the Pious .

[ 37 ] In 1245, in Wrocław, Franciscan friar Benedict of Poland , considered one of the first Polish explorers, joined Italian diplomat Giovanni da Pian del Carpine , on his journey to the seat of the Mongol Khan near Karakorum , the capital of the Mongol Empire , in what is considered the first such journey by Europeans.

[ 38 ] After the Mongol invasion, the town was partly populated by German settlers who, in the ensuing centuries, gradually became its dominant population.

[ 39 ] The city, however, retained its multi-ethnic character, a reflection of its importance as a trading post on the junction of the Via Regia and the Amber Road.

[ 40 ] With the influx of settlers, the town expanded and in 1242 came under German town law . The city council used both Latin and German , and the early forms of the name Breslau , the German name of the city, appeared for the first time in its written records.

[ 39 ] Polish gradually ceased to be used in the town books, while it survived in the courts until 1337, when it was banned by the new rulers, the German-speaking House of Luxembourg .

[ 35 ] The enlarged town covered around 60 hectares (150 acres), and the new main market square , surrounded by timber-frame houses, became the trade centre of the town. The original foundation, Ostrów Tumski , became its religious centre. The city gained Magdeburg rights in 1261. While the Polish Piast dynasty remained in control of the region, the city council's ability to govern independently had increased.

[ 41 ] In 1274 prince Henry IV Probus gave the city its staple right . In the 13th century, two Polish monarchs were buried in Wrocław churches founded by them, Henry II the Pious in the St. Vincent church [ 42 ] and Henryk IV Probus in the Holy Cross church .

[ 43 ] The oldest printed text in the Polish language – Statuta Synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensis , printed in Wrocław by Kasper Elyan, 1475 Wrocław, which for 350 years had been mostly under Polish hegemony , fell in 1335, after the death of Henry VI the Good , to John of Luxembourg . His son Emperor Charles IV in 1348 formally incorporated the city into the Holy Roman Empire . Between 1342 and 1344, two fires destroyed large parts of the city. In 1387 the city joined the Hanseatic League . On 5 June 1443, the city was rocked by an earthquake, estimated at magnitude 6, which destroyed or seriously damaged many of its buildings.

Between 1469 and 1490, Wrocław was part of the Kingdom of Hungary , and king Matthias Corvinus was said to have had a Vratislavian mistress who bore him a son.

[ 44 ] In 1474, after almost a century, the city left the Hanseatic League. Also in 1474, the city was besieged by combined Polish-Czech forces. However, in November 1474, Kings Casimir IV of Poland , his son Vladislaus II of Bohemia , and Matthias Corvinus of Hungary met in the nearby village of Muchobór Wielki (present-day a district of Wrocław), and in December 1474 a ceasefire was signed according to which the city remained under Hungarian rule.

[ 45 ] The following year was marked by the publication in Wrocław of the Statuta Synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensium (1475) by Kasper Elyan, the first ever incunable in Polish, containing the proceedings and prayers of the Wrocław bishops.

[ 46 ] Renaissance and the Reformation [ edit ] A map of the city from 1562, with its fortifications on the Oder River In the 16th century, the Breslauer Schöps beer style was created in Breslau.

[ 47 ] The Protestant Reformation reached the city in 1518 and it converted to the new rite. However, starting in 1526 Silesia was ruled by the Catholic House of Habsburg . In 1618, it supported the Bohemian Revolt out of fear of losing the right to religious freedom . During the ensuing Thirty Years' War , the city was occupied by Saxon and Swedish troops and lost thousands of inhabitants to the plague .

[ 48 ] The Emperor brought in the Counter-Reformation by encouraging Catholic orders to settle in the city, starting in 1610 with the Franciscans , followed by the Jesuits , then Capuchins , and finally Ursuline nuns in 1687.

[ 15 ] These orders erected buildings that shaped the city's appearance until 1945. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, however, it was one of only a few Silesian cities to stay Protestant.

The Polish Municipal school opened in 1666 and lasted until 1766. Precise record-keeping of births and deaths by the city fathers led to the use of their data for analysis of mortality, first by John Graunt and then, based on data provided to him by Breslau professor Caspar Neumann , by Edmond Halley .

[ 49 ] Halley's tables and analysis, published in 1693, are considered to be the first true actuarial tables, and thus the foundation of modern actuarial science . During the Counter-Reformation, the intellectual life of the city flourished, as the Protestant bourgeoisie lost some of its dominance to the Catholic orders as patrons of the arts.

Enlightenment period [ edit ] The Battle of Breslau during the Seven Years' War ( Third Silesian War 1756–1763) One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the city in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

[ 50 ] The city became the centre of German Baroque literature and was home to the First and Second Silesian school of poets.

[ 51 ] In 1742, the Schlesische Zeitung was founded in Breslau.

[ 52 ] In the 1740s the Kingdom of Prussia annexed the city and most of Silesia during the War of the Austrian Succession .

Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa ceded most of the territory in the Treaty of Breslau in 1742 to Prussia. Austria attempted to recover Silesia during the Seven Years' War at the Battle of Breslau , but they were unsuccessful. The Venetian Italian adventurer, Giacomo Casanova , stayed in Breslau in 1766.

[ 52 ] Napoleonic Wars [ edit ] The entry of Prince Jérôme Bonaparte into the city, 7 January 1807 During the Napoleonic Wars , it was occupied by the Confederation of the Rhine army. The fortifications of the city were levelled, and monasteries and cloisters were seized.

[ 15 ] The Protestant Viadrina European University at Frankfurt an der Oder was relocated to Breslau in 1811, and united with the local Jesuit University to create the new Silesian Frederick-William University ( German : Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universität , now the University of Wrocław ). The city became a centre of the German Liberation movement against Napoleon, and a gathering place for volunteers from all over Germany. The city was the centre of Prussian mobilisation for the campaign which ended at the Battle of Leipzig .

[ 53 ] Industrial age [ edit ] The Confederation of the Rhine had increased prosperity in Silesia and in the city. The removal of fortifications opened room for the city to expand beyond its former limits. Breslau became an important railway hub and industrial centre, notably for linen and cotton manufacture and the metal industry. The reconstructed university served as a major centre of science; Johannes Brahms later wrote his Academic Festival Overture to thank the university for an honorary doctorate awarded in 1879.

[ 54 ] In 1821, the (Arch)Diocese of Breslau withdrew from dependence on the Polish archbishopric of Gniezno, and Breslau became an exempt see. In 1822, the Prussian police discovered the Polonia Polish youth resistance organisation and carried out arrests of its members and searches of their homes.

[ 55 ] In 1848, many local Polish students joined the Greater Poland uprising against Prussia.

[ 56 ] On 5 May 1848, a convention of Polish activists from the Prussian and Austrian partitions of Poland was held in the city.

[ 57 ] On 10 October 1854, the Jewish Theological Seminary opened. The institution was the first modern rabbinical seminary in Central Europe. In 1863 the brothers Karl and Louis Stangen founded the travel agency Stangen, the second travel agency in the world.

[ 58 ] The Royal Palace from 1717 was once the residence of Prussian monarchs. Today, the building houses the City Museum.

The city was an important centre of the Polish secret resistance movement and the seat of a Polish uprising committee before and during the January Uprising of 1863–1864 in the Russian Partition of Poland.

[ 59 ] Local Poles took part in Polish national mourning after the Russian massacre of Polish protesters in Warsaw in February 1861, and also organised several patriotic Polish church services throughout 1861.

[ 60 ] Secret Polish correspondence, weapons, and insurgents were transported through the city.

[ 61 ] After the outbreak of the uprising in 1863, the Prussian police carried out mass searches of Polish homes, especially those of Poles who had recently come to the city.

[ 62 ] The city's inhabitants, both Poles and Germans, excluding the German aristocracy, largely sympathised with the uprising, and some Germans even joined local Poles in their secret activities.

[ 63 ] In June 1863 the city was officially confirmed as the seat of secret Polish insurgent authorities.

[ 64 ] In January 1864, the Prussian police arrested a number of members of the Polish insurgent movement.

[ 65 ] Old Town Hall , 1900 The Unification of Germany in 1871 turned Breslau into the sixth-largest city in the German Empire . Its population more than tripled to over half a million between 1860 and 1910. The 1900 census listed 422,709 residents.

[ 66 ] In 1890, construction began of Breslau Fortress as the city's defences. Important landmarks were inaugurated in 1910, the Kaiser bridge (today Grunwald Bridge ) and the Technical University , which now houses the Wrocław University of Technology .
The 1910 census listed 95.7% of the population as German-speakers, with 15,107 Polish-speakers (3%), and 3,431 (0.7%) as bilingual in Polish and German, [ 67 ] although some estimates put the number of Poles in the city at the time at 20,000 to 30,000.

[ 68 ] The population was 58% Protestant, 37% Catholic (including at least 2% Polish) [ 69 ] and 5% Jewish (totaling 20,536 in the 1905 census).

[ 70 ] The Jewish community of Breslau was among the most important in Germany, producing several distinguished artists and scientists.

[ 71 ] From 1912, the head of the university's Department of Psychiatry and director of the Clinic of Psychiatry ( Königlich Psychiatrischen und Nervenklinik ) was Alois Alzheimer and, that same year, professor William Stern introduced the concept of IQ .

[ 72 ] Market Square , 1890–1900 Feniks Department Store , built in 1902–1904 In 1913, the newly built Centennial Hall housed an exhibition commemorating the 100th anniversary of the historical German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon and the first award of the Iron Cross .

[ 73 ] The Centennial Hall was built by Max Berg (1870–1947), since 2006 it is part of the world heritage of UNESCO.

[ 74 ] The central station (by Wilhelm Grapow, 1857) was one of the biggest in Germany and one of the first stations with electrified railway services.

[ 75 ] Since 1900 modern department stores like Barasch (today "Feniks") or Petersdorff (built by architect Erich Mendelsohn) were erected.

During World War I , in 1914, a branch of the Organizacja Pomocy Legionom ("Legion Assistance Organisation") operated in the city with the goal of gaining support and recruiting volunteers for the Polish Legion , but three Legions' envoys were arrested by the Germans in November 1914 and deported to Austria, and the organisation soon ended its activities in the city.

[ 76 ] During the war, the German administration operated seven forced labour camps for Allied prisoners of war in the city.

[ 77 ] Following the war, Breslau became the capital of the newly created Prussian Province of Lower Silesia of the Weimar Republic in 1919. After the war the Polish community began holding masses in Polish at the Church of Saint Anne, and, as of 1921, at St. Martin's and a Polish School was founded by Helena Adamczewska.

[ 78 ] In 1920 a Polish consulate was opened on the Main Square. In August 1920, during the Polish Silesian Uprising in Upper Silesia , the Polish Consulate and School were destroyed, while the Polish Library was burned down by a mob. The number of Poles as a percentage of the total population fell to just 0.5% after the re-emergence of Poland as a state in 1918, when many moved to Poland.

[ 69 ] Antisemitic riots occurred in 1923.

[ 79 ] The city boundaries were expanded between 1925 and 1930 to include an area of 175 km 2 (68 sq mi) with a population of 600,000. In 1929, the Werkbund opened WuWa ( German : Wohnungs- und Werkraumausstellung ) in Breslau-Scheitnig, an international showcase of modern architecture by architects of the Silesian branch of the Werkbund. In June 1930, Breslau hosted the Deutsche Kampfspiele , a sporting event for German athletes after Germany was excluded from the Olympic Games after World War I. The number of Jews remaining in Breslau fell from 23,240 in 1925 to 10,659 in 1933.

[ 80 ] Up to the beginning of World War II, Breslau was the largest city in Germany east of Berlin .

[ 81 ] A pre-war aerial view of the city, 1920 Known as a stronghold of left wing liberalism during the German Empire, Breslau eventually became one of the strongest support bases of the Nazi Party , which in the 1932 elections received 44% of the city's vote, their third-highest total in all Germany.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] After Hitler 's appointment as German Chancellor in 1933, political enemies of the Nazis were persecuted, and their institutions closed or destroyed.

KZ Dürrgoy , one of the first concentration camps in Nazi Germany , was set up in the city in 1933.

[ 84 ] The Gestapo began actions against Polish and Jewish students (see: Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau ), Communists , Social Democrats , and trade unionists . Arrests were made for speaking Polish in public, and in 1938 the Nazi-controlled police destroyed the Polish cultural centre.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] In June 1939, Polish students were expelled from the university.

[ 87 ] Also many other people seen as "undesirable" by Nazi Germany were sent to concentration camps .

[ 85 ] A network of concentration camps and forced labour camps was established around Breslau to serve industrial concerns, including FAMO , Junkers , and Krupp . Tens of thousands of forced labourers were imprisoned there.

[ 88 ] The last big event organised by the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise , called Deutsches Turn-und-Sportfest (Gym and Sports Festivities), took place in Breslau from 26 to 31 July 1938. The Sportsfest was held to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon's invasion.

[ 89 ] Second World War [ edit ] Wartime destruction around the cathedral, 1945 During the invasion of Poland , which started World War II , in September 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Polish activists and banned Polish organisations, [ 87 ] and the city was made the headquarters of the southern district of the Selbstschutz , whose task was to persecute Poles .

[ 90 ] For most of the war, the fighting did not affect the city. During the war, the Germans opened the graves of medieval Polish monarchs and local dukes to carry out anthropological research for propaganda purposes, wanting to demonstrate German " racial purity ".

[ 42 ] The remains were transported to other places by the Germans, and they have not been found to this day.

[ 42 ] In 1941, the remnants of the pre-war Polish minority in the city, as well as Polish slave labourers, organised a resistance group called Olimp . The organisation gathered intelligence, carrying out sabotage and organising aid for Polish slave workers. In September 1941 the city's 10,000 Jews were expelled from their homes and soon deported to concentration camps. Few survived the Holocaust .

[ 91 ] As the war continued, refugees from bombed-out German cities, and later refugees from farther east, swelled the population to nearly one million, [ 92 ] including 51,000 forced labourers in 1944, and 9,876 Allied PoWs. At the end of 1944 an additional 30,000–60,000 Poles were moved into the city after the Germans crushed the Warsaw Uprising .

[ 93 ] During the war the German administration operated four subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the city.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] Approximately 3,400–3,800 men were imprisoned in three subcamps, among them Poles, Russians , Italians , Frenchmen , Ukrainians , Czechs , Belgians , Yugoslavs , Dutchmen , Chinese , and about 1,500 Jewish women were imprisoned in the fourth camp.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] Many prisoners died, and the remaining were evacuated to the main camp of Gross-Rosen in January 1945.

[ 94 ] There were also three subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp , [ 96 ] three subcamps of the Stalag VIII-C POW camp, [ 97 ] and two Nazi prisons in the city, including a youth prison, with multiple forced labour subcamps.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] In 1945, the city became part of the front lines and was the site of the brutal Siege of Breslau .

[ 100 ] Adolf Hitler had in 1944 declared Breslau to be a fortress ( Festung ), to be held at all costs. An attempted evacuation of the city took place in January 1945, with 18,000 people freezing to death in icy snowstorms of −20 °C (−4 °F) weather. In February 1945, the Soviet Army approached the city and the German Luftwaffe began an airlift to the besieged garrison. A large area of the city centre was demolished and turned into an airfield by the defenders.

[ 101 ] By the end of the three-month siege in May 1945, half the city had been destroyed. Breslau was the last major city in Germany to surrender, capitulating only two days before the end of the war in Europe.

[ 102 ] Civilian deaths amounted to as many as 80,000. In August the Soviets placed the city under the control of German communists .

[ 103 ] Following the Yalta Conference held in February 1945, where the new geopolitics of Central Europe were decided, the terms of the Potsdam Conference decreed that along with almost all of Lower Silesia, the city would again become part of Poland [ 103 ] in exchange for Poland's loss of the city of Lwów along with the massive territory of Kresy in the east, which was annexed by the Soviet Union .

[ 104 ] The Polish name of Wrocław was declared official. There had been discussion among the Western Allies to place the southern Polish-German boundary on the Eastern Neisse , which meant post-war Germany would have been allowed to retain approximately half of Silesia, including those parts of Breslau that lay on the west bank of the Oder. However, the Soviet government insisted the border be drawn at the Lusatian Neisse farther west.

[ 104 ] 1945–present [ edit ] A Wrocław dwarf The city's German inhabitants who had not fled, or who had returned to their home city after the war had ended, were expelled between 1945 and 1949 in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement and were settled in the Soviet occupation zone or in the Allied Occupation Zones in the remainder of Germany. The city's last pre-war German school was closed in 1963.

[ 105 ] The Polish population was dramatically increased by the resettlement of Poles, partly due to postwar population transfers during the forced deportations from Polish lands annexed by the Soviet Union in the east region, some of whom came from Lviv ( Lwów ), Volhynia , and the Vilnius Region . However, despite the prime role given to re-settlers from the Kresy , in 1949, only 20% of the new Polish population actually were refugees themselves.

[ 106 ] A small German minority (about 1,000 people, or 2% of the population) remains in the city, so that today the proportion of the Polish population compared to that of the Germans is the reverse of what it was a hundred years ago.

[ 107 ] Traces of the German past, such as inscriptions and signs, were removed.

[ 108 ] In 1948, Wrocław organised the Recovered Territories Exhibition and the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Peace .

Picasso 's lithograph, La Colombe (The Dove), a traditional, realistic picture of a pigeon, without an olive branch, was created on a napkin at the Monopol Hotel in Wrocław during the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Peace .

[ 109 ] In 1963, Wrocław was declared a closed city because of a smallpox epidemic .

[ 110 ] Fighting Solidarity logo In 1982, during martial law in Poland , the anti-communist underground organisations Fighting Solidarity and Orange Alternative were founded in Wrocław.

Wrocław's dwarves , made of bronze, famously grew out of and commemorate Orange Alternative.

[ 111 ] In 1983 and 1997, Pope John Paul II visited the city.

[ 112 ] PTV Echo, the first non-state television station in Poland and in the post-communist countries, began to broadcast in Wrocław on 6 February 1990.

[ 113 ] In May 1997, Wrocław hosted the 46th International Eucharistic Congress .

[ 114 ] In July 1997, the city was heavily affected by the Millennium Flood , the worst flooding in post-war Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic . About one-third of the area of the city was flooded.

[ 115 ] The smaller Widawa River also flooded the city simultaneously, worsening the damage. An earlier, equally devastating flood of the Oder river had taken place in 1903.

[ 116 ] A small part of the city was also flooded during the flood of 2010 . From 2012 to 2015, the Wrocław water node was renovated and redeveloped to prevent further flooding.

[ 117 ] Municipal Stadium in Wrocław, opened in 2011, hosted three matches in Group A of the UEFA Euro 2012 championship.

[ 118 ] In 2016, Wrocław was declared the European Capital of Culture .

[ 119 ] In 2017, Wrocław hosted the 2017 World Games .

[ 120 ] Wrocław won the European Best Destination title in 2018.

[ 121 ] Wrocław is now a unique European city of mixed heritage, with architecture influenced by Polish, Bohemian , Austrian , and Prussian traditions, such as Silesian Gothic and its Baroque style of court builders of Habsburg Austria ( Fischer von Erlach ). Wrocław has a number of notable buildings by German modernist architects including the famous Centennial Hall (1911–1913) designed by Max Berg .

Geography [ edit ] Wrocław is located in the three mesoregions of the Silesian Lowlands ( Wrocław Plain , Wrocław Valley , Oleśnica Plain) at an elevation of around 105–156 metres (Gajowe Hill and Maślickie Hill) above sea level.

[ 122 ] The city lies on the Oder River and its four tributaries, which supply it within the city limits – Bystrzyca , Oława , Ślęza and Widawa .

[ 123 ] The Dobra River and many streams flow through the city. The city has a sewage treatment plant on the Janówek estate.

[ 124 ] Flora and fauna [ edit ] John of Nepomuk Church in Szczytnicki Park , 16th-century There are 44 city parks and public green spaces covering around 800 hectares. The most notable are Szczytnicki Park , Park Południowy (South Park) and Anders Park . In addition, Wrocław University runs an historical botanical garden , founded in 1811, with a salient Alpine garden, a lake and a valley.

[ 125 ] In Wrocław, the presence of over 200 species of birds has been registered, of which over 100 have nesting places there.

[ 126 ] As in other large Polish cities, the most numerous are pigeons . Other common species are the sparrow , tree sparrow , siskin , rook , hooded crow , jackdaw , magpie , swift , martin , swallow , kestrel , mute swan , mallard , coot , goosander , black-headed gull , great tit , blue tit , long-tailed tit , greenfinch , hawfinch , collared dove , wood pigeon , fieldfare , redwing , common starling , grey heron , white stork , common chaffinch , blackbird , jay , nuthatch , bullfinch , cuckoo , waxwing , lesser spotted woodpecker , great spotted woodpecker , middle spotted woodpecker , white wagtail , blackcap , black redstart , spotted flycatcher , collared flycatcher , goldfinch , marsh harrier , little bittern , common moorhen , reed bunting , penduline tit , great reed warbler , little crake , little ringed plover and white-tailed eagle .

[ 127 ] Wrocław South Park – Park Południowy The city is periodically plagued by the brown rat , especially in the Market Square and in the vicinity of eateries . Otherwise, due to the proximity of wooded areas, there are hedgehogs , foxes , wild boar , bats , martens , squirrels , roe deer , hares , beavers , polecats , otters , badgers , weasels , stoats and raccoon dogs . There are also occasional sightings of escaped muskrat , american mink and raccoon .

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] Climate [ edit ] Within the Köppen climate classification , Wrocław has an oceanic climate ( Cfb ), bordering on a humid continental climate ( Dfb ) using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm. The position of Wrocław in the Silesian Lowlands , which are located just north of the Sudetes and to the southwest of the Trzebnickie Hills , creates a favourable environment for accumulation of heat in the Oder river valley between Wrocław and Opole .

[ 129 ] Wrocław is therefore the warmest city in Poland , among those tracked by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW), with a mean annual temperature of 9.7 °C (49 °F).

[ 130 ] The city experiences relatively mild and dry winters, but with the skies frequently overcast. Summers are warm and generally sunny, however, that is the period when most precipitation occurs, which often falls during thunderstorms. The city sometimes experiences foehn -like conditions, particularly when the wind blows from the south or the south-west.

[ 129 ] The temperatures in the city centre often tend to be higher than on the outskirts due to the urban heat island effect.

[ 131 ] [ 129 ] Snow may fall in any month from October to May but normally does so in winter. The snow cover of at least 1 cm (0.39 in) stays on the ground for an average of 27.5 days per year – one of the lowest in Poland.

[ 130 ] The highest temperature in Wrocław recognised by IMGW was noted on 8 August 2015 (37.9 °C (100 °F)), [ 130 ] though thermometers at the meteorological station managed by the University of Wrocław indicated 38.9 °C (102 °F) on that day.

[ 132 ] The lowest temperature was recorded on 11 February 1956 (−32 °C (−26 °F)).
