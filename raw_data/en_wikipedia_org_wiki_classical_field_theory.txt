A **classical field theory** is a [physical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theory "Physical theory") that predicts how one or more [fields in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)") interact with matter through **field equations**, without considering [effects of quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"); theories that incorporate quantum mechanics are called [quantum field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). In most contexts, 'classical field theory' is specifically intended to describe [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") and [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation"), two of the [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force "Fundamental force") of nature.

A physical field can be thought of as the assignment of a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") at each point of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"). For example, in a weather forecast, the wind velocity during a day over a country is described by assigning a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") to each point in space. Each vector represents the direction of the movement of air at that point, so the set of all wind vectors in an area at a given point in time constitutes a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"). As the day progresses, the directions in which the vectors point change as the directions of the wind change.

The first field theories, [Newtonian gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_gravitation "Newtonian gravitation") and [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") of electromagnetic fields were developed in classical physics before the advent of [relativity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory "Relativity theory") in 1905, and had to be revised to be consistent with that theory. Consequently, classical field theories are usually categorized as _non-relativistic_ and _relativistic_. Modern field theories are usually expressed using the mathematics of [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus"). A more recent alternative mathematical formalism describes classical fields as sections of [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") called [fiber bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle").

[Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") coined the term "field" and lines of forces to explain electric and magnetic phenomena. [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin") in 1851 formalized the concept of field in different areas of physics.

Non-relativistic field theories
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Non-relativistic field theories")]

Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with [Faraday's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday")[lines of force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_of_force "Lines of force") when describing the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"). The [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") was then similarly described.

### Newtonian gravitation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Newtonian gravitation")]

The first [field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_theory_(physics) "Field theory (physics)") of gravity was [Newton's theory of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_theory_of_gravitation "Newton's theory of gravitation") in which the mutual interaction between two [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") obeys an [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law "Inverse square law"). This was very useful for predicting the motion of planets around the Sun.

Any massive body _M_ has a [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field")**g** which describes its influence on other massive bodies. The gravitational field of _M_ at a point **r** in space is found by determining the force **F** that _M_ exerts on a small [test mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_mass "Test mass")_m_ located at **r**, and then dividing by _m_:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-kleppner85-1)![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24e6e7fa277945002d4571dd95399c35756e8951) Stipulating that _m_ is much smaller than _M_ ensures that the presence of _m_ has a negligible influence on the behavior of _M_.

According to [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), **F**(**r**) is given by[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-kleppner85-1)![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d1769b7b58545469a0f3f326b100f06cd8616bd) where ![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9740464b71653e12932278ee944540be8caa5b96) is a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") pointing along the line from _M_ to _m_, and _G_ is Newton's [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"). Therefore, the gravitational field of _M_ is[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-kleppner85-1)![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}=-{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11de36a634c2d70b37666d605797ce67f56200e)

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to unprecedented levels of accuracy leads to the identification of the gravitational field strength as identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle"), which leads to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity").

For a discrete collection of masses, _M i_, located at points, **r**_i_, the gravitational field at a point **r** due to the masses is ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-G\sum _{i}{\frac {M_{i}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r_{i}} )}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{i}|^{3}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/244f85b80e4df306cc61ff754a962973794ac9a9)

If we have a continuous mass distribution _ρ_ instead, the sum is replaced by an integral, ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-G\iiint _{V}{\frac {\rho (\mathbf {x} )d^{3}\mathbf {x} (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {x} )}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {x} |^{3}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/773b28db2f28b133b92c78a5014306571b2d1850)

Note that the direction of the field points from the position **r** to the position of the masses **r**_i_; this is ensured by the minus sign. In a nutshell, this means all masses attract.

In the integral form [Gauss's law for gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity "Gauss's law for gravity") is ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \iint \mathbf {g} \cdot d\mathbf {S} =-4\pi GM}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd236713d60459dc2022de4496d032e7d13e7223) while in differential form it is ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} =-4\pi G\rho _{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a769bd5c01d9235f5c9bb67d359ad23f7f9715f)

Therefore, the gravitational field **g** can be written in terms of the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of a [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential")_φ_(**r**): ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-\nabla \phi (\mathbf {r} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e89e8aa6db939d289e1a09b8f788f087ffffaa0) This is a consequence of the gravitational force **F** being [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field").

A [charged test particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_charge "Test charge") with charge _q_ experiences a force **F** based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field")**E** generated by the source charge _Q_ so that **F** = _q_**E**: ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{q}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1f42850ffa7f5e8906f8354481f36eee1646e37)

Using this and [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") the electric field due to a single charged particle is ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Q}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08c89a2ceb36d0d67a212ceaf6f459342dc78cb4)

The electric field is [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field"), and hence is given by the gradient of a scalar potential, _V_(**r**)![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )=-\nabla V(\mathbf {r} )\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a01fbca42d4f645d89029749a15a183311591e19)

[Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law "Gauss's law") for electricity is in integral form ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \iint \mathbf {E} \cdot d\mathbf {S} ={\frac {Q}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cbf3fb5ef57f127a2042b5400644c60af467125) while in differential form ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\frac {\rho _{e}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23bc111d3284d6032f0e18a0bc9f7972ec1f30aa)

A steady current _I_ flowing along a path _ℓ_ will exert a force on nearby charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by _I_ on a nearby charge _q_ with velocity **v** is ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/983133a8249a097e794566e90ad2973af4c2803c) where **B**(**r**) is the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), which is determined from _I_ by the [Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law"): ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times d{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}{r^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10ae9c4be73523468239bb31709550e9ea6408f8)

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a [vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_vector_potential "Magnetic vector potential"), **A**(**r**): ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )=\nabla \times \mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46eb26e70ab42445c30a50fd137f507c1b8db6dd)

[Gauss's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law "Gauss's law") for magnetism in integral form is ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \iint \mathbf {B} \cdot d\mathbf {S} =0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5521dceb1c11b7111ab2f4aa6f5fa8957c1a34b) while in differential form it is ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} =0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36c015fe5fdcd43019f00487b56bdff89dd39b40)

The physical interpretation is that there are no [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole").

In general, in the presence of both a charge density _ρ_(**r**, _t_) and current density **J**(**r**, _t_), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), a set of differential equations which directly relate **E** and **B** to the electric charge density (charge per unit volume) _ρ_ and [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") (electric current per unit area) **J**.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-griffiths326-2)

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials _V_ and **A**. A set of integral equations known as _[retarded potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded\_potential "Retarded potential")_ allow one to calculate _V_ and **A** from ρ and **J**,[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-3) and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-wangsness469-4)![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =-\nabla V-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {A} }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/003a6ca1fc1b54ef001e2fa69dd4f2de95732e90)![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =\nabla \times \mathbf {A} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0ed88394f66f017dc933ce395369ba11d7acd9c)

### Continuum mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Continuum mechanics")]

Fluid dynamics has fields of pressure, density, and flow rate that are connected by conservation laws for energy and momentum. The mass continuity equation is a continuity equation, representing the conservation of mass ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2567e1f460ceb134fd751701f777e0f1931aa7a1) and the [Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations "Navier–Stokes equations") represent the conservation of momentum in the fluid, found from Newton's laws applied to the fluid, ![Image 23: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\rho \mathbf {u} )+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} +p\mathbf {I} )=\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}+\rho \mathbf {b} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b84b6d120274198a86600302f1a7e3699df4a21) if the density ρ, pressure p, [deviatoric stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviatoric_stress_tensor "Deviatoric stress tensor")**τ** of the fluid, as well as external body forces **b**, are all given. The [velocity field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_field "Velocity field")**u** is the vector field to solve for.

In 1839, [James MacCullagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacCullagh "James MacCullagh") presented field equations to describe [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") in "An essay toward a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-5)

The term "[potential theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory "Potential theory")" arises from the fact that, in 19th century physics, the fundamental forces of nature were believed to be derived from [scalar potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential "Scalar potential") which satisfied [Laplace's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation "Laplace's equation"). Poisson addressed the question of the stability of the planetary [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit"), which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation from the perturbation forces, and derived the [Poisson's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation "Poisson's equation"), named after him. The general form of this equation is

![Image 24: {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =\sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c514f043daba88b6c3af3b47454c95c5660079f3)

where _σ_ is a source function (as a density, a quantity per unit volume) and ø the scalar potential to solve for.

In Newtonian gravitation, masses are the sources of the field so that field lines terminate at objects that have mass. Similarly, charges are the sources and sinks of electrostatic fields: positive charges emanate electric field lines, and field lines terminate at negative charges. These field concepts are also illustrated in the general [divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem"), specifically Gauss's law's for gravity and electricity. For the cases of time-independent gravity and electromagnetism, the fields are gradients of corresponding potentials ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\nabla \phi _{g}\,,\quad \mathbf {E} =-\nabla \phi _{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec591e1a1004cfc87145f7a26fe8c34464b54458) so substituting these into Gauss' law for each case obtains ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi _{g}=4\pi G\rho _{g}\,,\quad \nabla ^{2}\phi _{e}=4\pi k_{e}\rho _{e}=-{\rho _{e} \over \varepsilon _{0}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f995bc441bacdfbd84498a89457d7b598c96812)

where _ρ g_ is the [mass density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_density "Mass density"), _ρ e_ the [charge density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density "Charge density"), _G_ the gravitational constant and _k e = 1/4πε 0_ the electric force constant.

Incidentally, this similarity arises from the similarity between [Newton's law of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_gravitation "Newton's law of gravitation") and [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law").

In the case where there is no source term (e.g. vacuum, or paired charges), these potentials obey [Laplace's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation "Laplace's equation"): ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d074535c8c44d55684b102793327c0d1adf4d1cb)

For a distribution of mass (or charge), the potential can be expanded in a series of [spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics "Spherical harmonics"), and the _n_ th term in the series can be viewed as a potential arising from the 2 _n_-moments (see [multipole expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_expansion "Multipole expansion")). For many purposes only the monopole, dipole, and quadrupole terms are needed in calculations.

Relativistic field theory
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Relativistic field theory")]

Modern formulations of classical field theories generally require [Lorentz covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_covariance "Lorentz covariance") as this is now recognised as a fundamental aspect of nature. A field theory tends to be expressed mathematically by using [Lagrangians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory) "Lagrangian (field theory)"). This is a function that, when subjected to an [action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principle "Action principle"), gives rise to the [field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_equations "Field equations") and a [conservation law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law_(physics) "Conservation law (physics)") for the theory. The [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") is a Lorentz scalar, from which the field equations and symmetries can be readily derived.

Throughout we use units such that the speed of light in vacuum is 1, i.e. _c_ = 1.[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-6)

### Lagrangian dynamics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Lagrangian dynamics")]

Given a field tensor ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4), a scalar called the [Lagrangian density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_density "Lagrangian density")![Image 29: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\phi ,\partial \phi ,\partial \partial \phi ,\ldots ,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/37327f8678bba2b138a2345f44bcf0408bdb788c) can be constructed from ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) and its derivatives. From this density, the action functional can be constructed by integrating over spacetime, ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}=\int {{\mathcal {L}}{\sqrt {-g}}\,\mathrm {d} ^{4}x}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f9f06f34b2faf96372af85a0cbc9c9738cc753c)

Where ![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}\,\mathrm {d} ^{4}x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98095c2a19bd4d67d0f8e4b19441447fd2b3ea1c) is the volume form in curved spacetime. ![Image 33: {\displaystyle (g\equiv \det(g_{\mu \nu }))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef9be9e854cb68d77a176666001adfe52c8f1471)

Therefore, the Lagrangian itself is equal to the integral of the Lagrangian density over all space.

Then by enforcing the [action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)"), the Euler–Lagrange equations are obtained

![Image 34: {\displaystyle {\frac {\delta {\mathcal {S}}}{\delta \phi }}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial \phi }}-\partial _{\mu }\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial (\partial _{\mu }\phi )}}\right)+\cdots +(-1)^{m}\partial _{\mu _{1}}\partial _{\mu _{2}}\cdots \partial _{\mu _{m-1}}\partial _{\mu _{m}}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial (\partial _{\mu _{1}}\partial _{\mu _{2}}\cdots \partial _{\mu _{m-1}}\partial _{\mu _{m}}\phi )}}\right)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db84fc8c65f6e393df240900f95ed10e26f0e77e)

Relativistic fields
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Relativistic fields")]

Two of the most well-known Lorentz-covariant classical field theories are now described.

Historically, the first (classical) field theories were those describing the electric and magnetic fields (separately). After numerous experiments, it was found that these two fields were related, or, in fact, two aspects of the same field: the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"). [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell")'s theory of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") describes the interaction of charged matter with the electromagnetic field. The first formulation of this field theory used vector fields to describe the [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric "Electric") and [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic "Magnetic") fields. With the advent of special relativity, a more complete formulation using [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") fields was found. Instead of using two vector fields describing the electric and magnetic fields, a tensor field representing these two fields together is used.

The [electromagnetic four-potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_four-potential "Electromagnetic four-potential") is defined to be _A a_ = (−_φ_, **A**), and the [electromagnetic four-current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-current "Four-current")_j a_ = (−_ρ_, **j**). The electromagnetic field at any point in spacetime is described by the antisymmetric (0,2)-rank [electromagnetic field tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field_tensor "Electromagnetic field tensor")![Image 35: {\displaystyle F_{ab}=\partial _{a}A_{b}-\partial _{b}A_{a}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c865bccab5b4f6ce46d9b6395b3613a3c0d66374)

To obtain the dynamics for this field, we try and construct a scalar from the field. In the vacuum, we have ![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-{\frac {1}{4\mu _{0}}}F^{ab}F_{ab}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1756925aa0930acf14768ba7bf2c8f9c16ff6876)

We can use [gauge field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_field_theory "Gauge field theory") to get the interaction term, and this gives us ![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-{\frac {1}{4\mu _{0}}}F^{ab}F_{ab}-j^{a}A_{a}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2042fe50494bf97184040ca8ec6507036062dd2)

To obtain the field equations, the electromagnetic tensor in the Lagrangian density needs to be replaced by its definition in terms of the 4-potential _A_, and it's this potential which enters the Euler-Lagrange equations. The EM field _F_ is not varied in the EL equations. Therefore, ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \partial _{b}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial \left(\partial _{b}A_{a}\right)}}\right)={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial A_{a}}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f279c304440f4d1e7b029825afe28597d0aca88)

Evaluating the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the field components ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial A_{a}}}=\mu _{0}j^{a}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/234d6d7c3fd16874c7112d4d79cb5066bc53a056) and the derivatives of the field components ![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial (\partial _{b}A_{a})}}=F^{ab}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47c4c01691b583e70df0ad4ea4814fa4e8ef6b6e) obtains [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") in vacuum. The source equations (Gauss' law for electricity and the Maxwell-Ampère law) are ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \partial _{b}F^{ab}=\mu _{0}j^{a}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16a15c38b181e0ccad8a060017e5a76fbbe2d7a4) while the other two (Gauss' law for magnetism and Faraday's law) are obtained from the fact that _F_ is the 4-curl of _A_, or, in other words, from the fact that the [Bianchi identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianchi_identity "Bianchi identity") holds for the electromagnetic field tensor.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-7)![Image 42: {\displaystyle 6F_{[ab,c]}\,=F_{ab,c}+F_{ca,b}+F_{bc,a}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d5778db2a71d5859ac8ad6ff48f47064f01da07a)

where the comma indicates a [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative").

After Newtonian gravitation was found to be inconsistent with [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") formulated a new theory of gravitation called [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). This treats [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") as a geometric phenomenon ('curved [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime")') caused by masses and represents the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") mathematically by a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field") called the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)"). The [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations") describe how this curvature is produced. [Newtonian gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_gravitation "Newtonian gravitation") is now superseded by Einstein's theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), in which [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") is thought of as being due to a curved [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), caused by masses. The Einstein field equations, ![Image 43: {\displaystyle G_{ab}=\kappa T_{ab}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bb9cbd1c44a410823f4d58582564a3863170254) describe how this curvature is produced by matter and radiation, where _G ab_ is the [Einstein tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_tensor "Einstein tensor"), ![Image 44: {\displaystyle G_{ab}\,=R_{ab}-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{ab}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2914642dce811bef958c7ae377160f266c816a9f) written in terms of the [Ricci tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_tensor "Ricci tensor")_R ab_ and [Ricci scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_scalar "Ricci scalar")_R_ = _R ab g ab_, _T ab_ is the [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor") and _κ_ = 8 _πG_/_c_ 4 is a constant. In the absence of matter and radiation (including sources) the '[vacuum field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_field_equations "Vacuum field equations")_,_![Image 45: {\displaystyle G_{ab}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bdaeeb7265c58b8ca1284f506967acecf4fea4d) can be derived by varying the [Einstein–Hilbert action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action "Einstein–Hilbert action"), ![Image 46: {\displaystyle S=\int R{\sqrt {-g}}\,d^{4}x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47db18364cfdc06ad56854ab38d2924c85b07886) with respect to the metric, where _g_ is the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)")_g ab_. Solutions of the vacuum field equations are called [vacuum solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_solution "Vacuum solution"). An alternative interpretation, due to [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington"), is that ![Image 47: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33) is fundamental, ![Image 48: {\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) is merely one aspect of ![Image 49: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33), and ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \kappa }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54ddec2e922c5caea4e47d04feef86e782dc8e6d) is forced by the choice of units.

Unification attempts
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_field_theory&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Unification attempts")]

Attempts to create a unified field theory based on [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") are classical unified field theories. During the years between the two World Wars, the idea of unification of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") with [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") was actively pursued by several mathematicians and physicists like [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), [Theodor Kaluza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Kaluza "Theodor Kaluza"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-kal-8)[Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-9)[Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-10)[Gustav Mie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mie "Gustav Mie")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-11) and Ernst Reichenbacher.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-12)

Early attempts to create such theory were based on incorporation of [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_fields "Electromagnetic fields") into the geometry of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). In 1918, the case for the first geometrization of the electromagnetic field was proposed in 1918 by Hermann Weyl.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) In 1919, the idea of a five-dimensional approach was suggested by [Theodor Kaluza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Kaluza "Theodor Kaluza").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) From that, a theory called [Kaluza-Klein Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_Theory "Kaluza-Klein Theory") was developed. It attempts to unify [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") and [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), in a five-dimensional [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time"). There are several ways of extending the representational framework for a unified field theory which have been considered by Einstein and other researchers. These extensions in general are based in two options.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) The first option is based in relaxing the conditions imposed on the original formulation, and the second is based in introducing other mathematical objects into the theory.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) An example of the first option is relaxing the restrictions to four-dimensional space-time by considering higher-dimensional representations.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) That is used in [Kaluza-Klein Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_Theory "Kaluza-Klein Theory"). For the second, the most prominent example arises from the concept of the [affine connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection "Affine connection") that was introduced into [the theory of general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") mainly through the work of [Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita") and [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13)

Further development of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") changed the focus of searching for unified field theory from classical to quantum description. Because of that, many theoretical physicists gave up looking for a classical unified field theory.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-Tilman-13) Quantum field theory would include unification of two other [fundamental forces of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions "Fundamental interactions"), the [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_force "Strong nuclear force") and [weak nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force "Weak nuclear force") which act on the subatomic level.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_note-15)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_ref-3)**This is contingent on the correct choice of [gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing "Gauge fixing"). _φ_ and **A** are not uniquely determined by _ρ_ and **J**; rather, they are only determined up to some scalar function _f_(**r**, _t_) known as the gauge. The retarded potential formalism requires one to choose the [Lorenz gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge "Lorenz gauge").
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory#cite_ref-6)**This is equivalent to choosing units of distance and time as light-seconds and seconds or light-years and years. Choosing _c_ = 1 allows us to simplify the equations. For instance, _E_ = _mc_ 2 reduces to _E_ = _m_ (since _c_ 2 = 1, without keeping track of units). This reduces complexity of the expressions while keeping focus on the underlying principles. This "trick" must be taken into account when performing actual numerical calculations.
