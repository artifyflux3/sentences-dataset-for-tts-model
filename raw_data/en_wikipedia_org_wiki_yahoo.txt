in its logo ) [ 4 ] is an American web portal that provides the search engine Yahoo Search and related services including My Yahoo , Yahoo Mail , Yahoo News , Yahoo Finance , Yahoo Sports , y!entertainment, yahoo!life, [ 5 ] and its advertising platform, Yahoo Native . It is operated by the namesake company Yahoo! Inc.

, which is 90% owned by Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon .

Yahoo was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s.

[ 6 ] However, its use declined in the 2010s as some of its services were discontinued, and it lost market share to Facebook and Google .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Etymology The word "yahoo" is a backronym for " Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle" [ 9 ] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".

[ 10 ] The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.

[ 11 ] However, founders Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth." [ 12 ] This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels .

History Main articles: History of Yahoo and Yahoo! Inc. (1995–2017) For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Yahoo .

Founding Jerry Yang and David Filo , the founders of Yahoo The Yahoo home page in 1994, when it was a directory. A search engine was added in 1995.

In January 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University , when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The site was a human-edited web directory , organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!" and became known as the Yahoo Directory .

[ 14 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The "yahoo.com" domain was registered on January 18, 1995.

[ 21 ] Yahoo was incorporated on March 2, 1995. In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo Directory.

[ 26 ] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users, [ 27 ] and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine, [ 19 ] receiving 95 million page views per day, triple that of rival Excite.

[ 25 ] It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Yahoo began offering free e-mail from October 1997 after the acquisition of RocketMail , which was then renamed to Yahoo Mail.

[ 32 ] Yahoo began using Google for search in June 2000.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004 partly using technology from its $280 million acquisition of Inktomi in 2002.
