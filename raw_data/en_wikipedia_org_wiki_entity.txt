Find sources: "Entity" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( July 2024 ) An entity is something that exists as itself. It does not need to be of material existence. In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is animate , or present . The verb tense of this form is to 'entitize' - meaning to convert into an entity; to perceive as tangible or alive.

[ 1 ] The term is broad in scope and may refer to animals; natural features such as mountains; inanimate objects such as tables; numbers or sets as symbols written on a paper; human contrivances such as laws, corporations and academic disciplines; or supernatural beings such as gods and spirits.

The adjectival form is entitative .

Etymology [ edit ] The word entity is derived from the Latin entitas , which in turn derives from the Latin ens meaning "being" or "existing" (compare English essence ).

Entity may hence literally be taken to mean "thing which exists".

In philosophy [ edit ] Main article: Ontology Ontology is the study of concepts of existence, and of recognition of entities. The words ontic and entity are derived respectively from the ancient Greek and Latin present participles that mean " being ".

In an ontic inquiry... one asks about the properties or the physical relations and structures peculiar to some entity – in the pen's case, for example, we might make the following ontic observations about it: it is black, full of blue ink, and sitting on top of my desk.

[ 2 ] In law, politics, economics, accounting [ edit ] Main articles: Legal person and Polity In law , a legal entity is an entity that is capable of bearing legal rights and obligations , such as a natural person or an artificial person (e.g. business entity or a corporate entity).

In politics , entity is used as term for territorial divisions of some countries (e.g.

Bosnia and Herzegovina ).

In economics , economic entity is one of the assumptions made in generally accepted accounting principles . Almost any type of organization or unit in society can be an economic entity.

In accounting , the entity concept is the concept that a business or an organization and its owners are treated as two separate parties.

In medicine [ edit ] Main article: Medicine In medicine, a disease entity is an illness due to a particular definite cause or to a specific pathological process. While a disease entity is not defined by a syndrome , it may or may not be manifest in one or more particular syndromes.

In computer science [ edit ] Further information: Entity–relationship model and Entity–control–boundary In computer science , an entity is an object that has an identity , which is independent of the changes of its attributes .  It represents long-lived information relevant for the users and is usually stored in a database .
