Vacuum pump and [bell jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_jar "Bell jar") for vacuum experiments, used in science education during the early 20th century, on display in the Schulhistorische Sammlung ('School Historical Museum'), [Bremerhaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremerhaven "Bremerhaven"), Germany

A **vacuum** (pl.: **vacuums** or **vacua**) is [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") devoid of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). The word is derived from the Latin adjective _vacuus_ (neuter _vacuum_) meaning "vacant" or "void". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") much less than [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-chambers-1) Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a _perfect_ vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or **free space**, and use the term **partial vacuum** to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a [laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory "Laboratory") or in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is considerably lower than atmospheric pressure.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-2) The Latin term _**in vacuo**_ is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum.

The _quality_ of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical [vacuum cleaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner "Vacuum cleaner") produces enough [suction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction "Suction") to reduce air pressure by around 20%.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-3) But higher-quality vacuums are possible. [Ultra-high vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high_vacuum "Ultra-high vacuum") chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm 3.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Gabrielse-4)[Outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average in intergalactic space.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-tadokoro-5)

Vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. [Clemens Timpler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemens_Timpler "Clemens Timpler") (1605) philosophized about the experimental possibility of producing a vacuum in small tubes.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-6)[Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli") produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. A Torricellian vacuum is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury (see below).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-7)

Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of [incandescent light bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb") and [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"), and a wide array of vacuum technologies has since become available. The development of [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.

The word _vacuum_ comes from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")'an empty space, void', noun use of neuter of _vacuus_, meaning "empty", related to _vacare_, meaning "to be empty".

_Vacuum_ is one of the few words in the English language that contains two consecutive instances of the vowel _[u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U "U")_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-double_u-8)

Historical understanding
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Historical understanding")]

Historically, there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist. Ancient [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy") debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism"), which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius") argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-genz-9)

Following [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), however, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void. In his _[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics\_(Aristotle) "Physics (Aristotle)")_, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue _ad infinitum_, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular.

In the medieval [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world"), the physicist and Islamic scholar [Al-Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi "Al-Farabi") wrote a treatise rejecting the existence of the vacuum in the 10th century.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-10) He concluded that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and therefore the concept of a perfect vacuum was incoherent.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-11) According to [Ahmad Dallal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Dallal "Ahmad Dallal"), [Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Rayh%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB "Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī") states that "there is no observable evidence that rules out the possibility of vacuum".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Dallal-12) The [suction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction "Suction")[pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump "Pump") was described by Arab engineer [Al-Jazari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jazari "Al-Jazari") in the 13th century, and later appeared in Europe from the 15th century.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Hill2-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-14)

European [scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") such as [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"), [Blasius of Parma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasius_of_Parma "Blasius of Parma") and [Walter Burley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Burley "Walter Burley") in the 13th and 14th century focused considerable attention on issues concerning the concept of a vacuum. The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called _[horror vacui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror\_vacui\_(physics) "Horror vacui (physics)")_. There was even speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted and the 1277 [Paris condemnations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_condemnations "Paris condemnations") of [Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop "Bishop")[Étienne Tempier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Tempier "Étienne Tempier"), which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Barrow-15) From the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective, scholars widely acknowledged that a [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural") void exists beyond the confines of the cosmos itself by the 17th century. This idea, influenced by [Stoic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_physics "Stoic physics"), helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Barrow2002-16)

Almost two thousand years after Plato, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism, without the problematic nothing–everything [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy "Dichotomy") of void and atom. Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position, that a vacuum does not occur in nature, the success of his [namesake coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") and more implicitly, the spatial–corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume. By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli")'s [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)")[barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer") produced one of the first sustained vacuums in a laboratory.

Medieval [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") into the idea of a vacuum considered whether a vacuum was present, if only for an instant, between two flat plates when they were rapidly separated.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-grant-17) There was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated, or, as [Walter Burley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Burley "Walter Burley") postulated, whether a 'celestial agent' prevented the vacuum arising. [Jean Buridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan "Jean Buridan") reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open [bellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellows "Bellows") when the port was sealed.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-genz-9)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Crookes_tube_two_views.jpg/250px-Crookes_tube_two_views.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crookes_tube_two_views.jpg)

The [Crookes tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_tube "Crookes tube"), used to discover and study [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray "Cathode ray"), was an evolution of the [Geissler tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geissler_tube "Geissler tube").

The 17th century saw the first attempts to quantify measurements of partial vacuum.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-18)[Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli")'s [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)")[barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer") of 1643 and [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal")'s experiments both demonstrated a partial vacuum.

In 1654, [Otto von Guericke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Guericke "Otto von Guericke") invented the first [vacuum pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump "Vacuum pump")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-19) and conducted his famous [Magdeburg hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg_hemispheres "Magdeburg hemispheres") experiment, showing that, owing to atmospheric pressure outside the hemispheres, teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated. [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") improved Guericke's design and with the help of [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke "Robert Hooke") further developed vacuum pump technology. Thereafter, research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when [August Toepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Toepler "August Toepler") invented the [Toepler pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toepler_pump "Toepler pump") and in 1855 when [Heinrich Geissler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Geissler "Heinrich Geissler") invented the mercury displacement pump, achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 Pa (0.1[Torr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr "Torr")). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, which renewed interest in further research.

While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)"). Borrowing somewhat from the [pneuma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneuma "Pneuma") of [Stoic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_physics "Stoic physics"), aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see [Aether (mythology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(mythology) "Aether (mythology)")). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s explanations of both [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") and of radiant heat.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-20) 19th century experiments into this [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether") attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer")[Henry Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Pickering "William Henry Pickering") commented: "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-21) Thereafter, however, luminiferous aether was discarded.

Later, in 1930, [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the [Dirac sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_sea "Dirac sea"). This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"), and successfully predicted the existence of the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron"), confirmed two years later. [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg")'s [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), formulated in 1927, predicted a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), or energy and time can be measured. This far reaching consequences also threatened whether the "emptiness" of space between particles exists.

Classical field theories
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Classical field theories")]

The strictest criterion to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor") are zero. This means that this region is devoid of energy and momentum, and by consequence, it must be empty of particles and other physical fields (such as electromagnetism) that contain energy and momentum.

In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), a vanishing stress–energy tensor implies, through [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations"), the vanishing of all the components of the [Ricci tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_tensor "Ricci tensor"). Vacuum does not mean that the curvature of [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time") is necessarily flat: the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave") (technically, these phenomena are the components of the [Weyl tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_tensor "Weyl tensor")). The [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") (with zero electric charge) is an elegant example of a region completely "filled" with vacuum, but still showing a strong curvature.

In [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"), the **vacuum of free space**, or sometimes just _free space_ or _perfect vacuum_, is a standard reference medium for electromagnetic effects.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-weig-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-23) Some authors refer to this reference medium as _classical vacuum_,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-weig-22) a terminology intended to separate this concept from [QED vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_vacuum "QED vacuum") or [QCD vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCD_vacuum "QCD vacuum"), where [vacuum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuation "Vacuum fluctuation") can produce transient [virtual particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle "Virtual particle") densities and a [relative permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity "Relative permittivity") and [relative permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)#Relative_permeability_and_magnetic_susceptibility "Permeability (electromagnetism)") that are not identically unity.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Grynberg-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Susskind-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Holstein-26)

In the theory of classical electromagnetism, free space has the following properties:

*   Electromagnetic radiation travels, when unobstructed, at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), the defined value 299,792,458 m/s in [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_units "SI units").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-NISTc-27)
*   The [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle") is always exactly true.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-28) For example, the electric potential generated by two charges is the simple addition of the potentials generated by each charge in isolation. The value of the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") at any point around these two charges is found by calculating the [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") sum of the two electric fields from each of the charges acting alone.
*   The [permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity "Permittivity") and [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism) "Permeability (electromagnetism)") are exactly the electric constant [_ε_ 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-NISTep0-29) and magnetic constant [_μ_ 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability "Vacuum permeability"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-NISTmu0-30) respectively (in [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_units "SI units")), or exactly 1 (in [Gaussian units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_units "Gaussian units")).
*   The [characteristic impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance "Characteristic impedance") (η) equals the [impedance of free space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space "Impedance of free space")_Z_ 0 ≈ 376.73 Ω.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-NISTz-31)

The vacuum of classical electromagnetism can be viewed as an idealized electromagnetic medium with the [constitutive relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation#Electromagnetism "Constitutive equation") in SI units:[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-E_Wolf-32)

A video of an experiment showing [vacuum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations "Vacuum fluctuations") (in the red ring) amplified by [spontaneous parametric down-conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion "Spontaneous parametric down-conversion").

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") of the [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space")). In [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") this vacuum is referred to as '[QED vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_vacuum "QED vacuum")' to distinguish it from the vacuum of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics"), denoted as [QCD vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCD_vacuum "QCD vacuum"). QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and no [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"). As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the [blackbody photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation").) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.

QED vacuum has interesting and complex properties. In QED vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values, but their variances are not zero.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Craig-33) As a result, QED vacuum contains [vacuum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations "Vacuum fluctuations") ([virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particles "Virtual particles") that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called [vacuum energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy "Vacuum energy"). Vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory. Some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include [spontaneous emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission") and the [Lamb shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift "Lamb shift").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Barrow-15)[Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") and the [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") in vacuum near an electric charge are modified.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Zeidler-34)

Theoretically, in QCD multiple vacuum states can coexist.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Altarelli-35) The starting and ending of [cosmological inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology) "Inflation (cosmology)") is thought to have arisen from transitions between different vacuum states. For theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory, each [stationary point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point "Stationary point") of the energy in the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") gives rise to a single vacuum. [String theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") is believed to have a huge number of vacua – the so-called [string theory landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape "String theory landscape").

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_LanguageSwitch.svg/500px-Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_LanguageSwitch.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere_LanguageSwitch.svg&lang=en)

Structure of the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") - is not a perfect vacuum, but a tenuous [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") awash with charged particles, free elements such as [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field").

[Outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") has very low density and pressure, and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is truly perfect, not even in interstellar space, where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-tadokoro-5)

Stars, planets, and moons keep their [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about 32 millipascals (4.6×10−6 psi) at 100 kilometres (62 mi) of altitude,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-squire2000-36) the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line"), which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space. Beyond this line, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure") from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and the [dynamic pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pressure "Dynamic pressure") of the [solar winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"), so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret. The [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere") in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"). Astrophysicists prefer to use [number density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_density "Number density") to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.

But although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)") on [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"). Most artificial satellites operate in this region called [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") and must fire their engines every couple of weeks or a few times a year (depending on solar activity).[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-37) The drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on [solar sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail "Solar sail"), a proposed propulsion system for [interplanetary travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_travel "Interplanetary travel").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-38)

All of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe") is filled with large numbers of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), the so-called [cosmic background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation "Cosmic background radiation"), and quite likely a correspondingly large number of [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"). The current [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") of this radiation is about 3[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (−270.15[°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius"); −454.27[°F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit "Fahrenheit")).

The quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its [absolute pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pressure "Absolute pressure"), but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path "Mean free path") (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics") do not apply. This vacuum state is called _high vacuum_, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70[nm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometer "Nanometer"), but at 100[mPa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millipascal "Millipascal") (≈10−3[Torr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr "Torr")) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"). The [Crookes radiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer "Crookes radiometer") turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.

Vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it. These ranges were defined in ISO 3529-1:2019 as shown in the following table (100 Pa corresponds to 0.75 Torr; Torr is a non-SI unit):

| Pressure range | Definition | The reasoning for the definition of the ranges is as follows (typical circumstances): |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prevailing atmospheric pressure (31 kPa to 110 kPa) to 100 Pa | low (rough) vacuum | Pressure can be achieved by simple materials (e.g. regular steel) and positive displacement vacuum pumps; viscous flow regime for gases |
| <100 Pa to 0.1 Pa | medium (fine) vacuum | Pressure can be achieved by elaborate materials (e.g. stainless steel) and positive displacement vacuum pumps; transitional flow regime for gases |
| <0.1 Pa to 1×10−6 Pa | high vacuum (HV) | Pressure can be achieved by elaborate materials (e.g. stainless steel), elastomer sealings and high vacuum pumps; molecular flow regime for gases |
| <1×10−6 Pa to 1×10−9 Pa | ultra-high vacuum (UHV) | Pressure can be achieved by elaborate materials (e.g. low-carbon stainless steel), metal sealings, special surface preparations and cleaning, bake-out and high vacuum pumps; molecular flow regime for gases |
| below 1×10−9 Pa | extreme-high vacuum (XHV) | Pressure can be achieved by sophisticated materials (e.g. vacuum fired low-carbon stainless steel, aluminium, copper-beryllium, titanium), metal sealings, special surface preparations and cleaning, bake-out and additional getter pumps; molecular flow regime for gases |

*   **Atmospheric pressure** is variable but 101.325 and 100 kilopascals (1013.25 and 1000.00 mbar) are common [standard or reference pressures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure "Standard temperature and pressure").
*   **Deep space** is generally much more empty than any artificial vacuum. It may or may not meet the definition of high vacuum above, depending on what region of space and astronomical bodies are being considered. For example, the MFP of interplanetary space is smaller than the size of the Solar System, but larger than small planets and moons. As a result, solar winds exhibit continuum flow on the scale of the Solar System, but must be considered a bombardment of particles with respect to the Earth and Moon.
*   **Perfect vacuum** is an ideal state of no particles at all. It cannot be achieved in a [laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory "Laboratory"), although there may be small volumes which, for a brief moment, happen to have no particles of matter in them. Even if all particles of matter were removed, there would still be [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), as well as [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), [virtual particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle "Virtual particle"), and other aspects of the [quantum vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum "Quantum vacuum").

### Relative versus absolute measurement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Relative versus absolute measurement")]

Vacuum is measured in units of [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), typically as a subtraction relative to ambient atmospheric pressure on Earth. But the amount of relative measurable vacuum varies with local conditions. On the surface of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), where ground-level atmospheric pressure is much higher than on Earth, much higher relative vacuum readings would be possible. On the surface of the Moon with almost no atmosphere, it would be extremely difficult to create a measurable vacuum relative to the local environment.

Similarly, much higher than normal relative vacuum readings are possible deep in the Earth's ocean. A [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine "Submarine") maintaining an internal pressure of 1 atmosphere submerged to a depth of 10 atmospheres (98 metres; a 9.8-metre column of seawater has the equivalent weight of 1 atm) is effectively a vacuum chamber keeping out the crushing exterior water pressures, though the 1 atm inside the submarine would not normally be considered a vacuum.

Therefore, to properly understand the following discussions of vacuum measurement, it is important that the reader assumes the relative measurements are being done on Earth at sea level, at exactly 1 atmosphere of ambient atmospheric pressure.

### Measurements relative to 1 atm

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Measurements relative to 1 atm")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/McLeod_gauge_01.jpg/250px-McLeod_gauge_01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:McLeod_gauge_01.jpg)

A glass McLeod gauge, drained of mercury

The [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") unit of pressure is the [pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (symbol Pa), but vacuum is often measured in [torrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr "Torr"), named for an Italian physicist Torricelli (1608–1647). A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury ([mmHg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg "MmHg")) in a [manometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometer "Manometer") with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the [barometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer") scale or as a percentage of [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure") in [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit) "Bar (unit)") or [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit) "Atmosphere (unit)"). Low vacuum is often measured in [millimeters of mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeters_of_mercury "Millimeters of mercury") (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. "Below atmospheric" means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure.

In other words, most low vacuum gauges that read, for example 50.79 Torr. Many inexpensive low vacuum gauges have a margin of error and may report a vacuum of 0 Torr but in practice this generally requires a two-stage rotary vane or other medium type of vacuum pump to go much beyond (lower than) 1 torr.

### Measuring instruments

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Measuring instruments")]

Many devices are used to measure the pressure in a vacuum, depending on what range of vacuum is needed.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-39)

**Hydrostatic** gauges (such as the mercury column [manometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometer "Manometer")) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element) "Mercury (element)") is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the [McLeod gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod_gauge "McLeod gauge") which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-measure-40)

The kenotometer is a particular type of hydrostatic gauge, typically used in power plants using steam turbines. The kenotometer measures the vacuum in the steam space of the condenser, that is, the exhaust of the last stage of the turbine.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-41)

**Mechanical** or **elastic** gauges depend on a Bourdon tube, diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the **capacitance manometer**, in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 10 3 torr to 10−4 torr, and beyond.

**Thermal conductivity** gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple#Thermocouple_as_vacuum_gauge "Thermocouple") or [Resistance Temperature Detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_Temperature_Detector "Resistance Temperature Detector") (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [Pirani gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirani_gauge "Pirani gauge") which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10−3 torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.

**[Ionization gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_gauge "Ionization gauge")** are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the [hot cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_filament_ionization_gauge "Hot filament ionization gauge") version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind [cold cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_cathode "Cold cathode") version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-42)

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Gluehlampe_01_KMJ.jpg/250px-Gluehlampe_01_KMJ.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gluehlampe_01_KMJ.jpg)

[Light bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb") contain a partial vacuum, usually backfilled with [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), which protects the [tungsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten "Tungsten") filament

Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices. Its first widespread use was in the [incandescent light bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb "Incandescent light bulb") to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for [electron beam welding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_beam_welding "Electron beam welding"), [cold welding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_welding "Cold welding"), [vacuum packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_packing "Vacuum packing") and [vacuum frying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fryer "Vacuum fryer"). [Ultra-high vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high_vacuum "Ultra-high vacuum") is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind [chemical vapor deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_vapor_deposition "Chemical vapor deposition"), [physical vapor deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_vapor_deposition "Physical vapor deposition"), and [dry etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_etching "Dry etching") which are essential to the fabrication of [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication "Semiconductor fabrication") and [optical coatings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coating "Optical coating"), and to [surface science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_science "Surface science"). The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of [thermos bottles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermos_bottle "Thermos bottle"). Deep vacuum lowers the [boiling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point "Boiling point") of liquids and promotes low temperature [outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "Outgassing") which is used in [freeze drying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_drying "Freeze drying"), [adhesive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive "Adhesive") preparation, [distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_distillation "Vacuum distillation"), [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make [electron microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope "Electron microscope") and [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") possible, including [cathode-ray tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube "Cathode-ray tube"). [Vacuum interrupters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_interrupter "Vacuum interrupter") are used in electrical switchgear. [Vacuum arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_arc "Vacuum arc") processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials. The elimination of air [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction") is useful for [flywheel energy storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage "Flywheel energy storage") and [ultracentrifuges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracentrifuge "Ultracentrifuge").

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/L-Pumpe2.png/190px-L-Pumpe2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:L-Pumpe2.png)

This shallow water well pump reduces atmospheric air pressure inside the pump chamber. Atmospheric pressure extends down into the well, and forces water up the pipe into the pump to balance the reduced pressure. Above-ground pump chambers are only effective to a depth of approximately 9 meters due to the water column weight balancing the atmospheric pressure.

### Vacuum-driven machines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Vacuum-driven machines")]

Vacuums are commonly used to produce [suction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction "Suction"), which has an even wider variety of applications. The [Newcomen steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine "Newcomen steam engine") used vacuum instead of pressure to drive a piston. In the 19th century, vacuum was used for traction on [Isambard Kingdom Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel "Isambard Kingdom Brunel")'s experimental [atmospheric railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_railway "Atmospheric railway"). [Vacuum brakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_brake "Vacuum brake") were once widely used on [trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train "Train") in the UK but, except on [heritage railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_railway "Heritage railway"), they have been replaced by [air brakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_air_brake "Railway air brake").

[Manifold vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_vacuum "Manifold vacuum") can be used to drive [accessories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_ancillary_power#Vacuum "Automobile ancillary power") on [automobiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile "Automobile"). The best known application is the [vacuum servo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_servo "Vacuum servo"), used to provide power assistance for the [brakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake "Brake"). Obsolete applications include vacuum-driven [windscreen wipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscreen_wipers "Windscreen wipers") and [Autovac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autovac "Autovac") fuel pumps. Some aircraft instruments ([Attitude Indicator (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator "Attitude indicator") and the [Heading Indicator (HI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_indicator "Heading indicator")) are typically vacuum-powered, as protection against loss of all (electrically powered) instruments, since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems, and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft, the engine and an external venturi. [Vacuum induction melting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_induction_melting "Vacuum induction melting") uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum.

Maintaining a vacuum in the [condenser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condenser_(steam_turbine) "Condenser (steam turbine)") is an important aspect of the efficient operation of [steam turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine "Steam turbine"). A steam jet [ejector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_ejector "Steam ejector") or [liquid ring vacuum pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_ring_pump "Liquid ring pump") is used for this purpose. The typical vacuum maintained in the condenser steam space at the exhaust of the turbine (also called condenser backpressure) is in the range 5 to 15 kPa (absolute), depending on the type of condenser and the ambient conditions.

[Evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation") and [sublimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry) "Sublimation (chemistry)") into a vacuum is called [outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "Outgassing"). All materials, solid or liquid, have a small [vapour pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure "Vapour pressure"), and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. Outgassing has the same effect as a leak and will limit the achievable vacuum. Outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces, which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials. This is of great concern to space missions, where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission.

The most prevalent outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It can be reduced by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of [rotary vane pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_vane_pump "Rotary vane pump") and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.

Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials and boil them off. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by [liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen "Liquid nitrogen") to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously [cryopump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopump "Cryopump") the system.

### Pumping and ambient air pressure

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vacuum&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Pumping and ambient air pressure")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Hand_pump.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_pump.png)

Deep wells have the pump chamber down in the well close to the water surface, or in the water. A "sucker rod" extends from the handle down the center of the pipe deep into the well to operate the plunger. The pump handle acts as a heavy counterweight against both the sucker rod weight and the weight of the water column standing on the upper plunger up to ground level.

Fluids cannot generally be pulled, so a vacuum cannot be created by [suction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction "Suction"). Suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the [diaphragm muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_(anatomy) "Diaphragm (anatomy)") expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure.

To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind [positive displacement pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump#Positive_displacement_pump "Vacuum pump"), like the manual water pump for example. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Cut_through_turbomolecular_pump.jpg/250px-Cut_through_turbomolecular_pump.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cut_through_turbomolecular_pump.jpg)

A cutaway view of a [turbomolecular pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbomolecular_pump "Turbomolecular pump"), a momentum transfer pump used to achieve high vacuum

The above explanation is merely a simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of the entire range of pumps in use. Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. [Momentum transfer pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump#Momentum_transfer_pump "Vacuum pump"), which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps. [Entrapment pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump#Entrapment_pump "Vacuum pump") can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen"), [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), and [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon "Neon").

The lowest pressure that can be attained in a system is also dependent on many things other than the nature of the pumps. Multiple pumps may be connected in series, called stages, to achieve higher vacuums. The choice of seals, chamber geometry, materials, and pump-down procedures will all have an impact. Collectively, these are called _vacuum technique_. And sometimes, the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic. Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates.

In [ultra high vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_vacuum "Ultra high vacuum") systems, some very "odd" leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") and [palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium "Palladium") becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or [titanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium "Titanium") must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.

The lowest pressures currently achievable in laboratory are about 1×10−13 torrs (13 pPa).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-43) However, pressures as low as 5×10−17 torrs (6.7 fPa) have been indirectly measured in a 4 K (−269.15°C; −452.47°F) cryogenic vacuum system.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Gabrielse-4) This corresponds to ≈100 particles/cm 3.

Humans and animals exposed to vacuum will lose [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") after a few seconds and die of [hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical) "Hypoxia (medical)") within minutes, but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture. The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Landis_Vacuum_Exposure-44) Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as [ebullism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism "Ebullism"), is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-NASA_Bio_Data_Book-45) Swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a [flight suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_suit "Flight suit"). [Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program") astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS) which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa (15 Torr).[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Webb_Space_Activity_Suit-46) Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard.

Animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds, while longer full-body exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Cooke_Cardiovascular_Responses-47) A study by NASA on eight chimpanzees found all of them survived two and a half minute exposures to vacuum.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-48) There is only a limited amount of data available from human accidents, but it is consistent with animal data. Limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-harding-49)[Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") was the first to show in 1660 that vacuum is lethal to small animals.

An experiment indicates that plants are able to survive in a low pressure environment (1.5 kPa) for about 30 minutes.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-51)

Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-harding-49) Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent [altitude sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness "Altitude sickness") in humans that did not undergo prior [acclimatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization "Acclimatization"), and [spacesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesuit "Spacesuit") are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-harding-49) Most spacesuits use only 20 kPa (150 Torr) of pure oxygen. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but [decompression sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness "Decompression sickness") and [gas embolisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_embolism "Air embolism") can still occur if decompression rates are not managed.

Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate [alveoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus "Pulmonary alveolus") of the [lungs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung "Lung").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-harding-49)[Eardrums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum "Eardrum") and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-Landis_Ebullism-52) Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called [barotrauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma "Barotrauma"). A pressure drop of 13 kPa (100 Torr), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-harding-49)

Some [extremophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile "Extremophile")[microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganisms "Microorganisms"), such as [tardigrades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade "Tardigrade"), can survive vacuum conditions for periods of days or weeks.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#cite_note-53)
