[ 1 ] SERENDIP takes advantage of ongoing "mainstream" radio telescope observations as a " piggy-back " or " commensal " program. Rather than having its own observation program, SERENDIP analyzes deep space radio telescope data that it obtains while other astronomers are using the telescope.

Background [ edit ] The initial SERENDIP instrument was a 100-channel analog radio spectrometer covering 100 kHz of bandwidth . Subsequent instruments have been significantly more capable, with the number of channels doubling roughly every year. These instruments have been deployed at a large number of telescopes including the NRAO 90m telescope at the Green Bank Observatory and the Arecibo 305m telescope .

SERENDIP observations have been conducted at frequencies between 400 MHz and 5 GHz , with most observations near the so-called Cosmic Water Hole (1.42 GHz (21 cm) neutral hydrogen and 1.66 GHz hydroxyl transitions).

Projects [ edit ] SERENDIP V was installed at the Arecibo Observatory in June 2009. The digital back-end instrument was an FPGA -based 128 million-channel digital spectrometer covering 200 MHz of bandwidth.  It took data commensally with the seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA).

[ 2 ] The next generation of SERENDIP experiments, SERENDIP VI was deployed in 2014 at both Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope .

[ 3 ] SERENDIP VI will also look for fast radio bursts, in collaboration with scientists from University of Oxford and West Virginia University .

[ 4 ] Findings [ edit ] The program has found around 400 suspicious signals, but there is not enough data to prove that they belong to extraterrestrial intelligence .

[ 5 ] In September–October 2004 the media wrote about Radio source SHGb02+14a and its artificial origin, but scrutiny has not been able to confirm its connection with an extraterrestrial civilization.

[ 6 ] Currently no confirmed extraterrestrial signals have been found.
