[ 1 ] He is a professor of statistics and electrical engineering (by courtesy) at Stanford University , where he is also the Barnum-Simons Chair in Mathematics and Statistics. Candès is a 2017 MacArthur Fellow .

Academic biography [ edit ] Candès earned a MSc from the École Polytechnique in 1993.

[ 2 ] He did his postgraduate studies at Stanford , where he earned a PhD in statistics in 1998 under the supervision of David Donoho [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and immediately joined the Stanford faculty as an assistant professor of statistics.

[ 2 ] He moved to the California Institute of Technology in 2000, [ 2 ] where in 2006 he was named the Ronald and Maxine Linde Professor of Applied and Computational Mathematics. He returned to Stanford in 2009.

Research [ edit ] Candès' early research concerned nonlinear approximation theory . In his PhD thesis, [ 3 ] he developed generalizations of wavelets called curvelets and ridgelets that were able to capture higher order structures in signals. This work has had significant impact in image processing and multiscale analysis , and earned him the Popov prize in approximation theory in 2001.

[ 4 ] In 2006, Candès wrote a paper with Australian-American mathematician Terence Tao [ 5 ] that spearheaded the field of compressed sensing : the recovery of sparse signals from a few carefully constructed, and seemingly random measurements. Many researchers have since contributed to this field, which has introduced the idea of a camera that can record pictures while needing only one sensor.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2001 Candès received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship .

[ 2 ] He was awarded the James H. Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing in 2005.

[ 2 ] In 2006, he received the Vasil A. Popov Prize [ 4 ] as well as the National Science Foundation 's highest honor: the Alan T. Waterman Award for research described by the NSF as "nothing short of revolutionary".

[ 8 ] In 2010 Candès and Terence Tao were awarded the George Pólya Prize .  In 2011, Candès was awarded the ICIAM Collatz Prize .

[ 9 ] Candès has also received the Lagrange Prize in Continuous Optimization, awarded by the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) . He was also presented with the Dannie Heineman Prize by the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen in 2013. In 2014 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences .

[ 10 ] In 2015 he  received the George David Birkhoff Prize of the AMS / SIAM. He is also a fellow of SIAM.

[ 11 ] In 2017 Candès received the MacArthur Fellowship for exploring the limits of signal recovery and matrix completion from incomplete data sets with implications for high-impact applications in multiple fields.

[ 12 ] He was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 13 ] In 2020, Candès was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research.

[ 14 ] Personal life [ edit ] Candès is married to Stanford statistician Chiara Sabatti .
