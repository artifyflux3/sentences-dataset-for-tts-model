Recent estimates of its age range up to 14,000 years old, and 16,000 years by the latest (2024) estimate.

[ 1 ] It is located in Utah , United States.

This is a list of the oldest-known trees . Definitions of an individual tree vary. Tree ages are derived from a variety of sources, including documented "tree-ring" ( dendrochronological ) count core samples, and from estimates. For these reasons, there are three lists of "oldest trees" here, using different criteria.

The three tables of trees are listed by age and species . The first table includes trees for which a minimum age has been directly determined, either through counting or cross-referencing tree rings or through radiocarbon dating . Many of these trees may be even older than their listed ages, but the oldest wood in the tree has rotted away. For some old trees, so much of the center is missing that their age cannot be directly determined. Instead, estimates are made based on the tree's size and presumed growth rate. The second table includes trees with these estimated ages. The last table lists clonal colonies in which no individual tree trunks may be remarkably old but in which the organism as a whole is thought to be very old.

The record-holders for individual, non-clonal trees are the Great Basin bristlecone pine trees from California and Nevada , in the United States. Through tree-ring cross-referencing, they have been shown to be almost five millennia old.

[ 2 ] A clonal colony can survive for much longer than an individual tree. A colony of 48,000 quaking aspen trees (nicknamed Pando ), covering 106 acres (43 ha) in the Fishlake National Forest of Utah , is considered one of the oldest and largest organisms in the world. Recent estimates set the colony's age at several thousand (up to 16,000) years, although tree ring samples date individual stems at rarely more than 130 years.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] A colony of Huon pine trees covering 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) on Mount Read (Tasmania) is estimated to be around 10,000 years old, as determined by DNA samples taken from pollen collected from the sediment of a nearby lake. Individual trees in this group date to no more than 4,000 years old, as determined by tree ring samples.

[ 68 ] Clonal trees [ edit ] As with all long-lived plant and fungal species, no individual part of a clonal colony is alive (in the sense of active metabolism ) for more than a very small fraction of the life of the entire clone. Some clonal colonies may be fully connected via their root systems , while most are not actually interconnected, but are genetically identical clones which populated an area through vegetative reproduction . Ages for clonal colonies, often based on current growth rates, are estimates.

[ citation needed ] Name Age (years) Species Location Country Notes Wollemi Pines 60+ million years Wollemi pine Wollemia nobilis Wollemi National Park , New South Wales Australia According to Cris Brack and Matthew Brookhouse at the ANU Fenner School of Environment & Society: "Once you accept that a common, genetically identical stock can define a tree, then the absolute "winner" for oldest tree (or the oldest clonal material belonging to a tree) [in Australia] must go to the Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis). It may be more than 60 million years old. The Wollemi pine clones itself, forming exact genetic copies. It was thought to be extinct until a tiny remnant population was discovered in Wollemi National Park in 1994... There is also substantial evidence that the tree has been cloning itself and its unique genes ever since it disappeared from the fossil record more than 60 million years ago." [ 69 ] Unknown 43,600–130,000 King's lomatia Lomatia tasmanica Southwest National Park , Tasmania Australia Lomatia tasmanica is an endangered species with only one population, consisting of several hundred genetically identical individuals. Although it flowers occasionally, fruit production has never been observed, and it propagates vegetatively. Fossilized leaves are dated as at least 43,600 years old, found in sediments with a maximum age of 130,000.

A critically endangered species, known only from 6 wild individuals, first described in the 1980s. Based on the size and growth rate of its lignotuber , the largest single specimen is estimated to be 3,000 years old. However, it is possible that two other specimens are actually the result of a split in the original rootstock, and based on their spread of 26m would be estimated at 13,000 years old, potentially the oldest single tree on earth.
