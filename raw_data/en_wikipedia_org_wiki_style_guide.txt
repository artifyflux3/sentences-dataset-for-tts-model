This article is about guides for writing. For style guides as fashion guides, often issued within fashion magazines, see [List of fashion magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fashion_magazines "List of fashion magazines").

A **style guide** is a set of standards for the writing, [formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting"), and design of [documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document "Document").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-1) A book-length style guide is often called a **style manual** or a **manual of style**. A short style guide, typically ranging from several to several dozen pages, is often called a **style sheet**. The standards documented in a style guide are applicable for either general use, or prescribed use in an individual publication, particular organization, or specific field.

A style guide establishes standard style requirements to improve [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication") by ensuring consistency within and across documents. They may require certain [best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice "Best practice") in [writing style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_style "Writing style"), [usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_(language) "Usage (language)"), [language composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(language) "Composition (language)"), [visual composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts) "Composition (visual arts)"), [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography"), and [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography") by setting standards of usage in areas such as [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"), [capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization "Capitalization"), [citing sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation#Styles "Citation"), formatting of numbers and dates, [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information) "Table (information)") appearance and other areas. For [academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing "Academic publishing") and [technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_communication "Technical communication") documents, a guide may also enforce best practices in [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") (such as [authorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author "Author"), [research ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_ethics "Research ethics"), and disclosure) and compliance ([technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard "Technical standard") and [regulatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance "Regulatory compliance")). For translations, a style guide may even be used to enforce consistent grammar, tone, and localization decisions such as [units of measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-2)

Style guides may be categorized into three types: **comprehensive style** for general use; **discipline style** for specialized use, which is often specific to [academic disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_publishing "Medical publishing"), [journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism "Journalism"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_publication "Legal publication"), [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Publishing_Office "Government Publishing Office"), business, and other fields; and **house** or **corporate style**, created and used by a particular publisher or organization.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-3)

Style guides vary widely in scope and size. Writers working in large industries or professional sectors may reference a specific style guide, written for usage in specialized documents within their fields. For the most part, these guides are relevant and useful for peer-to-peer specialist documentation, or to help writers working in specific industries or sectors to communicate highly technical information in scholarly articles or industry [white papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper "White paper").

Professional style guides from different countries can be referenced for authoritative advice on their respective language(s), such as _[Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%27s\_Rules "Hart's Rules")_ from [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press") and _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ from the [University of Chicago Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Press "University of Chicago Press"). Australia has a style guide, available online, created by its government.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-4)

The guides' variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, analogous to how style sheets cascade in [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development) "Style sheet (web development)") and in [desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(desktop_publishing) "Style sheet (desktop publishing)") with [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") styles.

In many cases, a project such as a [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book "Book"), [journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal"), or [monograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph "Monograph") series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the larger style guide of an organization such as a [publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing "Publishing") company, whose specific content is usually called _house style_. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an industry-wide or profession-wide style manual that is even more comprehensive. Examples of industry style guides include:

*   _[The Associated Press Stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Associated\_Press\_Stylebook "The Associated Press Stylebook")_ (_AP Stylebook_) and _The Canadian Press Stylebook_ for journalism
*   _Hart's Rules_ and _The Chicago Manual of Style_ for general academic writing and publishing
*   [Modern Humanities Research Association (MHRA) style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHRA_Style_Guide "MHRA Style Guide") and [American Sociological Association (ASA) style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASA_style "ASA style") for the humanities and social sciences
*   _[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Standard\_for\_Citation\_of\_Legal\_Authorities "Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities")_ (_OSCOLA_) and [_Bluebook_ style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebook "Bluebook") for law
*   [US Government Publishing Office (USGPO) style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPO_style_manual "GPO style manual") and [Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Publishing_Service "Australian Government Publishing Service") for government publications

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") norms of the language in use (for example, [English orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography "English orthography") for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety, such as [British, American, Canadian, and Australian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English "Comparison of American and British English").

Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design "Graphic design"), including [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"). Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects, as well as text.

Guides in specific scientific and technical fields may cover [nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature "Nomenclature") to specify names or classification labels that are clear, standardized, and [ontologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") sound (e.g., [taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology) "Taxonomy (biology)"), [chemical nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_nomenclature "Chemical nomenclature"), and [gene nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_nomenclature "Gene nomenclature")).

Style guides that cover [usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_(language) "Usage (language)") may suggest descriptive terms for people which avoid [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism"), [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism "Sexism"), [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia "Homophobia"), etc. Style guides increasingly incorporate [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility "Accessibility") conventions for audience members with visual, mobility, or other disabilities.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-5)

Since the beginning of the digital era, websites have allowed for an expansion of style guide conventions to account for digital behavior such as [screen reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reading "Screen reading").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-:0-6) Screen reading requires web style guides to focus more intensively on a user experience that is subject to multichannel surfing. Though web style guides can vary widely, they tend to prioritize similar values about brevity, terminology, syntax, tone, structure, typography, graphics, and errors.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-:0-6)

Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and usage. The update frequency and [revision control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control "Revision control") are determined by the subject. For style manuals in [reference-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_work "Reference work") format, new [editions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_(book) "Edition (book)") typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the _AP Stylebook_ is revised every other year (since 2020).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide#cite_note-7)_The Chicago Manual of Style_ is in its 18th edition, while the [American Psychological Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association "American Psychological Association") (APA) and ASA styles are each in their 7th edition as of 2025. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.
