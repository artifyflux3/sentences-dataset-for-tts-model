Biography [ edit ] Coat of Arms of Joseph Willard Willard was born December 29, 1738, in Biddeford , York County (at that time part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , but subsequently the state of Maine ) into one of the most illustrious families in Colonial Massachusetts. His parents were Reverend Samuel Willard (1705-1741) and Abigail Willard ( née Sherman). One of his great-grandfathers was another Reverend Samuel Willard , and his great-great-grandfather was Major Simon Willard .

Joseph's father died when he was two years old and one year later his mother remarried to a Rev. Richard Elvins. Joseph was educated at the Dummer Academy (now known as The Governor's Academy ). Through the generosity of friends he entered Harvard College , where he received a B.A.

in 1765, and an M.A.

in 1768.  He was a tutor at Harvard until 1772, when he began serving as pastor at the First Congregational Church in Beverly, Massachusetts . In 1780 he was a charter member [ 1 ] and first corresponding secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . In 1785, he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Harvard and in 1791, a Doctor of Laws degree from Yale University .

In 1781, he became president of Harvard, in which he served until his death. His tenure was marked by his institution of a dress code (due to his disapproval of the brightly colored silk garments often worn by pupils) consisting of blue-gray coats, and breeches and waistcoats in four approved colors. In 1789, he was recorded as owning an enslaved man named Cesar.

[ 2 ] When delivering the 1799 commencement address, Willard broke with tradition and delivered it in English, rather than the customary Latin. In 1804, Willard was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia .

[ 3 ] Joseph Willard died in New Bedford, Massachusetts on September 25, 1804.

[ 4 ] His great-grandfather Samuel Willard had served as Acting President of Harvard from 1701 until his own death in 1707.

Willard was the father of Cambridge Mayor Sidney Willard .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Works [ edit ] He published a few sermons, a Latin address on the death of George Washington , prefixed to David Tappan 's Discourse (Cambridge, 1800), and mathematical and astronomical papers in the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society . He was a sound Greek scholar, and left a Greek grammar in manuscript.
