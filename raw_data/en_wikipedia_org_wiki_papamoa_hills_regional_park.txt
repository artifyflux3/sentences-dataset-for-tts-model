[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Its traditional Māori name is Te Rae o Pāpāmoa , translating roughly as "the forehead of the woman who is the hills".

[ 7 ] Features [ edit ] The park is an operational farm several gates, located behind a Fulton Hogan quarry with regular truck traffic.

Initially, there were five trees, but they were toppled by strong winds in the early 2000s. Another pine tree, located beside the Pāpāmoa Pā, was removed due to falling branches, posing a hazard to the area in 2016.
