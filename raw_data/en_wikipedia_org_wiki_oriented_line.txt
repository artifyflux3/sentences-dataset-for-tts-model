[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg/250px-Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg)

The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.

The **orientation of a real vector space** or simply **orientation of a vector space** is the arbitrary choice of which ordered [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(mathematics) "Basis (mathematics)") are "positively" oriented and which are "negatively" oriented. In the three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), right-handed bases are typically declared to be positively oriented, but the choice is arbitrary, as they may also be assigned a negative orientation. A [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") with an orientation selected is called an **oriented vector space**, while one not having an orientation selected is called **unoriented**.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), _[orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability")_ is a broader notion that, in two dimensions, allows one to say when a [cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(topology) "Loop (topology)") goes around clockwise or counterclockwise, and in three dimensions when a figure is left-handed or right-handed. In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), the notion of orientation makes sense in arbitrary finite dimension, and is a kind of asymmetry that makes a [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") impossible to replicate by means of a simple [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation "Rigid transformation"). Thus, in three dimensions, it is impossible to make the left hand of a human figure into the right hand of the figure by applying a displacement alone, but it is possible to do so by reflecting the figure in a mirror. As a result, in the three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), the two possible basis orientations are called [right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_rule "Right hand rule") and left-handed (or right-chiral and left-chiral).

Let _V_ be a [finite-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-dimensional "Finite-dimensional") real vector space and let _b_ 1 and _b_ 2 be two ordered bases for _V_. It is a standard result in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") that there exists a unique [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation")_A_: _V_ → _V_ that takes _b_ 1 to _b_ 2. The bases _b_ 1 and _b_ 2 are said to have the _same orientation_ (or be consistently oriented) if _A_ has positive [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant"); otherwise they have _opposite orientations_. The property of having the same orientation defines an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on the set of all ordered bases for _V_. If _V_ is non-zero, there are precisely two [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") determined by this relation. An **orientation** on _V_ is an assignment of +1 to one equivalence class and −1 to the other.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-1)

Every ordered basis lives in one equivalence class or another. Thus any choice of a privileged ordered basis for _V_ determines an orientation: the orientation class of the privileged basis is declared to be positive.

For example, the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis "Standard basis") on **R**_n_ provides a **standard orientation** on **R**_n_ (in turn, the orientation of the standard basis depends on the orientation of the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") on which it is built). Any choice of a linear [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") between _V_ and **R**_n_ will then provide an orientation on _V_.

The ordering of elements in a basis is crucial. Two bases with a different ordering will differ by some [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation"). They will have the same/opposite orientations according to whether the [signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_(permutation) "Signature (permutation)") of this permutation is ±1. This is because the determinant of a [permutation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix "Permutation matrix") is equal to the signature of the associated permutation.

Similarly, let _A_ be a nonsingular linear mapping of vector space **R**_n_ to **R**_n_. This mapping is **orientation-preserving** if its determinant is positive.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-2) For instance, in **R**3 a rotation around the _Z_ Cartesian axis by an angle _α_ is orientation-preserving: ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{1}={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \alpha &-\sin \alpha &0\\\sin \alpha &\cos \alpha &0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c8d6805fb103da70ce548562fbeb56323a616ef) while a reflection by the _XY_ Cartesian plane is not orientation-preserving: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{2}={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdba0a12879cf068458b8dacd9736a813bfeb1c8)

### Zero-dimensional case

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(vector_space)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Zero-dimensional case")]

The concept of orientation degenerates in the zero-dimensional case. A zero-dimensional vector space has only a single point, the zero vector. Consequently, the only basis of a zero-dimensional vector space is the empty set ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \emptyset }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6af50205f42bb2ec3c666b7b847d2c7f96e464c7). Therefore, there is a single equivalence class of ordered bases, namely, the class ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \{\emptyset \}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b2943085c6db53add570975fb7c528c398f0c52) whose sole member is the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"). This means that an orientation of a [zero-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional_space "Zero-dimensional space") is a function ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \{\{\emptyset \}\}\to \{\pm 1\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6e9c71ca04d4cedb00e438afb39e3fc478d43e8) It is therefore possible to orient a point in two different ways, positive and negative.

Because there is only a single ordered basis ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \emptyset }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6af50205f42bb2ec3c666b7b847d2c7f96e464c7), a zero-dimensional vector space is the same as a zero-dimensional vector space with ordered basis. Choosing ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \{\emptyset \}\mapsto +1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49a1672258ad87591b203f66f02490486aa7073a) or ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \{\emptyset \}\mapsto -1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf04a70112ef04902ee192f96e3239a84e521834) therefore chooses an orientation of every basis of every zero-dimensional vector space. If all zero-dimensional vector spaces are assigned this orientation, then, because all isomorphisms among zero-dimensional vector spaces preserve the ordered basis, they also preserve the orientation. This is unlike the case of higher-dimensional vector spaces where there is no way to choose an orientation so that it is preserved under all isomorphisms.

However, there are situations where it is desirable to give different orientations to different points. For example, consider the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus") as an instance of [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem"). A closed interval [_a_, _b_] is a one-dimensional [manifold with boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_with_boundary "Manifold with boundary"), and its boundary is the set {_a_, _b_}. In order to get the correct statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the point _b_ should be oriented positively, while the point _a_ should be oriented negatively.

The one-dimensional case deals with an **oriented line** or **directed line**, which may be traversed in one of two directions. In [real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space"), an oriented line is also known as an _**axis**_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-3) There are two orientations to a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") just as there are two orientations to an [oriented circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_circle "Oriented circle") (clockwise and anti-clockwise). A semi-infinite oriented line is called a _[ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray\_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)")_. In the case of a [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") (a connected subset of a line), the two possible orientations result in _[directed line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed\_line\_segment "Directed line segment")_.

An [orientable surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") sometimes has the selected orientation indicated by the orientation of a [surface normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal "Surface normal"). An [oriented plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_plane "Oriented plane") can be defined by a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector").

### Multilinear algebra

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(vector_space)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Multilinear algebra")]

For any _n_-dimensional real vector space _V_ we can form the _k_ th-[exterior power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_power "Exterior power") of _V_, denoted Λ _k_ _V_. This is a real vector space of dimension [![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/206415d3742167e319b2e52c2ca7563b799abad7)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient "Binomial coefficient"). The vector space Λ _n_ _V_ (called the _top exterior power_) therefore has dimension 1. That is, Λ _n_ _V_ is just a real line. There is no _a priori_ choice of which direction on this line is positive. An orientation is just such a choice. Any nonzero [linear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_form "Linear form")_ω_ on Λ _n_ _V_ determines an orientation of _V_ by declaring that _x_ is in the positive direction when _ω_(_x_) > 0. To connect with the basis point of view we say that the positively-oriented bases are those on which _ω_ evaluates to a positive number (since _ω_ is an _n_-form we can evaluate it on an ordered set of _n_ vectors, giving an element of **R**). The form _ω_ is called an **orientation form**. If {_e_ _i_} is a privileged basis for _V_ and {_e_ _i_∗} is the [dual basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_basis "Dual basis"), then the orientation form giving the standard orientation is _e_ 1∗ ∧ _e_ 2∗ ∧ … ∧ _e_ _n_∗.

The connection of this with the determinant point of view is: the determinant of an [endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism "Endomorphism")![Image 11: {\displaystyle T:V\to V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0fabb548ced097e03f45cf54dbb066d23d010f3) can be interpreted as the induced action on the top exterior power.

Let _B_ be the set of all ordered bases for _V_. Then the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group") GL(_V_) [acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") freely and transitively on _B_. (In fancy language, _B_ is a GL(_V_)-[torsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsor "Torsor")). This means that as a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), _B_ is (noncanonically) [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to GL(_V_). Note that the group GL(_V_) is not [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space"), but rather has two [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") according to whether the determinant of the transformation is positive or negative (except for GL 0, which is the trivial group and thus has a single connected component; this corresponds to the canonical orientation on a zero-dimensional vector space). The [identity component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_component "Identity component") of GL(_V_) is denoted GL+(_V_) and consists of those transformations with positive determinant. The action of GL+(_V_) on _B_ is _not_ transitive: there are two orbits which correspond to the connected components of _B_. These orbits are precisely the equivalence classes referred to above. Since _B_ does not have a distinguished element (i.e. a privileged basis) there is no natural choice of which component is positive. Contrast this with GL(_V_) which does have a privileged component: the component of the identity. A specific choice of homeomorphism between _B_ and GL(_V_) is equivalent to a choice of a privileged basis and therefore determines an orientation.

More formally: ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \pi _{0}(\operatorname {GL} (V))=(\operatorname {GL} (V)/\operatorname {GL} ^{+}(V)=\{\pm 1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67bdae6f4c60bce1eb46c6ac1289c5e7df5ff689), and the [Stiefel manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiefel_manifold "Stiefel manifold") of _n_-frames in ![Image 13: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) is a ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ea57e2326666ffe7efa076e1e93e01aab303d556)-[torsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsor "Torsor"), so ![Image 15: {\displaystyle V_{n}(V)/\operatorname {GL} ^{+}(V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d38339975083bb91891afc390ae756b1c9a465a7) is a [torsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsor "Torsor") over ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \{\pm 1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5eeb8470fc14dbbc80503092df4c0c36d56e66ac), i.e., its 2 points, and a choice of one of them is an orientation.

Parallel plane segments with the same attitude, magnitude and orientation, all corresponding to the same bivector **a** ∧ **b**.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-Dorst-4)

The various objects of [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra") are charged with three attributes or _features_: attitude, orientation, and magnitude.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-Jancewicz1-5) For example, a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") has an attitude given by a straight line parallel to it, an orientation given by its sense (often indicated by an arrowhead) and a magnitude given by its length. Similarly, a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector") in three dimensions has an attitude given by the family of [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") associated with it (possibly specified by the [normal line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_and_normal_components "Tangential and normal components") common to these planes [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-Granville-6)), an orientation (sometimes denoted by a curved arrow in the plane) indicating a choice of sense of traversal of its boundary (its _circulation_), and a magnitude given by the area of the [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") defined by its two vectors.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_line#cite_note-Hestenes-7)

Orientation on manifolds
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orientation_(vector_space)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Orientation on manifolds")]

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Surface_orientation.pdf/page1-250px-Surface_orientation.pdf.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Surface_orientation.pdf)

The orientation of a volume may be determined by the orientation on its boundary, indicated by the circulating arrows.

Each point _p_ on an _n_-dimensional differentiable [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") has a [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space")_T_ _p_ _M_ which is an _n_-dimensional real vector space. Each of these vector spaces can be assigned an orientation. Some orientations "vary smoothly" from point to point. Due to certain [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") restrictions, this is not always possible. A manifold that admits a smooth choice of orientations for its tangent spaces is said to be _[orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability")_.
