In 2001, Dartmouth participated in the inaugural NCAA Championship tournament. Since then, they have appeared in the "Frozen Four", the semifinals of the NCAA hockey tournament, three additional times.

History [ edit ] Dartmouth College started a women’s ice hockey program on January 7, 1978, six years after first admitting women students. The Big Green  defeated Middlebury by a 6–5 score. The Big Green finished their inaugural season with 7 wins, 7 losses, and 1 tie. Against Ivy League teams, the Big Green was 1–3–1.

[ 2 ] Big Green player Judy Parish Oberting was named to the first U.S. National Team that competed at the 1990 IIHF Women's World Championship . Oberting was named to the Ivy League's Silver Anniversary Team in 1999. In addition, she coached the Dartmouth's women's hockey team from 1998–2003.

[ 3 ] In 1998, Sarah Hood was one of two Ivy League players named first team All-Americans. This was the first time that Ivy League women's hockey players were bestowed such an honor.

The team has won the ECAC regular season title in 2001, 2002, and 2007 and the post-season tournament in 2001, 2003, 2007, and 2009.

[ 4 ] The Big Green was the Ivy League champion 8 times (1991, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2007).

[ 5 ] The Ivy league announced in July 2020 that play would be suspended in Fall 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In August 2020, Laura Schuler stepped down as head coach, and Morgan Illikinen, Class of '15, was chosen as interim head coach.

On May 31, 2024, Maura Crowell was named head coach.
