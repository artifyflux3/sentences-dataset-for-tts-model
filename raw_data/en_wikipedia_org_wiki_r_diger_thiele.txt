[ 1 ] Early life, family and education [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( February 2025 ) Rolf-Rüdiger Thiele was born in Polepp , Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic ).

Thiele studied mathematics, physics, and psychology at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and received his promotion (Ph.D.) there in 1973.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Career [ edit ] Thiele worked in the publishing business in Leipzig for B. G. Teubner Verlag and Salomon Hirzel Verlag. From 1986 to 2008, he worked at the Karl Sudhoff Institute for the History of Medicine and Natural Sciences at the University of Leipzig . He has held visiting positions at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (from 1992 to 1995 as chair for the history of natural sciences), at TU Darmstadt , at the University of Bonn (from 1995 to 1996), and at the University of Toronto .

[ 2 ] In 2001, Thiele habilitated in the department of mathematics at the University of Hamburg with his work Von der Bernoullischen Brachistochrone zum Kalibratorkonzept (From the Bernoullian brachistochrone to the calibrator concept). His habilitation thesis was published in the series Collection de travaux de l'Académie internationale d'Histoire des Sciences , Brepols Verlag, Turnhout . In 2002, he became a privatdozent in the department of mathematics at the University of Leipzig.

[ 2 ] In 2004, he was awarded the Lester R. Ford Award of the Mathematical Association of America for his expository article on Hilbert's cancelled 24th problem .

[ 4 ] He discovered the 24th problem in an unpublished notebook among Hilbert's Nachlass . He has been the vice president of the Euler Society .

His most important works deal with the biographies of Leonhard Euler , Bartel Leendert van der Waerden , David Hilbert , Felix Klein . Central topics in his historical research are analysis and the calculus of variations . In his writings, Thiele uses numerous previously unpublished sources.

In addition to numerous book publications and specialist articles on various questions in the history of mathematics, he has published several books on mathematical games in recreational mathematics (often in collaboration with Konrad Haase).
