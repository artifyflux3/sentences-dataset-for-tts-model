Norton Publication date 2006 ISBN 978-0-393-05948-9 No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality [ 1 ] is a book by psychology researcher Judith Rich Harris . It was published in February 2006. Harris attempts to explain why people are so different in personality, even identical twins who grow up in the same home.

[ 2 ] No Two Alike expands on some of the ideas from her previous book The Nurture Assumption , especially the effect of birth order on personality and criticism of developmental psychology . She also attempts to answer some of the criticisms leveled at The Nurture Assumption .

Harris proposes that three distinct mental systems shape personality: A relationship system that allows us to distinguish family from strangers and tell individuals apart.

A socialization system that helps us to become members of a group and absorb the group's culture.

A status system that enables us to acquire self-knowledge by measuring ourselves against others.

The book was translated into Hebrew in 2006.
