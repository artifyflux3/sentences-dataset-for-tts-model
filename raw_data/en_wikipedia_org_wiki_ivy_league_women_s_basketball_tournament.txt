The overall event is currently marketed as Ivy Madness . As with the men's tournament, the women's event is a single-elimination tournament involving the top four schools in the standings. The tournament format consists of two semifinal games on the first day (Saturday), with the No. 1 seed playing the No. 4 seed and the No. 2 seed playing the No. 3 seed, followed by the championship game played the next day (Sunday). The tournament winner receives the League's automatic bids to the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament . The teams that finish with the best records from the 14-game, regular-season conference schedule will continue to be recognized as Ivy League champions.

Unlike the men's Ivy tournament, in which the regular-season champion receives an automatic berth in the National Invitation Tournament should it fail to win the conference tournament, a women's regular-season champion is technically not guaranteed a postseason berth if it does not make the NCAA tournament. However, the Women's National Invitation Tournament has a standing policy of inviting the top available team from each NCAA Division I conference once the NCAA women's tournament field has been set.

[ 1 ] (This difference is because unlike the men's NIT, the WNIT is neither owned nor operated by the NCAA.) Prior to the formal tournament, the Ivy League used a one-game playoff if necessary to break ties eight times with two teams, and in 2001-02, a three-team tournament, in order to settle the conference championship.

The first two tournaments in 2017 and 2018 were held at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania . The 2019 event was held at John J. Lee Amphitheater, a venue located within Yale University 's Payne Whitney Gymnasium . In 2019, the Ivy League announced that the men's and women's tournaments would rotate among the remaining conference members through 2025.

[ 2 ] Due to COVID-19 disruptions, the 2020 tournament was canceled, and the Ivy League did not play a 2020–21 season . The tournament resumed in 2022, with all venues shifted forward by two years.
