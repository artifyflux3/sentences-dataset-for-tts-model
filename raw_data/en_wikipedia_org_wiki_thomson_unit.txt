J. Thomson The thomson (symbol: Th ) is a unit that has appeared infrequently in scientific literature relating to the field of mass spectrometry as a unit of mass-to-charge ratio . The unit was proposed by R. Graham Cooks and Alan L. Rockwood [ 1 ] naming it in honour of J. J. Thomson who measured the mass-to-charge ratio of electrons and ions.

Definition [ edit ] The thomson is defined as [ 2 ] 1 T h = 1 D a e ≈ ≈ 1.036426 × × 10 − − 8 k g ⋅ ⋅ C − − 1 {\displaystyle 1~\mathrm {Th} =1~{\frac {\mathrm {Da} }{e}}\approx 1.036426\times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm {kg{\cdot }C^{-1}} } where Da is the symbol for the unit dalton (also called the unified atomic mass unit, symbol u), and e is the elementary charge , which is the unit of electric charge in the system of atomic units .

For example, the ion C 7 H 7 2+ has a mass of 91 Da. Its charge number is +2, and hence its charge is 2 e . The ion will be observed at 45.5 Th in a mass spectrum.

The thomson allows for negative values for negatively charged ions. For example, the benzoate anion would be observed at −121 Th since the charge is − e .

Use [ edit ] The thomson has been used by some mass spectrometrists, for example Alexander Makarov —the inventor of the Orbitrap —in a scientific poster, [ 3 ] and a 2015 presentation.

[ 4 ] Other uses of the thomson include papers, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and (notably) one book.

[ 2 ] The journal Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry (in which the original article appeared) states that "the thomson (Th) may be used for such purposes as a unit of mass-to-charge ratio although it is not currently approved by IUPAP or IUPAC." [ 7 ] Even so, the term has been called "controversial" by RCM's former Editor-in Chief [ 8 ] (in a review the Hoffman text cited above [ 2 ] ). The book, Mass Spectrometry Desk Reference , argues against the use of the thomson.

[ 9 ] However, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan has written an editorial in support of the thomson unit.

[ 10 ] The thomson is not an SI unit , nor has it been defined by IUPAC .

Since 2013, the thomson is deprecated by IUPAC (Definitions of Terms Relating to Mass Spectrometry).

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Since 2014, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry regards the thomson as a "term that should be avoided in mass spectrometry publications".
