[ 1 ] The theory was further developed by Dorothy Maharam (1958) [ 2 ] and by Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea and Cassius Ionescu Tulcea (1961).

[ 3 ] Lifting theory was motivated to a large extent by its striking applications. Its development up to 1969 was described in a monograph of the Ionescu Tulceas.

[ 4 ] Lifting theory continued to develop since then, yielding new results and applications.

Definitions [ edit ] A lifting on a measure space ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a linear and multiplicative operator T : L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) → → L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle T:L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )\to {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} which is a right inverse of the quotient map { L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) → → L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) f ↦ ↦ [ f ] {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )\to L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )\\f\mapsto [f]\end{cases}}} where L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is the seminormed L p space of measurable functions and L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is its usual normed quotient. In other words, a lifting picks from every equivalence class [ f ] {\displaystyle [f]} of bounded measurable functions modulo negligible functions a representative— which is henceforth written T ( [ f ] ) {\displaystyle T([f])} or T [ f ] {\displaystyle T[f]} or simply T f {\displaystyle Tf} — in such a way that T [ 1 ] = 1 {\displaystyle T[1]=1} and for all p ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p\in X} and all r , s ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle r,s\in \mathbb {R} ,} T ( r [ f ] + s [ g ] ) ( p ) = r T [ f ] ( p ) + s T [ g ] ( p ) , {\displaystyle T(r[f]+s[g])(p)=rT[f](p)+sT[g](p),} T ( [ f ] × × [ g ] ) ( p ) = T [ f ] ( p ) × × T [ g ] ( p ) .

{\displaystyle T([f]\times [g])(p)=T[f](p)\times T[g](p).} Liftings are used to produce disintegrations of measures , for instance conditional probability distributions given continuous random variables, and fibrations of Lebesgue measure on the level sets of a function.

Existence of liftings [ edit ] Theorem.

Suppose ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is complete.

[ 5 ] Then ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} admits a lifting if and only if there exists a collection of mutually disjoint integrable sets in Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } whose union is X .

{\displaystyle X.} In particular, if ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is the completion of a σ -finite [ 6 ] measure or of an inner regular Borel measure on a locally compact space , then ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} admits a lifting.

The proof consists in extending a lifting to ever larger sub- σ -algebras, applying Doob's martingale convergence theorem if one encounters a countable chain in the process.

Strong liftings [ edit ] Suppose ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is complete and X {\displaystyle X} is equipped with a completely regular Hausdorff topology τ τ ⊆ ⊆ Σ Σ {\displaystyle \tau \subseteq \Sigma } such that the union of any collection of negligible open sets is again negligible – this is the case if ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is σ -finite or comes from a Radon measure . Then the support of μ μ , {\displaystyle \mu ,} Supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} (\mu ),} can be defined as the complement of the largest negligible open subset, and the collection C b ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle C_{b}(X,\tau )} of bounded continuous functions belongs to L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu ).} A strong lifting for ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a lifting T : L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) → → L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle T:L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )\to {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} such that T φ φ = φ φ {\displaystyle T\varphi =\varphi } on Supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} (\mu )} for all φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } in C b ( X , τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle C_{b}(X,\tau ).} This is the same as requiring that [ 7 ] T U ≥ ≥ ( U ∩ ∩ Supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) ) {\displaystyle TU\geq (U\cap \operatorname {Supp} (\mu ))} for all open sets U {\displaystyle U} in τ τ .

{\displaystyle \tau .} Theorem.

If ( Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (\Sigma ,\mu )} is σ -finite and complete and τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } has a countable basis then ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} admits a strong lifting.

Proof.

Let T 0 {\displaystyle T_{0}} be a lifting for ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} and U 1 , U 2 , … … {\displaystyle U_{1},U_{2},\ldots } a countable basis for τ τ .

{\displaystyle \tau .} For any point p {\displaystyle p} in the negligible set N := ⋃ ⋃ n { p ∈ ∈ Supp ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ ) : ( T 0 U n ) ( p ) < U n ( p ) } {\displaystyle N:=\bigcup \nolimits _{n}\left\{p\in \operatorname {Supp} (\mu ):(T_{0}U_{n})(p)<U_{n}(p)\right\}} let T p {\displaystyle T_{p}} be any character [ 8 ] on L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} that extends the character ϕ ϕ ↦ ↦ ϕ ϕ ( p ) {\displaystyle \phi \mapsto \phi (p)} of C b ( X , τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle C_{b}(X,\tau ).} Then for p {\displaystyle p} in X {\displaystyle X} and [ f ] {\displaystyle [f]} in L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} define: ( T [ f ] ) ( p ) := { ( T 0 [ f ] ) ( p ) p ∉ ∉ N T p [ f ] p ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle (T[f])(p):={\begin{cases}(T_{0}[f])(p)&p\notin N\\T_{p}[f]&p\in N.\end{cases}}} T {\displaystyle T} is the desired strong lifting.

Application: disintegration of a measure [ edit ] Suppose ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} and ( Y , Φ Φ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (Y,\Phi ,\nu )} are σ -finite measure spaces ( μ μ , ν ν {\displaystyle \mu ,\nu } positive) and π π : X → → Y {\displaystyle \pi :X\to Y} is a measurable map. A disintegration of μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } along π π {\displaystyle \pi } with respect to ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is a slew Y ∋ ∋ y ↦ ↦ λ λ y {\displaystyle Y\ni y\mapsto \lambda _{y}} of positive σ -additive measures on ( Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (\Sigma ,\mu )} such that λ λ y {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}} is carried by the fiber π π − − 1 ( { y } ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}(\{y\})} of π π {\displaystyle \pi } over y {\displaystyle y} , i.e.

{ y } ∈ ∈ Φ Φ {\displaystyle \{y\}\in \Phi } and λ λ y ( ( X ∖ ∖ π π − − 1 ( { y } ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}\left((X\setminus \pi ^{-1}(\{y\})\right)=0} for almost all y ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle y\in Y} for every μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -integrable function f , {\displaystyle f,} ∫ ∫ X f ( p ) μ μ ( d p ) = ∫ ∫ Y ( ∫ ∫ π π − − 1 ( { y } ) f ( p ) λ λ y ( d p ) ) ν ν ( d y ) ( ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle \int _{X}f(p)\;\mu (dp)=\int _{Y}\left(\int _{\pi ^{-1}(\{y\})}f(p)\,\lambda _{y}(dp)\right)\nu (dy)\qquad (*)} in the sense that, for ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } -almost all y {\displaystyle y} in Y , {\displaystyle Y,} f {\displaystyle f} is λ λ y {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}} -integrable, the function y ↦ ↦ ∫ ∫ π π − − 1 ( { y } ) f ( p ) λ λ y ( d p ) {\displaystyle y\mapsto \int _{\pi ^{-1}(\{y\})}f(p)\,\lambda _{y}(dp)} is ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } -integrable, and the displayed equality ( ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle (*)} holds.

Disintegrations exist in various circumstances, the proofs varying but almost all using strong liftings. Here is a rather general result. Its short proof gives the general flavor.

Theorem.

Suppose X {\displaystyle X} is a Polish space [ 9 ] and Y {\displaystyle Y} a separable Hausdorff space, both equipped with their Borel σ -algebras. Let μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be a σ -finite Borel measure on X {\displaystyle X} and π π : X → → Y {\displaystyle \pi :X\to Y} a Σ Σ , Φ Φ − − {\displaystyle \Sigma ,\Phi -} measurable map. Then there exists a σ-finite Borel measure ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } on Y {\displaystyle Y} and a disintegration (*).
If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is finite, ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } can be taken to be the pushforward [ 10 ] π π ∗ ∗ μ μ , {\displaystyle \pi _{*}\mu ,} and then the λ λ y {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}} are probabilities.

Proof.

Because of the polish nature of X {\displaystyle X} there is a sequence of compact subsets of X {\displaystyle X} that are mutually disjoint, whose union has negligible complement, and on which π π {\displaystyle \pi } is continuous. This observation reduces the problem to the case that both X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are compact and π π {\displaystyle \pi } is continuous, and ν ν = π π ∗ ∗ μ μ .

{\displaystyle \nu =\pi _{*}\mu .} Complete Φ Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } under ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } and fix a strong lifting T {\displaystyle T} for ( Y , Φ Φ , ν ν ) .

{\displaystyle (Y,\Phi ,\nu ).} Given a bounded μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measurable function f , {\displaystyle f,} let ⌊ ⌊ f ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor f\rfloor } denote its conditional expectation under π π , {\displaystyle \pi ,} that is, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of [ 11 ] π π ∗ ∗ ( f μ μ ) {\displaystyle \pi _{*}(f\mu )} with respect to π π ∗ ∗ μ μ .

{\displaystyle \pi _{*}\mu .} Then set, for every y {\displaystyle y} in Y , {\displaystyle Y,} λ λ y ( f ) := T ( ⌊ ⌊ f ⌋ ⌋ ) ( y ) .

{\displaystyle \lambda _{y}(f):=T(\lfloor f\rfloor )(y).} To show that this defines a disintegration is a matter of bookkeeping and a suitable Fubini theorem. To see how the strongness of the lifting enters, note that λ λ y ( f ⋅ ⋅ φ φ ∘ ∘ π π ) = φ φ ( y ) λ λ y ( f ) ∀ ∀ y ∈ ∈ Y , φ φ ∈ ∈ C b ( Y ) , f ∈ ∈ L ∞ ∞ ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}(f\cdot \varphi \circ \pi )=\varphi (y)\lambda _{y}(f)\qquad \forall y\in Y,\varphi \in C_{b}(Y),f\in L^{\infty }(X,\Sigma ,\mu )} and take the infimum over all positive φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } in C b ( Y ) {\displaystyle C_{b}(Y)} with φ φ ( y ) = 1 ; {\displaystyle \varphi (y)=1;} it becomes apparent that the support of λ λ y {\displaystyle \lambda _{y}} lies in the fiber over y .
