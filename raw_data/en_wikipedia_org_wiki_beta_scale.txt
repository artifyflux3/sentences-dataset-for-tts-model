It is derived from approximating just intervals using multiples of a single interval without, as is standard in equal temperaments , requiring an octave (2:1). It may be approximated by splitting the perfect fifth (3:2) into eleven equal parts [(3:2) 1 ⁄ 11 ≈ 63.8 cents]. It may be approximated by splitting the perfect fourth (4:3) into two equal parts [(4:3) 1 ⁄ 2 ], [ 1 ] or eight equal parts [(4:3) 1 ⁄ 8 = 64 cents], [ 2 ] totaling approximately 18.8 steps per octave .

The scale step may also precisely be derived from using 11:6 (B ↑ ♭ - , 1049.36 cents, Play ⓘ ) to approximate the interval 3:2 ⁄ 5:4 , [ 3 ] which equals 6:5 Play ⓘ .

In order to make the approximation as good as possible we minimize the mean square deviation . ... We choose a value of the scale degree so that eleven of them approximate a 3:2 perfect fifth, six of them approximate a 5:4 major third, and five of them approximate a 6:5 minor third.

"According to Carlos, beta has almost the same properties as the alpha scale, except that the sevenths are slightly more in tune." [ 1 ] The delta scale may be regarded as the beta scale's reciprocal since it is "as far 'down' the ( 0 3 6 9 ) circle from α as β is 'up'."
