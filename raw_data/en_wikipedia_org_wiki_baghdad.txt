With a population exceeding 7 million, it ranks among the most populous cities in the Middle East and Arab world and forms 22% of the country's population . Spanning an area of approximately 673 square kilometres (260 sq mi), Baghdad is the capital of its governorate and serves as Iraq's political, economic, and cultural hub.

Founded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur , Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into a cultural and intellectual center of the Muslim world . This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom , as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the "Center of Learning". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age , Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an , as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires such as the Ilkhanate , White Sheep Turkoman , Turco–Persian , Mamluk dynasty and the Ottoman Empire .

The city and its province served as the capital and administrative center of Ottoman Iraq , [ 2 ] exercising authority over the provinces of Basra , Mosul , and Shahrizor .

[ 3 ] During the World War I it was captured by British forces in 1917. Baghdad became capital of the former Mandate of Mesopotamia in 1921. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture . During the era of oil boom in Iraq, the city experienced a period of prosperity and growth. It faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War , which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts . Impacted by the subsequent 2011–2013 insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world during the period. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare.

As capital of Iraq, Baghdad is the location of the seat of government, national institutions and government ministries and serves as headquarters to numerous companies. It generates 40% of Iraq's GDP. A major center of Islamic history , the city is home to numerous historic mosques , as well as churches, mandis and synagogues , highlighting the city's historical diversity. Baghdad is home to Mustansiriya University , one of the oldest universities, and Masjid al-Kādhimayn , which is visited every year by millions of Shi'ite pilgrims. The city is home to important cultural sites such as the National Museum of Iraq , the Iraqi National Library and the National Media Center . It is also known as the "City of Palaces", as it is home to well-known palaces.

Name [ edit ] The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed.

[ 4 ] The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.

[ 5 ] Arab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Middle Persian .

[ 4 ] They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was "bestowed by God".

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology, [ 4 ] which views the word as a Persian compound of bagh ( ) "god" and dād ( ) "given".

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In Old Persian the first element can be traced to boghu and is related to Indo-Iranian bhag and Slavic bog "god." [ 4 ] [ 9 ] A similar term in Middle Persian is the name Mithradāt ( Mehrdad in New Persian ), known in English by its borrowed Hellenistic form Mithridates , meaning "Given by Mithra " ( dāt is the more archaic form of dād , related to Sanskrit dāt , Latin dat and English donor ), [ 4 ] ultimately borrowed from Persian Mehrdad . There are a number of other locations whose names are compounds of the Middle Persian word bagh , including Baghlan and Bagram in Afghanistan, Baghshan in Iran itself, [ 10 ] and Baghdati in Georgia , which likely share the same etymological Iranic origins.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Other authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu ), and the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name of a place called Baghdatha ( בגדתא ).

[ 4 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.

[ 4 ] Another highly recommended view is that Baghdad is a reference to Bagh and Dad as in Dadan, Dedan, and Dad as in Hadad, Adad. Another view suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of "Baghdad" is derived from " Akkad ", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad ( 𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠 ) is pronounced " a-ga-dè KI " ("Agade") and its resemblance to "Baghdad" is compelling.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] It is argued that, throughout all the various spellings of the city's name, whether Baghdad [بغداد], Baghdadh [بغداذ], Baghdan [بغدان], Maghdad [مغداد], Maghdadh [مغداذ], or Maghdan [مغدان], the only phonetically definite segment of the name appears to be Aghda [ىَغْدَا], which could be equated with the pronunciation of the name Agade.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] When the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name "City of peace" (Arabic: مدینة السلام , romanized: Madīnat as-Salām ), which now refers to the Round City of Baghdad proper. By the 11th century, Baghdad became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

Christophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his "new city" at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced Sargon 's choice to found the original city of Akkad in the exact same location.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Baghdad For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Baghdad .

Foundation [ edit ] The Round City of Baghdad between 767 and 912 AD After the fall of the Umayyads, the victorious Abbasids sought a new capital.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] On 30 July 762, the Caliph Al-Mansur commissioned Baghdad's construction, guided by the Iranian Barmakids . He believed Baghdad was ideal for ruling the Islamic Empire. Historian al-Tabari recorded a prophecy from Christian monks about a leader named Miklas building a great city in the area, and Al-Mansur, who was once called Miklas, saw this as a good omen. He expressed deep affection for the site, declaring it would be the home of his dynasty.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The two designers who were hired by Al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht , a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah , a Jew from Khorasan , Iran .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] They determined the city's auspicious founding date under the sign of Leo the lion , symbolizing strength and expansion.

[ 28 ] Baghdad's strategic location along the Tigris and its abundant water supply contributed to its rapid growth. It was divided into three judicial districts: Round City ( Madinat al-Mansur ), al-Karkh ( al-Sharqiyya ), and Askar al-Mahdi. To prevent disturbances, Al-Mansur moved markets to al-Karkh. Over time, Baghdad became a hub for merchants and craftsmen. Officials called "Muhtasib" monitored trade to prevent fraud.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Baghdad surpassed Ctesiphon , the former Sassanid capital, located 30 km southeast. The ruins of Ctesiphon remain in Salman Pak , where Salman the Persian is believed to be buried.

[ 31 ] Ctesiphon itself had replaced Seleucia , which had earlier succeeded Babylon .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] According to the traveler Ibn Battuta , Baghdad was one of the largest cities, [ 34 ] not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbalis .

[ 35 ] Most residents were Hanbali Muslims. The city housed Abu Hanifa's grave , marked by a mosque and cell.

[ 36 ] Its ruler, Abu Said Bahadur Khan , was a Tatar who had embraced Islam.

[ 37 ] Baghdad was designed to symbolize Paradise as described in the Qur'an .

[ 38 ] It took four years (764–768) to build, with over 100,000 workers involved. Al-Mansur recruited engineers and artisans worldwide. Astrologers Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah advised starting construction under Leo, associated with fire, productivity, and expansion. Bricks for the city were 18 inches square, and Abu Hanifah supervised their production. A canal supplied water for drinking and construction. Marble was used extensively, including steps leading to the river.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 28 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The city's layout consisted of two large semicircles, with a 2 km-wide circular core known as the "Round City." It had parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. Unlike European cities of the time, Baghdad had a sanitation system , fountains , and public baths , with thousands of hammams enhancing hygiene. The mosque and guard headquarters stood at the center, though some central space's function remains unknown. Baghdad's circular design reflected ancient Near Eastern urban planning, similar to the Sasanian city of Gur and older Mesopotamian cities like Mari.

[ 41 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] While Tell Chuera and Tell al-Rawda also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in Bronze Age Syria .

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

Baghdad was lively, with attractions like cabarets, chess halls, live plays, concerts, and acrobatics.

[ 47 ] Storytelling flourished, with professional storytellers ( al-Qaskhun ) captivating crowds, inspiring the tales of Arabian Nights .

[ 48 ] The city had four walls named after major destinations— Kufa , Basra , Khurasan , and Syria ; their gates pointed in on these destinations.

[ 49 ] The gates were 2.4 km apart, with massive iron doors requiring several men to operate.

[ 50 ] The walls, up to 44 meters thick and 30 meters high, were reinforced with a second wall, towers, and a moat for added defense.

[ 51 ] On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights.

[ 44 ] [ 52 ] The Golden Gate Palace, home of the caliph, stood at Baghdad's center with a grand 48-meter green dome. Only the caliph could approach its esplanade on horseback. Nearby were officer residences and a guardhouse. After Caliph Al-Amin 's death in 813, the palace ceased to be the caliph's residence.

Center of learning (8th–9th centuries) [ edit ] Further information: Islamic Golden Age Courtyard of Mustansiriya madrasa , established in 1227, was one of the oldest universities in the world. Its building survived the Mongol invasion of 1258. The modern Mustansiriyah University was established in 1963.

Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce . The city flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of science , medicine , philosophy , and education , especially with the Abbasid translation movement began under the second caliph Al-Mansur and thrived under the seventh caliph Al-Ma'mun .

[ 53 ] Baytul-Hikmah or the "House of Wisdom" was among the most well known academies, [ 54 ] and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the 9th century.

[ citation needed ] Notable scholars based in Baghdad during this time include translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq , mathematician al-Khwarizmi , and philosopher Al-Kindi .

[ 54 ] Although Arabic was used as the language of science, the scholarship involved not only Arabs, but also Persians , Syriacs , [ 55 ] Nestorians , Jews , Arab Christians , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] and people from other ethnic and religious groups native to the region.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] These are considered among the fundamental elements that contributed to the flourishing of scholarship in the Medieval Islamic world.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Baghdad was also a significant center of Islamic religious learning, with Al-Jahiz contributing to the formation of Mu'tazili theology, as well as Al-Tabari culminating in the scholarship on the Quranic exegesis .

[ 53 ] Baghdad is likely to have been the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it tied with Córdoba .

[ 65 ] Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak.

[ 66 ] Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales, widely known as the Arabian Nights , are set in Baghdad during this period. It would surpass even Constantinople in prosperity and size.

[ 67 ] Khan Murjan , built in the 14th century as a caravanserai Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.

[ 68 ] Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al-Ma'mun , who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy.

[ 68 ] This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society.

[ 68 ] The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nezamiyeh was founded by the Persian Nizam al-Mulk , who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans.

[ 68 ] It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah madrasa , which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al-Mustansir , the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242.

[ 68 ] This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.

Stagnation and invasions (10th–16th centuries) [ edit ] Al-Khulafa mosque retains an Abbasid-era minaret Zumurrud Khatun Tomb in Baghdad (built in 1202 AD) By the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million [ 69 ] and 2 million.

[ 70 ] Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate , including relocations of the capital to Samarra (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945–1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055–1135). The Seljuks were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia that converted to the Sunni branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the Ghaznavids , taking over their land and in 1055, Tughril Beg , the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the Buyid dynasty of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.

[ 71 ] Baghdad was captured in 1394 , 1534 , 1623 and 1638 . The city has been sieged in 812 , 865 , 946 , 1157 , 1258 and in 1393 and 1401, by Tamerlane . In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh.

[ 72 ] Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i , al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil , Wāsit and Kufa . Soon after, [ 73 ] by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph.

[ 73 ] Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.

[ 74 ] Conquest of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258 CE On 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the Mongols led by Hulegu , a grandson of Genghis Khan ( Chingiz Khan ), during the siege of Baghdad .

[ 75 ] Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph Al-Musta'sim , and destroyed large sections of the city. The canals and dykes forming the city's irrigation system were also destroyed. During this time, in Baghdad, Christians and Shia were tolerated, while Sunnis were treated as enemies.

[ 76 ] The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate.

[ 77 ] It has been argued that this marked an end to the Islamic Golden Age and served a blow from which Islamic civilization never fully recovered.

[ 78 ] Timur sacked the city and spared almost no one At this point, Baghdad was ruled by the Ilkhanate , a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In August 1393, Baghdad was occupied by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur ("Tamerlane"), [ 79 ] by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz . Sultan Ahmad Jalayir fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan Barquq protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the Sarbadar prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern Baghdad, but he was driven out when Ahmad Jalayir returned.

In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by Timur, a Central Asian Turko-Mongol figure.

[ 80 ] When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads.

[ 81 ] Baghdad became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid (1400–1411), Turkic Kara Koyunlu (1411–1469), Turkic Ak Koyunlu (1469–1508), and the Iranian Safavid (1508–1534) dynasties.

Ottoman and Mamluks (16th–19th centuries) [ edit ] See also: Baghdad Eyalet , Baghdad Vilayet , and History of Baghdad (1831–1917) The Safavids took control of the city in 1509 under the leadership of Shah Ismail I. It remained under Safavid rule until the Ottomans seized it in 1535, but the Safavids regained control in 1624. A massacre occurred when the Shah's army entered the city. It remained under Safavid rule until 1639 when Sultan Murad IV recaptured it in 1638.

In 1534, Baghdad was captured by the Ottoman Empire .

[ 82 ] Under the Ottomans , Baghdad continued into a period of decline , partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids , which did not accept the Sunni control of the city.

Between 1623 and 1638 , it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands.

[ 83 ] Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague and cholera , [ 84 ] and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.

[ 85 ] The city became part of an eyalet and then a vilayet .

[ 86 ] For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East.

[ 87 ] The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century, under Mamluk government.

[ 87 ] Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by Ali Rıza Pasha in 1831.

[ 87 ] From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed Namık Pasha .

[ 87 ] The Nuttall Encyclopedia reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.

[ 87 ] The city's municipality was established in 1868, and Ibrahim al-Daftari was appointed its first mayor.

[ 88 ] The year 1869 is of great importance in the history of Baghdad in the Ottoman era, as it was the beginning of what can be considered a distinct era of the Ottoman eras, the foundations of which were laid by Governor Midhat Pasha , who implemented a number of reform systems and laws that the state legislated during the era of reforms and reconstruction, which was called the Tanzimat era.

[ 88 ] The overall importance of Baghdad to the Ottomans was that they made the headquarters of the Sixth Corps of the Ottoman Army in the city.

[ 88 ] By the 19th century, Baghdad emerged as a leading center for Jewish learning.

[ 89 ] The city had Jewish population of over 6,000 and had numerous yeshivas.

[ 89 ] The Jewish population has grown so rapidly that by 1884, there were 30,000 Jews in Baghdad and by 1900, around 50,000, comprising over a quarter of the city's total population.

[ 89 ] Large-scale Jewish immigration from Kurdistan to Baghdad continued throughout this period.

[ 89 ] By the mid-19th century, the religious infrastructure of Baghdad grew to include a large yeshiva which trained up to sixty rabbis at time.

[ 89 ] Religious scholarship flourished in Baghdad, which produced great rabbis, such as Joseph Hayyim ben Eliahu Mazal-Tov, known as the Ben Ish Chai (1834–1909) or Rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813–1889). During this time, Baghdadi Jews established a successful trade diaspora in China, India and Singapore.

[ 90 ] In 1920, a revolt erupted against the British rule in Iraq.

[ 91 ] The British forces retaliated by air bombing on Baghdad, which killed thousands of residents.

[ 91 ] In 1921, Baghdad became the capital of the Mandatory Iraq under the Mandate of Mesopotamia , with several architectural and planning projects commissioned to reinforce this administration.

[ 90 ] After receiving independence in 1932, the city became capital of the new Kingdom of Iraq .

[ 90 ] During this period, the substantial Jewish community (probably exceeding 100,000 people) comprised between a quarter and a third of the city's population.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] On 1 April 1941, members of the " Golden Square " and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani staged a coup in Baghdad and installed a pro- German and pro- Italian government to replace the pro-British government of Regent Abd al-Ilah .

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] On 31 May, after the resulting Anglo-Iraqi War , Gaylani and his government had fled, and the mayor of Baghdad surrendered to the British and Commonwealth forces.

[ 95 ] On 1–2 June, during the ensuing power vacuum , Jewish residents were attacked following rumors they had aided the British.

[ 96 ] In what became known as the Farhud , over 180 Jews were killed, 1,000 injured and hundreds of Jewish properties were ransacked.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Between 300 and 400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence.

[ 98 ] Between 1950 and 1951, Jews were targeted in series of bombings.

[ 99 ] According to Avi Shlaim , Israel was behind bombings , which is also believed by the majority of the Iraqis.

[ 99 ] Revolutionary soldiers in a street of Baghdad, 1958 The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950.

[ 100 ] A development plan came during the reign of King Faisal II .

[ 143 ] Sunni insurgents established their bases Mansour, Adhamiyah and Doura .

[ 143 ] Mansour district borders the Shi'ite populated Kadhimiyah and East Rasheed .

[ 143 ] Before 2003, it was home to wealthy Sunnis and Ba'athist officials.

[ 143 ] Hence, when the regime fell, it quickly became a stronghold for the Sunni insurgency.

[ 143 ] While Shia militias were based in Sadr City , Kadhimiyah , and West Rasheed, with Bab Al-Sharqi becoming stronghold for the Mahdi Army.

[ 143 ] Later, they also expanded into the surrounding districts of eastern Baghdad. 9 Nissan, Karadah, and Rusafa were dominated by Shias.

[ 150 ] Geography [ edit ] Al-Zawraa Park in Baghdad Baghdad as seen from the International Space Station The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the Tigris river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called " Risafa " and the Western half known as " Karkh ". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of quaternary alluvial origin due to periodic large flooding of the Tigris river. The Diyala river is a tributary of the Tigris, flowing southeast of the city and bordering its eastern suburbs.

Baghdad is 529.8 kilometres (329.2 mi) northwest of Basra , 402.9 kilometres (250.4 mi) south of Mosul , 366.8 kilometres (227.9 mi) south of Erbil and 103.8 kilometres (64.5 mi) northeast of Karbala .

[ 151 ] Located to the south is Mahmoudiyah , which serves as the gateway to Baghdad.

Panoramic view of the Tigris as it flows through Baghdad Climate [ edit ] Baghdad has a hot desert climate ( Köppen BWh ), featuring extremely hot, prolonged, dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wet, short winters. In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as 44 °C (111 °F) and accompanied by sunshine. Rainfall has been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded 1 mm (0.04 in).

[ 152 ] Even at night, temperatures in summer are seldom below 24 °C (75 °F). Baghdad's record highest temperature of 51.8 °C (125.2 °F) was reached on 28 July 2020.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] Humidity is under 50% in summer, due to Baghdad's distance from both the marshes in southern Iraq and the coasts of the Persian Gulf .

Dust storms from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Its winter temperatures are those of a hot desert climate . From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging 16 to 19 °C (61 to 66 °F), with highs possible above 21 °C (70 °F). Lows below freezing occur statistically a couple of times per year.

[ 155 ] Annual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November through March, averages approximately 150 mm (5.91 in), but has been as high as 338 mm (13.31 in) and as low as 37 mm (1.46 in).

[ 162 ] Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.

[ 162 ] Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities.

[ 162 ] The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.

[ 162 ] These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function.

[ 162 ] Beginning in April 2003, the U.S—controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these.

[ 162 ] The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses.

[ 162 ] The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.

[ 162 ] Each neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them.

[ 162 ] Once all 88 neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils.

[ 162 ] The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population.

[ 162 ] The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council.

[ 162 ] Later, the number of official neighborhoods were increased to 89.

[ 162 ] This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

[ 162 ] The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself.

[ 162 ] There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods ( Nahia ) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils ( Qada ).

[ 162 ] As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows: [ 162 ] Adhamiyah Karkh ( Green Zone ) [ 163 ] Karrada [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Kadhimiya [ 166 ] Mansour Sadr City (Thawra) [ 167 ] Al Rashid [ 168 ] Rusafa New Baghdad (Tisaa Nissan) (9 April) [ 169 ] The nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above. The following is a selection (rather than a complete list) of these neighborhoods: Al- Ghazaliya Al-A'amiriya Dora Karrada Al-Jadriya Al-Hebnaa Zayouna Al-Saydiya Al-Sa'adoon Al-Shu'ala Al-Mahmudiyah Bab Al-Moatham Al-Baya' Al-Za'franiya Hayy Ur Sha'ab Hayy Al-Jami'a Al-Adel Al Khadhraa Hayy Al-Jihad Hayy Al-A'amel Hayy Aoor Al-Hurriya Haydar-Khana Hayy Al-Shurtta Yarmouk Jesr Diyala Abu Disher Al-Maidan Raghiba Khatoun Arab Jibor Al-Fathel Al-Ubedy Al-Washash Al-Wazireya Bataween Notable streets [ edit ] Abu Nuwas Street Mutanabbi Street Haifa Street Hilla Road – Runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk (Baghdad) Caliphs Street – site of historical mosques and churches Al-Sa'doun Street – stretching from Liberation Square to Masbah Abu Nuwas Street – runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge Damascus Street – goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road Mutanabbi Street – A street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi Rabia Street 14 July Street ( Mosul Road ) Muthana al-Shaibani Street Bor Saeed (Port Said) Street Thawra Street Al-Qanat Street – runs through Baghdad north-south Al-Khat al-Sare'a – Mohammed al-Qasim (high speed lane) – runs through Baghdad, north–south Industry Street runs by the University of Technology – center of the computer trade in Baghdad Al Nidhal Street Al-Rasheed Street – city center Baghdad Al-Jumhuriya Street – city center Baghdad Falastin Street Tariq al-Muaskar – (Al-Rasheed Camp Road) Akhrot street Baghdad Airport Road [ 170 ] Demographics [ edit ] Baghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015.

[ 231 ] Planned Baghdad Metro [ edit ] Main article: Baghdad Metro The Baghdad Metro project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come to fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability.

[ 232 ] In 2019, it was reported that Korean Hyundai and French Alstom would be building the metro.

[ 233 ] However, the planned construction did not happen.

As of February 2024, the current plan consisted of fully electric and automated ( driverless ) trains running on an extensive railway network including an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80–140 km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.

[ 234 ] In July 2024, it was announced that an international consortium of German French, Spanish, and Turkish companies was awarded $17.5 billion contract to construct Baghdad's metro.

[ 235 ] The consortium includes Alstom, Systra , SNCF , Talgo , Deutsche Bank and SENER . The consortium was then to negotiate the technical, financial and operational details of the project which is now estimated to be completed in May 2029.

[ 247 ] However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War.

[ 247 ] The monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist Ismail Fatah Al Turk .

[ 247 ] Though these works symbolize the ruling entity.

[ 105 ] Neverthelsess, they have remained part of architectural legacy, which beautified Baghdad.

[ 105 ] Al-Kazimiyya Mosque Masjid Al-Kadhimain is a shrine that is located in the Kādhimayn suburb of Baghdad.

[ 187 ] [ 248 ] It contains the tombs of the seventh and ninth Twelver Shi'ite Imams , Musa al-Kadhim and Muhammad at-Taqi respectively, upon whom the title of Kādhimayn ("Two who swallow their anger") was bestowed.

[ 253 ] The Sabian–Mandaean Mandi of Baghdad is a Mandaen temple in al-Qadisiyyah.

[ 254 ] It is the main community center for Mandaeans in Iraq.

[ 254 ] Plans are underway to demolish and build a larger one to accommodate more worshippers.

[ 254 ] A cultural institute for Mandeans is also in Baghdad.

[ 255 ] The city is home to Baba Nanak Shrine , a sacred site in Sikhism.

It is considered a holy place and a place of pilgrimage by Baha'is according to their " Most Holy Book ".

[ 256 ] On 23 June 2013, the house was destroyed under unclear circumstances.

[ 204 ] Baghdad Zoo used to be the largest zoological park in the Middle East . Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived.

[ 257 ] This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food.

[ 257 ] Conservationist Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally.

[ 257 ] [ 258 ] Eventually Paul Bremer , Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the invasion, ordered protection for the zoo and enlisted U.S. engineers to help reopen the facility.

[ 257 ] Al-Zawraa Park is also part of the zoo, which is main urban park of the city.

Historically, the city had a vibrant modern culture and lifestyle.

[ 109 ] Famous Arab poets and singers such as Nizar Qabbani , Umm Kulthum , Fairuz , Salah Al-Hamdani , Ilham al-Madfai and others have performed for the city. The dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, The Arabic Language ). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late Middle Ages .
