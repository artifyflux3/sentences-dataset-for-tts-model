The title of battalion chief is usually synonymous with firefighting in the United States and Canada.

[ 1 ] A battalion chief is the lowest chief officer in a fire department's rank structure, above rank-and-file fire station officers and fire company officers. A battalion chief is in charge of a firefighting battalion, similar to a military battalion . A battalion consists of several fire stations and multiple fire companies. A battalion chief has command over each fire station's officers and each company or unit's officers, as well as the uniformed firefighters .

A battalion chief is usually under the command of a division chief, district chief, deputy chief, or assistant chief, etc who in turn reports to a chief of department , chief engineer, a shift commander, a tour commander or a fire commissioner or other personnel who are official employees.
