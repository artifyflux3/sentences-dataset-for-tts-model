Geography [ edit ] It is located 118 km (74 mi) south of El Rosario and 106 km (66 mi) north of the junction of Federal Highway 12 to Bahía de los Ángeles . It is accessible by Federal Highway 1 .

Economy [ edit ] Hotel Misíon Santa María - Cataviña.

The local economy is dependent on tourism , ranching (Rancho Santa Inés, on the outskirts of the town, is an ejido held in common by the residents), and a couple of private vendors selling gasoline from 55 gallon barrels.

Tourism [ edit ] Cataviña has a first-rate hotel developed by the National Fund for the Promotion of Tourism in the Mexican government.  Nearby are some cave paintings and a field of giant rocks, mixed with desert vegetation, which make the area a place visited for lovers of ecotourism.

Those planning a trip that includes Cataviña, need to make sure to purchase enough fuel to get from El Rosario to Villa Jesús María , to avoid buying gasoline from the private vendor just mentioned (the Pemex station in Cataviña is closed, permanently.)
