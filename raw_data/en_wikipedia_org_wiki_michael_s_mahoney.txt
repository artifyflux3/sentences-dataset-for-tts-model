Mahoney ) American historian of science Michael Sean Mahoney (June 30, 1939 – July 23, 2008) was a historian of science and technology .

Mahoney was born in New York City , and did his undergraduate studies at Harvard University , graduating in 1960. He earned a Ph.D. in history and history of science from Princeton University in 1967, and immediately took a position as an assistant professor there. He remained at Princeton for over 40 years, until his death in 2008.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A conference on the history of science and technology was held in his honor at Princeton in May 2009.

[ 4 ] Fermat biography [ edit ] Mahoney's biography of Pierre de Fermat received much critical attention [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] including a scathing review by André Weil in 1973.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] A second edition of Mahoney's book came out in 1994.
