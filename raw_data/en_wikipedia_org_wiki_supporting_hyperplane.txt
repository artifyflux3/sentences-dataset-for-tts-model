In geometry , a supporting hyperplane of a set S {\displaystyle S} in Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a hyperplane that has both of the following two properties: [ 1 ] S {\displaystyle S} is entirely contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by the hyperplane, S {\displaystyle S} has at least one boundary-point on the hyperplane.

Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the points within the hyperplane.

Supporting hyperplane theorem [ edit ] A convex set can have more than one supporting hyperplane at a given point on its boundary.

This theorem states that if S {\displaystyle S} is a convex set in the topological vector space X = R n , {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} ^{n},} and x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} is a point on the boundary of S , {\displaystyle S,} then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing x 0 .

{\displaystyle x_{0}.} If x ∗ ∗ ∈ ∈ X ∗ ∗ ∖ ∖ { 0 } {\displaystyle x^{*}\in X^{*}\backslash \{0\}} ( X ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle X^{*}} is the dual space of X {\displaystyle X} , x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle x^{*}} is a nonzero linear functional) such that x ∗ ∗ ( x 0 ) ≥ ≥ x ∗ ∗ ( x ) {\displaystyle x^{*}\left(x_{0}\right)\geq x^{*}(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ S {\displaystyle x\in S} , then H = { x ∈ ∈ X : x ∗ ∗ ( x ) = x ∗ ∗ ( x 0 ) } {\displaystyle H=\{x\in X:x^{*}(x)=x^{*}\left(x_{0}\right)\}} defines a supporting hyperplane.

[ 2 ] Conversely, if S {\displaystyle S} is a closed set with nonempty interior such that every point on the boundary has a supporting hyperplane, then S {\displaystyle S} is a convex set, and is the intersection of all its supporting closed half-spaces.

[ 2 ] The hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right. If the closed set S {\displaystyle S} is not convex, the statement of the theorem is not true at all points on the boundary of S , {\displaystyle S,} as illustrated in the third picture on the right.

The supporting hyperplanes of convex sets are also called tac-planes or tac-hyperplanes .

[ 3 ] The forward direction can be proved as a special case of the separating hyperplane theorem (see the page for the proof ). For the converse direction, Proof Define T {\displaystyle T} to be the intersection of all its supporting closed half-spaces. Clearly S ⊂ ⊂ T {\displaystyle S\subset T} . Now let y ∉ S {\displaystyle y\not \in S} , show y ∉ T {\displaystyle y\not \in T} .

Let x ∈ ∈ i n t ( S ) {\displaystyle x\in \mathrm {int} (S)} , and consider the line segment [ x , y ] {\displaystyle [x,y]} . Let t {\displaystyle t} be the largest number such that [ x , t ( y − − x ) + x ] {\displaystyle [x,t(y-x)+x]} is contained in S {\displaystyle S} . Then t ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle t\in (0,1)} .

Let b = t ( y − − x ) + x {\displaystyle b=t(y-x)+x} , then b ∈ ∈ ∂ ∂ S {\displaystyle b\in \partial S} . Draw a supporting hyperplane across b {\displaystyle b} . Let it be represented as a nonzero linear functional f : R n → → R {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } such that ∀ ∀ a ∈ ∈ T , f ( a ) ≥ ≥ f ( b ) {\displaystyle \forall a\in T,f(a)\geq f(b)} . Then since x ∈ ∈ i n t ( S ) {\displaystyle x\in \mathrm {int} (S)} , we have f ( x ) > f ( b ) {\displaystyle f(x)>f(b)} . Thus by f ( y ) − − f ( b ) 1 − − t = f ( b ) − − f ( x ) t − − 0 < 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {f(y)-f(b)}{1-t}}={\frac {f(b)-f(x)}{t-0}}<0} , we have f ( y ) < f ( b ) {\displaystyle f(y)<f(b)} , so y ∉ T {\displaystyle y\not \in T} .

See also [ edit ] A supporting hyperplane containing a given point on the boundary of S {\displaystyle S} may not exist if S {\displaystyle S} is not convex.
