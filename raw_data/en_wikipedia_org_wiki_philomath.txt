The term is from Greek philos ( φίλος ; "beloved", "loving", as in philosophy or philanthropy ) and manthanein , math- ( μανθάνειν , μαθ- ; "to learn", as in polymath ).

Philomathy is similar to, but distinguished from, philosophy in that -soph , the latter suffix, specifies " wisdom " or " knowledge ", rather than the process of acquisition thereof. Philomath is not synonymous with polymath, as a polymath is someone who possesses great and detailed knowledge and facts from a variety of disciplines, while a philomath is someone who greatly enjoys learning and studying.

Overview [ edit ] The shift in meaning for mathema is likely a result of the rapid categorization during the time of Plato and Aristotle of their mathemata in terms of education : arithmetic , geometry , astronomy , and music (the quadrivium ), which the Greeks found to create a "natural grouping" of mathematical (in the modern usage; " doctrina mathematica " in the ancient usage) precepts.

In a philosophical dialogue, King James penned the character Philomathes to debate on arguments of whether the ancient religious concepts of witchcraft should be punished in a politically fueled Christian society. The arguments King James poses through the character Epistemon are based on concepts of theological reasoning regarding society's belief, as his opponent, Philomathes, takes a philosophical stance on society's legal aspects but seeks to obtain the knowledge of Epistemon. This philosophical approach signified a philomath seeking to obtain greater knowledge through epistemology . The dialogue was used by King James to educate society on various concepts including the history and etymology of the subjects debated.
