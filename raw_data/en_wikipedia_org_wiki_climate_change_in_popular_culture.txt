[ edit ] Climate fiction (sometimes shortened to cli-fi) is literature that deals with climate change .

[ 36 ] Generally speculative in nature but inspired by climate science , works of climate fiction may take place in the world as we know it , in the near future , or in fictional worlds experiencing climate change. The genre frequently includes science fiction and dystopian or utopian themes , imagining potential futures based on research about the impacts of climate change and speculations about how humans may respond to these and the problem of climate change. Climate fiction typically involves anthropogenic climate change and other environmental issues as opposed to weather and disaster more generally. Technologies such as climate engineering or climate adaptation practices often feature prominently in works exploring their impacts on society.

The term "cli-fi" is generally credited to freelance news reporter and climate activist Dan Bloom, who coined it in either 2007 or 2008.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] References to "climate fiction" appear to have begun in the 2010s, although the term has also been retroactively applied to a number of works.
