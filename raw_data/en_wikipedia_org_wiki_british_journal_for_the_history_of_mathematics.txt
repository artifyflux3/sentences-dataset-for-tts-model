The BSHM is concerned with all periods and cultures, and with all aspects of mathematics.  It participates in the Joint Mathematical Council of the United Kingdom.

The Society's journal, the British Journal for the History of Mathematics, is published on behalf of BSHM by Taylor & Francis .

[ 1 ] Neumann Prize [ edit ] Not to be confused with John von Neumann Theory Prize .

The Neumann prize is awarded biennially by the BSHM for "a book in English (including books in translation) dealing with the history of mathematics and aimed at a broad audience." [ 2 ] The prize was named in honour of Peter M. Neumann , who was a longstanding supporter of and contributor to the society. It carries an award of £600.The previous winners are: 2023: Casanova's Lottery: The History of a Revolutionary Game of Chance , Stephen M.
