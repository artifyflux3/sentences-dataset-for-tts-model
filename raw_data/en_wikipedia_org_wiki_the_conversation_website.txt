[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Articles are written by academics and researchers under a Creative Commons license, allowing reuse without modification. Copyright terms for images are generally listed in the image caption and attribution.

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] Its model has been described as explanatory journalism .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Except in "exceptional circumstances", it only publishes articles by "academics employed by, or otherwise formally connected to, accredited institutions, including universities and accredited research bodies".

[ 7 ] : 8 The website was launched in Australia in March 2011.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The network has since expanded globally with a variety of local editions originating from around the world.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In September 2019, The Conversation reported a monthly online audience of 10.7 million users, and a combined reach of 40 million people when including republication.

[ 12 ] The site employed more than 150 full-time staff as of 2020.

[ 13 ] Each regional or national edition of The Conversation is an independent nonprofit or charity funded by various sources such as partnered universities and university systems , governments and other grant awarding bodies, corporate partners, and reader donations.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] History [ edit ] Launch [ edit ] The Conversation was co-founded by Andrew Jaspan and Jack Rejtman, [ 16 ] and launched in Australia in March 2011.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Jaspan first discussed the concept of The Conversation in 2009 with Glyn Davis , vice chancellor at the University of Melbourne . Jaspan wrote a report for the university communications department on the university's engagement with the public, envisioning the university as "a giant newsroom", with academics and researchers collaboratively providing expert, informed content that engaged with the news cycle and major current affairs issues.

[ 17 ] This vision became the blueprint for The Conversation .

Jaspan and Rejtman were provided support by Melbourne University in mid-2009, which allowed time to incubate the business model. By February 2010, they had developed their model, branding, and business identity that they launched to potential support partners through an Information Memorandum in February 2010.

[ 18 ] The founders secured $10m in funding from four universities ( Melbourne , Monash , Australian National University , University of Western Australia ), CSIRO , the Government of Victoria , the Government of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank .

[ 1 ] [ additional citation(s) needed ] Departure of Andrew Jaspan [ edit ] In March 2017, Andrew Jaspan resigned as executive director and editor, six months after being placed on enforced leave after complaints from senior staff in Melbourne about his management style and the group's global direction.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Management of the UK, U.S., and Africa offices also wrote a letter of no confidence to the Conversation Media Group asking that Jaspan not have an active role in the future.

[ 21 ] Content [ edit ] Articles are written by academic researchers in their respective areas of expertise.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] They either pitch topics or are specifically commissioned to write on a topic in which they are a subject-matter expert , including for articles about current events .

[ 15 ] [ 25 ] The Conversation 's core staff then edits these articles, ensuring a balance between reader accessibility and academic rigour.

[ 13 ] [ 23 ] Editors who work for the site frequently have past experience working for traditional news outlets.

[ 26 ] The original authors then review the edited version.

[ 9 ] [ 27 ] Topics include politics, society, health, science, and the environment .

[ 15 ] [ 28 ] Authors are required to disclose conflicts of interest.

[ 29 ] All articles are published under a Creative Commons Attribution/No derivatives licence.

[ 27 ] [ 30 ] Fact checking [ edit ] The site often publishes fact-checks produced by academics from major universities, then blind peer reviewed by another academic who comments on the accuracy of the fact check.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] In 2016, the fact-check unit of The Conversation became accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network , an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the U.S.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] The assessment criteria require non-partisanship , fairness, transparency of funding, sources, and methods, as well as a commitment to open and honest corrections.

[ 35 ] Technology [ edit ] The Conversation uses a custom publishing and content management system built in Ruby on Rails . This system enables authors and editors to collaborate on articles in real-time.

[ 25 ] [ 36 ] Articles link to author profiles—including disclosure statements—and personal dashboards showing authors' engagement with the public.

[ 37 ] [ 27 ] This is intended to encourage authors for the site to become more familiar with social media and their audience.

[ 38 ] International editions [ edit ] Each edition of The Conversation has a unique content set, editor-in-chief, and board of advisors.

[ 26 ] From its first Melbourne-headquartered Australian edition, The Conversation has expanded to a global network of eight editions, operating in multiple languages.

This has included expansions into the United Kingdom in 2013, [ 39 ] United States in 2014, [ 40 ] Africa and France in 2015, [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Canada, Indonesia, and New Zealand in 2017,.

[ 28 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Spain in 2018, [ 45 ] Europe and Brasil in 2024.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] The website also has an international staff.

[ 11 ] As of 2018, 36% of its readership was in Australia, 29% was in the United States, 7% in the United Kingdom, 4% in Canada, and 24% elsewhere.
