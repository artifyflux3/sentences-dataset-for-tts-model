He is spoken of only by Stephanus of Byzantium , from whom we learn that he was a native of Methymna in Lesbos .

Several other persons of this name, concerning whom nothing is known beyond what is contained in the passages where they occur, are mentioned by Thucydides (i. Ill), Pausanias (x. 16. § 4), Aelian (V. H. i. 25), Lucian (Timon, 7), and by Anyte in the Greek Anthology (vi. 123.).
