For the polylogarithm denoted by Li s ( z ), see Polylogarithm .

Plot of the absolute value of the logarithmic integral function li(z) in the complex plane from -2-2i to 2+2i with colors showing the argument (the angle around the complex plane) In mathematics , the logarithmic integral function or integral logarithm li( x ) is a special function . It is relevant in problems of physics and has number theoretic significance. In particular, according to the prime number theorem , it is a very good approximation to the prime-counting function , which is defined as the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given value x .

Logarithmic integral function plot Integral representation [ edit ] The logarithmic integral has an integral representation defined for all positive real numbers x ≠ 1 by the definite integral li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 0 x d t ln ⁡ ⁡ t .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)=\int _{0}^{x}{\frac {dt}{\ln t}}.} Here, ln denotes the natural logarithm . The function 1/(ln t ) has a singularity at t = 1 , and the integral for x > 1 is interpreted as a Cauchy principal value , li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = lim ε ε → → 0 + ( ∫ ∫ 0 1 − − ε ε d t ln ⁡ ⁡ t + ∫ ∫ 1 + ε ε x d t ln ⁡ ⁡ t ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)=\lim _{\varepsilon \to 0+}\left(\int _{0}^{1-\varepsilon }{\frac {dt}{\ln t}}+\int _{1+\varepsilon }^{x}{\frac {dt}{\ln t}}\right).} However, the logarithmic integral can also be taken to be a meromorphic complex-valued function in the complex domain. In this case it is multi-valued with branch points at 0 and 1, and the values between 0 and 1 defined by the above integral are not compatible with the values beyond 1. The complex function is shown in the figure above. The values on the real axis beyond 1 are the same as defined above, but the values between 0 and 1 are offset by iπ so that the absolute value at 0 is π rather than zero. The complex function is also defined (but multi-valued) for numbers with negative real part, but on the negative real axis the values are not real.

Offset logarithmic integral [ edit ] The offset logarithmic integral or Eulerian logarithmic integral is defined as Li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 2 x d t ln ⁡ ⁡ t = li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − li ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Li} (x)=\int _{2}^{x}{\frac {dt}{\ln t}}=\operatorname {li} (x)-\operatorname {li} (2).} As such, the integral representation has the advantage of avoiding the singularity in the domain of integration.

Equivalently, li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 0 x d t ln ⁡ ⁡ t = Li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + li ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)=\int _{0}^{x}{\frac {dt}{\ln t}}=\operatorname {Li} (x)+\operatorname {li} (2).} Special values [ edit ] The function li( x ) has a single positive zero; it occurs at x ≈ 1.45136 92348 83381 05028 39684 85892 02744 94930...

OEIS : A070769 ; this number is known as the Ramanujan–Soldner constant .

li ⁡ ⁡ ( Li − − 1 ( 0 ) ) = li ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} ({\text{Li}}^{-1}(0))={\text{li}}(2)} ≈ 1.045163 780117 492784 844588 889194 613136 522615 578151...

OEIS : A069284 This is − − ( Γ Γ ( 0 , − − ln ⁡ ⁡ 2 ) + i π π ) {\displaystyle -(\Gamma (0,-\ln 2)+i\,\pi )} where Γ Γ ( a , x ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (a,x)} is the incomplete gamma function . It must be understood as the Cauchy principal value of the function.

Series representation [ edit ] The function li( x ) is related to the exponential integral Ei( x ) via the equation li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = Ei ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) , {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)={\hbox{Ei}}(\ln x),} which is valid for x > 0. This identity provides a series representation of li( x ) as li ⁡ ⁡ ( e u ) = Ei ( u ) = γ γ + ln ⁡ ⁡ | u | + ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ u n n ⋅ ⋅ n !

for u ≠ ≠ 0 , {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (e^{u})={\hbox{Ei}}(u)=\gamma +\ln |u|+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{u^{n} \over n\cdot n!}\quad {\text{ for }}u\neq 0\,,} where γ ≈ 0.57721 56649 01532 ...

OEIS : A001620 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant . For the complex function the formula is li ⁡ ⁡ ( e u ) = Ei ( u ) = γ γ + ln ⁡ ⁡ u + ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ u n n ⋅ ⋅ n !

for u ≠ ≠ 0 , {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (e^{u})={\hbox{Ei}}(u)=\gamma +\ln u+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{u^{n} \over n\cdot n!}\quad {\text{ for }}u\neq 0\,,} (without taking the absolute value of u).
A more rapidly convergent series by Ramanujan [ 1 ] is li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = γ γ + ln ⁡ ⁡ | ln ⁡ ⁡ x | + x ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ( ( − − 1 ) n − − 1 ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) n n !

2 n − − 1 ∑ ∑ k = 0 ⌊ ⌊ ( n − − 1 ) / 2 ⌋ ⌋ 1 2 k + 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)=\gamma +\ln |\ln x|+{\sqrt {x}}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left({\frac {(-1)^{n-1}(\ln x)^{n}}{n!\,2^{n-1}}}\sum _{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2\rfloor }{\frac {1}{2k+1}}\right).} Again, for the meromorphic complex function the term ln ⁡ ⁡ | ln ⁡ ⁡ u | {\displaystyle \ln |\ln u|} must be replaced by ln ⁡ ⁡ ln ⁡ ⁡ u .

{\displaystyle \ln \ln u.} Asymptotic expansion [ edit ] The asymptotic behavior both for x → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x\to \infty } and for x → → 0 + {\displaystyle x\to 0^{+}} is li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) = O ( x ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)=O\left({\frac {x}{\ln x}}\right).} where O {\displaystyle O} is the big O notation . The full asymptotic expansion is li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ∼ ∼ x ln ⁡ ⁡ x ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ k !

( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) k {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)\sim {\frac {x}{\ln x}}\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {k!}{(\ln x)^{k}}}} or li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) x / ln ⁡ ⁡ x ∼ ∼ 1 + 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x + 2 ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 + 6 ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) 3 + ⋯ ⋯ .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\operatorname {li} (x)}{x/\ln x}}\sim 1+{\frac {1}{\ln x}}+{\frac {2}{(\ln x)^{2}}}+{\frac {6}{(\ln x)^{3}}}+\cdots .} This gives the following more accurate asymptotic behaviour: li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − x ln ⁡ ⁡ x = O ( x ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)-{\frac {x}{\ln x}}=O\left({\frac {x}{(\ln x)^{2}}}\right).} As an asymptotic expansion, this series is not convergent : it is a reasonable approximation only if the series is truncated at a finite number of terms, and only large values of x are employed. This expansion follows directly from the asymptotic expansion for the exponential integral .

This implies e.g. that we can bracket li as: 1 + 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x < li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ln ⁡ ⁡ x x < 1 + 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x + 3 ( ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 {\displaystyle 1+{\frac {1}{\ln x}}<\operatorname {li} (x){\frac {\ln x}{x}}<1+{\frac {1}{\ln x}}+{\frac {3}{(\ln x)^{2}}}} for all ln ⁡ ⁡ x ≥ ≥ 11 {\displaystyle \ln x\geq 11} .

Number theoretic significance [ edit ] The logarithmic integral is important in number theory , appearing in estimates of the number of prime numbers less than a given value. For example, the prime number theorem states that: π π ( x ) ∼ ∼ li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle \pi (x)\sim \operatorname {li} (x)} where π π ( x ) {\displaystyle \pi (x)} denotes the number of primes smaller than or equal to x {\displaystyle x} .

Assuming the Riemann hypothesis , we get the even stronger: [ 2 ] | li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − π π ( x ) | = O ( x log ⁡ ⁡ x ) {\displaystyle |\operatorname {li} (x)-\pi (x)|=O({\sqrt {x}}\log x)} In fact, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that: | li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) − − π π ( x ) | = O ( x 1 / 2 + a ) {\displaystyle |\operatorname {li} (x)-\pi (x)|=O(x^{1/2+a})} for any a > 0 {\displaystyle a>0} .

For small x {\displaystyle x} , li ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) > π π ( x ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {li} (x)>\pi (x)} but the difference changes sign an infinite number of times as x {\displaystyle x} increases, and the first time that this happens is somewhere between 10 19 and 1.4 × 10 316 .
