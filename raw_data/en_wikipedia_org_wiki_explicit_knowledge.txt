Explicit knowledge (also expressive knowledge ) [ 1 ] is knowledge that can be readily articulated, conceptualized , codified, formalized , stored and accessed.

[ 2 ] It can be expressed in formal and systematical language and shared in the form of data, scientific formulae, specifications, manuals and such like.

[ 3 ] It is easily codifiable and thus transmittable without loss of integrity once the syntactical rules required for deciphering it are known.

[ 4 ] Most forms of explicit knowledge can be stored in certain media . Explicit knowledge is often seen as complementary to tacit knowledge .

[ 5 ] Explicit knowledge is often seen as easier to formalize compared to tacit knowledge , but both are necessary for knowledge creation. Nonaka and Takeuchi introduce the SECI model as a way for knowledge creation. The SECI model involves four stages where explicit and tacit knowledge interact with each other in a spiral manner. The four stages are: Socialization , from tacit to tacit knowledge Externalization, from tacit to explicit knowledge Combination, from explicit to explicit knowledge Internalization, from explicit to tacit knowledge.

[ 5 ] Examples [ edit ] The information contained in encyclopedias and textbooks are good examples of explicit knowledge, specifically declarative knowledge . The most common forms of explicit knowledge are manuals, documents, procedures, and how-to videos. Knowledge also can be audio-visual. Engineering works and product design can be seen as other forms of explicit knowledge where human skills, motives and knowledge are externalized.

In the scholarly literature , papers presenting an up-to-date "systemization of knowledge" (SoK) on a particular area of research are valuable resources for PhD students.
