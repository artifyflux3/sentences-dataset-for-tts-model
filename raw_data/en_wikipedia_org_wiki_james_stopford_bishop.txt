[ 2 ] He was born in London , son of Joseph Stopford, a captain in the English Army, and Elizabeth Boate, widow of Richard Brooking. His father was a younger son of James Stopford, a soldier who fought in Ireland under Oliver Cromwell , settled in County  Meath and accumulated great wealth. The senior branch of the Stopford family was given the title Earl of Courtown .

The younger James attended school in Wexford and Trinity College, Dublin , where he took his degree in 1715. He was a fellow of Trinity College from 1717 to 1727. He became a close friend of Jonathan Swift (his cousin  Dorothea "Dolly" Stopford, widow of the fourth Earl of Meath , was one of Swift's closest friends). Swift admired his modesty and learning, and introduced him to other leading writers of the day like Alexander Pope .
