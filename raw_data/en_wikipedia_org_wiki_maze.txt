The word is used to refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler non-branching ("unicursal") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal. The term " labyrinth " is generally synonymous with "maze", but can also connote specifically a unicursal pattern.

[ 1 ] The pathways and walls in a maze are typically fixed, but puzzles in which the walls and paths can change during the game are also categorised as mazes or tour puzzles.

Construction [ edit ] Mazes have been built with a variety of materials.  Some are relatively permanent, like hedges , turf , walls, rooms, tiles, and paving stones or bricks.

[ 2 ] Others are deliberately transitory, like corn stalks , straw bales , books,  snow, [ 3 ] or in fields of crops such as corn or maize . Maize mazes can be very large; they are usually kept only for one growing season, so they can be different each year, and are promoted as seasonal tourist attractions .

[ 4 ] Indoors, mirror mazes are another form of maze, in which many of the apparent pathways are imaginary routes seen through multiple reflections in mirrors. Another type of maze consists of a set of rooms linked by doors (so a passageway is just another room in this definition). Players enter at one spot, and exit at another, or the idea may be to reach a certain spot in the maze. Mazes can also be printed or drawn on paper to be followed by a pencil or fingertip.

A small maze with one entrance and one exit.

Generation [ edit ] Main article: Maze generation algorithm Maze generation is the act of designing the layout of passages and walls within a maze. There are many different approaches to generating mazes, with various maze generation algorithms for building them, either by hand or automatically by computer .

There are two main mechanisms used to generate mazes. In "carving passages", one marks out the network of available routes. In building a maze by "adding walls", one lays out a set of obstructions within an open area.

Solution [ edit ] Main article: Maze solving algorithm Maze solving is the act of finding a route through the maze from the start to finish. Some maze solving methods are designed to be used inside the maze by a traveler with no prior knowledge of the maze, whereas others are designed to be used by a person or computer program that can see the whole maze at once.

The mathematician Leonhard Euler was one of the first to analyze plane mazes mathematically, and in doing so made the first significant contributions to the branch of mathematics known as topology .

[ 5 ] Mazes containing no loops are known as "standard", or "perfect" mazes, and are equivalent to a tree in graph theory. Thus many maze solving algorithms are closely related to graph theory . Intuitively, if one pulled and stretched out the paths in the maze in the proper way, the result could be made to resemble a tree.

[ 6 ] Psychology experiments [ edit ] Mazes are often used in psychology experiments to study spatial navigation and learning . Such experiments typically use rats or mice . Examples are: Barnes maze Morris water maze Oasis maze Radial arm maze Elevated plus maze T-maze Types [ edit ] A fractal maze (top) with 3 iterations (left) and a solution (right) Ball-in-a-maze puzzles Dexterity puzzles which involve navigating a ball through a maze or labyrinth.

Fractal maze A maze containing holes inside which the maze is indefinitely repeated at a smaller scale.

[ 7 ] Hamilton maze A maze in which the goal is to find the unique Hamiltonian cycle .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Logic mazes These are like standard mazes except they use rules other than "don't cross the lines" to restrict motion.

Picture maze A standard maze that forms a picture when solved.

Turf mazes and mizmazes A pattern like a long rope folded up, without any junctions or crossings.

Gallery [ edit ] Standard maze: Find a path from and back to the star.

Circular maze type: Find a route to the centre of the maze.

Loops and traps maze: Follow the arrows from and back to the star Block maze: Fill in four blocks to make a road connecting the stars. No diagonals.

Number maze: Begin and end at the star. Using the number in your space, jump that number of blocks in a straight line to a new space. No diagonals.

[ 56 ] Caribbean [ edit ] Cuba [ edit ] The colonial city of Camagüey , Cuba, founded in 1528, layout resembles a real maze, with narrow, short streets always turning in one direction or another.

The player must escape monsters, outrace an opponent, or navigate the maze within a time limit. After the release of Namco 's Pac-Man in 1980, many maze games followed its conventions of completing a level by traversing all paths and a way of temporarily turning the tables on pursuers.

Television [ edit ] Both Nubeluz and American Gladiators , from Peru and the United States respectively, featured a giant life-size maze used in competition. The object on both programs was for the contestants to find their way from the entrance to the exit as quickly as possible. On Nubeluz , the contestants took turns running through the maze and had a maximum of 1 minute to reach the exit; [ 58 ] on American Gladiators , both contestants ran through the maze simultaneously and were given 45 seconds to find the correct solution.

[ 59 ] The giant maze was part of the game rotation on both programs concurrently, and was also retired from both programs simultaneously.

The Shining [ edit ] The film adaptation of Stephen King 's 1977 novel, The Shining (1980), includes a scene featuring Jack Torrance and Danny Torrance in a  hedge maze.
