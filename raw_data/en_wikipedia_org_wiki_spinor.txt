A spinor visualized as a vector pointing along the [Möbius band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_band "Möbius band"), exhibiting a sign inversion when the circle (the "physical system") is continuously rotated through a full turn of 360°.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-1)

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **spinors** (pronounced "spinner"[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] IPA ) are elements of a [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers")[vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") that can be associated with [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-2) A spinor transforms linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a slight ([infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_transformation "Infinitesimal transformation")) rotation,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-3) but unlike [geometric vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") and [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), a spinor transforms to its negative when the space rotates through 360° (see picture). It takes a rotation of 720° for a spinor to go back to its original state. This property characterizes spinors: spinors can be viewed as the "square roots" of vectors (although this is inaccurate and may be misleading; they are better viewed as "square roots" of [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle") – in the case of the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") bundle of the [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle"), they thus become "square roots" of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form")).

It is also possible to associate a substantially similar notion of spinor to [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), in which case the [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") play the role of rotations. Spinors were introduced in geometry by [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") in 1913.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-4)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-6) In the 1920s physicists discovered that spinors are essential to describe the [intrinsic angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_angular_momentum "Intrinsic angular momentum"), or "spin", of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and other subatomic particles.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-7)

Spinors are characterized by the specific way in which they behave under rotations. They change in different ways depending not just on the overall final rotation, but the details of how that rotation was achieved (by a continuous path in the [rotation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group "Rotation group")). There are two topologically distinguishable classes ([homotopy classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_class "Homotopy class")) of paths through rotations that result in the same overall rotation, as illustrated by the [belt trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_trick "Belt trick") puzzle. These two inequivalent classes yield spinor transformations of opposite sign. The [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") is the group of all rotations keeping track of the class.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-8) It doubly covers the rotation group, since each rotation can be obtained in two inequivalent ways as the endpoint of a path. The space of spinors by definition is equipped with a (complex) [linear representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_representation "Linear representation") of the spin group, meaning that elements of the spin group [act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") as linear transformations on the space of spinors, in a way that genuinely depends on the homotopy class.[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-9) In mathematical terms, spinors are described by a double-valued [projective representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation "Projective representation") of the rotation group [SO(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(3) "SO(3)").

Although spinors can be defined purely as elements of a representation space of the spin group (or its [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") of infinitesimal rotations), they are typically defined as elements of a vector space that carries a linear representation of the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra"). The Clifford algebra is an [associative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") that can be constructed from Euclidean space and its inner product in a basis-independent way. Both the spin group and its Lie algebra are embedded inside the Clifford algebra in a natural way, and in applications the Clifford algebra is often the easiest to work with.[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-10) A Clifford space operates on a spinor space, and the elements of a spinor space are spinors.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-11) After choosing an [orthonormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormality "Orthonormality") basis of Euclidean space, a representation of the Clifford algebra is generated by [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices"), matrices that satisfy a set of canonical anti-commutation relations. The spinors are the [column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vectors "Column vectors") on which these matrices act. In three Euclidean dimensions, for instance, the [Pauli spin matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_spin_matrices "Pauli spin matrices") are a set of gamma matrices,[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-12) and the two-component complex column vectors on which these matrices act are spinors. However, the particular matrix representation of the Clifford algebra, hence what precisely constitutes a "column vector" (or spinor), involves the choice of basis and gamma matrices in an essential way. As a representation of the spin group, this realization of spinors as (complex[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-13)) column vectors will either be [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representation "Irreducible representation") if the dimension is odd, or it will decompose into a pair of so-called "half-spin" or Weyl representations if the dimension is even.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-14)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Belt_trick_2.gif/250px-Belt_trick_2.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Belt_trick_2.gif)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Belt_trick_1.gif/250px-Belt_trick_1.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Belt_trick_1.gif)

A gradual rotation can be visualized as a ribbon in space.[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-15) Two gradual rotations with different classes, one through 360° and one through 720° are illustrated here in the [belt trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_trick "Belt trick") puzzle. A solution of the puzzle is a continuous manipulation of the belt, fixing the endpoints, that untwists it. This is impossible with the 360° rotation, but possible with the 720° rotation. A solution, shown in the second animation, gives an explicit [homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy "Homotopy") in the rotation group between the 720° rotation and the 0° identity rotation.

An object attached to belts or strings can spin continuously without becoming tangled. Notice that after the cube completes a 360° rotation, the spiral is reversed from its initial configuration. The belts return to their original configuration after spinning a full 720°.

A more extreme example demonstrating that this works with any number of strings. In the limit, a piece of solid continuous space can rotate in place like this without tearing or intersecting itself

What characterizes spinors and distinguishes them from [geometric vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_vector "Geometric vector") and other tensors is subtle. Consider applying a rotation to the coordinates of a system. No object in the system itself has moved, only the coordinates have, so there will always be a compensating change in those coordinate values when applied to any object of the system. Geometrical vectors, for example, have components that will undergo _the same_ rotation as the coordinates. More broadly, any [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") associated with the system (for instance, the [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor "Cauchy stress tensor") of some medium) also has coordinate descriptions that adjust to compensate for changes to the coordinate system itself.

Spinors do not appear at this level of the description of a physical system, when one is concerned only with the properties of a single isolated rotation of the coordinates. Rather, spinors appear when we imagine that instead of a single rotation, the coordinate system is gradually ([continuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function")) rotated between some initial and final configuration. For any of the familiar and intuitive ("tensorial") quantities associated with the system, the transformation law does not depend on the precise details of how the coordinates arrived at their final configuration. Spinors, on the other hand, are constructed in such a way that makes them _sensitive_ to how the gradual rotation of the coordinates arrived there: They exhibit path-dependence. It turns out that, for any final configuration of the coordinates, there are actually two ("[topologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology")") inequivalent _gradual_ (continuous) rotations of the coordinate system that result in this same configuration. This ambiguity is called the [homotopy class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_class "Homotopy class") of the gradual rotation. The [belt trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_trick "Belt trick") (shown, in which both ends of the rotated object are physically tethered to an external reference) demonstrates two different rotations, one through an angle of 2 π and the other through an angle of 4 π, having the same final configurations but different classes. Spinors actually exhibit a sign-reversal that genuinely depends on this homotopy class. This distinguishes them from vectors and other tensors, none of which can feel the class.

Spinors can be exhibited as concrete objects using a choice of [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"). In three Euclidean dimensions, for instance, spinors can be constructed by making a choice of [Pauli spin matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_spin_matrices "Pauli spin matrices") corresponding to ([angular momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator "Angular momentum operator") about) the three coordinate axes. These are 2×2 matrices with [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") entries, and the two-component complex [column vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector "Column vector") on which these matrices act by [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") are the spinors. In this case, the spin group is isomorphic to the group of 2×2 [unitary matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix "Unitary matrix") with [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") one, which naturally sits inside the matrix algebra. This group acts by conjugation on the real vector space spanned by the Pauli matrices themselves,[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-16) realizing it as a group of rotations among them,[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-18) but it also acts on the column vectors (that is, the spinors).

More generally, a Clifford algebra can be constructed from any vector space _V_ equipped with a (nondegenerate) [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form"), such as [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") with its standard dot product or [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") with its standard Lorentz metric. The [space of spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") is the space of column vectors with ![Image 4: {\displaystyle 2^{\lfloor \dim V/2\rfloor }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d634497e612359dce87a5d6afcfb052592d556d2) components. The orthogonal Lie algebra (i.e., the infinitesimal "rotations") and the spin group associated to the quadratic form are both (canonically) contained in the Clifford algebra, so every Clifford algebra representation also defines a representation of the Lie algebra and the spin group.[[o]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-19) Depending on the dimension and [metric signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature "Metric signature"), this realization of spinors as column vectors may be [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representation "Irreducible representation") or it may decompose into a pair of so-called "half-spin" or Weyl representations.[[p]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-20) When the vector space _V_ is four-dimensional, the algebra is described by the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices").

Mathematical definition
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Mathematical definition")]

The space of spinors is formally defined as the [fundamental representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_representation "Fundamental representation") of the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra"). (This may or may not decompose into irreducible representations.) The space of spinors may also be defined as a [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation") of the [orthogonal Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Lie_algebra "Orthogonal Lie algebra"). These spin representations are also characterized as the finite-dimensional projective representations of the special orthogonal group that do not factor through linear representations. Equivalently, a spinor is an element of a finite-dimensional [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") of the [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") on which the [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_a_group "Center of a group") acts non-trivially.

There are essentially two frameworks for viewing the notion of a spinor: the _representation theoretic point of view_ and the _geometric point of view_.

#### Representation theoretic point of view

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Representation theoretic point of view")]

From a [representation theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory") point of view, one knows beforehand that there are some representations of the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") of the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") that cannot be formed by the usual tensor constructions. These missing representations are then labeled the **[spin representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation")**, and their constituents _spinors_. From this view, a spinor must belong to a [representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") of the [double cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space "Covering space") of the [rotation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group")SO(_n_,![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)), or more generally of a double cover of the [generalized special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_special_orthogonal_group "Generalized special orthogonal group")SO+(_p_, _q_, ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)) on spaces with a [metric signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature "Metric signature") of (_p_, _q_). These double covers are [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_groups "Lie groups"), called the [spin groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group")Spin(_n_) or Spin(_p_, _q_). All the properties of spinors, and their applications and derived objects, are manifested first in the spin group. Representations of the double covers of these groups yield double-valued [projective representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_representation "Projective representation") of the groups themselves. (This means that the action of a particular rotation on vectors in the quantum Hilbert space is only defined up to a sign.)

In summary, given a representation specified by the data ![Image 7: {\displaystyle (V,{\text{Spin}}(p,q),\rho )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fef5252f27eb56775a4fc44f962d43c519a46555) where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) is a vector space over ![Image 9: {\displaystyle K=\mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6419d3aa99701ca996737b17a5e1174d53e6c9e) or ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) and ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64) is a homomorphism ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \rho :{\text{Spin}}(p,q)\rightarrow {\text{GL}}(V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7fd02e4046a42a4f4c04148716c17968ba4ac25), a **spinor** is an element of the vector space ![Image 13: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845).

#### Geometric point of view

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Geometric point of view")]

From a geometrical point of view, one can explicitly construct the spinors and then examine how they behave under the action of the relevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a concrete and elementary description of what a spinor is. However, such a description becomes unwieldy when complicated properties of the spinors, such as [Fierz identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fierz_identity "Fierz identity"), are needed.

The language of [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-21) (sometimes called [geometric algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra")) provides a complete picture of the spin representations of all the spin groups, and the various relationships between those representations, via the [classification of Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Clifford_algebras "Classification of Clifford algebras"). It largely removes the need for _ad hoc_ constructions.

In detail, let _V_ be a finite-dimensional complex vector space with nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form _g_. The Clifford algebra Cℓ(_V_, _g_) is the algebra generated by _V_ along with the anticommutation relation _xy_ + _yx_ = 2 _g_(_x_, _y_). It is an abstract version of the algebra generated by the [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices") or [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices"). If _V_ = ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258), with the standard form _g_(_x_, _y_) = _x_ T _y_ = _x_ 1 _y_ 1 + ... + _x_ _n_ _y_ _n_ we denote the Clifford algebra by Cℓ _n_(![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)). Since by the choice of an orthonormal basis every complex vector space with non-degenerate form is isomorphic to this standard example, this notation is abused more generally if dim![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)(_V_) = _n_. If _n_ = 2 _k_ is even, Cℓ _n_(![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) is isomorphic as an algebra (in a non-unique way) to the algebra Mat(2 _k_, ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) of 2 _k_ × 2 _k_ complex matrices (by the [Artin–Wedderburn theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin%E2%80%93Wedderburn_theorem "Artin–Wedderburn theorem") and the easy to prove fact that the Clifford algebra is [central simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_simple_algebra "Central simple algebra")). If _n_ = 2 _k_ + 1 is odd, Cℓ 2 _k_+1(![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) is isomorphic to the algebra Mat(2 _k_, ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) ⊕ Mat(2 _k_, ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) of two copies of the 2 _k_ × 2 _k_ complex matrices. Therefore, in either case Cℓ(_V_, _g_) has a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible representation (also called simple [Clifford module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_module "Clifford module")), commonly denoted by Δ, of dimension 2[_n_/2]. Since the Lie algebra **so**(_V_, _g_) is embedded as a Lie subalgebra in Cℓ(_V_, _g_) equipped with the Clifford algebra [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator") as Lie bracket, the space Δ is also a Lie algebra representation of **so**(_V_, _g_) called a [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation"). If _n_ is odd, this Lie algebra representation is irreducible. If _n_ is even, it splits further[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] into two irreducible representations Δ = Δ+ ⊕ Δ− called the Weyl or _half-spin representations_.

Irreducible representations over the reals in the case when _V_ is a real vector space are much more intricate, and the reader is referred to the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra#Spinors "Clifford algebra") article for more details.

[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Spin_representations_do_not_lift.svg/250px-Spin_representations_do_not_lift.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spin_representations_do_not_lift.svg)

The spin representation Δ is a vector space equipped with a representation of the spin group that does not factor through a representation of the (special) orthogonal group. The vertical arrows depict a [short exact sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_exact_sequence "Short exact sequence").

Spinors form a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), usually over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers"), equipped with a linear [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") of the [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") that does not factor through a representation of the group of rotations (see diagram). The spin group is the [group of rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group") keeping track of the homotopy class. Spinors are needed to encode basic information about the topology of the group of rotations because that group is not [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected"), but the simply connected spin group is its [double cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_covering_group "Double covering group"). So for every rotation there are two elements of the spin group that represent it. [Geometric vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_vector "Geometric vector") and other [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") cannot feel the difference between these two elements, but they produce _opposite_ signs when they affect any spinor under the representation. Thinking of the elements of the spin group as [homotopy classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_classes "Homotopy classes") of one-parameter families of rotations, each rotation is represented by two distinct homotopy classes of paths to the identity. If a one-parameter family of rotations is visualized as a ribbon in space, with the arc length parameter of that ribbon being the parameter (its tangent, normal, binormal frame actually gives the rotation), then these two distinct homotopy classes are visualized in the two states of the [belt trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_trick "Belt trick") puzzle (above). The space of spinors is an auxiliary vector space that can be constructed explicitly in coordinates, but ultimately only exists up to isomorphism in that there is no "natural" construction of them that does not rely on arbitrary choices such as coordinate systems. A notion of spinors can be associated, as such an auxiliary mathematical object, with any vector space equipped with a [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form "Quadratic form") such as [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") with its standard [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"), or [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") with its [Lorentz metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_metric "Lorentz metric"). In the latter case, the "rotations" include the [Lorentz boosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_boost "Lorentz boost"), but otherwise the theory is substantially similar.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Spinor fields in physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Spinor fields in physics")]

The constructions given above, in terms of Clifford algebra or representation theory, can be thought of as defining spinors as geometric objects in zero-dimensional [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time"). To obtain the spinors of physics, such as the [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor "Dirac spinor"), one extends the construction to obtain a [spin structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure "Spin structure") on 4-dimensional space-time ([Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space")). Effectively, one starts with the [tangent manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_manifold "Tangent manifold") of space-time, each point of which is a 4-dimensional vector space with SO(3,1) symmetry, and then builds the [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") at each point. The neighborhoods of points are endowed with concepts of smoothness and differentiability: the standard construction is one of a [fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle"), the fibers of which are affine spaces transforming under the spin group. After constructing the fiber bundle, one may then consider differential equations, such as the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"), or the [Weyl equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation "Weyl equation") on the fiber bundle. These equations (Dirac or Weyl) have solutions that are [plane waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_wave "Plane wave"), having symmetries characteristic of the fibers, _i.e._ having the symmetries of spinors, as obtained from the (zero-dimensional) Clifford algebra/spin representation theory described above. Such plane-wave solutions (or other solutions) of the differential equations can then properly be called [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"); fermions have the algebraic qualities of spinors. By general convention, the terms "fermion" and "spinor" are often used interchangeably in physics, as synonyms of one-another.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

It appears that all [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle "Fundamental particle") in nature that are spin-1/2 are described by the Dirac equation, with the possible exception of the [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"). There does not seem to be any _a priori_ reason why this would be the case. A perfectly valid choice for spinors would be the non-complexified version of Cℓ 2,2(![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)), the [Majorana spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_spinor "Majorana spinor").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-22) There also does not seem to be any particular prohibition to having [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor "Weyl spinor") appear in nature as fundamental particles.

The Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinors are interrelated, and their relation can be elucidated on the basis of real geometric algebra.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-23) Dirac and Weyl spinors are complex representations while Majorana spinors are real representations.

Weyl spinors are insufficient to describe massive particles, such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), since the Weyl plane-wave solutions necessarily travel at the speed of light; for massive particles, the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") is needed. The initial construction of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of particle physics starts with both the electron and the neutrino as massless Weyl spinors; the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism") gives electrons a mass; the classical [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") remained massless, and was thus an example of a Weyl spinor.[[q]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-24) However, because of observed [neutrino oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation "Neutrino oscillation"), it is now believed that they are not Weyl spinors, but perhaps instead Majorana spinors.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-25) It is not known whether Weyl spinor fundamental particles exist in nature.

The situation for [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics") is different: one can construct two and three-dimensional "spacetimes" in a large variety of different physical materials, ranging from [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor") to far more exotic materials. In 2015, an international team led by [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") scientists announced that they had found a [quasiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiparticle "Quasiparticle") that behaves as a Weyl fermion.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-26)

### Spinors in representation theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Spinors in representation theory")]

One major mathematical application of the construction of spinors is to make possible the explicit construction of [linear representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_representation "Linear representation") of the [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") of the [special orthogonal groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group"), and consequently spinor representations of the groups themselves. At a more profound level, spinors have been found to be at the heart of approaches to the [Atiyah–Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem "Atiyah–Singer index theorem"), and to provide constructions in particular for [discrete series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_series "Discrete series") representations of [semisimple groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisimple_group "Semisimple group").

The spin representations of the special orthogonal Lie algebras are distinguished from the [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") representations given by [Weyl's construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_symmetrizer "Young symmetrizer") by the [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_(representation_theory) "Weight (representation theory)"). Whereas the weights of the tensor representations are integer linear combinations of the roots of the Lie algebra, those of the spin representations are half-integer linear combinations thereof. Explicit details can be found in the [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation") article.

### Attempts at intuitive understanding

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Attempts at intuitive understanding")]

The spinor can be described, in simple terms, as "vectors of a space the transformations of which are related in a particular way to rotations in physical space".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-27) Stated differently:

> Spinors ... provide a linear representation of the group of [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") in a space with any number ![Image 24: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) of dimensions, each spinor having ![Image 25: {\displaystyle 2^{\nu }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0fa1eebc5674c68166a18a335b39288ed2eb325) components where ![Image 26: {\displaystyle n=2\nu +1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02fb584fa8bec4ac60d3eeb0b3ae8496199e1c00) or ![Image 27: {\displaystyle 2\nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db2654d0632cb4b4cd30cfddb80a75ba7d743216).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-cartan-1966-quote-5)

Several ways of illustrating everyday analogies have been formulated in terms of the [plate trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_trick "Plate trick"), [tangloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangloids "Tangloids") and other examples of [orientation entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_entanglement "Orientation entanglement").

Nonetheless, the concept is generally considered notoriously difficult to understand, as illustrated by [Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah "Michael Atiyah")'s statement that is recounted by Dirac's biographer Graham Farmelo:

> No one fully understands spinors. Their algebra is formally understood but their general significance is mysterious. In some sense they describe the "square root" of geometry and, just as understanding the [square root of −1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_%E2%88%921 "Square root of −1") took centuries, the same might be true of spinors.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-28)

The most general mathematical form of spinors was discovered by [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") in 1913.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-29) The word "spinor" was coined by [Paul Ehrenfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrenfest "Paul Ehrenfest") in his work on [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-30)

Spinors were first applied to [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") by [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli") in 1927, when he introduced his [spin matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-31) The following year, [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") discovered the fully [relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") theory of [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")[spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") by showing the connection between spinors and the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group "Lorentz group").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-32) By the 1930s, Dirac, [Piet Hein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(Denmark) "Piet Hein (Denmark)") and others at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr_Institute "Niels Bohr Institute") (then known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Copenhagen) created toys such as [Tangloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangloids "Tangloids") to teach and model the calculus of spinors.

Spinor spaces were represented as [left ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ideal "Left ideal") of a matrix algebra in 1930, by [Gustave Juvett](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gustave_Juvett&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gustave Juvett (page does not exist)")[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-33) and by [Fritz Sauter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Sauter "Fritz Sauter").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-34)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-lounesto-1995-p151-35) More specifically, instead of representing spinors as complex-valued 2D column vectors as Pauli had done, they represented them as complex-valued 2 × 2 matrices in which only the elements of the left column are non-zero. In this manner the spinor space became a [minimal left ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_ideal "Minimal ideal") in Mat(2, ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)).[[r]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-37)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-lounesto-2001-p148f-p327f-38)

In 1947 [Marcel Riesz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Riesz "Marcel Riesz") constructed spinor spaces as elements of a minimal left ideal of [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra"). In 1966/1967, [David Hestenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hestenes "David Hestenes")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-39)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-40) replaced spinor spaces by the [even subalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_subalgebra "Even subalgebra") Cℓ 0 1,3(![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)) of the [spacetime algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_algebra "Spacetime algebra") Cℓ 1,3(![Image 30: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-lounesto-1995-p151-35)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-lounesto-2001-p148f-p327f-38) As of the 1980s, the theoretical physics group at [Birkbeck College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkbeck_College "Birkbeck College") around [David Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm "David Bohm") and [Basil Hiley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Hiley "Basil Hiley") has been developing [algebraic approaches to quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Hiley#Implicate_orders,_pre-space_and_algebraic_structures "Basil Hiley") that build on Sauter and Riesz' identification of spinors with minimal left ideals.

Some simple examples of spinors in low dimensions arise from considering the even-graded subalgebras of the Clifford algebra Cℓ _p_, _q_(![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)). This is an algebra built up from an orthonormal basis of _n_ = _p_ + _q_ mutually orthogonal vectors under addition and multiplication, _p_ of which have norm +1 and _q_ of which have norm −1, with the product rule for the basis vectors ![Image 32: {\displaystyle e_{i}e_{j}={\begin{cases}+1&i=j,\,i\in (1,\ldots ,p)\\-1&i=j,\,i\in (p+1,\ldots ,n)\\-e_{j}e_{i}&i\neq j.\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a7bb0526bf1c69aae1ca3133e4e894e4dc46e2fd)

From the definitions above, it is evident that (_σ_ 1)2 = (_σ_ 2)2 = 1, and (_σ_ 1 _σ_ 2)(_σ_ 1 _σ_ 2) = −_σ_ 1 _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 _σ_ 2 = −1.

It is made up of real linear combinations of 1 and _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2. As a real algebra, Cℓ 0 2,0(![Image 36: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)) is isomorphic to the field of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers")![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7). As a result, it admits a conjugation operation (analogous to [complex conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate "Complex conjugate")), sometimes called the _reverse_ of a Clifford element, defined by ![Image 38: {\displaystyle (a+b\sigma _{1}\sigma _{2})^{*}=a+b\sigma _{2}\sigma _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b478020c54d9d0ffe746b56175967bf3058a35a) which, by the Clifford relations, can be written ![Image 39: {\displaystyle (a+b\sigma _{1}\sigma _{2})^{*}=a+b\sigma _{2}\sigma _{1}=a-b\sigma _{1}\sigma _{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e47f5af5b9cd3885d9982b68c049b3f3631911f7)

In this situation, a **spinor**[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-41) is an ordinary complex number. The action of ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) on a spinor ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is given by ordinary complex multiplication: ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \gamma (\phi )=\gamma \phi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60002d8d1af4b2d36f494ebd33c0dfc6cfaf61b7)

An important feature of this definition is the distinction between ordinary vectors and spinors, manifested in how the even-graded elements act on each of them in different ways. In general, a quick check of the Clifford relations reveals that even-graded elements conjugate-commute with ordinary vectors: ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \gamma (u)=\gamma u\gamma ^{*}=\gamma ^{2}u.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebd3498f2f7f9ea565bad34197f49377406328e9)

On the other hand, in comparison with its action on spinors ![Image 49: {\displaystyle \gamma (\phi )=\gamma \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc3c366d3970de98bbdca34b665682cd128133ce), the action of ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) on ordinary vectors appears as the _square_ of its action on spinors.

Consider, for example, the implication this has for plane rotations. Rotating a vector through an angle of _θ_ corresponds to _γ_ 2 = exp(_θ σ_ 1 _σ_ 2), so that the corresponding action on spinors is via _γ_ = ± exp(_θ σ_ 1 _σ_ 2/2). In general, because of [logarithmic branching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_cut "Branch cut"), it is impossible to choose a sign in a consistent way. Thus the representation of plane rotations on spinors is two-valued.

In applications of spinors in two dimensions, it is common to exploit the fact that the algebra of even-graded elements (that is just the ring of complex numbers) is identical to the space of spinors. So, by [abuse of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation "Abuse of notation"), the two are often conflated. One may then talk about "the action of a spinor on a vector". In a general setting, such statements are meaningless. But in dimensions 2 and 3 (as applied, for example, to [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics")) they make sense.

The Clifford algebra Cℓ 3,0(![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)) is built up from a basis of one unit scalar, 1, three orthogonal unit vectors, [_σ_ 1, _σ_ 2 and _σ_ 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices"), the three unit bivectors _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2, _σ_ 2 _σ_ 3, _σ_ 3 _σ_ 1 and the [pseudoscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscalar "Pseudoscalar")_i_ = _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 _σ_ 3. It is straightforward to show that (_σ_ 1)2 = (_σ_ 2)2 = (_σ_ 3)2 = 1, and (_σ_ 1 _σ_ 2)2 = (_σ_ 2 _σ_ 3)2 = (_σ_ 3 _σ_ 1)2 = (_σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 _σ_ 3)2 = −1.

The sub-algebra of even-graded elements is made up of scalar dilations, ![Image 52: {\displaystyle u'=\rho ^{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}u\rho ^{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}=\rho u,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d04f2a3aa833707ea63fe10176696f9155119018) and vector rotations ![Image 53: {\displaystyle u'=\gamma u\gamma ^{*},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65714c95b31176621ad444b13210137260b50bdc) where

As a special case, it is easy to see that, if _v_ = _σ_ 3, this reproduces the _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 rotation considered in the previous section; and that such rotation leaves the coefficients of vectors in the _σ_ 3 direction invariant, since

Note that the expression (1) for a vector rotation through an angle θ, _the angle appearing in γ was halved_. Thus the spinor rotation _γ_(_ψ_) = _γψ_ (ordinary quaternionic multiplication) will rotate the spinor ψ through an angle one-half the measure of the angle of the corresponding vector rotation. Once again, the problem of lifting a vector rotation to a spinor rotation is two-valued: the expression (1) with (180° + _θ_/2) in place of _θ_/2 will produce the same vector rotation, but the negative of the spinor rotation.

The spinor/quaternion representation of rotations in 3D is becoming increasingly prevalent in computer geometry and other applications, because of the notable brevity of the corresponding spin matrix, and the simplicity with which they can be multiplied together to calculate the combined effect of successive rotations about different axes.

Explicit constructions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Explicit constructions")]

A space of spinors can be constructed explicitly with concrete and abstract constructions. The equivalence of these constructions is a consequence of the uniqueness of the spinor representation of the complex Clifford algebra. For a complete example in dimension 3, see [spinors in three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinors_in_three_dimensions "Spinors in three dimensions").

Given a vector space _V_ and a quadratic form _g_ an explicit matrix representation of the Clifford algebra Cℓ(_V_, _g_) can be defined as follows. Choose an orthonormal basis _e_ 1 ... _e_ _n_ for _V_ i.e. _g_(_e_ _μ_ _e_ _ν_) = _η_ _μν_ where _η_ _μμ_ = ±1 and _η_ _μν_ = 0 for _μ_ ≠ _ν_. Let _k_ = ⌊_n_/2⌋. Fix a set of 2 _k_ × 2 _k_ matrices _γ_ 1 ... _γ_ _n_ such that _γ_ _μ_ _γ_ _ν_ + _γ_ _ν_ _γ_ _μ_ = 2 _η_ _μν_ 1 (i.e. fix a convention for the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices")). Then the assignment _e_ _μ_ → _γ_ _μ_ extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism Cℓ(_V_, _g_) → Mat(2 _k_, ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) by sending the monomial _e_ _μ_ 1 ⋅⋅⋅ _e_ _μ_ _k_ in the Clifford algebra to the product _γ_ _μ_ 1 ⋅⋅⋅ _γ_ _μ_ _k_ of matrices and extending linearly. The space ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \Delta =\mathbb {C} ^{2^{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fa1ff934ed5f5d6135a893d0471046dc797f195) on which the gamma matrices act is now a space of spinors. One needs to construct such matrices explicitly, however. In dimension 3, defining the gamma matrices to be the [Pauli sigma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices") gives rise to the familiar two component spinors used in non relativistic [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). Likewise using the 4 × 4 Dirac gamma matrices gives rise to the 4 component Dirac spinors used in 3+1 dimensional relativistic [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). In general, in order to define gamma matrices of the required kind, one can use the [Weyl–Brauer matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl%E2%80%93Brauer_matrices "Weyl–Brauer matrices").

In this construction the representation of the Clifford algebra Cℓ(_V_, _g_), the Lie algebra **so**(_V_, _g_), and the Spin group Spin(_V_, _g_), all depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis and the choice of the gamma matrices. This can cause confusion over conventions, but invariants like traces are independent of choices. In particular, all physically observable quantities must be independent of such choices. In this construction a spinor can be represented as a vector of 2 _k_ complex numbers and is denoted with spinor indices (usually _α_, _β_, _γ_). In the physics literature, such [indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_indices "Abstract indices") are often used to denote spinors even when an abstract spinor construction is used.

There are at least two different, but essentially equivalent, ways to define spinors abstractly. One approach seeks to identify the minimal ideals for the left action of Cℓ(_V_, _g_) on itself. These are subspaces of the Clifford algebra of the form Cℓ(_V_, _g_)_ω_, admitting the evident action of Cℓ(_V_, _g_) by left-multiplication: _c_ : _xω_ → _cxω_. There are two variations on this theme: one can either find a primitive element _ω_ that is a [nilpotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilpotent "Nilpotent") element of the Clifford algebra, or one that is an [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent "Idempotent"). The construction via nilpotent elements is more fundamental in the sense that an idempotent may then be produced from it.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-44) In this way, the spinor representations are identified with certain subspaces of the Clifford algebra itself. The second approach is to construct a vector space using a distinguished subspace of _V_, and then specify the action of the Clifford algebra _externally_ to that vector space.

In either approach, the fundamental notion is that of an [isotropic subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic_subspace "Isotropic subspace")_W_. Each construction depends on an initial freedom in choosing this subspace. In physical terms, this corresponds to the fact that there is no measurement protocol that can specify a basis of the spin space, even if a preferred basis of _V_ is given.

As above, we let (_V_, _g_) be an _n_-dimensional complex vector space equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form. If _V_ is a real vector space, then we replace _V_ by its [complexification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexification "Complexification")![Image 60: {\displaystyle V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/488efafc27b11de008a8bb600fe0a083fab76068) and let _g_ denote the induced bilinear form on ![Image 61: {\displaystyle V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/488efafc27b11de008a8bb600fe0a083fab76068). Let _W_ be a maximal isotropic subspace, i.e. a maximal subspace of _V_ such that _g_|_W_ = 0. If _n_ = 2 _k_ is even, then let _W_′ be an isotropic subspace complementary to _W_. If _n_ = 2 _k_ + 1 is odd, let _W_′ be a maximal isotropic subspace with _W_ ∩ _W_′ = 0, and let _U_ be the orthogonal complement of _W_ ⊕ _W_′. In both the even- and odd-dimensional cases _W_ and _W_′ have dimension _k_. In the odd-dimensional case, _U_ is one-dimensional, spanned by a unit vector _u_.

Since _W_′ is isotropic, multiplication of elements of _W_′ inside Cℓ(_V_, _g_) is [skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_algebra "Alternative algebra"). Hence vectors in _W_′ anti-commute, and Cℓ(_W_′, _g_|_W_′) = Cℓ(_W_′, 0) is just the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra") Λ∗_W_′. Consequently, the _k_-fold product of _W_′ with itself, _W_′_k_, is one-dimensional. Let _ω_ be a generator of _W_′_k_. In terms of a basis _w_′1, ..., _w_′k of in _W_′, one possibility is to set ![Image 62: {\displaystyle \omega =w'_{1}w'_{2}\cdots w'_{k}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cc67063ae8e7e85e1dc063c02a9ad00954f84a4)

Note that _ω_ 2 = 0 (i.e., _ω_ is nilpotent of order 2), and moreover, _w_′_ω_ = 0 for all _w_′ ∈ _W_′. The following facts can be proven easily:

1.   If _n_ = 2 _k_, then the left ideal Δ = Cℓ(_V_, _g_)_ω_ is a minimal left ideal. Furthermore, this splits into the two spin spaces Δ+ = Cℓ even _ω_ and Δ− = Cℓ odd _ω_ on restriction to the action of the even Clifford algebra.
2.   If _n_ = 2 _k_ + 1, then the action of the unit vector _u_ on the left ideal Cℓ(_V_, _g_)_ω_ decomposes the space into a pair of isomorphic irreducible eigenspaces (both denoted by Δ), corresponding to the respective eigenvalues +1 and −1.

In detail, suppose for instance that _n_ is even. Suppose that _I_ is a non-zero left ideal contained in Cℓ(_V_, _g_)_ω_. We shall show that _I_ must be equal to Cℓ(_V_, _g_)_ω_ by proving that it contains a nonzero scalar multiple of _ω_.

Fix a basis _w_ _i_ of _W_ and a complementary basis _w_ _i_′ of _W_′ so that

_w_ _i_ _w_ _j_′ +_w_ _j_′_w_ _i_ = _δ_ _ij_, and

(_w_ _i_)2 = 0, (_w_ _i_′)2 = 0.

Note that any element of _I_ must have the form _αω_, by virtue of our assumption that _I_ ⊂ Cℓ(_V_, _g_) _ω_. Let _αω_ ∈ _I_ be any such element. Using the chosen basis, we may write ![Image 63: {\displaystyle \alpha =\sum _{i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{p}}a_{i_{1}\dots i_{p}}w_{i_{1}}\cdots w_{i_{p}}+\sum _{j}B_{j}w'_{j}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54269582f7d2a99a2794a8637dda80697bd101be) where the _a_ _i_ 1..._i_ _p_ are scalars, and the _B_ _j_ are auxiliary elements of the Clifford algebra. Observe now that the product ![Image 64: {\displaystyle \alpha \omega =\sum _{i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{p}}a_{i_{1}\dots i_{p}}w_{i_{1}}\cdots w_{i_{p}}\omega .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bdce618aa9432ffd91667ef48b12130bdf3bd4f8) Pick any nonzero monomial _a_ in the expansion of _α_ with maximal homogeneous degree in the elements _w_ i: ![Image 65: {\displaystyle a=a_{i_{1}\dots i_{\text{max}}}w_{i_{1}}\dots w_{i_{\text{max}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd9626852d843d9c9c30e5df6c0d4faa5bc3cd85) (no summation implied), then ![Image 66: {\displaystyle w'_{i_{\text{max}}}\cdots w'_{i_{1}}\alpha \omega =a_{i_{1}\dots i_{\text{max}}}\omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3cf755d3f00b845e960d73c12d6e5881ab7e5697) is a nonzero scalar multiple of _ω_, as required.

Note that for _n_ even, this computation also shows that ![Image 67: {\displaystyle \Delta =\mathrm {C} \ell (W)\omega =\left(\Lambda ^{*}W\right)\omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a1d93a9855e984eed5f58b32008b94f470f86ed) as a vector space. In the last equality we again used that _W_ is isotropic. In physics terms, this shows that Δ is built up like a [Fock space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fock_space "Fock space") by [creating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_annihilation "Creation and annihilation") spinors using anti-commuting creation operators in _W_ acting on a vacuum _ω_.

### Exterior algebra construction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Exterior algebra construction")]

The computations with the minimal ideal construction suggest that a spinor representation can also be defined directly using the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra")Λ∗_W_ = ⊕_j_ Λ _j_ _W_ of the isotropic subspace _W_. Let Δ = Λ∗_W_ denote the exterior algebra of _W_ considered as vector space only. This will be the spin representation, and its elements will be referred to as spinors.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-45)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-46)

The action of the Clifford algebra on Δ is defined first by giving the action of an element of _V_ on Δ, and then showing that this action respects the Clifford relation and so extends to a [homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") of the full Clifford algebra into the [endomorphism ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism_ring "Endomorphism ring") End(Δ) by the [universal property of Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra#Universal_property_and_construction "Clifford algebra"). The details differ slightly according to whether the dimension of _V_ is even or odd.

When dim(V) is even, _V_ = _W_ ⊕ _W_′ where _W_′ is the chosen isotropic complement. Hence any _v_ ∈ _V_ decomposes uniquely as _v_ = _w_ + _w_′ with _w_ ∈ _W_ and _w_′ ∈ _W_′. The action of v on a spinor is given by ![Image 68: {\displaystyle c(v)w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{n}=\left(\epsilon (w)+i\left(w'\right)\right)\left(w_{1}\wedge \cdots \wedge w_{n}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86a462e8307ee6270d43cdd969bcf4ea6595673e) where _i_(_w_′) is [interior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_product "Interior product") with _w_′ using the nondegenerate quadratic form to identify _V_ with _V_∗, and _ε_(_w_) denotes the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product"). This action is sometimes called the **Clifford product**. It may be verified that ![Image 69: {\displaystyle c(u)\,c(v)+c(v)\,c(u)=2\,g(u,v)\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/554e378f254f531a0dbbb56f8103f739cee0b761) and so c respects the Clifford relations and extends to a homomorphism from the Clifford algebra to End(Δ).

The spin representation Δ further decomposes into a pair of irreducible complex representations of the Spin group[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-47) (the half-spin representations, or Weyl spinors) via ![Image 70: {\displaystyle \Delta _{+}=\Lambda ^{\text{even}}W,\,\Delta _{-}=\Lambda ^{\text{odd}}W.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cbfc4860fa4dc00b66a9d4c869c4ceae7981d3f)

When dim(_V_) is odd, _V_ = _W_ ⊕ _U_ ⊕ _W_′, where _U_ is spanned by a unit vector _u_ orthogonal to _W_. The Clifford action _c_ is defined as before on _W_ ⊕ _W_′, while the Clifford action of (multiples of) _u_ is defined by ![Image 71: {\displaystyle c(u)\alpha ={\begin{cases}\alpha &{\hbox{if }}\alpha \in \Lambda ^{\text{even}}W\\-\alpha &{\hbox{if }}\alpha \in \Lambda ^{\text{odd}}W\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f90f45f13b393d5da7aeef0cf6d13305d9662850) As before, one verifies that _c_ respects the Clifford relations, and so induces a homomorphism.

### Hermitian vector spaces and spinors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Hermitian vector spaces and spinors")]

If the vector space _V_ has extra structure that provides a decomposition of its complexification into two maximal isotropic subspaces, then the definition of spinors (by either method) becomes natural.

The main example is the case that the real vector space _V_ is a [hermitian vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_form "Hermitian form")(_V_, _g_), i.e., _V_ is equipped with a [complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complex_structure "Linear complex structure")_J_ that is an [orthogonal transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_transformation "Orthogonal transformation") with respect to the inner product _g_ on _V_. Then ![Image 72: {\displaystyle V\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/488efafc27b11de008a8bb600fe0a083fab76068) splits in the ±_i_ eigenspaces of _J_. These eigenspaces are isotropic for the complexification of _g_ and can be identified with the complex vector space (_V_, _J_) and its complex conjugate (_V_, −_J_). Therefore, for a hermitian vector space (_V_, _g_) the vector space ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \Lambda _{\mathbb {C} }^{\cdot }{\bar {V}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a92788e0461a16cbc4e754d6e61e57b58243ce23) (as well as its complex conjugate ![Image 74: {\displaystyle \Lambda _{\mathbb {C} }^{\cdot }V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb23cd9e9724920714f95c9e7c94c2955802072b)) is a spinor space for the underlying real euclidean vector space.

With the Clifford action as above but with contraction using the hermitian form, this construction gives a spinor space at every point of an [almost Hermitian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Hermitian_manifold "Almost Hermitian manifold") and is the reason why every [almost complex manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_manifold "Almost complex manifold") (in particular every [symplectic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold")) has a [Spin c structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-c_structure "Spin-c structure"). Likewise, every complex vector bundle on a manifold carries a Spin c structure.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-48)

Clebsch–Gordan decomposition
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Clebsch–Gordan decomposition")]

A number of [Clebsch–Gordan decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients "Clebsch–Gordan coefficients") are possible on the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product") of one spin representation with another.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-49) These decompositions express the tensor product in terms of the alternating representations of the orthogonal group.

For the real or complex case, the alternating representations are

*   Γ _r_ = Λ _r_ _V_, the representation of the orthogonal group on skew tensors of rank _r_.

In addition, for the real orthogonal groups, there are three [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_theory "Character theory") (one-dimensional representations)

*   _σ_+ : O(_p_, _q_) → {−1, +1} given by _σ_+(R) = −1, if _R_ reverses the spatial orientation of _V_, +1, if _R_ preserves the spatial orientation of _V_. (_The spatial character_.)
*   _σ_− : O(_p_, _q_) → {−1, +1} given by _σ_−(R) = −1, if _R_ reverses the temporal orientation of _V_, +1, if _R_ preserves the temporal orientation of _V_. (_The temporal character_.)
*   _σ_ = _σ_+_σ_− . (_The orientation character_.)

The Clebsch–Gordan decomposition allows one to define, among other things:

*   An action of spinors on vectors.
*   A [Hermitian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_metric "Hermitian metric") on the complex representations of the real spin groups.
*   A [Dirac operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_operator "Dirac operator") on each spin representation.

If _n_ = 2 _k_ is even, then the tensor product of Δ with the [contragredient representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contragredient_representation "Contragredient representation") decomposes as ![Image 75: {\displaystyle \Delta \otimes \Delta ^{*}\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{n}\Gamma _{p}\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k-1}\left(\Gamma _{p}\oplus \sigma \Gamma _{p}\right)\oplus \Gamma _{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44847ed0e5eefa962cba502cc86fbf3e0b157610) which can be seen explicitly by considering (in the Explicit construction) the action of the Clifford algebra on decomposable elements _αω_ ⊗ _βω_′. The rightmost formulation follows from the transformation properties of the [Hodge star operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator "Hodge star operator"). Note that on restriction to the even Clifford algebra, the paired summands Γ _p_ ⊕ _σ_ Γ _p_ are isomorphic, but under the full Clifford algebra they are not.

There is a natural identification of Δ with its contragredient representation via the conjugation in the Clifford algebra: ![Image 76: {\displaystyle (\alpha \omega )^{*}=\omega \left(\alpha ^{*}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a6dc2616509329da9df38ed4bb3aee3f6cb9da4) So Δ ⊗ Δ also decomposes in the above manner. Furthermore, under the even Clifford algebra, the half-spin representations decompose ![Image 77: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta _{+}\otimes \Delta _{+}^{*}\cong \Delta _{-}\otimes \Delta _{-}^{*}&\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k}\Gamma _{2p}\\\Delta _{+}\otimes \Delta _{-}^{*}\cong \Delta _{-}\otimes \Delta _{+}^{*}&\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k-1}\Gamma _{2p+1}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ef2d15310558a57ebea9d602bb0fb04f4b57166)

For the complex representations of the real Clifford algebras, the associated [reality structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_structure "Reality structure") on the complex Clifford algebra descends to the space of spinors (via the explicit construction in terms of minimal ideals, for instance). In this way, we obtain the complex conjugate Δ of the representation Δ, and the following isomorphism is seen to hold: ![Image 78: {\displaystyle {\bar {\Delta }}\cong \sigma _{-}\Delta ^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c8ae63789550e6eafb2d65043fa85a78f9abf73)

In particular, note that the representation Δ of the orthochronous spin group is a [unitary representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_representation "Unitary representation"). In general, there are Clebsch–Gordan decompositions ![Image 79: {\displaystyle \Delta \otimes {\bar {\Delta }}\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k}\left(\sigma _{-}\Gamma _{p}\oplus \sigma _{+}\Gamma _{p}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9fbeb1d7dcc8e018771536b632a0972440f7dab)

In metric signature (_p_, _q_), the following isomorphisms hold for the conjugate half-spin representations

Using these isomorphisms, one can deduce analogous decompositions for the tensor products of the half-spin representations Δ± ⊗ Δ±.

If _n_ = 2 _k_ + 1 is odd, then ![Image 80: {\displaystyle \Delta \otimes \Delta ^{*}\cong \bigoplus _{p=0}^{k}\Gamma _{2p}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce77d980a71d439d45b1bd03008943c75e59b7ee) In the real case, once again the isomorphism holds ![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\bar {\Delta }}\cong \sigma _{-}\Delta ^{*}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c11042b67cf0e4ebd0687f62154fabead4180ed8) Hence there is a Clebsch–Gordan decomposition (again using the Hodge star to dualize) given by ![Image 82: {\displaystyle \Delta \otimes {\bar {\Delta }}\cong \sigma _{-}\Gamma _{0}\oplus \sigma _{+}\Gamma _{1}\oplus \dots \oplus \sigma _{\pm }\Gamma _{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ea85dc8c1f368185083230c142b22ce024e92740)

There are many far-reaching consequences of the Clebsch–Gordan decompositions of the spinor spaces. The most fundamental of these pertain to Dirac's theory of the electron, among whose basic requirements are

*   A manner of regarding the product of two spinors _ϕ ψ_ as a scalar. In physical terms, a spinor should determine a [probability amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude "Probability amplitude") for the [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state").
*   A manner of regarding the product _ψ ϕ_ as a vector. This is an essential feature of Dirac's theory, which ties the spinor formalism to the geometry of physical space.
*   A manner of regarding a spinor as acting upon a vector, by an expression such as _ψv ψ_. In physical terms, this represents an [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") of Maxwell's [electromagnetic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_theory "Electromagnetic theory"), or more generally a [probability current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_current "Probability current").

Summary in low dimensions
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinor&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Summary in low dimensions")]

*   In 1 dimension (a trivial example), the single spinor representation is formally Majorana, a [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_representation "Real representation") 1-dimensional representation that does not transform.
*   In 2 Euclidean dimensions, the left-handed and the right-handed Weyl spinor are 1-component [complex representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_representation "Complex representation"), i.e. complex numbers that get multiplied by _e_±_iφ_/2 under a rotation by angle _φ_.
*   In 3 Euclidean dimensions, the single spinor representation is 2-dimensional and [quaternionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternionic_representation "Quaternionic representation"). The existence of spinors in 3 dimensions follows from the isomorphism of the [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)")SU(2) ≅ Spin(3) that allows us to define the action of Spin(3) on a complex 2-component column (a spinor); the generators of SU(2) can be written as [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices").
*   In 4 Euclidean dimensions, the corresponding isomorphism is Spin(4) ≅ SU(2) × SU(2). There are two inequivalent [quaternionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternionic_representation "Quaternionic representation") 2-component Weyl spinors and each of them transforms under one of the SU(2) factors only.
*   In 5 Euclidean dimensions, the relevant isomorphism is Spin(5) ≅ USp(4) ≅ Sp(2) that implies that the single spinor representation is 4-dimensional and quaternionic.
*   In 6 Euclidean dimensions, the isomorphism Spin(6) ≅ SU(4) guarantees that there are two 4-dimensional complex Weyl representations that are complex conjugates of one another.
*   In 7 Euclidean dimensions, the single spinor representation is 8-dimensional and real; no isomorphisms to a Lie algebra from another series (A or C) exist from this dimension on.
*   In 8 Euclidean dimensions, there are two Weyl–Majorana real 8-dimensional representations that are related to the 8-dimensional real vector representation by a special property of [Spin(8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin(8) "Spin(8)") called [triality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triality "Triality").
*   In _d_ + 8 dimensions, the number of distinct irreducible spinor representations and their reality (whether they are real, pseudoreal, or complex) mimics the structure in _d_ dimensions, but their dimensions are 16 times larger; this allows one to understand all remaining cases. See [Bott periodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bott_periodicity "Bott periodicity").
*   In spacetimes with _p_ spatial and _q_ time-like directions, the dimensions viewed as dimensions over the complex numbers coincide with the case of the (_p_ + _q_)-dimensional Euclidean space, but the reality projections mimic the structure in |_p_ − _q_| Euclidean dimensions. For example, in 3 + 1 dimensions there are two non-equivalent Weyl complex (like in 2 dimensions) 2-component (like in 4 dimensions) spinors, which follows from the isomorphism SL(2, ![Image 83: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) ≅ Spin(3,1).

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-1)**Spinors in three dimensions are points of a [line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_bundle "Line bundle") over a [conic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic "Conic") in the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"). In this picture, which is associated to spinors of a three-dimensional [pseudo-Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Euclidean_space "Pseudo-Euclidean space") of signature (1,2), the conic is an ordinary real conic (here the circle), the line bundle is the Möbius bundle, and the spin group is SL 2(![Image 84: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc)). In Euclidean signature, the projective plane, conic and line bundle are over the complex instead, and this picture is just a real slice.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-2)**Spinors can always be defined over the complex numbers. However, in some signatures there exist real spinors. Details can be found in [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation").
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-3)**A formal definition of spinors at this level is that the space of spinors is a [linear representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_representation "Linear representation") of the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra") of [infinitesimal rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_rotation "Infinitesimal rotation") of a [certain kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation").
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-6)**"Spinors were first used under that name, by physicists, in the field of Quantum Mechanics. In their most general form, spinors were discovered in 1913 by the author of this work, in his investigations on the linear representations of simple groups*; they provide a linear representation of the group of rotations in a space with any number ![Image 85: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) of dimensions, each spinor having ![Image 86: {\displaystyle 2^{\nu }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0fa1eebc5674c68166a18a335b39288ed2eb325) components where ![Image 87: {\displaystyle n=2\nu +1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02fb584fa8bec4ac60d3eeb0b3ae8496199e1c00) or ![Image 88: {\displaystyle 2\nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db2654d0632cb4b4cd30cfddb80a75ba7d743216)."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-cartan-1966-quote-5) The star (*) refers to Cartan (1913).
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-7)**More precisely, it is the [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") of [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2 "Spin-1/2") that are described by spinors, which is true both in the relativistic and non-relativistic theory. The wavefunction of the non-relativistic electron has values in 2-component spinors transforming under 3-dimensional infinitesimal rotations. The relativistic [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") for the electron is an equation for 4-component spinors transforming under infinitesimal Lorentz transformations, for which a substantially similar theory of spinors exists.
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-8)**Formally, the spin group is the group of [relative homotopy classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_homotopy_class "Relative homotopy class") with fixed endpoints in the rotation group.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-9)**More formally, the space of spinors can be defined as an ([irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representation "Irreducible representation")) representation of the spin group that does not factor through a representation of the rotation group (in general, the connected component of the identity of the [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group")).
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-10)**[Geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra") is a name for the Clifford algebra in an applied setting.
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-12)**The Pauli matrices correspond to [angular momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator "Angular momentum operator") operators about the three coordinate axes. This makes them slightly atypical gamma matrices because in addition to their anticommutation relation they also satisfy commutation relations.
10.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-13)**The [metric signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature "Metric signature") relevant as well if we are concerned with real spinors. See [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation").
11.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-14)**Whether the representation decomposes depends on whether they are regarded as representations of the spin group (or its Lie algebra), in which case it decomposes in even but not odd dimensions, or the Clifford algebra when it is the other way around. Other structures than this decomposition can also exist; precise criteria are covered at [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation") and [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra").
12.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-15)**The [TNB frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNB_frame "TNB frame") of the ribbon defines a rotation continuously for each value of the arc length parameter.
13.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-16)**This is the set of 2×2 complex [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra) "Trace (linear algebra)")[hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix "Hermitian matrix").
14.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-18)**Except for a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") of ![Image 89: {\displaystyle \{\pm 1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5eeb8470fc14dbbc80503092df4c0c36d56e66ac) corresponding to the two different elements of the spin group that go to the same rotation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-17)
15.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-19)**So the ambiguity in identifying the spinors themselves persists from the point of view of the group theory, and still depends on choices.
16.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-20)**The Clifford algebra can be given an even/odd [grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_algebra "Graded algebra") from the parity of the degree in the gammas, and the spin group and its Lie algebra both lie in the even part. Whether here by "representation" we mean representations of the spin group or the Clifford algebra will affect the determination of their reducibility. Other structures than this splitting can also exist; precise criteria are covered at [spin representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_representation "Spin representation") and [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra").
17.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-24)**More precisely, the electron starts out as two massless Weyl spinors, left and right-handed. Upon symmetry breaking, both gain a mass, and are coupled to form a Dirac spinor.
18.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-37)**The matrices of dimension _N_ × _N_ in which only the elements of the left column are non-zero form a _left ideal_ in the _N_ × _N_ matrix algebra Mat(_N_, ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)) – multiplying such a matrix _M_ from the left with any _N_ × _N_ matrix _A_ gives the result _AM_ that is again an _N_ × _N_ matrix in which only the elements of the left column are non-zero. Moreover, it can be shown that it is a _minimal left ideal_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_note-36)
19.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-41)**These are the right-handed Weyl spinors in two dimensions. For the left-handed Weyl spinors, the representation is via _γ_(_ϕ_) = _γ ϕ_. The Majorana spinors are the common underlying real representation for the Weyl representations.
20.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-42)**Since, for a [skew field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_field "Skew field"), the kernel of the representation must be trivial. So inequivalent representations can only arise via an [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism") of the skew-field. In this case, there are a pair of equivalent representations: _γ_(_ϕ_) = _γϕ_, and its quaternionic conjugate _γ_(_ϕ_) = _ϕ γ_.
21.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#cite_ref-43)**The complex spinors are obtained as the representations of the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product "Tensor product")![Image 91: {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} \otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87333035eee79dcfb7042925014511dfc5247b4e) = Mat 2(![Image 92: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7)). These are considered in more detail in [spinors in three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinors_in_three_dimensions "Spinors in three dimensions").
