Cover of Ribofunk by Paul Di Filippo , a seminal biopunk story collection Biopunk (a portmanteau of " biotechnology " or " biology " and " punk ") is a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on biotechnology. It is derived from cyberpunk , but focuses on the implications of biotechnology rather than mechanical cyberware and information technology .

[ 1 ] Biopunk is concerned with synthetic biology . It is derived from cyberpunk and often involves bio-hackers , biotech megacorporations , and oppressive organizations that engineer DNA . Most often keeping with the dark atmosphere of cyberpunk, biopunk generally examines risks and downsides of genetic engineering and illustrates potential perils of biotechnologies.

Description [ edit ] Biopunk is a subgenre of science fiction closely related to cyberpunk that focuses on the near-future (most often unintended) consequences of the biotechnology revolution following the invention of recombinant DNA . Biopunk stories explore the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of human experimentation , against a typically dystopian backdrop of totalitarian governments or megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control and profiteering . Often, the fruits of biotechnology, such as human enhancement and extended longevity , are not evenly distributed and are controlled by corporations.

[ 2 ] Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on information technology , but on synthetic biology. Like in postcyberpunk fiction, individuals are often modified and enhanced not with cyberware , but by genetic manipulation .

[ 1 ] A common feature of biopunk fiction is the "black clinic", which is a laboratory, clinic, or hospital that performs illegal, unregulated, or ethically dubious biological modification and genetic engineering procedures.

[ 3 ] Many features of biopunk fiction have their roots in William Gibson 's Neuromancer , one of the first cyberpunk novels.

[ 4 ] One of the prominent writers in this field is Paul Di Filippo , though he called his collection of such stories ribofunk , a blend of " ribosome " and " funk ".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Di Filippo suggests that precursors of biopunk fiction include H. G. Wells ' The Island of Doctor Moreau ; Julian Huxley 's The Tissue-Culture King ; some of David H. Keller 's stories, Damon Knight 's Natural State and Other Stories ; Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth 's Gravy Planet ; novels of T. J. Bass and John Varley ; Greg Bear 's Blood Music ; Bruce Sterling 's Schismatrix and Autonomous by Annalee Newitz .

[ 6 ] The stories of Cordwainer Smith , including his first and most famous Scanners Live in Vain , also foreshadow biopunk themes.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Another example is the New Jedi Order series published from 1999 to 2003, which prominently feature the Yuuzhan Vong who exclusively use biotechnology.
