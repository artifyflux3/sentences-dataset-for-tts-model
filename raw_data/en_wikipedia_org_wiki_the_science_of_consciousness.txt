It is organized by the Center for Consciousness Studies of the University of Arizona . Alternate conferences are held in Arizona (either Tucson or Phoenix), and the others in locations worldwide. The conference is devoted exclusively to the investigation of consciousness .

[ 1 ] Associated people [ edit ] The main organizer is Stuart Hameroff , an anestheologist and the director of the center that hosts the conference. One of the speakers at the first conference, David Chalmers , had co-organized some of the following ones, until the event became too far away from the scientific mainstream.

[ 2 ] Conference books [ edit ] Three books published by MIT Press have resulted from the conference.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] John Benjamins published a book containing selected proceedings from TSC 1999.

[ 6 ] Independent academic coverage [ edit ] An essay review Toward a science of consciousness:Tucson I and II by J. Gray was printed in ISR Interdisciplinary Science Reviews Volume 24 Issue 4 (1 April 1999), pp. 255–260.

[ 7 ] Michael Punt reviewed TSC 2002 in the journal Leonardo .

[ 8 ] In the Journal of Consciousness Exploration & Research , Christopher Holvenstot reviewed TSC 2011, likening it to The Greatest Show on Earth .

[ 9 ] A review of TSC 2012 may be found in the Journal of Consciousness Studies .

[ 10 ] A commentary on dropping the word "Toward" was published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies in 2016.

[ 11 ] Media coverage [ edit ] Chapter 8 of John Horgan 's book The Undiscovered Mind is entirely devoted to his experiences at the first (1994) TSC conference.

[ 12 ] In The New York Times , George Johnson wrote about the 2016 conference that "wild speculations and carnivalesque pseudoscience were juxtaposed with sober sessions".

[ 13 ] The conference and its main organizers were the subject of a long feature in June 2018, first in the Chronicle of Higher Education , and re-published in The Guardian . Tom Bartlett concluded that the conference was "more or less the Stuart [Hameroff] Show. He decides who will and who will not present. [...] Some consciousness researchers believe that the whole shindig has gone off the rails, that it’s seriously damaging the field of consciousness studies, and that it should be shut down." [ 14 ] See also [ edit ] Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness , which puts on a similar series of conferences about consciousness .
