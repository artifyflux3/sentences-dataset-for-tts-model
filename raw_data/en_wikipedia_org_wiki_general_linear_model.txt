In that sense it is not a separate statistical linear model . The various multiple linear regression models may be compactly written as [ 1 ] Y = X B + U , {\displaystyle \mathbf {Y} =\mathbf {X} \mathbf {B} +\mathbf {U} ,} where Y is a matrix with series of multivariate measurements (each column being a set of measurements on one of the dependent variables ), X is a matrix of observations on independent variables that might be a design matrix (each column being a set of observations on one of the independent variables), B is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated and U is a matrix containing errors (noise). The errors are usually assumed to be uncorrelated across measurements, and follow a multivariate normal distribution . If the errors do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, generalized linear models may be used to relax assumptions about Y and U .

The general linear model (GLM) encompasses several statistical models, including ANOVA , ANCOVA , MANOVA , MANCOVA , ordinary linear regression . Within this framework, both t -test and F -test can be applied. The general linear model is a generalization of multiple linear regression to the case of more than one dependent variable. If Y , B , and U were column vectors , the matrix equation above would represent multiple linear regression.

Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: multivariate or as several independent univariate tests. In multivariate tests the columns of Y are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of Y are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix.

Comparison to multiple linear regression [ edit ] Further information: Multiple linear regression Multiple linear regression is a generalization of simple linear regression to the case of more than one independent variable, and a special case of general linear models, restricted to one dependent variable. The basic model for multiple linear regression is Y i = β β 0 + β β 1 X i 1 + β β 2 X i 2 + … … + β β p X i p + ϵ ϵ i {\displaystyle Y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X_{i1}+\beta _{2}X_{i2}+\ldots +\beta _{p}X_{ip}+\epsilon _{i}} or more compactly Y i = β β 0 + ∑ ∑ k = 1 p β β k X i k + ϵ ϵ i {\displaystyle Y_{i}=\beta _{0}+\sum \limits _{k=1}^{p}{\beta _{k}X_{ik}}+\epsilon _{i}} for each observation i = 1, ... , n .

In the formula above we consider n observations of one dependent variable and p independent variables. Thus, Y i is the i th observation of the dependent variable, X ik is i th observation of the k th independent variable, k = 1, 2, ..., p . The values βk represent parameters to be estimated, and ε i is the i th independent identically distributed normal error.

In the more general multivariate linear regression, there is one equation of the above form for each of m > 1 dependent variables that share the same set of explanatory variables and hence are estimated simultaneously with each other: Y i j = β β 0 j + β β 1 j X i 1 + β β 2 j X i 2 + … … + β β p j X i p + ϵ ϵ i j {\displaystyle Y_{ij}=\beta _{0j}+\beta _{1j}X_{i1}+\beta _{2j}X_{i2}+\ldots +\beta _{pj}X_{ip}+\epsilon _{ij}} or more compactly Y i j = β β 0 j + ∑ ∑ k = 1 p β β k j X i k + ϵ ϵ i j {\displaystyle Y_{ij}=\beta _{0j}+\sum \limits _{k=1}^{p}{\beta _{kj}X_{ik}}+\epsilon _{ij}} for all observations indexed as i = 1, ... , n and for all dependent variables indexed as j = 1 , ...

, m .

Note that, since each dependent variable has its own set of regression parameters to be fitted, from a computational point of view the general multivariate regression is simply a sequence of standard multiple linear regressions using the same explanatory variables.

Comparison to generalized linear model [ edit ] The general linear model and the generalized linear model (GLM) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] are two commonly used families of statistical methods to relate some number of continuous and/or categorical predictors to a single outcome variable .

The main difference between the two approaches is that the general linear model strictly assumes that the residuals will follow a conditionally normal distribution , [ 4 ] while the GLM loosens this assumption and allows for a variety of other distributions from the exponential family for the residuals.

[ 2 ] The general linear model is a special case of the GLM in which the distribution of the residuals follow a conditionally normal distribution.

The distribution of the residuals largely depends on the type and distribution of the outcome variable; different types of outcome variables lead to the variety of models within the GLM family. Commonly used models in the GLM family include binary logistic regression [ 5 ] for binary or dichotomous outcomes, Poisson regression [ 6 ] for count outcomes, and linear regression for continuous, normally distributed outcomes. This means that GLM may be spoken of as a general family of statistical models or as specific models for specific outcome types.

It is usually tested in a univariate way (usually referred to a mass-univariate in this setting) and is often referred to as statistical parametric mapping .
