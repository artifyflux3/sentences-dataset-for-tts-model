It is set in the Stoa of Zeus Eleutherios , and features Socrates in conversation with Critias , Eryxias , and Erasistratus (nephew of Phaeax ).

[ 1 ] The dialogue concerns the topic of wealth and virtue . The position of Eryxias that it is good to be materially prosperous is defeated when Critias argues that having money is not always a good thing. Socrates then shows that money has only a conventional value.

[ 2 ] In an argument addressed to Critias, Socrates concludes that money can never be considered useful, even when it is used to buy something useful.

[ 2 ] The final conclusion of the Eryxias is that the most wealthy are the most wretched because they have so many material wants.
