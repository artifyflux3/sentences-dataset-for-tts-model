[ 1 ] Each chapter of the work focuses on a different mathematician and begins with a biographical overview. Within each chapter, Hawking examines the mathematician’s key discoveries, presents formal proofs of significant results, and explains their impact on the development of the mathematical field.

The title of the book is a reference to a quotation attributed to mathematician Leopold Kronecker , who once wrote that "God made the integers ; all else is the work of man." [ 2 ] Content [ edit ] The works are grouped by author and ordered chronologically. Each section is prefaced by notes on the mathematician's life and work. The anthology includes works by the following mathematicians: Euclid Archimedes Diophantus René Descartes Isaac Newton Leonhard Euler Pierre-Simon Laplace Joseph Fourier Carl Friedrich Gauss Augustin-Louis Cauchy Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky János Bolyai Évariste Galois George Boole Bernhard Riemann Karl Weierstrass Richard Dedekind Georg Cantor Henri Lebesgue Kurt Gödel Alan Turing Selections from the works of Euler, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Galois, which are included in the second edition of the book (published in 2007), were not included in the first edition.
