A Lénárt sphere is an educational manipulative and writing surface for exploring spherical geometry , invented by Hungarian István Lénárt as a modern replacement for a spherical blackboard .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It can be used for visualizing the geometry of points , great and small circles , triangles , polygons , conics , and other objects on a sphere , and comparing spherical geometry to Euclidean geometry as drawn on a flat piece of paper or blackboard. The included spherical ruler and compass support synthetic straightedge and compass construction on the sphere.

Products [ edit ] Equilateral triangle constructed on a Lenart sphere.

The Lénárt sphere and accessories are produced by the company Lénárt Educational Research and Technology.

The basic set includes: [ 3 ] An eight-inch transparent plastic sphere A torus -shaped support to place under the sphere Hemispherical transparencies that fit over the sphere for students to draw on with marker pens or cut out shapes with scissors A spherical ruler with two scaled edges for drawing great-circle arcs and measuring spherical angles and great-circle distances A spherical compass and center locator for drawing small circles A set of wet-wipe markers for writing and drawing on the sphere and transparencies A hanger for displaying spherical constructions and designs A 16-page booklet of suggested activities, "Getting Started on the Lenart Sphere" A four-color polyconic projection of the earth that one can cut out and transform into a globe The company also sells replacement parts, extra transparency sheets, wet-wipe markers , and Lénárt's book Non-Euclidean Adventures on the Lenart Sphere , which describes more activities for students.

Related tools [ edit ] Spherical Easel is an interactive geometry software tool for exploring spherical geometry (see § External links ). Other interactive geometry software is typically limited to the flat plane.

History [ edit ] See also: History of trigonometry Spherical trigonometry is fundamental to ancient astronomy and astrology , celestial navigation , and geodesy and cartography , and it used to be a standard part of undergraduate mathematics education . In recent decades hand computations have been replaced by electronic computers and spherical trigonometry has been pushed out of the typical mathematics curriculum by other topics.

[ 1 ] The Lénárt sphere was invented by István Lénárt in Hungary in the early 1990s and its use is described in his 2003 book comparing planar and spherical geometry.

[ 4 ] The Lénárt sphere is widely used throughout Europe in university courses on non-Euclidean geometry and geographic information systems (GIS).
