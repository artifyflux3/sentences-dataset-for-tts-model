It is both a generalization of the correlated equilibrium perfect information solution concept to bayesian games, and also a broader solution concept than the usual Bayesian Nash equilibrium thereof. Additionally, it can be seen as a generalized multi-player solution of the Bayesian persuasion information design problem.

[ 1 ] Intuitively, a Bayes correlated equilibrium allows for players to correlate their actions in such a way that no player has an incentive to deviate for every possible type they may have. It was first proposed by Dirk Bergemann and Stephen Morris .

[ 2 ] Formal definition [ edit ] Preliminaries [ edit ] Let I {\displaystyle I} be a set of players, and Θ Θ {\displaystyle \Theta } a set of possible states of the world. A game is defined as a tuple G = ⟨ ⟨ ( A i , u i ) i ∈ ∈ I , Θ Θ , ψ ψ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle G=\langle (A_{i},u_{i})_{i\in I},\Theta ,\psi \rangle } , where A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} is the set of possible actions  (with A = ∏ ∏ i ∈ ∈ I A i {\displaystyle A=\prod _{i\in I}A_{i}} ) and u i : A × × Θ Θ → → R {\displaystyle u_{i}:A\times \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is the utility function for each player, and ψ ψ ∈ ∈ Δ Δ + + ( Θ Θ ) {\displaystyle \psi \in \Delta _{++}(\Theta )} is a full support common prior over the states of the world.

An information structure is defined as a tuple S = ⟨ ⟨ ( T i ) i ∈ ∈ I , π π ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle S=\langle (T_{i})_{i\in I},\pi \rangle } , where T i {\displaystyle T_{i}} is a set of possible signals (or types) each player can receive (with T = ∏ ∏ i ∈ ∈ I T i {\displaystyle T=\prod _{i\in I}T_{i}} ), and π π : Θ Θ → → Δ Δ ( T ) {\displaystyle \pi :\Theta \rightarrow \Delta (T)} is a signal distribution function, informing the probability π π ( t | θ θ ) {\displaystyle \pi (t|\theta )} of observing the joint signal t ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle t\in T} when the state of the world is θ θ ∈ ∈ Θ Θ {\displaystyle \theta \in \Theta } .

By joining those two definitions, one can define Γ Γ = ( G , S ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =(G,S)} as an incomplete information game .

[ 3 ] A decision rule for the incomplete information game Γ Γ = ( G , S ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =(G,S)} is a mapping σ σ : T × × Θ Θ → → Δ Δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \sigma :T\times \Theta \rightarrow \Delta (A)} . Intuitively, the value of decision rule σ σ ( a | t , θ θ ) {\displaystyle \sigma (a|t,\theta )} can be thought of as a joint recommendation for players to play the joint mixed strategy σ σ ( ⋅ ⋅ ∣ ∣ t , θ θ ) ∈ ∈ Δ Δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \sigma (\cdot \mid t,\theta )\in \Delta (A)} when the joint signal received is t ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle t\in T} and the state of the world is θ θ ∈ ∈ Θ Θ {\displaystyle \theta \in \Theta } .

Definition [ edit ] A Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE) is defined to be a decision rule σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } which is obedient: that is, one where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from the recommended joint strategy, for any possible type they may be. Formally, decision rule σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is obedient (and a Bayes correlated equilibrium) for game Γ Γ = ( G , S ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =(G,S)} if, for every player i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , every signal t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} and every action a i ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a_{i}\in A_{i}} , we have ∑ ∑ a − − i , t − − i , θ θ ψ ψ ( θ θ ) π π ( t i , t − − i | θ θ ) σ σ ( a i , a − − i | t i , t − − i , θ θ ) u i ( a i , a − − i , θ θ ) {\displaystyle \sum _{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\psi (\theta )\pi (t_{i},t_{-i}|\theta )\sigma (a_{i},a_{-i}|t_{i},t_{-i},\theta )u_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i},\theta )} ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ a − − i , t − − i , θ θ ψ ψ ( θ θ ) π π ( t i , t − − i | θ θ ) σ σ ( a i , a − − i | t i , t − − i , θ θ ) u i ( a i ′ , a − − i , θ θ ) {\displaystyle \geq \sum _{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\psi (\theta )\pi (t_{i},t_{-i}|\theta )\sigma (a_{i},a_{-i}|t_{i},t_{-i},\theta )u_{i}(a'_{i},a_{-i},\theta )} for all a i ′ ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a'_{i}\in A_{i}} .

That is, every player obtains a higher expected payoff by following the recommendation from the decision rule than by deviating to any other possible action.

Relation to other concepts [ edit ] Bayesian Nash equilibrium [ edit ] Every Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) of an incomplete information game can be thought of a as BCE, where the recommended joint strategy is simply the equilibrium joint strategy.

[ 2 ] Formally, let Γ Γ = ( G , S ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =(G,S)} be an incomplete information game, and let s : T → → Δ Δ ( A ) {\displaystyle s:T\rightarrow \Delta (A)} be an equilibrium joint strategy, with each player i {\displaystyle i} playing s i ( a i | t i ) ∈ ∈ Δ Δ ( A i ) {\displaystyle s_{i}(a_{i}|t_{i})\in \Delta (A_{i})} . Therefore, the definition of BNE implies that, for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , t i ∈ ∈ T i {\displaystyle t_{i}\in T_{i}} and a i ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a_{i}\in A_{i}} such that s i ( a i | t i ) > 0 {\displaystyle s_{i}(a_{i}|t_{i})>0} , we have ∑ ∑ a − − i , t − − i , θ θ ψ ψ ( θ θ ) π π ( t i , t − − i | θ θ ) ( ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i s j ( a j | t j ) ) u i ( a i , a − − i , θ θ ) {\displaystyle \sum _{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\psi (\theta )\pi (t_{i},t_{-i}|\theta )\left(\prod _{j\neq i}s_{j}(a_{j}|t_{j})\right)u_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i},\theta )} ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ a − − i , t − − i , θ θ ψ ψ ( θ θ ) π π ( t i , t − − i | θ θ ) ( ∏ ∏ j ≠ ≠ i s j ( a j | t j ) ) u i ( a i ′ , a − − i , θ θ ) {\displaystyle \geq \sum _{a_{-i},t_{-i},\theta }\psi (\theta )\pi (t_{i},t_{-i}|\theta )\left(\prod _{j\neq i}s_{j}(a_{j}|t_{j})\right)u_{i}(a'_{i},a_{-i},\theta )} for every a i ′ ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a'_{i}\in A_{i}} .

If we define the decision rule σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } on Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } as σ σ ( a | t , θ θ ) = s ( a | t ) = ∏ ∏ i s i ( a i | t i ) {\displaystyle \sigma (a|t,\theta )=s(a|t)=\prod _{i}s_{i}(a_{i}|t_{i})} for all t ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle t\in T} and θ θ ∈ ∈ Θ Θ {\displaystyle \theta \in \Theta } , we directly get a BCE.

Correlated equilibrium [ edit ] If there is no uncertainty about the state of the world (e.g., if Θ Θ {\displaystyle \Theta } is a singleton), then the definition collapses to Aumann 's correlated equilibrium solution.

[ 4 ] In this case, σ σ ∈ ∈ Δ Δ ( A ) {\displaystyle \sigma \in \Delta (A)} is a BCE if, for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} , we have [ 1 ] ∑ ∑ a − − i ∈ ∈ A − − i σ σ ( a i , a − − i ) u i ( a i , a − − i ) ≥ ≥ ∑ ∑ a − − i ∈ ∈ A − − i σ σ ( a i , a − − i ) u i ( a i ′ , a − − i ) {\displaystyle \sum _{a_{-i}\in A{-i}}\sigma (a_{i},a_{-i})u_{i}(a_{i},a_{-i})\geq \sum _{a_{-i}\in A{-i}}\sigma (a_{i},a_{-i})u_{i}(a'_{i},a_{-i})} for every a i ′ ∈ ∈ A i {\displaystyle a'_{i}\in A_{i}} , which is equivalent to the definition of a correlated equilibrium for such a setting.

Bayesian persuasion [ edit ] Additionally, the problem of designing a BCE can be thought of as a multi-player generalization of the Bayesian persuasion problem from Emir Kamenica and Matthew Gentzkow .

[ 5 ] More specifically, let v : A × × Θ Θ → → R {\displaystyle v:A\times \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } be the information designer's objective function. Then her ex-ante expected utility from a BCE decision rule σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is given by: [ 1 ] V ( σ σ ) = ∑ ∑ a , t , θ θ ψ ψ ( θ θ ) π π ( t | θ θ ) σ σ ( a | t , θ θ ) v ( a , θ θ ) {\displaystyle V(\sigma )=\sum _{a,t,\theta }\psi (\theta )\pi (t|\theta )\sigma (a|t,\theta )v(a,\theta )} If the set of players I {\displaystyle I} is a singleton, then choosing an information structure to maximize V ( σ σ ) {\displaystyle V(\sigma )} is equivalent to a Bayesian persuasion problem, where the information designer is called a Sender and the player is called a Receiver.
