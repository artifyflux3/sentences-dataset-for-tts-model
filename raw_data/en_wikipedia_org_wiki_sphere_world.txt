The idea of a **sphere-world** was constructed by French mathematician [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") who, while pursuing his argument for [conventionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventionalism "Conventionalism") (see [philosophy of space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_space_and_time "Philosophy of space and time")), offered a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") about a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") with strange properties.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere-world#cite_note-1)

Poincaré asks us to imagine a sphere of radius _R_. The temperature of the sphere decreases from its maximum at the center to absolute zero at its extremity such that a body’s temperature at a distance _r_ from the center is proportional to ![Image 1: {\displaystyle R^{2}-r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec5b0edc54ee6d76ce15c5b5232ce5eca1104485).

In addition, all bodies have the same [coefficient of dilatation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion "Coefficient of thermal expansion") so every body shrinks and expands in similar proportion as they move about the sphere. To finish the story, Poincaré states that the [index of refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") will also vary with the distance _r_, in [inverse proportion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_proportion "Inverse proportion") to ![Image 2: {\displaystyle R^{2}-r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec5b0edc54ee6d76ce15c5b5232ce5eca1104485).

How will this world look to inhabitants of this sphere?

In many ways it will look _normal_. Bodies will remain intact upon transfer from place to place, as well as seeming to remain the same size (the Spherians would shrink along with them). The geometry, on the other hand, would seem quite different. Supposing the inhabitants were to view rods believed to be rigid, or measure [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") with [light rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_beam "Light beam"). They would find that a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") is not a straight line, and that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius is greater than ![Image 3: {\displaystyle 2\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73efd1f6493490b058097060a572606d2c550a06).

These inhabitants would in fact determine that their universe is not ruled by [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), but instead by [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry").

This [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") is discussed in [Roberto Torretti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Torretti "Roberto Torretti")'s book _Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré_[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere-world#cite_note-2) and in [Jeremy Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Gray_(mathematician) "Jeremy Gray (mathematician)")'s article "Epistemology of Geometry" in the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere-world#cite_note-3) This sphere-world is also described in [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician) "Ian Stewart (mathematician)")'s book _[Flatterland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatterland "Flatterland")_ (chapter 10, Platterland).
