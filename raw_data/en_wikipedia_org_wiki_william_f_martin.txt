William Martin (born February 16, 1957, in Bethesda, Maryland ) is an American botanist and microbiologist, currently Head of the Institut für Molekulare Evolution, Heinrich Heine Universität , Düsseldorf .

Born in Bethesda, Maryland , Martin was educated at Richland College , Dallas, Texas, and Texas A&M University . After working as a carpenter in Dallas, Martin moved to Hannover , Germany, and obtained his university Diploma from Technische Universität Hannover in 1985. Martin's PhD is from Max-Planck-Institut für Züchtungsforschung, Cologne , where he did postdoctoral research , followed by further postdoctoral work at Institut für Genetik, Technische Universität Braunschweig , where he obtained his Habilitation in 1992.

[ citation needed ] In 1999, Martin became full (C4) professor at Universität Düsseldorf.

[ citation needed ] Martin is a distinguished and sometimes controversial [ citation needed ] contributor to the field of molecular evolution and the origin of life . He is known particularly for his work on the evolution of the Calvin cycle and plastids including chloroplasts , and, more generally, for contributions to understanding the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells . Martin is co-author, with Miklos Mueller of Rockefeller University , of the 1998 paper The Hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote .

[ 1 ] A wealth of subsequent research papers include contributions, independently and with Michael J. Russell of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , to understanding the geochemical origins of cells and their biochemical pathways. Martin's work is well cited (nearly 30,000 times) and he has an h-index of 95.
