( January 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In physics , a charged particle is a particle with an electric charge . For example, some elementary particles , like the electron or quarks are charged.

[ 1 ] Some composite particles like protons are charged particles.  An ion , such as a molecule or atom with a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons are also charged particles.

A plasma is a collection of charged particles, atomic nuclei and separated electrons, but can also be a gas containing a significant proportion of charged particles.

Charged particles are labeled as either positive (+) or negative (-). The designations are arbitrary. Nothing is inherent to a positively charged particle that makes it "positive", and the same goes for negatively charged particles.

Examples [ edit ] Positively charged particles [ edit ] protons positrons (antielectrons) positively charged pions alpha particles cations Negatively charged particles [ edit ] electrons antiprotons muons tauons negative charged pions anions Particles with zero charge [ edit ] neutrons photons neutrinos neutral pions z boson higgs boson atoms See also [ edit ] Charge carrier – refers to moving charged particles that create an electric current References [ edit ] ^ Frisch, David H.
