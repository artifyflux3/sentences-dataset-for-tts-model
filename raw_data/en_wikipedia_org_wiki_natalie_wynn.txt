She is best known for her YouTube channel, ContraPoints , where she creates video essays exploring topics such as politics , gender , ethics , race , and philosophy .

Her videos often provide counterarguments to right-wing extremists and classical liberals . They comment on modern social issues such as class inequality , transgender rights (as well as LGBTQ rights on the whole), cancel culture , and modern internet culture .

[ 3 ] Her videos make use of set design, costumes, and characters.

[ 4 ] Wynn won a Streamy Award for "Commentary" in 2020 and was nominated in the same category at the 2021 Streamy Awards.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2022, she became an honoree of a Peabody Award .

[ 7 ] Early life Wynn was born on October 21, 1988, in Arlington, Virginia , [ 8 ] and raised in Vienna, Virginia .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Her father is a psychology professor, and her mother is a doctor.

[ 3 ] [ 11 ] After studying piano at Berklee College of Music , [ 12 ] she attended Georgetown University , where she studied philosophy. She then enrolled at Northwestern University to pursue a PhD in philosophy, where she also served as an instructor.

[ 3 ] [ 9 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] She left Northwestern with a master's degree (subsequently stating, "The idea of being an academic for the rest of my life became boring to the point of existential despair"). She moved to Baltimore, Maryland , for a relationship, which ended up failing.

[ 9 ] [ 15 ] After quitting her PhD program, Wynn taught piano and worked as a paralegal , Uber driver , and copywriter . She eventually decided to begin making video responses to the alt-right and Gamergate on YouTube.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] YouTube career Wynn started publishing YouTube videos in 2008, initially focusing on criticism of religion and her position as an atheist and a skeptic . In 2016, she began the ContraPoints channel in reaction to the Gamergate controversy and the increasing prevalence of right-wing YouTubers, shifting her content to countering their arguments.

[ 9 ] [ 13 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Early ContraPoints videos also covered subjects such as race, racism, and online radicalization.

[ 9 ] In her videos, Wynn utilizes philosophy and personal anecdotes not only to explain left-wing ideas but also to criticize typical conservative , classical liberal , alt-right, and fascist talking points.

[ 13 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Wynn's videos often have a combative but humorous tone, containing dark and surreal humor , sarcasm, and sexual themes.

[ 13 ] She usually illustrates concepts by playing different characters who debate one another.

[ 1 ] The videos have been noted for her production choices, such as dramatic lighting and elaborate costumes.

[ 22 ] She borrows some aesthetic cues from drag performance .

[ 23 ] In a 2018 interview for The Verge , journalist Katherine Cross notes a difference between Wynn in person and how she presents herself on YouTube. Cross explains that the channel projects a "blithe, aloof, decadent and disdainful" image, whereas Wynn, personally, "can be earnest—and she cares deeply, almost too much," with Wynn concurring: "Contra has BDE . I do not." [ 4 ] The video channel is financed through the crowdfunding platform Patreon , which has about 32,500 supporters as of March 2024 [update] .

[ 11 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In February 2020, Wynn made all her videos from before August 2017, when she began her gender transition , private, stating that they "no longer represent the person I've become." [ 26 ] She posted transcripts of older videos on her website.

[ 27 ] Wynn provided voice acting for the 2022 Netflix show Bee and PuppyCat .

[ 28 ] Reception Writing for Vice , Jake Hall called Wynn "one of the most incisive and compelling video essayists on YouTube." [ 9 ] New York magazine states, "ContraPoints is very good. Regardless of the viewer's interest or lack thereof in internet culture wars, YouTube Nazis , or any of the other wide-ranging subjects covered in its videos, they're funny, bizarre, erudite, and compelling." [ 13 ] Nathan J. Robinson of Current Affairs calls ContraPoints a "one-woman blitzkrieg against the YouTube right." [ 1 ] Media often describe the channel's content as suited to a millennial audience due to its style and attention to online culture.

[ 1 ] [ 22 ] [ 29 ] The Southern Poverty Law Center has cited her analysis of right-wing use of memes and coded symbols in an article explaining the right-wing use of the OK sign .

[ 21 ] In The Nation , journalist Liza Featherstone recommends the channel, saying that Wynn does a "fabulous job" acknowledging her opponents' valid points while debunking weak arguments and revealing the influence of a sometimes unacknowledged far-right political agenda.

[ 30 ] In November 2018, after a ContraPoints video about incels reached over one million views, The New Yorker carried a report on the channel, describing Wynn as "one of the few Internet demi-celebrities who is as clever as she thinks she is, and one of the few leftists anywhere who can be nuanced without being boring." [ 31 ] The Verge has called Wynn's "confident and indulgent" persona in ContraPoints as " decadent " in "the mold of Oscar Wilde by way of Weird Twitter," commenting on her postmodern rococo set design and the "bewildering" variety of characters she deploys.

[ 4 ] The Atlantic praised the channel's sets, lighting, and music, opining that "the most spectacular attraction [...] is Wynn herself." [ 29 ] Polygon named her video on incels one of the 10 best video essays of the year 2018.

[ 14 ] In May 2019, she topped the Dazed 100 list, which ranks people who "dared to give culture a shot in the arm." [ 32 ] ContraPoints won Best Commentary at the 10th Annual Streamy Awards .

[ 33 ] Pronouns and transmedicalism controversies In September 2019, Wynn described her feelings on Twitter of awkwardness when asked in some contexts to describe her preferred gender pronouns .

[ 34 ] The tweets were criticized as dismissive of non-binary people who use pronouns other than "he/him" and "she/her." [ 35 ] Linguistics professor Lal Zimman said about pronoun introductions, "Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic." [ 34 ] Following constant hostile harassment , Wynn deactivated her Twitter account for a week and then posted an apology.

[ 35 ] Shortly after, Wynn's video "Opulence" featured a quote from John Waters read by transsexual pornographic actor Buck Angel , [ 36 ] whose views on transgender and non-binary people have attracted criticism, including by some who see Angel's opinions as being transmedicalist .

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Wynn was criticized for using Angel in the video.

[ 36 ] At the time, Wynn and other YouTubers associated with her channel were widely harassed online.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Wynn's January 2020 video "Canceling" addressed both criticism of her and harassment and the broader context of cancel culture .

Robby Soave of Reason praised her stance.

[ 37 ] In a Guardian interview on her January 2021 video "J.K. Rowling," in which she addressed cancel culture in the context of trans-exclusionary radical feminists , Wynn stated she is "less interested in cancelling Rowling – whose books [...] she enjoyed as a child – than in prompting her [Wynn's] viewers to consider the possibility of their own lurking transphobia ," adding that she tries to "take a more humanistic perspective when it comes to the topic of bigotry ." [ 11 ] Personal life Wynn is a transgender woman , a matter prominently featured in her videos. She began her gender transition in 2017.

[ 11 ] [ 13 ] She had previously identified as genderqueer .

[ 11 ] [ 38 ] Wynn is a feminist and has called herself a democratic socialist and social democrat . She endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries and supports Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .

[ 4 ] [ 17 ] [ 31 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] As of 2017 [update] , she resides in Baltimore, Maryland.

[ 13 ] In 2020, in a video titled "Shame," she came out as a lesbian .
