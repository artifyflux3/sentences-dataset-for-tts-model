_**Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension**_ (1994, [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) "ISBN (identifier)")[0-19-286189-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-286189-1 "Special:BookSources/0-19-286189-1")) is a book by [Michio Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku "Michio Kaku"), a [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physicist "Theoretical physicist") from the [City College of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York "City College of New York"). It focuses on Kaku's studies of higher [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") referred to as [hyperspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_theory "Hyperspace theory"). The recurring theme of the book is that all four forces of the universe (the [strong force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_force "Strong force"), the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_force "Weak force"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), and [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity")) become more coherent and their description simpler in [higher dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_dimensions "Higher dimensions").

Michio Kaku tries to explain higher dimensions, first analyzing the history of higher dimensions of space and the struggle to unite [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") in [one theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"). He then goes on to detail theories concerning the 2-D world, named "[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland "Flatland")". The end of the book discusses such topics as [wormholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole "Wormhole"), [parallel universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse "Multiverse") and the fate of the universe.

A 1994 review for the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los\_Angeles\_Times "Los Angeles Times")_ noted that the book is not written for physicists, but for the "lay people excited by the possibilities" of their discoveries, and that for them, it is a good fit.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(book)#cite_note-1)

Reviewing the book for _[The Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Observatory\_(journal) "The Observatory (journal)")_ in 1996, [Ian Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Crawford_(astrobiologist) "Ian Crawford (astrobiologist)") was quite negative; noting that he "was disappointed with this book". He criticized "low level of basic scholarship" visible in poor referencing standards, occasional if minor errors, and unwarranted "sweeping generalizations". He also noted that while the book author is acknowledged to be an expert on superstrings, he found the book discussion of this concept quite lacking.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(book)#cite_note-2)

A 2004 review in [SF Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF_Signal "SF Signal") praised the book for engaging, educational writing on an interesting topic, diluted by irrelevant biographical passages.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(book)#cite_note-3)

Michael Starks reviewing the book in 2016 was also more positive, calling it "a lovely book full of fascinating info on the evolution of physics and cosmology".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(book)#cite_note-4)
