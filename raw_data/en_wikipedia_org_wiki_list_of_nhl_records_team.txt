Season records [ edit ] During the first eight years the NHL existed, teams played between 18 and 36 games in a season. Beginning in 1926 , teams played 44–60 games. This ended in 1949 where teams now play 70 or more games. There have been four instances since then when teams have played fewer than 70 games in a season. Both the 1994–95 season and 2012–13 season were reduced to 48 games due to lockouts. The 2019–20 season and 2020–21 season were reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

In 1983 , the NHL added a five-minute overtime, and ties would only occur after 65 minutes. Starting with the 1999-2000 season, the NHL credited one point to the team that lost in overtime, [ 1 ] leading to a system in which teams could potentially earn three points between them in a single game, rather than a fixed number of two previously. In 2005 , the league eliminated ties meaning that any game which went to overtime would be a three-point game. Games that didn't end in overtime would end in a shootout between the two teams. These changes in points awarded therefore make strict comparisons in wins, losses, and ties (after overtime, 1983–99, and in regulation, 1999–present) before and after these dates slightly problematic.

Postseason records [ edit ] Longest playoff game: Detroit Red Wings vs Montreal Maroons on March 24, 1936 (60 minutes of regulation, 116 minutes, 30 seconds of overtime for a total of 176 minutes and 30 seconds . This game had 6 20-minute overtime periods).
