In the philosophy of language and metaphysics , metasemantics is the study of the foundations of natural language semantics (the philosophical study of meaning ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Metasemantics searches for "the proper understanding of compositionality , the object of truth-conditional analysis, metaphysics of reference , as well as, and most importantly, the scope of semantic theory itself" [ 4 ] and asks "how it is that expressions become endowed with their semantic significance ".
