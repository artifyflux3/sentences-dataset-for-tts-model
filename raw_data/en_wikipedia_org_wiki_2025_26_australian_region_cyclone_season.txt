The season will officially start on 1 November 2025 and end on 30 April 2026, however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2025 and 30 June 2026 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by one of the three tropical cyclone warning centres (TCWCs) for the region which are operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , National Weather Service of Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics . The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and other national meteorological services including Météo-France and the Fiji Meteorological Service will also monitor the basin during the season.

Season summary [ edit ] Systems [ edit ] Tropical Low [ edit ] Tropical low (BMKG) Duration 15 July – 16 July ( Exited basin ) Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1003 hPa ( mbar ) See also: List of off-season Australian region tropical cyclones On 15 July, a low-pressure area that had developed out of an equatorial trough which interacted with the Madden-Julian Oscillation gained better characteristics, thus it was noted as the first tropical low, in the area of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta.

[ 1 ] It was the first July tropical low in the Australian region since 2023 . As the system slowly intensified in an area of warm SSTs offset by high shear, a TCFA was issued by the JTWC , shortly before the system exited into the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 16 July.

Tropical Low [ edit ] Tropical low (BMKG) Duration 2 August – 5 August Peak intensity 55 km/h (35 mph) (10-min) ; 1005 hPa ( mbar ) See also: List of off-season Australian region tropical cyclones On 2 August, TCWC Jakarta noted an area of low-pressure in the western reaches of the basin. The JTWC also monitored the system, and issued a TCFA on 4 August, citing expected rapid organization but possibility of high wind shear. On 5 August, as the system failed to consolidate, the JTWC cancelled their TCFA.

Storm names [ edit ] Bureau of Meteorology [ edit ] Main article: Tropical_cyclone_naming § Australian_region_(90°E_–_160°E) The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (TCWC Melbourne) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby .

[ 2 ] Should a tropical low reach tropical cyclone strength within the BoM's area of responsibility, it will be assigned the next name from the following naming list. The names that will be used for the 2025–26 season are listed below: Fina (unused) Grant (unused) Hayley (unused) Iggy (unused) Jenna (unused) Koji (unused) Luana (unused) Mitchell (unused) Narelle (unused) Oran (unused) Peta (unused) Riordan (unused) TCWC Jakarta [ edit ] TCWC Jakarta monitors Tropical Cyclones from the Equator to 11S and from 90E to 145E. Should a Tropical Depression reach Tropical Cyclone strength within TCWC Jakarta's Area of Responsibility then it will be assigned the next name from the following list.

[ 2 ] Bakung (unused) Cempaka (unused) Dahlia (unused) Flamboyan (unused) Kenanga (unused) Lili (unused) TCWC Port Moresby [ edit ] Tropical cyclones that develop north of 11°S between 151°E and 160°E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea . Tropical cyclone formation in this area is rare, with no cyclones being named in it since 2007 .

[ 3 ] As names are assigned in a random order, the whole list is shown below: Alu (unused) Buri (unused) Dodo (unused) Emau (unused) Fere (unused) Hibu (unused) Ila (unused) Kama (unused) Lobu (unused) Maila (unused) Season effects [ edit ] This table lists all of the tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones that were monitored during the 2025–2026 Australian region cyclone season. Information on their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, primarily comes from RSMC Australia. Death and damage reports come from either press reports or the relevant national disaster management agency while the damage totals are given in 2025 or 2026 USD.
