More specifically a stratifold is stratified into differentiable manifolds of (possibly) different dimensions. Stratifolds can be used to construct new homology theories . For example, they provide a new geometric model for ordinary homology. The concept of stratifolds was invented by Matthias Kreck . The basic idea is similar to that of a topologically stratified space , but adapted to differential topology.

Definitions [ edit ] Before we come to stratifolds, we define a preliminary notion, which captures the minimal notion for a smooth structure on a space: A differential space (in the sense of Sikorski) is a pair ( X , C ) , {\displaystyle (X,C),} where X is a topological space and C is a subalgebra of the continuous functions X → → R {\displaystyle X\to \mathbb {R} } such that a function is in C if it is locally in C and g ∘ ∘ ( f 1 , … … , f n ) : X → → R {\displaystyle g\circ \left(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{n}\right):X\to \mathbb {R} } is in C for g : R n → → R {\displaystyle g:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } smooth and f i ∈ ∈ C .

{\displaystyle f_{i}\in C.} A simple example takes for X a smooth manifold and for C just the smooth functions.

For a general differential space ( X , C ) {\displaystyle (X,C)} and a point x in X we can define as in the case of manifolds a tangent space T x X {\displaystyle T_{x}X} as the vector space of all derivations of function germs at x . Define strata X i = { x ∈ ∈ X : T x X {\displaystyle X_{i}=\{x\in X:T_{x}X} has dimension i } .

{\displaystyle \}.} For an n -dimensional manifold M we have that M n = M {\displaystyle M_{n}=M} and all other strata are empty. We are now ready for the definition of a stratifold, where more than one stratum may be non-empty: A k -dimensional stratifold is a differential space ( S , C ) , {\displaystyle (S,C),} where S is a locally compact Hausdorff space with countable base of topology. All skeleta should be closed. In addition we assume: The suspension The ( S i , C | S i ) {\displaystyle \left(S_{i},C|_{S_{i}}\right)} are i -dimensional smooth manifolds.

For all x in S , restriction defines an isomorphism of stalks C x → → C ∞ ∞ ( S i ) x .

{\displaystyle C_{x}\to C^{\infty }(S_{i})_{x}.} All tangent spaces have dimension ≤ k .

For each x in S and every neighbourhood U of x , there exists a function ρ ρ : U → → R {\displaystyle \rho :U\to \mathbb {R} } with ρ ρ ( x ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \rho (x)\neq 0} and supp ( ρ ρ ) ⊂ ⊂ U {\displaystyle {\text{supp}}(\rho )\subset U} (a bump function).

A n -dimensional stratifold is called oriented if its ( n − 1)-stratum is empty and its top stratum is oriented. One can also define stratifolds with boundary, the so-called c-stratifolds . One defines them as a pair ( T , ∂ ∂ T ) {\displaystyle (T,\partial T)} of topological spaces such that T − − ∂ ∂ T {\displaystyle T-\partial T} is an n -dimensional stratifold and ∂ ∂ T {\displaystyle \partial T} is an ( n − 1)-dimensional stratifold, together with an equivalence class of collars .

An important subclass of stratifolds are the regular stratifolds, which can be roughly characterized as looking locally around a point in the i -stratum like the i -stratum times a ( n − i )-dimensional stratifold. This is a condition which is fulfilled in most stratifold one usually encounters.

Examples [ edit ] There are plenty of examples of stratifolds. The first example to consider is the open cone over a manifold M . We define a continuous function from S to the reals to be in C if and only if it is smooth on M × × ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle M\times (0,1)} and it is locally constant around the cone point. The last condition is automatic by point 2 in the definition of a stratifold. We can substitute M by a stratifold S in this construction. The cone is oriented if and only if S is oriented and not zero-dimensional. If we consider the (closed) cone with bottom, we get a stratifold with boundary S .

Other examples for stratifolds are one-point compactifications and suspensions of manifolds, (real) algebraic varieties with only isolated singularities and (finite) simplicial complexes.

Bordism theories [ edit ] An example of a bordism relation In this section, we will assume all stratifolds to be regular. We call two maps S , S ′ → → X {\displaystyle S,S'\to X} from two oriented compact k -dimensional stratifolds into a space X bordant if there exists an oriented ( k + 1)-dimensional compact stratifold T with boundary S + (− S ') such that the map to X extends to T . The set of equivalence classes of such maps S → → X {\displaystyle S\to X} is denoted by S H k X .

{\displaystyle SH_{k}X.} The sets have actually the structure of abelian groups with disjoint union as addition. One can develop enough differential topology of stratifolds to show that these define a homology theory . Clearly, S H k ( point ) = 0 {\displaystyle SH_{k}({\text{point}})=0} for k > 0 {\displaystyle k>0} since every oriented stratifold S is the boundary of its cone, which is oriented if dim ⁡ ⁡ ( S ) > 0.

{\displaystyle \dim(S)>0.} One can show that S H 0 ( point ) ≅ ≅ Z .

{\displaystyle SH_{0}({\text{point}})\cong \mathbb {Z} .} Hence, by the Eilenberg–Steenrod uniqueness theorem, S H k ( X ) ≅ ≅ H k ( X ) {\displaystyle SH_{k}(X)\cong H_{k}(X)} for every space X homotopy-equivalent to a CW-complex , where H denotes singular homology . For other spaces these two homology theories need not be isomorphic (an example is the one-point compactification of the surface of infinite genus).

There is also a simple way to define equivariant homology with the help of stratifolds. Let G be a compact Lie group . We can then define a bordism theory of stratifolds mapping into a space X with a G -action just as above, only that we require all stratifolds to be equipped with an orientation-preserving free G -action and all maps to be G-equivariant. Denote by S H k G ( X ) {\displaystyle SH_{k}^{G}(X)} the bordism classes. One can prove S H k G ( X ) ≅ ≅ H k − − dim ⁡ ⁡ ( G ) G ( X ) {\displaystyle SH_{k}^{G}(X)\cong H_{k-\dim(G)}^{G}(X)} for every X homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex.

Connection to the theory of genera [ edit ] A genus is a ring homomorphism from a bordism ring into another ring. For example, the Euler characteristic defines a ring homomorphism Ω Ω O ( point ) → → Z / 2 [ t ] {\displaystyle \Omega ^{O}({\text{point}})\to \mathbb {Z} /2[t]} from the unoriented bordism ring and the signature defines a ring homomorphism Ω Ω S O ( point ) → → Z [ t ] {\displaystyle \Omega ^{SO}({\text{point}})\to \mathbb {Z} [t]} from the oriented bordism ring . Here t has in the first case degree 1 and in the second case degree 4 , since only manifolds in dimensions divisible by 4 can have non-zero signature. The left hand sides of these homomorphisms are homology theories evaluated at a point. With the help of stratifolds it is possible to construct homology theories such that the right hand sides are these homology theories evaluated at a point, the Euler homology and the Hirzebruch homology respectively.

Umkehr maps [ edit ] Suppose, one has a closed embedding i : N ↪ ↪ M {\displaystyle i:N\hookrightarrow M} of manifolds with oriented normal bundle. Then one can define an umkehr map H k ( M ) → → H k + dim ⁡ ⁡ ( N ) − − dim ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) ( N ) .

{\displaystyle H_{k}(M)\to H_{k+\dim(N)-\dim(M)}(N).} One possibility is to use stratifolds: represent a class x ∈ ∈ H k ( M ) {\displaystyle x\in H_{k}(M)} by a stratifold f : S → → M .

{\displaystyle f:S\to M.} Then make ƒ transversal to N . The intersection of S and N defines a new stratifold S ' with a map to N , which represents a class in H k + dim ⁡ ⁡ ( N ) − − dim ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) ( N ) .

{\displaystyle H_{k+\dim(N)-\dim(M)}(N).} It is possible to repeat this construction in the context of an embedding of Hilbert manifolds of finite codimension, which can be used in string topology .
