[ 1 ] There is a chance it could be on the inner edge of the habitable zone.

[ 2 ] Physical properties [ edit ] Mass, radius and temperature [ edit ] Kepler-737b is an exoplanet with 1.96 R üú® (0.175 R J ). Its mass is unknown, but is estimated at 4.5 M üú® based on a mass-radius relationship.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] If the 4.5-earth mass estimate is correct, this gives the planet an approximate density of 3.3 times that of water, giving it the possibility of being a mini-Neptune or, more favorable to habitability, a water world . Due to its stellar flux 121% that of Venus, it may be a smaller version of GJ 1214b , a classic superpressured water world. The planet's equilibrium temperature is 298 K (25¬†¬∞C).

Star [ edit ] The star's designations include Kepler-737 and KOI-947.

[ 2 ] It is an early M-star . The mass is 0.51 solar masses and its radius is 0.48 times that of the Sun .

[ 2 ] The temperature of the star is 3813 K and its metallicity is -0.24, significantly lower than the Sun's.

[ 2 ] The host star's age is 3.89 billion years, 680 million years younger than the Sun.

[ 5 ] Orbit [ edit ] Kepler-737b orbits its star once every 28.5992 days.

[ 2 ] It may be within the inner part of the habitable zone , depending on the habitable zone model used. The conservative model/models place it over 1 Earth flux level outside of the habitable zone, but some very optimistic models place it inside the far inner section of the extended habitable zone. If it is not a mini-Neptune , then it might have a small chance of being habitable. It would be substantially hotter than Earth , due to its stellar flux 2.297 times that of Earth, [ 3 ] greater than that of Venus , [ 6 ] and resulting equilibrium temperature of 298¬†K (25¬†¬∞C; 77¬†¬∞F).

[ 1 ] Discovery [ edit ] Kepler-737b is a confirmed exoplanet that was found by Kepler using the transit method.

[ 2 ] It was confirmed on May 10, [ 2 ] 2016.

[ 1 ] Nomenclature [ edit ] Kepler-737b is also known as KOI-947.01, KIC 9710326 b, and Gaia DR2 2126820324123177472 b.

[ 2 ] KOI means " Kepler Object of Interest " and KIC means " Kepler Input Catalog ". Gaia is a European satellite that was launched on December 19, 2013.

[ 7 ] Habitability [ edit ] Main article: Habitability of red dwarf systems With a stellar flux 2.297 times that of Earth , [ 3 ] greater than that of Venus , [ 6 ] Kepler-737b is unlikely to be habitable. However, Kepler-737b is considered to be in the habitable zone by the Open Exoplanet Catalogue , [ 2 ] based on an extremely optimistic habitable zone model that also places Venus in the habitable zone.

[ 8 ] Due to its equilibrium temp. of 298 K, with and earth-like GE it would be about sixty degrees Celsius, and with twice its GE, ninety degrees. It is likely tidally locked due to its short orbit; a tidally locked planet would have one side facing the star permanently while the other would be in constant darkness.

[ 9 ] If Kepler-737b has little or no atmosphere, this could make one side too hot to live on, and the other too cold. However, there may be a "sweet spot" in between the two, where liquid water can exist. This spot would be the planet's terminator line . Kepler-737b may instead have atmospheric circulation that would distribute the heat around the planet, potentially making a large portion of it habitable, [ 10 ] although given its stellar flux the most likely scenario is that the planet's surface is too hot to be habitable. Water on Kepler-737b's surface could also distribute heat.

[ 11 ] Kepler-737b's density is unknown, so it could either be a rocky super-Earth or a mini-Neptune . The fact that the planet is quite likely to have no magnetic field [ citation needed ] could spark adaptations to the relatively high radiation level, such as a thick shell of a substance that could repel the radiation or tardigrade -like DNA . In most earthly creatures, DNA is damaged permanently, but with tardigrades, DNA is repairable after being damaged by deadly radiation.

[ 12 ] There is a reduced chance of intelligent life on Kepler-737b due to the fair chance that it is a water world, with no dry land.

[ citation needed ] It is likely substantially hotter than Earth, due to its stellar flux 2.297 times that of Earth [ 3 ] and resulting equilibrium temperature of 298¬†K (25¬†¬∞C; 77¬†¬∞F).

[ 13 ] If ice caps exist, then they would likely be much smaller than Earth's, due to the temperature as well as to the possibility that Kepler-737b has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than Earth.

[ a ] It would have accreted the carbon dioxide by gravity or because water worlds are likely to have a lot of carbon dioxide in their atmospheres.

[ citation needed ] More carbon dioxide in an atmosphere equalizes the temperature.
