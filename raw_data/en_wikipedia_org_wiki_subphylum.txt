In zoological nomenclature , a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum .

The taxonomic rank of " subdivision " in fungi and plant taxonomy is equivalent to "subphylum" in zoological taxonomy. Some plant taxonomists have also used the rank of subphylum, for instance monocotyledons as a subphylum of phylum Angiospermae and vertebrates as a subphylum of phylum Chordata .

[ 1 ] Taxonomic rank [ edit ] Subphylum is: subordinate to the phylum superordinate to the infraphylum , which is in turn superordinate to parvphylum .

[ 2 ] Where convenient, subphyla in turn can be divided into infraphyla ; in turn such an infraphylum also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the hierarchy .

Examples [ edit ] Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include: Arthropoda : divided into subphyla Trilobitomorpha , Chelicerata , Myriapoda , and Pancrustacea Brachiopoda : divided into subphyla Linguliformea , Craniformea and Rhynchonelliformea Chordata : divided into Tunicata , Cephalochordata , and its largest subphylum Vertebrata Examples of infraphyla include the Mycetozoa , the Gnathostomata and the Agnatha .
