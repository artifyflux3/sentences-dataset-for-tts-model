**Harry George Armstrong** (February 17, 1899 – February 5, 1983) was a [major general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States) "Major general (United States)") in the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force"), a physician, and an airman. He is widely recognized as a pioneer in the field of aviation medicine. The [Armstrong limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit "Armstrong limit"), the altitude above which water boils at the temperature of the human body, is named after him.

Armstrong served in the Marines during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the army and air force from 1930 to 1957.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_G._Armstrong#cite_note-afhrastudy91part0-2) As director of the United States Aeromedical Research Laboratory, he applied his medical and aviation knowledge to the improvement of aircrew protection from temperature extremes and the lack of oxygen at high altitude.
