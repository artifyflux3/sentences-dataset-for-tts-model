The " Old World " ( Latin : Mundus vetus ) is a term for Afro-Eurasia coined by Europeans after 1493, when they became aware of the existence of the Americas .

[ 1 ] It is used to contrast the continents of Africa, Europe, and Asia in the Eastern Hemisphere , previously thought of by the Europeans as comprising the entire world, with the " New World ", a term for the newly encountered lands of the Western Hemisphere , particularly the Americas.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] In the context of archaeology and world history , the term "Old World" includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the Bronze Age onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early civilizations , mostly in the temperate zone between roughly the 45th and 25th parallels north, in the area of the Mediterranean , including North Africa . It also included Mesopotamia , the Persian plateau , the Indian subcontinent , China , and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa .

[ citation needed ] These regions were connected via the Silk Road trade route, and they had a pronounced Iron Age period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called Axial Age , referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical Western ( Hellenism , " classical "), Near Eastern ( Zoroastrian and Abrahamic ) and Far Eastern ( Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , Confucianism , Taoism ) cultural spheres .

Other names [ edit ] The mainland of Afro-Eurasia (excluding islands or island groups such as the British Isles , Japan, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and the Malay Archipelago ) has been referred to as the World Island . The term may have been coined by Sir Halford John Mackinder in The Geographical Pivot of History .
