930 , was a Nabataean ( Aramaic -speaking, rural Iraqi) agriculturalist , toxicologist , and alchemist born in Qussīn, near Kufa in Iraq .

[ 2 ] He is the author of the Nabataean Agriculture ( Kitāb al-Filāḥa al-Nabaṭiyya ), an influential Arabic work on agriculture , astrology , and magic .

[ 3 ] Already by the end of the tenth century, various works were being falsely attributed to him.

[ 4 ] One of these spurious writings, the Kitāb Shawq al-mustahām fī maʿrifat rumūz al-aqlām ("The Book of the Desire of the Maddened Lover for the Knowledge of Secret Scripts", perhaps 1022–3 CE ), [ 5 ] is notable as an early proposal that some Egyptian hieroglyphs could be read phonetically , rather than only logographically .

[ 6 ] Name [ edit ] His full name was Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn ʿAlī ibn [Qays ibn] al-Mukhtār ibn ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn Ḥarathyā ibn Badanyā ibn Barṭānyā ibn ʿĀlāṭyā al-Kasdānī al-Ṣūfī .

[ 7 ] Just like the semi-legendary Jabir ibn Hayyan , he carried the nisba al-Ṣūfī despite the fact that he is not known to have engaged in or to have written anything about Sufism .

[ 8 ] The nisba al-Kasdānī is a variant of al-Kaldānī ( 'Chaldaean' ), a term referring to the native inhabitants of Mesopotamia that was also used in Greek , but (given the known -shd-/-ld- variation in Babylonian language ) may perhaps be based on a living oral tradition indigenous to Iraq.

[ 9 ] Biography [ edit ] Ibn Wahshiyya was likely born in Qussīn (Iraq) and died in the year 318 of the Islamic calendar ( = 930-1 CE ). Very little else is known about his life. Our main source of information are Ibn Wahshiyya's own writings, as well as the short entry in Ibn al-Nadim 's (died c. 995 ) Fihrist , where he is explicitly said to be among the "authors whose life is not well known". Ibn Wahshiyya himself claimed to be a descendant of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib ( r.

704 – 681 BCE ), whom the rural, Aramaic -speaking population of southern Iraq (known to Arabic authors of Ibn Wahshiyya's time as 'Nabataeans') revered as their illustrious ancestor. Despite the fact that these Iraqi 'Nabataeans' [ a ] were generally looked down upon as lowly peasants by the contemporary Arab elite, Ibn Wahshiyya identified himself as one of them. Ibn Wahshiyya's self-identification as 'Nabataean' seems credible given the accurate use of Aramaic terms in his works.

[ 10 ] Works [ edit ] Ibn Wahshiyya's works were written down and redacted after his death by his student and scribe Abū Ṭālib al-Zayyāt.

[ 11 ] They were used not only by later agriculturalists, but also by authors of works on magic like Maslama al-Qurṭubī (died 964, author of the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm , "The Aim of the Sage", Latin: Picatrix ), and by philosophers like Maimonides (1138–1204) in his Dalālat al-ḥāʾirīn ("Guide for the Perplexed", c. 1190).

[ 12 ] Ibn al-Nadim , in his Kitāb al-Fihrist (c. 987), lists approximately twenty works attributed to Ibn Wahshiyya. However, most of these were probably not written by Ibn Wahshiyya himself, but rather by other tenth-century authors inspired by him.

[ 13 ] The Nabataean Agriculture [ edit ] Main article: The Nabatean Agriculture Ibn Wahshiyya's major work, the Nabataean Agriculture ( Kitāb al-Filāḥa al-Nabaṭiyya , c. 904), claims to have been translated from an "ancient Syriac" original, written c. 20,000 years ago by the ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia .

[ 14 ] In Ibn Wahshiyya's time, Syriac was thought to have been the primordial language used at the time of creation.

[ 15 ] While the work may indeed have been translated from a Syriac original, [ 16 ] in reality Syriac is a language that only emerged in the first century. By the ninth century, it had become the carrier of a rich literature, including many works translated from the Greek . The book's extolling of Babylonian civilization against that of the conquering Arabs forms part of a wider movement (the Shu'ubiyya movement) in the early Abbasid period (750-945 CE), which witnessed the emancipation of non-Arabs from their former status as second-class Muslims.

[ 17 ] Other works [ edit ] The Book of the Desire of the Maddened Lover for the Knowledge of Secret Scripts [ edit ] One of the works attributed to Ibn Wahshiyya is the Kitāb Shawq al-mustahām fī maʿrifat rumūz al-aqlām ("The Book of the Desire of the Maddened Lover for the Knowledge of Secret Scripts”), a work dealing amongst other things with Egyptian hieroglyphs . Its author refers to his extensive travels in Egypt, but Ibn Wahshiyya himself seems never to have visited Egypt, a country which he barely even mentions in his authentic works. For this and other reasons, scholars believe the work to be spurious .

[ 18 ] According to Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila , it may have been authored by Hasan ibn Faraj, an obscure descendant of the Harranian Sabian scholar Sinan ibn Thabit ibn Qurra ( c.

880–943 ) who claimed to have merely copied the work in the year 413 AH , corresponding to 1022–3 CE.

[ 19 ] The Book of Poisons [ edit ] Another work attributed to Ibn Wahshiyya is a treatise on toxicology called the Book of Poisons , which combines contemporary knowledge on pharmacology with magic and astrology.

[ 20 ] This treatise was strongly influenced by Indian sources.

[ 20 ] Cryptography [ edit ] The works attributed to Ibn Wahshiyya contain several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt magic formulas.

[ 21 ] Later influence [ edit ] Attempted translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs by pseudo-Ibn Wahshiyyah ( from Shawq al-mustahām , Paris MS Arabe 6805, fol 92b–93a).

[ 22 ] Pseudo -Ibn Wahshiyya's Kitāb Shawq al-mustahām fī maʿrifat rumūz al-aqlām ("The Book of the Desire of the Maddened Lover for the Knowledge of Secret Scripts", perhaps 1022–3 CE , see above ), has been claimed by Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly to have correctly identified the phonetic value of a number of Egyptian hieroglyphs .

[ 23 ] However, other scholars have been highly sceptical about El-Daly's claims on the accuracy of these identifications, which betray a keen interest in (as well as some basic knowledge of) the nature of Egyptian hieroglyphs, but are in fact for the most part incorrect.

[ 24 ] The book was translated into English by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall in 1806 as Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained; with an Account of the Egyptian Priests, their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices in the Arabic Language by Ahmad Bin Abubekr Bin Wahishih .

Stephan 2017 , p. 265 affirms that the author correctly deciphered a few signs and that he showed some knowledge on the nature of Egyptian hieroglyphs.
