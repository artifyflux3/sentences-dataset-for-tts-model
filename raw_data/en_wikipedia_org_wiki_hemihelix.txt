Both ends are free to rotate.

A hemihelix is a curved geometric shape consisting of a series of helices with alternating chirality , connected by a perversion at the reversals.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The formation of hemihelices with periodic distributions of perversions in slender structures is understood in terms of competing buckling instabilities generated by in-plane stresses .
