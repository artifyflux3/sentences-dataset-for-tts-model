Development began in 1998 and the first launch took place from the Guiana Space Centre on 13 February 2012.

[ 1 ] It is designed to launch small payloads — 300 to 2,500 kilograms (660 to 5,510 lb) satellites for scientific and Earth observation missions to polar and low Earth orbits.

[ 2 ] The reference Vega mission is a polar orbit bringing a spacecraft of 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb) to an altitude of 700 kilometres (430 mi).

The rocket, named after the star Vega , [ 3 ] is a single-body launcher (no strap-on boosters) with three solid rocket stages: the P80 first stage, the Zefiro 23 second stage, and the Zefiro 9 third stage. The upper module is a liquid rocket called AVUM. The improved version of the P80 stage, the P120C , is also used as the side boosters of the Ariane 6 .

Italy is the leading contributor to the Vega program (65%), followed by France (13%).

[ 4 ] Other participants include Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland and Sweden .
