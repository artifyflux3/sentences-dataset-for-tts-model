The variable _y_ is directly proportional to the variable _x_ with proportionality constant ~0.6.

The variable _y_ is inversely proportional to the variable _x_ with proportionality constant 1.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), two [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of numbers, often [experimental data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_data "Experimental data"), are **proportional** or **directly proportional** if their corresponding elements have a constant [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio"). The ratio is called _**coefficient of proportionality**_ (or _**proportionality constant**_) and its reciprocal is known as _**constant of normalization**_ (or _**normalizing constant**_). Two sequences are **inversely proportional** if corresponding elements have a constant [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)").

Two [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")![Image 3: {\displaystyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle g(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6ca91363022bd5e4dcb17e5ef29f78b8ef00b59) are _proportional_ if their ratio ![Image 5: {\textstyle {\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/102bc2ce010b8b1133e1f4cf7953b2a19e6524d3) is a [constant function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function "Constant function").

If several pairs of variables share the same direct proportionality constant, the [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") expressing the equality of these ratios is called a **proportion**, e.g., ⁠_a_/_b_⁠ = ⁠_x_/_y_⁠ = ⋯ = _k_ (for details see [Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio")). Proportionality is closely related to _[linearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity "Linearity")_.

Direct proportionality
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proportionality_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Direct proportionality")]

Given an [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)#Dependent_and_independent_variables "Variable (mathematics)")_x_ and a dependent variable _y_, _y_ is **directly proportional** to _x_[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)#cite_note-1) if there is a positive constant _k_ such that:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle y=kx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a0ce87b0aaacaad25a36d2f52dc1fae2ead92689)
The relation is often denoted using the symbols "∝" (not to be confused with the Greek letter [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha "Alpha")) or "~", with exception of Japanese texts, where "~" is reserved for intervals:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle y\propto x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b6f3478f6e9a02ccaba915d97e73241e540b75c) (or ![Image 8: {\displaystyle y\sim x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c54fe8e222fd770c44b4df39405b2616532a976))
For ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x\neq 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35a455db7b2aab1b0e72ccbc7385e4424e2372e5) the **proportionality constant** can be expressed as the ratio:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle k={\frac {y}{x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c57718f06c0377edf7d3ffcfa34c4e4c93bc0ac)
It is also called the **constant of variation** or **constant of proportionality**. Given such a constant _k_, the proportionality [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") ∝ with proportionality constant _k_ between two sets _A_ and _B_ is the [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") defined by ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \{(a,b)\in A\times B:a=kb\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e493e4f1002b7d1fe8dcd61827f60e65f399496)

A direct proportionality can also be viewed as a [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") in two variables with a [_y_-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept "Y-intercept") of 0 and a [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of _k_> 0, which corresponds to [linear growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_growth "Linear growth").

*   If an object travels at a constant [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"), then the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") traveled is directly proportional to the [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") spent traveling, with the speed being the constant of proportionality.
*   The [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference") of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") is directly proportional to its [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"), with the constant of proportionality equal to [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi").
*   On a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map "Map") of a sufficiently small geographical area, drawn to [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map) "Scale (map)") distances, the distance between any two points on the map is directly proportional to the beeline distance between the two locations represented by those points; the constant of proportionality is the scale of the map.
*   The [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)"), acting on a small object with small [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") by a nearby large extended mass due to [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), is directly proportional to the object's mass; the constant of proportionality between the force and the mass is known as [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration").
*   The net force acting on an object is proportional to the acceleration of that object with respect to an inertial frame of reference. The constant of proportionality in this, [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law"), is the classical mass of the object.

Inverse proportionality
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proportionality_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Inverse proportionality")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Inverse_proportionality_function_plot.gif/330px-Inverse_proportionality_function_plot.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inverse_proportionality_function_plot.gif)

Inverse proportionality with product _x y_ = 1 .

Two variables are **inversely proportional** (also called **varying inversely**, in **inverse variation**, in **inverse proportion**)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)#cite_note-2) if each of the variables is directly proportional to the [multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") (reciprocal) of the other, or equivalently if their [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") is a constant.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) It follows that the variable _y_ is inversely proportional to the variable _x_ if there exists a non-zero constant _k_ such that

![Image 13: {\displaystyle y={\frac {k}{x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec505faf6069cc9862860354e3208a2223cccf63)
or equivalently, ![Image 14: {\displaystyle xy=k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58a68fcbf4e4a86e5465ac0a30d2092b8fab34ef). Hence the constant "_k_" is the product of _x_ and _y_.

The graph of two variables varying inversely on the [Cartesian coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") plane is a [rectangular hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_hyperbola "Rectangular hyperbola"). The product of the _x_ and _y_ values of each point on the curve equals the constant of proportionality (_k_). Since neither _x_ nor _y_ can equal zero (because _k_ is non-zero), the graph never crosses either axis.

Direct and inverse proportion contrast as follows: in direct proportion the variables increase or decrease together. With inverse proportion, an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. For instance, in travel, a constant speed dictates a direct proportion between distance and time travelled; in contrast, for a given distance (the constant), the time of travel is inversely proportional to speed: _s_ × _t_ = _d_.

Hyperbolic coordinates
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proportionality_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Hyperbolic coordinates")]

The concepts of _direct_ and _inverse_ proportion lead to the location of points in the Cartesian plane by [hyperbolic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_coordinates "Hyperbolic coordinates"); the two coordinates correspond to the constant of direct proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular [ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics)#Ray "Line (mathematics)") and the [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(mathematics) "Constant (mathematics)") of inverse proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola").
