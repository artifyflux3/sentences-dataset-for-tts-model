**Methylene** (IUPAC name: **methylidene**, also called **carbene** or **methene**) is an [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") with the [chemical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula "Chemical formula")CH

2 (also written [CH

2] and not to be confused with [compressed hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_hydrogen "Compressed hydrogen"), which is also denoted CH

2). It is a colourless gas that fluoresces in the mid-infrared range, and only persists in dilution, or as an [adduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct "Adduct").

Methylene is the simplest [carbene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbene "Carbene").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-hoff-3): p.7 [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-4) It is usually detected only at [very low temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics "Cryogenics") or as a short-lived intermediate in [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-demben-5)

The [trivial name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_name "Trivial name")_carbene_ is the [preferred IUPAC name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_IUPAC_name "Preferred IUPAC name").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-Powell_2013_p1054-2) The systematic names _methylidene_ and _dihydridocarbon_, valid [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC "IUPAC") names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively.

_Methylidene_ is viewed as [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") with two hydrogen atoms removed. By default, this name pays no regard to the radicality of the methylene. Although in a context where the radicality is considered, it can also name the non-radical [excited state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state"), whereas the radical [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state") with two unpaired electrons is named _methanediyl_.

_Methylene_ is also used as the trivial name for the [substituent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent "Substituent") groups _methanediyl_ (>CH

2), and _methylidene_ (=CH

2). It was introduced as early as 1835 by French chemists [Jean-Baptiste Dumas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Dumas "Jean-Baptiste Dumas") and [Eugene Peligot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Peligot "Eugene Peligot") after determining [methanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol "Methanol")'s chemical structure. They coined it the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")[μέθυ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%B8%CF%85#Ancient_Greek "wikt:μέθυ") (_methy_) "wine" and [ὕλη](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BD%95%CE%BB%CE%B7#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ὕλη") (_hȳlē_) "wood, patch of trees" (even though the correct Greek word for the substance "wood" is _xylo-_) with the intention of highlighting its origins, 'alcohol made from wood (substance)'.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-6)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Propene_Methylidene_Structural_Formulae_V.1.svg/250px-Propene_Methylidene_Structural_Formulae_V.1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Propene_Methylidene_Structural_Formulae_V.1.svg)

The blue part of this diagram of a [propene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propene "Propene") molecule is a **methylidene** group.

A **methylidene group** is any part of a molecule that consists of a CH 2= group.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-7) The group may be represented as =CH 2, where the '=' denotes the double bond.

In contrast, methylene is connected to the rest of the molecule by two [single bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_bond "Single bond").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-8) The distinction is often important, because the double bond is chemically different from two single bonds.

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Methylenecyclopropene.svg/250px-Methylenecyclopropene.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Methylenecyclopropene.svg)

[3-Methylidenecycloprop-1-ene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenecyclopropene "Methylenecyclopropene") is named as a cyclopropene with a methylidene substituent.

The same name (methylidene) was used for the distinct molecule CH 2, also known as [carbene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbene "Carbene").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-9) Formerly the methylene name was used for all three isomers (methylene, methylidene, and carbene).

Many organic compounds are named and classified as if they were the result of [substituting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent "Substituent") a methylidene group for two [adjacent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminal "Geminal") hydrogen atoms of some parent molecule (even if they are not actually obtained that way). Thus, for example, [methylenecyclopropene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenecyclopropene "Methylenecyclopropene") is named after [cyclopropene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopropene "Cyclopropene").

Methylene can be prepared by decomposition of compounds with a methylidene or methanediyl group, such as [ketene (ethenone)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethenone "Ethenone") (CH 2=CO), [diazomethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazomethane "Diazomethane") (linear CH 2=N 2), [diazirine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazirine "Diazirine") (cyclic [−CH 2−N=N−]) and [diiodomethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diiodomethane "Diiodomethane") (I−CH 2−I). The decomposition can be effected by [photolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis "Photolysis"), [photosensitized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitization "Photosensitization") reagents (such as [benzophenone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzophenone "Benzophenone")), or thermal decomposition.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-demben-5)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10) Methylene can be produced by [photolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis "Photolysis") of [diazomethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazomethane "Diazomethane").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-11) In its [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") spectrum, gaseous methylene absorbs at around 141.5 nm. It was shown to have a bond angle of about 140°.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-12)

The reactions of methylene were also studied around 1960 by [infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy") using [matrix isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_isolation "Matrix isolation") experiments.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-dempri-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-jacox-14)

Chemical properties
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methylene_(compound)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Chemical properties")]

Many of methylene's electronic states lie relatively close to each other, giving rise to varying degrees of radical chemistry. The ground state is a triplet radical with two unpaired electrons (_X_̃3 _B_ 1),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10) and the first excited state is a singlet non-radical (_ã_ 1 _A_ 1). With the singlet non-radical only 38 kJ above the ground state,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10) a sample of methylene exists as a mixture of electronic states even at room temperature, giving rise to complex reactions. For example, reactions of the triplet radical with non-radical species generally involves abstraction, whereas reactions of the singlet non-radical not only involves abstraction, but also insertion or addition.

The singlet state is also more [stereospecific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_isomer "Stereo isomer") than the triplet.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10)

Methylene spontaneously autopolymerises to form various excited oligomers, the simplest of which, is the excited form of the [alkene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkene "Alkene")[ethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene "Ethylene"). The excited oligomers, decompose rather than decay to a ground state. For example, the excited form of ethylene decomposes to acetylene and atomic hydrogen.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10)

The ground state of methylene has an [ionisation energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy "Ionization energy") of 10.396[eV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt "Electronvolt"). It has a bent configuration, with H–C–H angle of 133.84[°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10) and is thus [paramagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetic "Paramagnetic"). (The correct prediction of this angle was an early success of [ab initio quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods "Ab initio quantum chemistry methods").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10)) However conversion to a linear configuration requires only 5.5[kcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilocalorie "Kilocalorie")/[mol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit) "Mole (unit)").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10)

The singlet state has a slightly higher energy (by about 9 kcal/mol) than the triplet state,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10) and its H–C–H angle is smaller, about 102°. In dilute mixtures with an inert gas, the two states will convert to each other until reaching an equilibrium.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-shav-10)

Neutral methylene complexes undergo different [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reactions "Chemical reactions") depending on the pi character of the coordinate bond to the carbon centre. A weak contribution, such as in diazomethane, yields mainly substitution reactions, whereas a strong contribution, such as in [ethenone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethenone "Ethenone"), yields mainly addition reactions. Upon treatment with a standard base, complexes with a weak contribution convert to a metal methoxide. With strong acids (e.g., [fluorosulfuric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorosulfuric_acid "Fluorosulfuric acid")), they can be protonated to give CH

3 L+

. Oxidation of these complexes yields formaldehyde, and reduction yields methane.

Free methylene undergoes the typical [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") of a [carbene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbene#Reactivity "Carbene"). [Addition reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition_reaction "Addition reaction") are very fast and exothermic.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-lazar-15)

When the methylene molecule is in its [state of lowest energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state "Ground state"), the unpaired valence electrons are in separate [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") with independent [spins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)"), a configuration known as [triplet state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_state "Triplet state").

Methylene is also a common [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand "Ligand") in [coordination compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_compound "Coordination compound"), such as [copper methylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Copper_methylene&action=edit&redlink=1 "Copper methylene (page does not exist)")CuCH

2.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-chang-16)

Methylene can bond as a terminal ligand, which is called _methylidene_, or as a bridging ligand, which is called _methanediyl_.

The formula of the methylene molecule (CH 2) was mentioned as part of a [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company "The Walt Disney Company") comic by the [Donald Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck "Donald Duck") character in a comic in 1944 in a humorous vein. In the same spirit, the comic was eventually cited in the scientific literature by Peter Gaspar and [George S.Hammond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Hammond "George S. Hammond").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-18) The comic has been cited in other sources since, including a widely adopted textbook in organic chemistry by Robert Morrison and Robert Boyd.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_(compound)#cite_note-19)
