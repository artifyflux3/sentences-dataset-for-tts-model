This makes the set of critical values "small" in the sense of a generic property . The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard .

Statement [ edit ] More explicitly, [ 1 ] let f : : R n ‚Üí ‚Üí R m {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{m}} be C k {\displaystyle C^{k}} , (that is, k {\displaystyle k} times continuously differentiable ), where k ‚â• ‚â• max { n ‚àí ‚àí m + 1 , 1 } {\displaystyle k\geq \max\{n-m+1,1\}} . Let X ‚äÇ ‚äÇ R n {\displaystyle X\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} denote the critical set of f , {\displaystyle f,} which is the set of points x ‚àà ‚àà R n {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}} at which the Jacobian matrix of f {\displaystyle f} has rank < m {\displaystyle <m} .  Then the image f ( X ) {\displaystyle f(X)} has Lebesgue measure 0 in R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} .

Intuitively speaking, this means that although X {\displaystyle X} may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while f {\displaystyle f} may have many critical points in the domain R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , it must have few critical values in the image R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} .

More generally, the result also holds for mappings between differentiable manifolds M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} of dimensions m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} , respectively. The critical set X {\displaystyle X} of a C k {\displaystyle C^{k}} function f : N ‚Üí ‚Üí M {\displaystyle f:N\rightarrow M} consists of those points at which the differential d f : T N ‚Üí ‚Üí T M {\displaystyle df:TN\rightarrow TM} has rank less than m {\displaystyle m} as a linear transformation. If k ‚â• ‚â• max { n ‚àí ‚àí m + 1 , 1 } {\displaystyle k\geq \max\{n-m+1,1\}} , then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of X {\displaystyle X} has measure zero as a subset of M {\displaystyle M} .  This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches.  The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism .

Variants [ edit ] There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case m = 1 {\displaystyle m=1} was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939, [ 2 ] and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942.

[ 1 ] A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale .

[ 3 ] The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted ‚Äî as in the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and some applications in Morse theory ‚Äî in order to prove the weaker corollary that ‚Äúa non-constant smooth map has at least one regular value‚Äù.

In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if f : N ‚Üí ‚Üí M {\displaystyle f:N\rightarrow M} is C ‚àû ‚àû {\displaystyle C^{\infty }} and if A r ‚äÜ ‚äÜ N {\displaystyle A_{r}\subseteq N} is the set of points x ‚àà ‚àà N {\displaystyle x\in N} such that d f x {\displaystyle df_{x}} has rank less or equal than r {\displaystyle r} , then the Hausdorff dimension of f ( A r ) {\displaystyle f(A_{r})} is at most r {\displaystyle r} .
