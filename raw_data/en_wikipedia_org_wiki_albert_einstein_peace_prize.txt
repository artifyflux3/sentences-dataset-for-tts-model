( January 2016 ) The Albert Einstein Peace Prize was a peace prize awarded annually since 1980 by the Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation . The Foundation dates from 1979, the centenary of the birth of Albert Einstein , and evokes the Russell–Einstein Manifesto which urges nuclear disarmament . It was established, with the sponsorship of the trustees of Einstein's estate , [ 1 ] by William M. Swartz (1912–87) a wealthy businessman and the grandfather of activist Aaron Swartz .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] William M. Swartz was involved in the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and established the Foundation in part to support Pugwash.

[ 6 ] Prize winners, mainly active in nuclear disarmament, [ 7 ] receive(d) $50,000.

The last known Albert Einstein Peace Prize was awarded in 1992, to Joseph Rotblat and Hans Bethe at a conference marking the fiftieth anniversary of Chicago Pile-1. Subsequent evidence, including public obituaries and the absence of publicized activity or awards since a 1992 conference, suggests the Foundation became inactive or defunct after that time and has not awarded new prizes since 1992.

[ 8 ] Winners of the Albert Einstein Peace Prize Year Winner Notes Refs 1980 Alva Myrdal For "her outspoken insistence on action by the great powers toward control over their nuclear competition and for her major contributions to the achievement of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1969, and agreements prohibiting the deployment of nuclear weapons on the seabed and in space ." [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 1981 George F. Kennan "For his continuing efforts to reduce tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and the world in general." Kennan had not heard of the prize when informed he had won it. His conferral ceremony was attended by members of the Reagan administration and Anatoly Dobrynin .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] 1982 McGeorge Bundy , Robert McNamara , Gerard C. Smith Joint award for opposing pre-emptive nuclear strikes [ 6 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] 1983 Joseph Bernardin for his part in drafting the U.S. bishops'  pastoral letter calling for new arms agreements [ 3 ] [ 16 ] 1984 Pierre Trudeau for working to promote disarmament [ 17 ] [ 18 ] 1985 Willy Brandt [ 19 ] 1986 Olof Palme Awarded posthumously for "wide-ranging efforts on behalf of peace" [ 3 ] [ 20 ] 1988 Andrei Sakharov [ 21 ] 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev [ 22 ] 1992 Joseph Rotblat and Hans Bethe Conferred at a conference marking the fiftieth anniversary of Chicago Pile-1 .
