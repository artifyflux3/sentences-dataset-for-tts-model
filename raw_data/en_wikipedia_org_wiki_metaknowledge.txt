[ 1 ] Some authors divide meta-knowledge into orders: zero order meta-knowledge is knowledge whose domain is not knowledge (and hence zero order meta-knowledge is not meta-knowledge per se ) first order meta-knowledge is knowledge whose domain is zero order meta-knowledge second order meta-knowledge is knowledge whose domain is first order meta-knowledge most generally, n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} order meta-knowledge is knowledge whose domain is n {\displaystyle n} order meta-knowledge.

[ 2 ] Other authors call zero order meta-knowledge first order knowledge , and call first order meta-knowledge second order knowledge ; meta-knowledge is also known as higher order knowledge .

[ 3 ] Meta-knowledge is a fundamental conceptual instrument in such research and scientific domains as, knowledge engineering , knowledge management , and others dealing with study and operations on knowledge, seen as a unified object /entities, abstracted from local conceptualizations and terminologies.
Examples of the first-level individual meta-knowledge are methods of planning, modeling, tagging , learning and every modification of a domain knowledge . 
Indeed, universal meta-knowledge frameworks have to be valid for the organization of meta-levels of individual meta-knowledge.

Meta-knowledge may be automatically harvested from electronic publication archives, to reveal patterns in research, relationships between researchers and institutions  and to identify contradictory results.
