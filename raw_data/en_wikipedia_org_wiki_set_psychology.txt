A perceptual set , also called perceptual expectancy , is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.

[ 1 ] Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.

[ 2 ] They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room , or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.

[ 3 ] A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem.

[ 4 ] It can be shaped by habit or by desire.

[ 5 ] Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.

[ 4 ] [ 6 ] Perceptual [ edit ] Perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise.

[ 7 ] A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".

[ 3 ] Sets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous situations so that they see what they want to see.

[ 7 ] For instance, a person's experience of the events in a sports match can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.

[ 8 ] In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.

[ 1 ] Perceptual sets have been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing.

[ 3 ] Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.

[ 3 ] Mental [ edit ] Mental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way, [ 6 ] either helping or interfering in the discovery of a solution.

[ 6 ] They are shaped by past experiences, habits, [ 9 ] and, most importantly, culture .

[ 10 ] These sets also exist as parts of our cognitive processes although they do not always enter consciousness.

[ 6 ] This is demonstrated in the way bookkeepers can balance their book without being aware of using addition or subtraction.

[ 11 ] An inappropriate mental set hampers the solution of straightforward problems.

[ 3 ] This could happen if the set contains a false assumption or a belief that is not correct.

[ 6 ] For example, when people are asked, "When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried.

[ 6 ] A specific form of mental set is functional fixedness , in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put.

[ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 9 ] An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.
