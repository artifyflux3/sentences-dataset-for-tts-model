{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \alpha }{\sin \beta }}<{\frac {\alpha }{\beta }}<{\frac {\tan \alpha }{\tan \beta }}.} Ptolemy used the first of these inequalities while constructing his table of chords .

[ 1 ] Proof [ edit ] The proof is a consequence of the more widely known inequalities 0 < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) < α α < tan ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) {\displaystyle 0<\sin(\alpha )<\alpha <\tan(\alpha )} , 0 < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) < 1 {\displaystyle 0<\sin(\beta )<\sin(\alpha )<1} and 1 > cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) > cos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) > 0 {\displaystyle 1>\cos(\beta )>\cos(\alpha )>0} .

Proof of the first inequality [ edit ] Using these inequalities we can first prove that sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) < α α β β .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin(\alpha )}{\sin(\beta )}}<{\frac {\alpha }{\beta }}.} We first note that the inequality is equivalent to sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) α α < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) β β {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin(\alpha )}{\alpha }}<{\frac {\sin(\beta )}{\beta }}} which itself can be rewritten as sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) α α − − β β < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) β β .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin(\alpha )-\sin(\beta )}{\alpha -\beta }}<{\frac {\sin(\beta )}{\beta }}.} We now want to show that sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) α α − − β β < cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) β β .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin(\alpha )-\sin(\beta )}{\alpha -\beta }}<\cos(\beta )<{\frac {\sin(\beta )}{\beta }}.} The second inequality is simply β β < tan ⁡ ⁡ β β {\displaystyle \beta <\tan \beta } . The first one is true because sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) α α − − β β = 2 ⋅ ⋅ sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α − − β β 2 ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α + β β 2 ) α α − − β β < 2 ⋅ ⋅ ( α α − − β β 2 ) ⋅ ⋅ cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) α α − − β β = cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin(\alpha )-\sin(\beta )}{\alpha -\beta }}={\frac {2\cdot \sin \left({\frac {\alpha -\beta }{2}}\right)\cos \left({\frac {\alpha +\beta }{2}}\right)}{\alpha -\beta }}<{\frac {2\cdot \left({\frac {\alpha -\beta }{2}}\right)\cdot \cos(\beta )}{\alpha -\beta }}=\cos(\beta ).} Proof of the second inequality [ edit ] Now we want to show the second inequality, i.e. that: α α β β < tan ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) tan ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\alpha }{\beta }}<{\frac {\tan(\alpha )}{\tan(\beta )}}.} We first note that due to the initial inequalities we have that: β β < tan ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) = sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) {\displaystyle \beta <\tan(\beta )={\frac {\sin(\beta )}{\cos(\beta )}}<{\frac {\sin(\beta )}{\cos(\alpha )}}} Consequently, using that 0 < α α − − β β < α α {\displaystyle 0<\alpha -\beta <\alpha } in the previous equation (replacing β β {\displaystyle \beta } by α α − − β β < α α {\displaystyle \alpha -\beta <\alpha } ) we obtain: α α − − β β < sin ⁡ ⁡ ( α α − − β β ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) = tan ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) .

{\displaystyle {\alpha -\beta }<{\frac {\sin(\alpha -\beta )}{\cos(\alpha )}}=\tan(\alpha )\cos(\beta )-\sin(\beta ).} We conclude that α α β β = α α − − β β β β + 1 < tan ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) + 1 = tan ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) tan ⁡ ⁡ ( β β ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\alpha }{\beta }}={\frac {\alpha -\beta }{\beta }}+1<{\frac {\tan(\alpha )\cos(\beta )-\sin(\beta )}{\sin(\beta )}}+1={\frac {\tan(\alpha )}{\tan(\beta )}}.} See also [ edit ] Aristarchus of Samos Eratosthenes Posidonius Notes and references [ edit ] ^ Toomer, G. J.
