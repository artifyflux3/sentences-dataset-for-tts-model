[ 1 ] It is also known as the section symbol , section mark , double-s , or silcrow .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In other languages it may be called the "paragraph symbol" (for example, German : Paragrafzeichen ). The section sign typically appears akin to a letter S stacked on top of another S.

[ 4 ] Use The section sign is often used when referring to a specific section of a legal code . For example, in Bluebook style, " Title 16 of the United States Code Section 580p" becomes "16 U.S.C. § 580p".

[ 5 ] The section sign is frequently used along with the pilcrow (or paragraph sign ), ¶ , to reference a specific paragraph within a section of a document. However, some jurisdiction prefer the sign be avoided, and rather that the word "section" be written out in full.

[ 6 ] While § is usually read in spoken English as the word "section", many other languages use the word "paragraph" exclusively to refer to a section of a document (especially of legal text), and use other words to describe a paragraph in the English sense. Consequently, in those cases "§" may be read as " paragraph" , and may occasionally also be described as a "paragraph sign", but this is a description of its usage, not a formal name.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] When duplicated, as §§ , it is read as the plural "sections". For example, "§§ 13–21" would be read as "sections 13 through 21", much as pp.

(pages) is the plural of p.

, meaning page .
It may also be used with footnotes when asterisk * , dagger † , and double dagger ‡ have already been used on a given page.

It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space so that the symbol is kept with the section number being cited.

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] : 212, 233 Unicode Two common representations of the section sign The section sign appeared in several early computer text encodings. It was placed at 0xA7 (167) in ISO-8859-1 , a position that was inherited by Unicode as code point U+00A7 § SECTION SIGN .  Representation of the sign is an artistic decision within the overall design language of the typeface (or computer font ): the two more commonly seen forms are shown here.

[ 10 ] In all cases, the sign is encoded by U+00A7.

Origin Two possible origins are often posited for the section sign: most probably, that it is a ligature formed by the combination of two S glyphs (from the Latin signum sectiōnis ).

[ 11 ] [ 2 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Some scholars, however, are skeptical of this explanation.

[ 14 ] Others have theorized that it is an adaptation of the Ancient Greek παράγραφος ( paragraphos ), [ 12 ] a catch-all term for a class of punctuation marks used by scribes with diverse shapes and intended uses.

[ 15 ] The modern form of the sign, with its modern meaning, has been in use since the 15th century .

[ 16 ] In literature In Jaroslav Hašek 's The Good Soldier Švejk , the § symbol is used repeatedly to mean " bureaucracy ". In his English translation of 1930, Paul Selver translated it as " red tape ".
