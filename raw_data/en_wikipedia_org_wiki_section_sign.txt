The **section sign** (**§**) is a [typographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical "Typographical")[character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(symbol) "Character (symbol)") for referencing individually numbered [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(documents) "Section (documents)") of a document; it is frequently used when citing sections of a [legal code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_code "Legal code").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Standler-1) It is also known as the **section symbol**, **section mark**, **double-s**, or **silcrow**.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Radoeva2017-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Butterick-3) In other languages it may be called the "paragraph symbol" (for example, [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _Paragrafzeichen_). The section sign typically appears akin to a letter S stacked on top of another S.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-4)

Use
---

The section sign is often used when referring to a specific section of a [legal code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_code "Legal code"). For example, in [Bluebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebook "Bluebook") style, "[Title 16 of the United States Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_16_of_the_United_States_Code "Title 16 of the United States Code") Section 580p" becomes "16 U.S.C. §580p".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-GL-BB-5) The section sign is frequently used along with the _[pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow "Pilcrow")_ (or _paragraph sign_), ¶, to reference a specific [paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph "Paragraph") within a section of a document. However, some jurisdiction prefer the sign be avoided, and rather that the word "section" be written out in full.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-6)

While § is usually read in spoken English as the word "section", many other languages use the word "paragraph" exclusively to refer to a section of a document (especially of legal text), and use other words to describe a paragraph in the English sense. Consequently, in those cases "§" may be read as "_paragraph"_, and may occasionally also be described as a "paragraph sign", but this is a description of its usage, not a formal name.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-unicode-latin1-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-radar-8)

When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections". For example, "§§13–21" would be read as "sections 13 through 21", much as pp. (pages) is the plural of p., meaning [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(paper) "Page (paper)"). It may also be used with footnotes when [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk")*, [dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark) "Dagger (mark)")†, and [double dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark) "Dagger (mark)")‡ have already been used on a given page.

It is common practice to follow the section sign with a [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space") so that the symbol is kept with the section number being cited.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Standler-1)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Felici-9): 212, 233

Two common representations of the section sign

The section sign appeared in several early computer text encodings. It was placed at 0xA7 (167) in [ISO-8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-8859-1 "ISO-8859-1"), a position that was inherited by Unicode as [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point")U+00A7§SECTION SIGN. Representation of the sign is an artistic decision within the overall design language of the typeface (or [computer font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font "Computer font")): the two more commonly seen forms are shown here.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-10) In all cases, the sign is encoded by U+00A7.

Origin
------

Two possible origins are often posited for the section sign: most probably, that it is a [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_ligature "Typographical ligature") formed by the combination of two [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S "S") glyphs (from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin")_[signum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:signum#Latin "wikt:en:signum")[sectiōnis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:sectio#Latin "wikt:en:sectio")_).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Webb-2018-11)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Radoeva2017-2)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Webster1886-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-13) Some scholars, however, are skeptical of this explanation.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-14)

Others have theorized that it is an adaptation of the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")παράγραφος (_[paragraphos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraphos "Paragraphos")_),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-Webster1886-12) a catch-all term for a class of [punctuation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_marks "Punctuation marks") used by [scribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribes "Scribes") with diverse shapes and intended uses.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-15)

The modern form of the sign, with its modern meaning, has been in use since the [15th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_century "15th century").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign#cite_note-16)

In literature
-------------

In [Jaroslav Hašek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Ha%C5%A1ek "Jaroslav Hašek")'s _[The Good Soldier Švejk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Good\_Soldier\_%C5%A0vejk "The Good Soldier Švejk")_, the § symbol is used repeatedly to mean "[bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy")". In his English translation of 1930, [Paul Selver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Selver "Paul Selver") translated it as "[red tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape "Red tape")".
