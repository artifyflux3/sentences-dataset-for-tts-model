Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States , Bangladesh , Brazil and Eastern India , but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe , Asia , and Australia .

There were 916 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in 2013. One of these tornadoes was the largest ever to be seen , with a peak width of 2.6 mi (4.2 km). A total of 120 fatalities were confirmed worldwide in 2013: 55 in the United States, 36 in Bangladesh, 24 in China , three in Turkey , and two in Brazil . Despite the high death toll along with several large outbreaks, the year was below average in terms of the number of tornadoes that occurred. This is also the most recent year to have an F5/EF5/IF5 tornado.

On April 1, Canada began utilizing the Enhanced Fujita scale to rate tornadoes with minor modifications to better suit the region's tornadoes.

[ 5 ] Synopsis [ edit ] Map of the tracks of all tornadoes in the United States in 2013 Entering 2013, the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for the three-month period lasting from November 2012 to January 2013 based on sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies was -0.3, denoting cooler than normal SSTs in areas of the Pacific.

[ 6 ] Throughout early to mid-January in the United States, there was isolated tornado activity, centered primarily in the South .

[ 7 ] In late-January, an unusually strong upper-level trough combined with atmospheric instability produced a widespread tornado outbreak over the Southern United States.

[ 8 ] The strongest of these tornadoes was an EF3, the first intense tornado confirmed in the U.S. in 2013.

[ 9 ] In eastern Australia, the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Oswald produced significant flooding in conjunction with tornadoes in late January.

[ 10 ] A small outbreak on February 10 spawned an EF4 tornado that affected Hattiesburg, Mississippi .

A period of inactivity followed the early weeks of the year. Both March and April had near-record low activity, which was attributed to cold air persisting over much of the continental U.S., preventing any significant severe weather from occurring (and allowing for late-season winter storms). However, this pattern changed abruptly in mid-May as a significant outbreak struck towns in north-central Texas , followed closely by a much larger outbreak that affected much of the Midwestern and Southern U.S., especially in Oklahoma . On May 20, an EF5 tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma . Another powerful outbreak struck the Midwest and Ark-La-Tex area in the final week of May. The outbreak produced the widest tornado in recorded history, just west of Oklahoma City that hit areas just south and southeast of El Reno on May 31, killing storm chaser Tim Samaras and his two partners and injuring The Weather Channel 's Mike Bettes' Tornado Hunt team.

June and July were both below average for tornadoes, and August and September were generally near average for tornadoes. Early October featured a very small outbreak of tornadoes over Nebraska and Iowa ; however, two of the tornadoes were violent enough to be rated EF4. Another small outbreak with mostly weak tornadoes ended the month, pushing October activity to near average. After a lull in activity during the first half of November, a large outbreak occurred on November 17, producing 77 tornadoes and killing seven people. Overall, November was slightly above average for tornadoes. December was below average for tornadoes, with only 18, causing 2013 to end with a record low tornado count with adjustments made for undercounting tornadoes in earlier years.

The warm air mass was followed by a strong cold front , [ 8 ] causing temperatures to fall below freezing.

[ 9 ] With increased instability in the region, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) formed and moved across the area ahead of the cold front, producing numerous tornadoes and wind-related damage.

[ 8 ] Over a two-day period from January 29 to January 30, 962 tornado, hail, and strong wind reports were received by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). Of these, 83 were tornado-related reports.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The strongest of these tornadoes occurred on January 30 and affected areas of Bartow and Gordon Counties in Georgia . The high-end EF3 killed one person in Adairsville , ending a record 220‑day streak without a tornado-related fatality in the United States, with the last death occurring due to an EF2 tornado associated with Tropical Storm Debby in Florida in June 2012.

[ 15 ] The 66 confirmed tornadoes was the third most ever recorded to occur in January.

[ 16 ] The outbreak was the largest January-tornado outbreak in Middle Tennessee , which confirmed 22 tornadoes.

EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 1 5 1 0 1 0 As a large and powerful area of low pressure moved across the northern Plains, powerful severe thunderstorms developed across a trailing cold front. These storms, located across Louisiana and Mississippi primarily, prompted many tornado warnings, with eight tornadoes touching down. One of the supercells produced four tornadoes with the first one being rated EF2. The second tornado was the one that struck Hattiesburg. Shortly after 5:00 pm CST (2300 UTC), the "large and extremely dangerous tornado" was confirmed southwest of Hattiesburg, Mississippi ; this wedge tornado, documented by locals and storm chasers, moved through the city after prompting a tornado emergency for the surrounding locations.

[ 17 ] Severe to locally catastrophic damage was reported in Hattiesburg and the nearby city of Petal , leaving 71 people injured. The tornado was initially rated an EF3, but was later upgraded to an EF4.

[ 18 ] Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant issued a State of emergency for Forrest , Lamar , Lawrence , and Marion Counties due to the impact of the severe storms and tornadoes in those counties.

[ 19 ] February 21 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 1 4 1 0 0 0 On February 21, a deep upper-level trough moved across the Central Plains, resulting in a small tornado event that produced six tornadoes. An EF1 tornado north of Pineland, Texas, killed a 74-year-old woman when a tree fell on her mobile home.

[ 20 ] March 18 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 4 3 3 0 0 0 A strong upper level system with a moist south to southeast flow produced severe weather, including several tornadoes that injured 13 people altogether, across the Southern United States , especially Tennessee , Alabama , and Georgia .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] An EF1 tornado near Boaz, Alabama destroyed two mobile homes and overturned another, injuring three people.

[ 23 ] An EF2 tornado struck Kilpatrick, Alabama causing significant damage to several mobile homes and destroying two others, injuring seven people. Another EF2 caused severe to outbuildings and chicken houses near Rainsville . Near Greenville, South Carolina , an EF2 tornado caused considerable damage to homes and barns.

[ 24 ] Hail associated with the severe weather event was the mostly costliest hailstorm to impact Jackson, Mississippi as of 2015, [ 25 ] while high wind gusts also associated with the severe weather event caused at least 100,000 power outages across Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.

[ 22 ] [ 26 ] April 7–11 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 9 14 4 1 0 0 As a powerful trough moved into the Rocky Mountains , return flow from the Gulf of Mexico provided ample moisture for the development of severe thunderstorms. This resulted in a moderate multi-day tornado outbreak that produced 28 tornadoes. A brief rope tornado was reported on April 7, near Paradise, Kansas , but no damage was reported.

[ 27 ] The following day, several tornadoes were reported in Colorado , Kansas , and Nebraska . The first tornado (rated EF0) touched down in Kit Carson County, Colorado , causing no damage. The second tornado (rated EF1) touched down shortly before 0300 UTC in Nebraska , causing substantial damage to a farm and feed yard. Cars and trucks were flipped off of highways, power poles and trees were snapped, and many buildings were damaged.

[ 28 ] No tornadoes were observed the following day, April 9, due to an inversion aloft, but many reports of large hail were received from Iowa to Texas .

[ 29 ] As the system pushed eastward across Missouri and Arkansas , and as a warm front drifted northward, severe thunderstorms broke out along both boundaries. Several storms in association with a squall line caused damaging winds. That evening, a damaging EF2 tornado touched down in the St. Louis suburb of Hazelwood, Missouri , tearing the roofs off of several homes and apartment buildings, downing numerous trees and power lines, and flipping many cars. Another EF2 tornado touched down in Van Buren County, Arkansas , prompting a tornado emergency. Significant damage was reported near Scotland , including many vehicles thrown off the road and many homes and other buildings being destroyed.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] The supercell that spawned the Scotland area tornado also produced a damaging EF2 near Mt. Olive as well.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] On April 11, a supercell ahead of the squall line developed in eastern Mississippi . A large wedge tornado touched down in Kemper County and moved into Noxubee County and Pickens County, Alabama . The tornado was rated EF3 and was on the ground for 68.4 miles (110.1 km). Several homes, a metal tower structure, and a steel-frame building were destroyed by the tornado.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] One person was killed and five were injured in Kemper County and another four people were injured in Noxubee County.

[ 34 ] A total of seven counties in Mississippi reported damage.

[ 35 ] Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for Kemper and Noxubee counties due to the impacts of the tornado.

[ 36 ] Later that evening, an EF2 tornado passed west of Notasulga, Alabama and heavily damaged several homes and mobile homes. One mobile home was completely destroyed, and a well-built house received major damage to an outer wall and lost its entire roof. Trees and headstones were knocked over, and one person was injured by flying glass.

[ 37 ] Other weaker tornadoes were confirmed across parts of Louisiana , Alabama , and Georgia before the outbreak came to an end.

[ 38 ] April 17–19 [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 10 12 2 0 0 0 On April 17, a powerful upper-level low pressure system and associated warm front developed across the central United States. The Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe weather for much of central Oklahoma , including a 15% hatched risk of tornadoes, some of which were predicted to be strong.

[ 39 ] Several supercell thunderstorms developed that evening and rapidly became severe. Multiple tornadoes touched down across the risk area that evening and overnight, though all were weak and relatively brief.

[ 40 ] A few weak tornadoes also touched down in Texas and Missouri .

[ 41 ] Tornadoes continued touching down early into the morning of the 18th, including an EF2 that caused considerable damage near Zena, Oklahoma .

[ 42 ] Other weak tornadoes occurred later that afternoon in Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana .

[ 41 ] The system also caused one tornado to touch down near Shelburne, Ontario (rated by Environment Canada to be an EF1, Canada's first tornado to be rated as such as the ratings are transitioned to the Enhanced Fujita Scale ).

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Isolated tornado activity continued on the 19th, with several touchdowns occurring mostly across the eastern United States. Five tornadoes were confirmed, including an EF2 that caused severe damage in the town of Mansfield, Georgia .

During the evening and overnight hours of May 19, tornadic activity became more sparse, with a few tornadoes reported in Iowa , Illinois , and Missouri .

[ 55 ] At least two tornadoes were confirmed in Iowa, one near Huxley and another near Earlham . The touchdowns in Iowa marked the end of a 358‑day span with no tornadoes in the state.

[ 58 ] On the afternoon of May 20, a large, violent tornado touched down west of Newcastle, Oklahoma and impacted the town of Moore , causing severe damage to residential areas as well as Plaza Towers and Briarwood Elementary schools. The Oklahoma Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed 24 fatalities, 7 of which were schoolchildren at Plaza Towers Elementary.

[ 59 ] After being preliminarily rated a high-end EF4, it was increased, and the tornado was given a final rating of EF5. The tornado followed a path similar to that of the F5 tornado that hit the area on May 3, 1999 . The tornado became the first EF5 tornado in nearly two years.

On May 21, an EF2 tornado touched down near the small community of Glenarm, Ontario about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west of Fenelon Falls , and Environment Canada confirmed that the roof of a home was torn off by the tornado and a barn was destroyed. No injuries were reported in this storm. This was Ontario's second tornado of the 2013 season.

A large, slow moving system produced 134 tornadoes across the Great Plains in the last week of May. Many tornadoes, some strong to violent, touched down across Kansas and Nebraska from the 27th through the 29th, with weaker tornadoes recorded in other states.

[ 62 ] One of the most notable tornadoes of the outbreak was a 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide wedge tornado that struck near El Reno, Oklahoma on the evening of May 31. It was the widest tornado ever recorded. The tornado was initially rated an EF5, with estimated winds being measured at >295 miles per hour (475 km/h) by a mobile Doppler radar; however, the worst damage was rated EF3, thus on August 30, 2013, the tornado's rating was downgraded to EF3.

[ 63 ] Eight deaths were attributed to this tornado including four storm chasers; TWISTEX project leader Tim Samaras , his son Paul, fellow chaser Carl Young, and amateur storm chaser Richard Charles Henderson.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] That same evening, a large EF3 tornado moved through several St. Louis suburbs, resulting in major damage and two injuries.

[ 98 ] Europe [ edit ] See also: List of European tornadoes in 2013 European yearly total [ edit ] Unlike the United States and Canada, the majority of Europe uses the TORRO scale and the Fujita scale to classify tornadoes. The European Severe Storms Laboratory maintains a database of all severe weather events across the continent. The vast majority of tornadoes go unrated due to a lack of surveys; however, some nations, such as France , provide detailed reports on these events. Of the 57 reported tornadoes during 2013, only 18 have been rated thus far.

[ 99 ] Totals are derived from this database and considered preliminary.

The first tornado was a high-end F2 that impacted the Castelfranco Emilia area, causing severe damage along a 18 km path. The tornado severely damaged multiple farm homes, some of which sustained roof loss and some collapse of exterior walls. Vehicles were flipped, light poles were toppled, and large trees were snapped or uprooted as well. Warehouses also sustained major damage along the path. After the initial tornado dissipated, the same supercell then produced a large, high-end F3 tornado that struck near Argelato , causing major damage along a 20 km path and injuring 12 people. Well-built brick farm homes were heavily damaged, and a few were largely destroyed. Trees were snapped and denuded by the tornado, and vehicles were thrown and destroyed. Near Mirandola , a strong F2 tornado damaged some buildings and injured one person. A total of three tornadoes were recorded, 13 people were injured, 119 people were made homeless, and large hail (up to 8 cm) caused severe damage to buildings and agriculture.

May 22 (Russia) [ edit ] On May 22, an F2 tornado struck the town of Yefremov, Russia , damaging 200 homes and leaving 100 million rubles (US$31.9 million) in losses.

One of these storms produced a destructive F3 tornado near the town of Châtillon-sur-Seine , France, in the department of Côte-d'Or . In addition to the tornado, the parent supercell thunderstorm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from multiple microbursts , which occurred in the rough terrain surrounding Châtillon-sur-Seine. The tornadic supercell that produced this tornado formed around 4:45 pm local time. A high-precipitation type supercell, the storm quickly developed a significant downdraft. The tornado was estimated to have touched down around 5:40 pm along the north side of the rear-flank downdraft. Moving along an intermittent path to the northeast and later east-northeast, the tornado fluctuated between F1 and F2 intensity. As the storm moved over Étrochey , the tornado reached F3 strength and destroyed a stone barn, debarked and defoliated trees, broke concrete electrical poles, and tossed a heavy gate several hundred meters. Other structures in the area sustained major roof damage, and tiles from the roofs of damaged buildings were found up to 500 m (550 yd) away embedded in the ground. As it moved into Montliot-et-Courcelles , a home was largely destroyed, with debris strewn over several hundred meters, and other nearby homes were damaged as well. Overall, the tornado moved along a discontinuous path 14 km (8.7 mi) long and reached a maximum width of 250 m (270 yd). A total of 20 homes were severely damaged or destroyed while 190 more sustained varying degrees of damage. One person sustained minor injuries in relation to the tornado. This was the strongest tornado in France since the deadly 2008 F4 Hautmont tornado .
