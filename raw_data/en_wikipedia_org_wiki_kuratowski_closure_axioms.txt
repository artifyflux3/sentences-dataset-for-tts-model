They are equivalent to the more commonly used open set definition. They were first formalized by Kazimierz Kuratowski , [ 1 ] and the idea was further studied by mathematicians such as Wacław Sierpiński and António Monteiro , [ 2 ] among others.

A similar set of axioms can be used to define a topological structure using only the dual notion of interior operator .

[ 3 ] Definition [ edit ] Kuratowski closure operators and weakenings [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an arbitrary set and ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} its power set . A Kuratowski closure operator is a unary operation c : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} with the following properties: [K1] It preserves the empty set : c ( ∅ ∅ ) = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\varnothing )=\varnothing } ; [K2] It is extensive : for all A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , A ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ) {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A)} ; [K3] It is idempotent : for all A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , c ( A ) = c ( c ( A ) ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)=\mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (A))} ; [K4] It preserves / distributes over binary unions : for all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , c ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = c ( A ) ∪ ∪ c ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A\cup B)=\mathbf {c} (A)\cup \mathbf {c} (B)} .

A consequence of c {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} } preserving binary unions is the following condition: [ 4 ] [K4'] It is monotone : A ⊆ ⊆ B ⇒ ⇒ c ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( B ) {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\Rightarrow \mathbf {c} (A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} (B)} .

In fact if we rewrite the equality in [K4] as an inclusion, giving the weaker axiom [K4''] ( subadditivity ): [K4''] It is subadditive : for all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , c ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ) ∪ ∪ c ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A\cup B)\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A)\cup \mathbf {c} (B)} , then it is easy to see that axioms [K4'] and [K4''] together are equivalent to [K4] (see the next-to-last paragraph of Proof 2 below).

Kuratowski (1966) includes a fifth (optional) axiom requiring that singleton sets should be stable under closure: for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , c ( { x } ) = { x } {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\{x\})=\{x\}} . He refers to topological spaces which satisfy all five axioms as T 1 -spaces in contrast to the more general spaces which only satisfy the four listed axioms. Indeed, these spaces correspond exactly to the topological T 1 -spaces via the usual correspondence (see below).

[ 5 ] If requirement [K3] is omitted, then the axioms define a Čech closure operator .

[ 6 ] If [K1] is omitted instead, then an operator satisfying [K2] , [K3] and [K4'] is said to be a Moore closure operator .

[ 7 ] A pair ( X , c ) {\displaystyle (X,\mathbf {c} )} is called Kuratowski , Čech or Moore closure space depending on the axioms satisfied by c {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} } .

Alternative axiomatizations [ edit ] The four Kuratowski closure axioms can be replaced by a single condition, given by Pervin: [ 8 ] [P] For all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , A ∪ ∪ c ( A ) ∪ ∪ c ( c ( B ) ) = c ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ∖ ∖ c ( ∅ ∅ ) {\displaystyle A\cup \mathbf {c} (A)\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (B))=\mathbf {c} (A\cup B)\setminus \mathbf {c} (\varnothing )} .

Axioms [K1] – [K4] can be derived as a consequence of this requirement: Choose A = B = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A=B=\varnothing } . Then ∅ ∅ ∪ ∪ c ( ∅ ∅ ) ∪ ∪ c ( c ( ∅ ∅ ) ) = c ( ∅ ∅ ) ∖ ∖ c ( ∅ ∅ ) = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing \cup \mathbf {c} (\varnothing )\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (\varnothing ))=\mathbf {c} (\varnothing )\setminus \mathbf {c} (\varnothing )=\varnothing } , or c ( ∅ ∅ ) ∪ ∪ c ( c ( ∅ ∅ ) ) = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\varnothing )\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (\varnothing ))=\varnothing } . This immediately implies [K1] .

Choose an arbitrary A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} and B = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle B=\varnothing } . Then, applying axiom [K1] , A ∪ ∪ c ( A ) = c ( A ) {\displaystyle A\cup \mathbf {c} (A)=\mathbf {c} (A)} , implying [K2] .

Choose A = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A=\varnothing } and an arbitrary B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle B\subseteq X} . Then, applying axiom [K1] , c ( c ( B ) ) = c ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (B))=\mathbf {c} (B)} , which is [K3] .

Choose arbitrary A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} . Applying axioms [K1] – [K3] , one derives [K4] .

Alternatively, Monteiro (1945) had proposed a weaker axiom that only entails [K2] – [K4] : [ 9 ] [M] For all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , A ∪ ∪ c ( A ) ∪ ∪ c ( c ( B ) ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\textstyle A\cup \mathbf {c} (A)\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (B))\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A\cup B)} .

Requirement [K1] is independent of [M] : indeed, if X ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle X\neq \varnothing } , the operator c ⋆ ⋆ : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ^{\star }:\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} defined by the constant assignment A ↦ ↦ c ⋆ ⋆ ( A ) := X {\displaystyle A\mapsto \mathbf {c} ^{\star }(A):=X} satisfies [M] but does not preserve the empty set, since c ⋆ ⋆ ( ∅ ∅ ) = X {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ^{\star }(\varnothing )=X} . Notice that, by definition, any operator satisfying [M] is a Moore closure operator.

A more symmetric alternative to [M] was also proven by M. O. Botelho and M. H. Teixeira to imply axioms [K2] – [K4] : [ 2 ] [BT] For all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , A ∪ ∪ B ∪ ∪ c ( c ( A ) ) ∪ ∪ c ( c ( B ) ) = c ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\textstyle A\cup B\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (A))\cup \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (B))=\mathbf {c} (A\cup B)} .

Analogous structures [ edit ] Interior, exterior and boundary operators [ edit ] A dual notion to Kuratowski closure operators is that of Kuratowski interior operator , which is a map i : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} :\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} satisfying the following similar requirements: [ 3 ] [I1] It preserves the total space : i ( X ) = X {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} (X)=X} ; [I2] It is intensive : for all A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , i ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} (A)\subseteq A} ; [I3] It is idempotent : for all A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} , i ( i ( A ) ) = i ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} (\mathbf {i} (A))=\mathbf {i} (A)} ; [I4] It preserves binary intersections : for all A , B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B\subseteq X} , i ( A ∩ ∩ B ) = i ( A ) ∩ ∩ i ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} (A\cap B)=\mathbf {i} (A)\cap \mathbf {i} (B)} .

For these operators, one can reach conclusions that are completely analogous to what was inferred for Kuratowski closures. For example, all Kuratowski interior operators are isotonic , i.e. they satisfy [K4'] , and because of intensivity [I2] , it is possible to weaken the equality in [I3] to a simple inclusion.

The duality between Kuratowski closures and interiors is provided by the natural complement operator on ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} , the map n : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} :\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} sending A ↦ ↦ n ( A ) := X ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle A\mapsto \mathbf {n} (A):=X\setminus A} . This map is an orthocomplementation on the power set lattice, meaning it satisfies De Morgan's laws : if I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} is an arbitrary set of indices and { A i } i ∈ ∈ I ⊆ ⊆ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \{A_{i}\}_{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\subseteq \wp (X)} , n ( ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I A i ) = ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I n ( A i ) , n ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I A i ) = ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I n ( A i ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {n} \left(\bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}A_{i}\right)=\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\mathbf {n} (A_{i}),\qquad \mathbf {n} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}A_{i}\right)=\bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\mathbf {n} (A_{i}).} By employing these laws, together with the defining properties of n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } , one can show that any Kuratowski interior induces a Kuratowski closure (and vice versa), via the defining relation c := n i n {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :=\mathbf {nin} } (and i := n c n {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} :=\mathbf {ncn} } ). Every result obtained concerning c {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} } may be converted into a result concerning i {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} } by employing these relations in conjunction with the properties of the orthocomplementation n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } .

Pervin (1964) further provides analogous axioms for Kuratowski exterior operators [ 3 ] and Kuratowski boundary operators , [ 10 ] which also induce Kuratowski closures via the relations c := n e {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :=\mathbf {ne} } and c ( A ) := A ∪ ∪ b ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A):=A\cup \mathbf {b} (A)} .

Abstract operators [ edit ] Main article: Interior algebra Notice that axioms [K1] – [K4] may be adapted to define an abstract unary operation c : L → → L {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :L\to L} on a general bounded lattice ( L , ∧ ∧ , ∨ ∨ , 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (L,\land ,\lor ,\mathbf {0} ,\mathbf {1} )} , by formally substituting set-theoretic inclusion with the partial order associated to the lattice, set-theoretic union with the join operation, and set-theoretic intersections with the meet operation; similarly for axioms [I1] – [I4] . If the lattice is orthocomplemented, these two abstract operations induce one another in the usual way. Abstract closure or interior operators can be used to define a generalized topology on the lattice.

Since neither unions nor the empty set appear in the requirement for a Moore closure operator, the definition may be adapted to define an abstract unary operator c : S → → S {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :S\to S} on an arbitrary poset S {\displaystyle S} .

Connection to other axiomatizations of topology [ edit ] Induction of topology from closure [ edit ] A closure operator naturally induces a topology as follows. Let X {\displaystyle X} be an arbitrary set. We shall say that a subset C ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle C\subseteq X} is closed with respect to a Kuratowski closure operator c : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} if and only if it is a fixed point of said operator, or in other words it is stable under c {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} } , i.e.

c ( C ) = C {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (C)=C} . The claim is that the family of all subsets of the total space that are complements of closed sets satisfies the three usual requirements for a topology, or equivalently, the family S [ c ] {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} of all closed sets satisfies the following: [T1] It is a bounded sublattice of ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} , i.e.

X , ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\displaystyle X,\varnothing \in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} ; [T2] It is complete under arbitrary intersections , i.e. if I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} is an arbitrary set of indices and { C i } i ∈ ∈ I ⊆ ⊆ S [ c ] {\displaystyle \{C_{i}\}_{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\subseteq {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} , then ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\textstyle \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} ; [T3] It is complete under finite unions , i.e. if I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} is a finite set of indices and { C i } i ∈ ∈ I ⊆ ⊆ S [ c ] {\displaystyle \{C_{i}\}_{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\subseteq {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} , then ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I C i ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\textstyle \bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} .

Notice that, by idempotency [K3] , one may succinctly write S [ c ] = im ⁡ ⁡ ( c ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]=\operatorname {im} (\mathbf {c} )} .

Proof 1.

[T1] By extensivity [K2] , X ⊆ ⊆ c ( X ) {\displaystyle X\subseteq \mathbf {c} (X)} and since closure maps the power set of X {\displaystyle X} into itself (that is, the image of any subset is a subset of X {\displaystyle X} ), c ( X ) ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (X)\subseteq X} we have X = c ( X ) {\displaystyle X=\mathbf {c} (X)} . Thus X ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\displaystyle X\in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} .  The preservation of the empty set [K1] readily implies ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\displaystyle \varnothing \in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} .

[T2] Next, let I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} be an arbitrary set of indices and let C i {\displaystyle C_{i}} be closed for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in {\mathcal {I}}} .  By extensivity [K2] , ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ⊆ ⊆ c ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ) {\textstyle \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\subseteq \mathbf {c} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\right)} .  Also, by isotonicity [K4'] , if ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ⊆ ⊆ C i {\textstyle \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\subseteq C_{i}} for all indices i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in {\mathcal {I}}} , then c ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( C i ) = C i {\textstyle \mathbf {c} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\right)\subseteq \mathbf {c} (C_{i})=C_{i}} for all i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in {\mathcal {I}}} , which implies c ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ) ⊆ ⊆ ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i {\textstyle \mathbf {c} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\right)\subseteq \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}} .  Therefore, ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i = c ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ) {\textstyle \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}=\mathbf {c} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\right)} , meaning ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I C i ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\textstyle \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} .

[T3] Finally, let I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} be a finite set of indices and let C i {\displaystyle C_{i}} be closed for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in {\mathcal {I}}} .  From the preservation of binary unions [K4] , and using induction on the number of subsets of which we take the union, we have ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I C i = c ( ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I C i ) {\textstyle \bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}=\mathbf {c} \left(\bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\right)} . Thus, ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I C i ∈ ∈ S [ c ] {\textstyle \bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}C_{i}\in {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} .

Induction of closure from topology [ edit ] Conversely, given a family κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } satisfying axioms [T1] – [T3] , it is possible to construct a Kuratowski closure operator in the following way: if A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} and A ↑ ↑ = { B ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) | A ⊆ ⊆ B } {\displaystyle A^{\uparrow }=\{B\in \wp (X)\ |\ A\subseteq B\}} is the inclusion upset of A {\displaystyle A} , then c κ κ ( A ) := ⋂ ⋂ B ∈ ∈ ( κ κ ∩ ∩ A ↑ ↑ ) B {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A):=\bigcap _{B\in (\kappa \cap A^{\uparrow })}B} defines a Kuratowski closure operator c κ κ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }} on ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} .

Proof 2.

[K1] Since ∅ ∅ ↑ ↑ = ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \varnothing ^{\uparrow }=\wp (X)} , c κ κ ( ∅ ∅ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(\varnothing )} reduces to the intersection of all sets in the family κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } ; but ∅ ∅ ∈ ∈ κ κ {\displaystyle \varnothing \in \kappa } by axiom [T1] , so the intersection collapses to the null set and [K1] follows.

[K2] By definition of A ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle A^{\uparrow }} , we have that A ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} for all B ∈ ∈ ( κ κ ∩ ∩ A ↑ ↑ ) {\displaystyle B\in \left(\kappa \cap A^{\uparrow }\right)} , and thus A {\displaystyle A} must be contained in the intersection of all such sets. Hence follows extensivity [K2] .

[K3] Notice that, for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} , the family c κ κ ( A ) ↑ ↑ ∩ ∩ κ κ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)^{\uparrow }\cap \kappa } contains c κ κ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)} itself as a minimal element w.r.t. inclusion. Hence c κ κ 2 ( A ) = ⋂ ⋂ B ∈ ∈ c κ κ ( A ) ↑ ↑ ∩ ∩ κ κ B = c κ κ ( A ) {\textstyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }^{2}(A)=\bigcap _{B\in \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)^{\uparrow }\cap \kappa }B=\mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)} , which is idempotence [K3] .

[K4'] Let A ⊆ ⊆ B ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\subseteq X} : then B ↑ ↑ ⊆ ⊆ A ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle B^{\uparrow }\subseteq A^{\uparrow }} , and thus κ κ ∩ ∩ B ↑ ↑ ⊆ ⊆ κ κ ∩ ∩ A ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \kappa \cap B^{\uparrow }\subseteq \kappa \cap A^{\uparrow }} . Since the latter family may contain more elements than the former, we find c κ κ ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c κ κ ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)} , which is isotonicity [K4'] . Notice that isotonicity implies c κ κ ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c κ κ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A\cup B)} and c κ κ ( B ) ⊆ ⊆ c κ κ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A\cup B)} , which together imply c κ κ ( A ) ∪ ∪ c κ κ ( B ) ⊆ ⊆ c κ κ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\cup \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A\cup B)} .

[K4] Finally, fix A , B ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A,B\in \wp (X)} . Axiom [T2] implies c κ κ ( A ) , c κ κ ( B ) ∈ ∈ κ κ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A),\mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\in \kappa } ; furthermore, axiom [T2] implies that c κ κ ( A ) ∪ ∪ c κ κ ( B ) ∈ ∈ κ κ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\cup \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\in \kappa } . By extensivity [K2] one has c κ κ ( A ) ∈ ∈ A ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\in A^{\uparrow }} and c κ κ ( B ) ∈ ∈ B ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\in B^{\uparrow }} , so that c κ κ ( A ) ∪ ∪ c κ κ ( B ) ∈ ∈ ( A ↑ ↑ ) ∩ ∩ ( B ↑ ↑ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\cup \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\in \left(A^{\uparrow }\right)\cap \left(B^{\uparrow }\right)} . But ( A ↑ ↑ ) ∩ ∩ ( B ↑ ↑ ) = ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \left(A^{\uparrow }\right)\cap \left(B^{\uparrow }\right)=(A\cup B)^{\uparrow }} , so that all in all c κ κ ( A ) ∪ ∪ c κ κ ( B ) ∈ ∈ κ κ ∩ ∩ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\cup \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)\in \kappa \cap (A\cup B)^{\uparrow }} . Since then c κ κ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A\cup B)} is a minimal element of κ κ ∩ ∩ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle \kappa \cap (A\cup B)^{\uparrow }} w.r.t. inclusion, we find c κ κ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ⊆ ⊆ c κ κ ( A ) ∪ ∪ c κ κ ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A\cup B)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\cup \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(B)} . Point 4. ensures additivity [K4] .

Exact correspondence between the two structures [ edit ] In fact, these two complementary constructions are inverse to one another: if C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)} is the collection of all Kuratowski closure operators on X {\displaystyle X} , and A t p ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Atp} (X)} is the collection of all families consisting of complements of all sets in a topology, i.e. the collection of all families satisfying [T1] – [T3] , then S : C l s K ( X ) → → A t p ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}:\mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)\to \mathrm {Atp} (X)} such that c ↦ ↦ S [ c ] {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} \mapsto {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} is a bijection, whose inverse is given by the assignment C : κ κ ↦ ↦ c κ κ {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {C}}:\kappa \mapsto \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }} .

Proof 3.

First we prove that C ∘ ∘ S = 1 C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {C}}\circ {\mathfrak {S}}={\mathfrak {1}}_{\mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)}} , the identity operator on C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)} . For a given Kuratowski closure c ∈ ∈ C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} \in \mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)} , define c ′ := C [ S [ c ] ] {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ':={\mathfrak {C}}[{\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]]} ; then if A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} its primed closure c ′ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} '(A)} is the intersection of all c {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} } -stable sets that contain A {\displaystyle A} . Its non-primed closure c ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)} satisfies this description: by extensivity [K2] we have A ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ) {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A)} , and by idempotence [K3] we have c ( c ( A ) ) = c ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {c} (A))=\mathbf {c} (A)} , and thus c ( A ) ∈ ∈ ( A ↑ ↑ ∩ ∩ S [ c ] ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)\in \left(A^{\uparrow }\cap {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]\right)} . Now, let C ∈ ∈ ( A ↑ ↑ ∩ ∩ S [ c ] ) {\displaystyle C\in \left(A^{\uparrow }\cap {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]\right)} such that A ⊆ ⊆ C ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ) {\displaystyle A\subseteq C\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A)} : by isotonicity [K4'] we have c ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( C ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} (C)} , and since c ( C ) = C {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (C)=C} we conclude that C = c ( A ) {\displaystyle C=\mathbf {c} (A)} . Hence c ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)} is the minimal element of A ↑ ↑ ∩ ∩ S [ c ] {\displaystyle A^{\uparrow }\cap {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} ]} w.r.t. inclusion, implying c ′ ( A ) = c ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} '(A)=\mathbf {c} (A)} .

Now we prove that S ∘ ∘ C = 1 A t p ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}\circ {\mathfrak {C}}={\mathfrak {1}}_{\mathrm {Atp} (X)}} . If κ κ ∈ ∈ A t p ( X ) {\displaystyle \kappa \in \mathrm {Atp} (X)} and κ κ ′ := S [ C [ κ κ ] ] {\displaystyle \kappa ':={\mathfrak {S}}[{\mathfrak {C}}[\kappa ]]} is the family of all sets that are stable under c κ κ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }} , the result follows if both κ κ ′ ⊆ ⊆ κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa '\subseteq \kappa } and κ κ ⊆ ⊆ κ κ ′ {\displaystyle \kappa \subseteq \kappa '} . Let A ∈ ∈ κ κ ′ {\displaystyle A\in \kappa '} : hence c κ κ ( A ) = A {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)=A} . Since c κ κ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)} is the intersection of an arbitrary subfamily of κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } , and the latter is complete under arbitrary intersections by [T2] , then A = c κ κ ( A ) ∈ ∈ κ κ {\displaystyle A=\mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)\in \kappa } . Conversely, if A ∈ ∈ κ κ {\displaystyle A\in \kappa } , then c κ κ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\kappa }(A)} is the minimal superset of A {\displaystyle A} that is contained in κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } . But that is trivially A {\displaystyle A} itself, implying A ∈ ∈ κ κ ′ {\displaystyle A\in \kappa '} .

We observe that one may also extend the bijection S {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}} to the collection C l s C ˇ ˇ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cls} _{\check {C}}(X)} of all Čech closure operators, which strictly contains C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)} ; this extension S ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathfrak {S}}}} is also surjective, which signifies that all Čech closure operators on X {\displaystyle X} also induce a topology on X {\displaystyle X} .

[ 11 ] However, this means that S ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathfrak {S}}}} is no longer a bijection.

Examples [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( August 2019 ) As discussed above, given a topological space X {\displaystyle X} we may define the closure of any subset A ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A\subseteq X} to be the set c ( A ) = ⋂ ⋂ { C a closed subset of X | A ⊆ ⊆ C } {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)=\bigcap \{C{\text{ a closed subset of }}X|A\subseteq C\}} , i.e. the intersection of all closed sets of X {\displaystyle X} which contain A {\displaystyle A} . The set c ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)} is the smallest closed set of X {\displaystyle X} containing A {\displaystyle A} , and the operator c : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} :\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} is a Kuratowski closure operator.

If X {\displaystyle X} is any set, the operators c ⊤ ⊤ , c ⊥ ⊥ : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\top },\mathbf {c} _{\bot }:\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} such that c ⊤ ⊤ ( A ) = { ∅ ∅ A = ∅ ∅ , X A ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ , c ⊥ ⊥ ( A ) = A ∀ ∀ A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\top }(A)={\begin{cases}\varnothing &A=\varnothing ,\\X&A\neq \varnothing ,\end{cases}}\qquad \mathbf {c} _{\bot }(A)=A\quad \forall A\in \wp (X),} are Kuratowski closures. The first induces the indiscrete topology { ∅ ∅ , X } {\displaystyle \{\varnothing ,X\}} , while the second induces the discrete topology ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} .

Fix an arbitrary S ⊊ ⊊ X {\displaystyle S\subsetneq X} , and let c S : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{S}:\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} be such that c S ( A ) := A ∪ ∪ S {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{S}(A):=A\cup S} for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} . Then c S {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{S}} defines a Kuratowski closure; the corresponding family of closed sets S [ c S ] {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} _{S}]} coincides with S ↑ ↑ {\displaystyle S^{\uparrow }} , the family of all subsets that contain S {\displaystyle S} . When S = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle S=\varnothing } , we once again retrieve the discrete topology ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} (i.e.

c ∅ ∅ = c ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\varnothing }=\mathbf {c} _{\bot }} , as can be seen from the definitions).

If λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is an infinite cardinal number such that λ λ ≤ ≤ crd ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \lambda \leq \operatorname {crd} (X)} , then the operator c λ λ : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\lambda }:\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} such that c λ λ ( A ) = { A crd ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) < λ λ , X crd ⁡ ⁡ ( A ) ≥ ≥ λ λ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\lambda }(A)={\begin{cases}A&\operatorname {crd} (A)<\lambda ,\\X&\operatorname {crd} (A)\geq \lambda \end{cases}}} satisfies all four Kuratowski axioms.

[ 12 ] If λ λ = ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle \lambda =\aleph _{0}} , this operator induces the cofinite topology on X {\displaystyle X} ; if λ λ = ℵ ℵ 1 {\displaystyle \lambda =\aleph _{1}} , it induces the cocountable topology .

Properties [ edit ] Since any Kuratowski closure is isotonic, and so is obviously any inclusion mapping, one has the (isotonic) Galois connection ⟨ ⟨ c : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → i m ( c ) ; ι ι : i m ( c ) ↪ ↪ ℘ ℘ ( X ) ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {c} :\wp (X)\to \mathrm {im} (\mathbf {c} );\iota :\mathrm {im} (\mathbf {c} )\hookrightarrow \wp (X)\rangle } , provided one views ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} as a poset with respect to inclusion, and i m ( c ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {im} (\mathbf {c} )} as a subposet of ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} . Indeed, it can be easily verified that, for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} and C ∈ ∈ i m ( c ) {\displaystyle C\in \mathrm {im} (\mathbf {c} )} , c ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)\subseteq C} if and only if A ⊆ ⊆ ι ι ( C ) {\displaystyle A\subseteq \iota (C)} .

If { A i } i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \{A_{i}\}_{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}} is a subfamily of ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} , then ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I c ( A i ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( ⋃ ⋃ i ∈ ∈ I A i ) , c ( ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I A i ) ⊆ ⊆ ⋂ ⋂ i ∈ ∈ I c ( A i ) .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\mathbf {c} (A_{i})\subseteq \mathbf {c} \left(\bigcup _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}A_{i}\right),\qquad \mathbf {c} \left(\bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}A_{i}\right)\subseteq \bigcap _{i\in {\mathcal {I}}}\mathbf {c} (A_{i}).} If A , B ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A,B\in \wp (X)} , then c ( A ) ∖ ∖ c ( B ) ⊆ ⊆ c ( A ∖ ∖ B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (A)\setminus \mathbf {c} (B)\subseteq \mathbf {c} (A\setminus B)} .

Topological concepts in terms of closure [ edit ] Refinements and subspaces [ edit ] A pair of Kuratowski closures c 1 , c 2 : ℘ ℘ ( X ) → → ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{1},\mathbf {c} _{2}:\wp (X)\to \wp (X)} such that c 2 ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c 1 ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{2}(A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} _{1}(A)} for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} induce topologies τ τ 1 , τ τ 2 {\displaystyle \tau _{1},\tau _{2}} such that τ τ 1 ⊆ ⊆ τ τ 2 {\displaystyle \tau _{1}\subseteq \tau _{2}} , and vice versa. In other words, c 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{1}} dominates c 2 {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{2}} if and only if the topology induced by the latter is a refinement of the topology induced by the former, or equivalently S [ c 1 ] ⊆ ⊆ S [ c 2 ] {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} _{1}]\subseteq {\mathfrak {S}}[\mathbf {c} _{2}]} .

[ 13 ] For example, c ⊤ ⊤ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\top }} clearly dominates c ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{\bot }} (the latter just being the identity on ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle \wp (X)} ). Since the same conclusion can be reached substituting τ τ i {\displaystyle \tau _{i}} with the family κ κ i {\displaystyle \kappa _{i}} containing the complements of all its members, if C l s K ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cls} _{\text{K}}(X)} is endowed with the partial order c ≤ ≤ c ′ ⟺ ⟺ c ( A ) ⊆ ⊆ c ′ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} \leq \mathbf {c} '\iff \mathbf {c} (A)\subseteq \mathbf {c} '(A)} for all A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} and A t p ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Atp} (X)} is endowed with the refinement order, then we may conclude that S {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {S}}} is an antitonic mapping between posets.

In any induced topology (relative to the subset A ) the closed sets induce a new closure operator that is just the original closure operator restricted to A : c A ( B ) = A ∩ ∩ c X ( B ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} _{A}(B)=A\cap \mathbf {c} _{X}(B)} , for all B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} .

[ 14 ] Continuous maps, closed maps and homeomorphisms [ edit ] A function f : ( X , c ) → → ( Y , c ′ ) {\displaystyle f:(X,\mathbf {c} )\to (Y,\mathbf {c} ')} is continuous at a point p {\displaystyle p} iff p ∈ ∈ c ( A ) ⇒ ⇒ f ( p ) ∈ ∈ c ′ ( f ( A ) ) {\displaystyle p\in \mathbf {c} (A)\Rightarrow f(p)\in \mathbf {c} '(f(A))} , and it is continuous everywhere iff f ( c ( A ) ) ⊆ ⊆ c ′ ( f ( A ) ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {c} (A))\subseteq \mathbf {c} '(f(A))} for all subsets A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} .

[ 15 ] The mapping f {\displaystyle f} is a closed map iff the reverse inclusion holds, [ 16 ] and it is a homeomorphism iff it is both continuous and closed, i.e. iff equality holds.

[ 17 ] Separation axioms [ edit ] Let ( X , c ) {\displaystyle (X,\mathbf {c} )} be a Kuratowski closure space. Then X {\displaystyle X} is a T 0 -space iff x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} implies c ( { x } ) ≠ ≠ c ( { y } ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\{x\})\neq \mathbf {c} (\{y\})} ; [ 18 ] X {\displaystyle X} is a T 1 -space iff c ( { x } ) = { x } {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\{x\})=\{x\}} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} ; [ 19 ] X {\displaystyle X} is a T 2 -space iff x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} implies that there exists a set A ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A\in \wp (X)} such that both x ∉ ∉ c ( A ) {\displaystyle x\notin \mathbf {c} (A)} and y ∉ ∉ c ( n ( A ) ) {\displaystyle y\notin \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {n} (A))} , where n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } is the set complement operator.

[ 20 ] Closeness and separation [ edit ] A point p {\displaystyle p} is close to a subset A {\displaystyle A} if p ∈ ∈ c ( A ) .

{\displaystyle p\in \mathbf {c} (A).} This can be used to define a proximity relation on the points and subsets of a set.

[ 21 ] Two sets A , B ∈ ∈ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle A,B\in \wp (X)} are separated iff ( A ∩ ∩ c ( B ) ) ∪ ∪ ( B ∩ ∩ c ( A ) ) = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle (A\cap \mathbf {c} (B))\cup (B\cap \mathbf {c} (A))=\varnothing } . The space X {\displaystyle X} is connected iff it cannot be written as the union of two separated subsets.
