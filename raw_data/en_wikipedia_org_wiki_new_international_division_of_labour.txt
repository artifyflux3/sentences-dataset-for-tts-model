For the Kirby remake on Game Boy Advance often referred to by the same abbreviation, see Kirby's Adventure § Rereleases .

In economics , the new international division of labour ( NIDL ) is a spatial division of labor that occurs when the process of production is no longer confined to national economies . It is an outcome of globalization : under the "old" international division of labor, until around 1970, underdeveloped areas were incorporated into the world economy principally as suppliers of minerals and agricultural commodities; but as developing economies are merged into the world economy, more production takes place in these economies.

[ 1 ] The term was coined by theorists seeking to explain the spatial shift of manufacturing industries from advanced capitalist countries to developing countries — an ongoing geographic reorganisation of production , which finds its origins in ideas about a global division of labor.

[ 1 ] This has led to a trend of transference, or what is also known as the "global industrial shift", in which production processes are relocated from developed countries (such as the US , European countries, and Japan ) to developing countries in Asia (such as China , Vietnam , and India ), Mexico and Central America . This is because companies search for the cheapest locations to manufacture and assemble components, so low-cost labor-intensive parts of the manufacturing process are shifted to the developing world where costs are substantially lower. Companies do so by taking advantage of transportation and communications technology , as well as fragmentation and locational flexibility of production. From 1953 to the late 1990s, the industrialised economies' share of world manufacturing output declined from 95% to 77%, and the developing economies' share more than quadrupled from 5% to 23%.
