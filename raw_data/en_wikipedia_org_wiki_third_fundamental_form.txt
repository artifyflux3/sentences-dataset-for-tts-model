Unlike the second fundamental form , it is independent of the surface normal .

Definition [ edit ] Let S be the shape operator and M be a smooth surface . Also, let u p and v p be elements of the tangent space T p ( M ) . The third fundamental form is then given by I I I ( u p , v p ) = S ( u p ) ⋅ ⋅ S ( v p ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I\!I} (\mathbf {u} _{p},\mathbf {v} _{p})=S(\mathbf {u} _{p})\cdot S(\mathbf {v} _{p})\,.} Properties [ edit ] The third fundamental form is expressible entirely in terms of the first fundamental form and second fundamental form . If we let H be the mean curvature of the surface and K be the Gaussian curvature of the surface, we have I I I − − 2 H I I + K I = 0 .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I\!I} -2H\mathrm {I\!I} +K\mathrm {I} =0\,.} As the shape operator is self-adjoint, for u , v ∈ T p ( M ) , we find I I I ( u , v ) = ⟨ ⟨ S u , S v ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ u , S 2 v ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ S 2 u , v ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {I\!I\!I} (u,v)=\langle Su,Sv\rangle =\langle u,S^{2}v\rangle =\langle S^{2}u,v\rangle \,.} See also [ edit ] Metric tensor First fundamental form Second fundamental form Tautological one-form v t e Various notions of curvature defined in differential geometry Differential geometry of curves Curvature Torsion of a curve Frenet–Serret formulas Radius of curvature Affine curvature Total curvature Total absolute curvature Differential geometry of surfaces Principal curvatures Gaussian curvature Mean curvature Darboux frame Gauss–Codazzi equations First fundamental form Second fundamental form Third fundamental form Riemannian geometry Curvature of Riemannian manifolds Riemann curvature tensor Ricci curvature Scalar curvature Sectional curvature Curvature of connections Curvature form Torsion tensor Cocurvature Holonomy This differential geometry -related article is a stub .
