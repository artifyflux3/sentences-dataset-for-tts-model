[ 13 ] [ 11 ] [ 14 ] Education [ edit ] Wolfe was educated at Trinity College Dublin , where he was awarded Bachelor of Arts degree in genetics in 1986 [ 3 ] followed by a PhD in 1990 [ 6 ] for research investigating synonymous substitution in vascular plants and mammals supervised by Paul M. Sharp .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 15 ] Research and career [ edit ] Wolfe's research focuses on comparative genomics , yeast genetics and bioinformatics .

[ 2 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Work in his laboratory investigates the evolution of eukaryotic genomes and chromosome organisation.

[ 12 ] He is best known for his discovery that the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae underwent complete genome duplication about 100 million years ago, [ 18 ] an event that is now known to be the result of hybridization between two divergent species .

[ 12 ] This finding reshaped our understanding both of yeast biology , and of mechanisms of genome evolution in eukaryotes.

[ 12 ] His subsequent discoveries of similar ancient genome duplications (paleopolyploidy) [ 19 ] during human evolution , and in almost all families of flowering plants , led to the realisation that whole-genome duplication is widespread.

[ 12 ] His group also studies the origin and evolution of mating systems in yeasts, and the process of mating-type switching in which one cell type can change into another by moving or replacing a section of chromosome.

[ 12 ] Wolfe was a postdoctoral researcher with Jeffrey D. Palmer [ 7 ] at Indiana University Bloomington before returning to Ireland in 1992 to establish his research group in the genetics department of Trinity College Dublin, [ 20 ] [ 3 ] where he remained for over 20 years. In 2013, he moved to University College Dublin 's UCD School of Medicine and Conway Institute.

[ 21 ] As of 2017 [update] his most highly cited peer reviewed papers [ 2 ] [ 14 ] [ 16 ] have been published in leading scientific journals including Nature , [ 18 ] [ 22 ] PNAS , [ 23 ] The Plant Cell , [ 19 ] [ 24 ] Genome Research [ 25 ] and Nature Reviews Genetics .

[ 7 ] Former doctoral students from the Wolfe lab include Mario A. Fares, [ 4 ] Aoife McLysaght , [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Kevin P. Byrne, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Estelle Proux-Wéra [ 4 ] and Cathal Seoighe.

[ 5 ] [ 10 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] Wolfe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017 , [ 12 ] a member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA) in 2000 [ 11 ] and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2010.

[ 1 ] In 2011 he served as president of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (smbe.org) .
