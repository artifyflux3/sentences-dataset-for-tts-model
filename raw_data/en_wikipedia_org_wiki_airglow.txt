Yellow, green and red bands of airglow along Earth's limb as seen from space.

**Airglow** is a faint emission of light by a planetary [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"). In the case of [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere"), this [optical phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_phenomenon "Optical phenomenon") causes the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky "Night sky") never to be completely dark, even after the effects of [starlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight "Starlight") and [diffused sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation "Diffuse sky radiation") from the far side are removed. This phenomenon originates with self-illuminated gases and has no relationship with [Earth's magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") or [sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot "Sunspot") activity, causing [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora").

Airglow occurs in two forms, resulting by two different processes, but both having the same cause. Airglow is caused by sunlight splitting atmospheric molecules, which at this point produce during day the **dayglow** called airglow, which is too faint to be seen in daylight. During the night airglow occurs as **nightglow**, resulting from the recombination of the molecules which were split during daytime.

The airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by Swedish physicist [Anders Ångström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m "Anders Ångström"). Since then, it has been studied in the laboratory, and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process. Scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in Earth's atmosphere, and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present. [Simon Newcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Newcomb "Simon Newcomb") was the first person to scientifically study and describe airglow, in 1901.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-1)

Airglow was known to the ancient Greeks: "[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and Pliny described the phenomena of _Chasmata_, which can be identified in part as auroras, and in part as bright airglow nights."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-SCIENCES_OF_THE_EARTH-2)

Types and layering of airglow above Earth

Airglow looks similar to the at times stronger [auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora"), though auroras are caused differently.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-y303-3)

Airglow is caused by various processes in the upper [atmosphere of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), such as the recombination of atoms which were [photoionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoionization "Photoionization") by the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") during the day, luminescence caused by [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") striking the upper atmosphere, and [chemiluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence "Chemiluminescence") caused mainly by [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") reacting with [hydroxyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl "Hydroxyl") free radicals at heights of a few hundred kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime due to the [glare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision) "Glare (vision)") and [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation "Diffuse sky radiation") of [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight"). The airglow resulting from the photoionization in daylight and the recombination at night is called **dayglow** and **nightglow** respectively.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-i510-4)

Even at the best ground-based observatories, airglow limits the [photosensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity "Photosensitivity") of [optical telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope "Optical telescope"). Partly for this reason, [space telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope") like [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope") can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at [visible wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum").

Airglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish. Although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere, it appears brightest at about 10° above the observer's [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon"), since the lower one looks, the greater the [mass of atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(astronomy) "Air mass (astronomy)") one is looking through. Very low down, however, atmospheric [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy) "Extinction (astronomy)") reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.

One airglow mechanism is when an atom of [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") combines with an atom of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") to form a molecule of [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (NO). In the process, a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N 2) and oxygen (O 2) are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other chemicals that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-meinel50a-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-meinel50b-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-high10-7) atomic oxygen (O), sodium (Na), and lithium (Li).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-8)

The [sky brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_brightness "Sky brightness") is typically measured in units of [apparent magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude "Apparent magnitude") per square [arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc") of sky.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Antarctic_aurora_ESA313457.jpg/500px-Antarctic_aurora_ESA313457.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Antarctic_aurora_ESA313457.jpg)

Airglow as pinkish orange sodium line at just below one hundred kilometers and a faint green line, at the [edge of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Boundary "Outer space") and the lower edge of the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere") (invisible), sandwiched between green and red bands of [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora") stretching over several hundred kilometers upward and the pink [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), white and blue [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), as well as orange [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere")[afterglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterglow "Afterglow") and silhouettes of clouds at the bottom.

In order to calculate the relative intensity of airglow, we need to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes of photons; this clearly depends on the spectrum of the source, but we will ignore that initially. At visible wavelengths, we need the parameter _S_ 0(_V_), the power per square centimetre of aperture and per micrometre of wavelength produced by a zeroth-magnitude star, to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes – _S_ 0(_V_) = 4.0×10−12 W⋅cm−2⋅µm−1.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-9) If we take the example of a _V_ = 28 star observed through a normal _V_ band filter (_B_ = 0.2 μm bandpass, frequency ν ≈ 6×10 14 Hz), the number of photons we receive per square centimeter of telescope aperture per second from the source is _N_ s:

![Image 5: {\displaystyle N_{\text{s}}=10^{-28/2.5}\times {\frac {S_{0}(V)\times B}{h\nu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535b1cc7eadde296185793ae2e0d5f27eb9fbf40)
(where _h_ is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"); _hν_ is the energy of a single photon of frequency _ν_).

At _V_ band, the emission from airglow is _V_ = 22 per square arc-second at a high-altitude observatory on a moonless night; in excellent [seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing "Astronomical seeing") conditions, the image of a star will be about 0.7 arc-second across with an area of 0.4 square arc-second, and so the emission from airglow over the area of the image corresponds to about _V_ = 23. This gives the number of photons from airglow, _N_ a:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle N_{\text{a}}=10^{-23/2.5}\times {\frac {S_{0}(V)\times B}{h\nu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7365a59ded3caa63629598c8f32ab325b0c2d6f9)
The signal-to-noise for an ideal ground-based observation with a telescope of area _A_ (ignoring losses and detector noise), arising from [Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution "Poisson distribution") statistics, is only:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle S/N={\sqrt {A}}\times {\frac {N_{\text{s}}}{\sqrt {N_{\text{s}}+N_{\text{a}}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16b3e5e8bd83cdaf97b3bfe719bb15dc6b88fccc)
If we assume a 10 m diameter ideal ground-based telescope and an unresolved star: every second, over a patch the size of the seeing-enlarged image of the star, 35 photons arrive from the star and 3500 from air-glow. So, over an hour, roughly 1.3×10 7 arrive from the air-glow, and approximately 1.3×10 5 arrive from the source; so the _S_/_N_ ratio is about:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\frac {1.3\times 10^{5}}{\sqrt {1.3\times 10^{7}}}}\approx 36.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc74907e2b7b2aab1895ea4005964a4abc6d7ca)
We can compare this with "real" answers from exposure time calculators. For an 8 m unit [Very Large Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope "Very Large Telescope") telescope, according to the [FORS](http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/bin/gen/form?INS.NAME=FORS1++INS.MODE=imaging) exposure time calculator, 40 hours of observing time are needed to reach _V_ = 28, while the 2.4 m Hubble only takes 4 hours according to the [ACS](https://archive.today/20050209215954/http://apt.stsci.edu/webetc/acs/acs_img_etc.jsp) exposure time calculator. A hypothetical 8 m Hubble telescope would take about 30 minutes.

This calculation shows that reducing the view field size can make fainter objects more detectable against the airglow; unfortunately, [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics "Adaptive optics") techniques that reduce the diameter of the view field of an Earth-based telescope by an order of magnitude only as yet work in the infrared, where the sky is much brighter. A [space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope") is not restricted by the view field, since it is not affected by airglow.

Two images of the sky over the [HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAARP "HAARP")[Gakona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gakona "Gakona") facility using the NRL-cooled [CCD imager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCD_imager "CCD imager") at 557.7 nm. The field of view is approximately 38°. The left-hand image shows the background star field with the HF transmitter off. The right-hand image was taken 63 seconds later with the HF transmitter on. Structure is evident in the emission region.

Scientific experiments have been conducted to induce airglow by directing high-power radio emissions at the Earth's [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-agu2005-10) These radiowaves interact with the ionosphere to induce faint but visible optical light at specific wavelengths under certain conditions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-nrlHAARP-11) The effect is also observable in the radio frequency band, using [ionosondes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosonde "Ionosonde").

Experimental observation
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airglow&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Experimental observation")]

[SwissCube-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwissCube-1 "SwissCube-1") is a [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") satellite operated by [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne "Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"). The spacecraft is a single unit [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat "CubeSat"), which was designed to conduct research into airglow within the Earth's atmosphere and to develop technology for future spacecraft. Though SwissCube-1 is rather small (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) and weighs less than 1 kg, it carries a small telescope for obtaining images of the airglow. The first [SwissCube-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwissCube-1 "SwissCube-1") image came down on 18 February 2011 and was quite black with some thermal noise on it. The first airglow image came down on 3 March 2011. This image has been converted to the human optical range (green) from its near-infrared measurement. This image provides a measurement of the intensity of the airglow phenomenon in the [near-infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared "Near-infrared"). The range measured is from 500 to 61400 [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons "Photons"), with a resolution of 500 photons.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-EPFL_Sopace_Center_airglow-12)

Observation of airglow on other planets
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Airglow&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Observation of airglow on other planets")]

The _[Venus Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\_Express "Venus Express")_ spacecraft contains an [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") sensor which has detected near-IR emissions from the upper atmosphere of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"). The emissions come from [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (NO) and from molecular oxygen.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-Garcia_MunozMills2009-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-14) Scientists had previously determined in laboratory testing that during NO production, [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") emissions and near-IR emissions were produced. The UV radiation had been detected in the atmosphere, but until this mission, the atmosphere-produced near-IR emissions were only theoretical.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-Wilson2009-15)

Airglow on Venus is the most likely candidate for the illusive [ashen light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashen_light "Ashen light") having been observed from Earth since the 17th century.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow#cite_note-e367-16)
