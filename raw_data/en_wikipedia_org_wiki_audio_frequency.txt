The SI unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is the property of sound that most determines pitch .

[ 1 ] The generally accepted standard hearing range for humans is 20 to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In air at atmospheric pressure , these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 metres (56 ft) to 1.7 centimetres (0.67 in). Frequencies below 20 Hz are generally felt rather than heard, assuming the amplitude of the vibration is great enough.  Sound waves that have frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic and those above 20 kHz are called ultrasonic .

Sound propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances.

[ 5 ] In general, frequency components of a sound determine its "color", its timbre . When speaking about the frequency (in singular) of a sound, it means the property that most determines its pitch .

[ 6 ] Higher pitches have higher frequency, and lower pitches have lower frequency.

The frequencies an ear can hear are limited to a specific range of frequencies .  The audible frequency range for humans is typically given as being between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other species have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000 Hz (60 kHz).

[ 7 ] In many media, such as air, the speed of sound is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.

Frequencies and descriptions [ edit ] Frequency (Hz) Octave Description 16 to 32 1st The lower human threshold of hearing, and the lowest pedal notes of a pipe organ.

32 to 512 2nd to 5th Rhythm frequencies, where the lower and upper bass notes lie.

512 to 2,048 6th to 7th Defines human speech intelligibility , gives a horn-like or tinny quality to sound.

2,048 to 8,192 8th to 9th Gives presence to speech, where labial and fricative sounds lie.

8,192 to 16,384 10th Brilliance, the sounds of bells and the ringing of cymbals and sibilance in speech.

16,384 to 32,768 11th Beyond brilliance, nebulous sounds approaching and just passing the upper human threshold of hearing Oscillogram of a pure tone middle C (262 Hz). (Scale: 1 square is equal to 1 millisecond ) C5, an octave above middle C. The frequency is twice that of middle C (523 Hz).

C3, an octave below middle C. The frequency is half that of middle C (131 Hz).
