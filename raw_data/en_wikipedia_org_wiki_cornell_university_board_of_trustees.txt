The university was co-founded by American philanthropist Ezra Cornell and historian and educator Andrew Dickson White in 1865. Since its founding, Cornell University has been a co-educational and nonsectarian institution. As of fall 2024, the student body included 16,128 undergraduate and 10,665 graduate students from all 50 U.S. states and 130 countries.

[ 7 ] The university is organized into eight undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions on its main Ithaca campus.

[ 12 ] Each college and academic division has near autonomy in defining its respective admission standards and academic curriculum. In addition to its primary campus in Ithaca, Cornell University administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City, the medical school and Cornell Tech , and a branch of the medical school in Al Rayyan , Qatar's Education City .

[ 12 ] Cornell is one of three private land-grant universities in the United States.

[ a ] Among the university's eight undergraduate colleges, four are state-supported statutory or contract colleges partly financed through the State University of New York , including the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences , the College of Human Ecology , the Industrial and Labor Relations School , and the Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. Among Cornell's graduate schools, only the Veterinary Medicine College is supported by New York. The main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca spans 745 acres (301 ha).

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Cornell University Cornell's founders Ezra Cornell Andrew Dickson White 19th century [ edit ] Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865, by Ezra Cornell, an entrepreneur and New York State Senator , and Andrew Dickson White, an educator and fellow state senator. The university was established as New York's land-grant institution following authorization by the New York State Legislature.

[ 19 ] Ezra Cornell provided his farm in Ithaca, New York, as the initial campus site and contributed $500,000 as an initial endowment (equivalent to $12,769,000 in 2024). White agreed to serve as the university’s first president.

White oversaw the university's early development, including the construction of its first two buildings, and traveled to recruit students and faculty.

[ 20 ] The university was formally inaugurated on October 7, 1868, with 412 male students enrolling the following day.

[ 21 ] Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, incorporating academic research into campus infrastructure and outreach efforts. In 1883, it became one of the first electrified universities, employing a water-powered dynamo to light parts of the campus.

[ 22 ] Since 1894, the university has incorporated state-funded colleges that fulfill statutory requirements, and it administers research and extension programs jointly funded by New York State and the U.S. federal government.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 1872, Cornell became one of the first universities in the United States to allow alumni-elected trustees on its board.

[ 25 ] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Cornell was home to literary societies that promoted writing, reading, and oratory skills. The U.S. Bureau of Education classified several of these societies as following the traditions of literary organizations at Eastern universities.

[ 26 ] 20th century [ edit ] Willard Straight Hall on the Cornell campus, which was occupied by armed anti-Vietnam War protesters in 1969, leading to the resignation of James Alfred Perkins , Cornell's seventh president In 1967, Cornell experienced a fire in the Residential Club dormitory that killed eight students and one professor. In the late 1960s, Cornell was among the Ivy League universities that experienced heightened student activism related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . In 1969, armed anti- Vietnam War protesters occupied Willard Straight Hall , an incident that led to a restructuring of the university's governance and forced the resignation of then Cornell president James Alfred Perkins .

[ 27 ] Since the 20th century, rankings of universities and colleges, Cornell University and its academic programs have routinely ranked among the best in the world. In 1995, the National Research Council ranked Cornell's PhD programs as sixth-best in the nation. It also ranked the academic quality of 18 individual Cornell Ph.D. programs among the top ten in the nation, which included astrophysics (ninth-best), chemistry (sixth-best), civil engineering (sixth-best), comparative literature (sixth-best), computer science (fifth-best), ecology (fourth-best), electrical engineering (seventh-best), English (seventh-best), French (eighth-best), geosciences (tenth-best), German (third-best), linguistics (ninth-best), materials science (third-best), mechanical engineering (seventh-best), philosophy (ninth-best), physics (sixth-best), Spanish (eighth-best), and statistics / biostatistics (fourth-best). The council ranked Cornell's College of Arts and Humanities faculty as fifth-best in the nation, its Mathematics and Physical Sciences faculty as sixth-best, and its College of Engineering as fifth-best.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] 21st century [ edit ] Further information: Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar and Cornell Tech Cornell Tech , founded in 2017 on Roosevelt Island in New York City In 2000, Cornell began expanding its international programs. In 2004, the university opened Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar in Education City in Al Rayyan , Qatar.

[ 30 ] The university also developed partnerships with academic institutions in India, the People's Republic of China , and Singapore.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In August 2002, a graduate student group, At What Cost?, was formed at Cornell to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by CASE/UAW, an affiliate of the United Auto Workers . The vote to unionize, held in October 2002, was rejected, and At What Cost? was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal, the first instance in history in which a U.S. graduate school vote on unionization was defeated in a vote.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In March 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid the cornerstone for the building and operation of "Bridging the Rift Center", located on the border between Israel and Jordan , and used for education.

[ 37 ] In 2005, Jeffrey S. Lehman , a former president of Cornell, described the university and its high international profile as a "transnational university".

[ 38 ] Campuses [ edit ] Ithaca campus [ edit ] The Arts Quad on Cornell's main campus with McGraw Tower and Olin and Uris libraries in the background Ho Plaza seen from McGraw Tower with Sage Hall and Barnes Hall in the background Sage Chapel on the Cornell campus, which hosts religious services and concerts and is the final resting place of Ezra Cornell , the university's founder Cornell University's main campus is located in Ithaca, New York , on East Hill, offering views of the city and Cayuga Lake . The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301 ha) since its founding, now including multiple academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 2011, Travel + Leisure recognized Cornell's campus in Ithaca as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.

[ 41 ] The Ithaca campus is characterized by an irregular layout and a mix of architectural styles, which have developed over time and are attributed to the university's ever-changing master plans for the campus. The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II . Since then, more recent buildings on the campus are characterized by modernist architectural styles.

[ 42 ] Several Cornell University buildings have been named National Historic Landmarks , [ 43 ] and ten have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places : Andrew Dickson White House , Bailey Hall , Caldwell Hall , the Computing and Communications Center , Morrill Hall , Rice Hall , Fernow Hall , Wing Hall , Llenroc , and Deke House .

[ 44 ] Three other listed historic buildings, the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall, were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new campus buildings and development.

[ 45 ] Central, North, and West campuses [ edit ] Main articles: Cornell Central Campus , Cornell North Campus , and Cornell West Campus The majority of Cornell University's academic and administrative facilities are located on its main campus in Ithaca. The architectural styles on the campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic , Victorian , and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international and modernist structures.

Frederick Law Olmsted , designer of Central Park , proposed a "grand terrace" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the development of the campus.

[ 46 ] North Campus features primarily residential buildings, including ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, and transfer students in the Townhouse Community.

[ 47 ] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and need for expanded student housing during the 20th century.

The West Campus House System showcases a blend of architectural styles, including Gothic -style buildings and residential halls collectively known as "the Gothics." [ 48 ] In Collegetown, located near the campus in Ithaca, the architectural styles are diverse, reflecting the area's mixed-use nature. The Schwartz Performing Arts Center and two upper-level residence halls [ 49 ] [ 50 ] are surrounded by a variety of apartment buildings, eateries, and businesses.

[ 51 ] Natural surroundings [ edit ] Cornell University's main campus in Ithaca is located in the Finger Lakes region in upstate New York and features views of the city , Cayuga Lake , and surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges , Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge. The gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, but their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.

[ 52 ] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens , which features various plants, trees, and ponds.

[ 53 ] Sustainability [ edit ] Further information: Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future Cornell University has implemented several green initiatives , designed to promote sustainability and reduce environmental impact, including a gas-fired combined heat and power facility, [ 54 ] an on-campus hydroelectric plant, [ 55 ] and a lake source cooling system.

[ 56 ] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future [ 57 ] The same year, following a multiyear, cross-campus discussion about energy and sustainability, Cornell's Atkinson Center for Sustainability was established, funded by an $80 million gift from alumnus David R. Atkinson ('60) and his wife Patricia, the largest gift ever received by Cornell from an individual at the time. A subsequent $30 million commitment in 2021 will name a new building on campus.

[ 58 ] As of 2020, the university, which has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035 [ 59 ] is powered by six solar farms, which provide 28 megawatts of power.

[ 60 ] Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, known as Earth Source Heating, designed to meet campus heating needs.

[ 61 ] In 2023, Cornell was the first university in the nation to commit to Kyoto Protocol emission reductions.

[ 62 ] The same year, a concert held at Barton Hall by Dead & Company raised $3.1 million for MusiCares and the Cornell 2030 Project, two organizations which have contributed to the establishment of the Climate Solutions Fund and aims to catalyze large-scale, impactful climate research across the university, which will be administered by the Atkinson Center.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] New York City campuses [ edit ] Weill Cornell [ edit ] Main article: Weill Cornell Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine , the medical school of Cornell University, located on the East River on the Upper East Side of New York City Cornell's medical campus in New York City, also called Weill Cornell, is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . It is home to two Cornell divisions, Weill Cornell Medicine , the university's medical school, and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences . Since 1927, Weill Cornell has been affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital , one of the nation's largest hospitals.

[ 65 ] While Cornell's medical school maintains its own faculty and academic divisions, it shares administrative and teaching hospital functions with Columbia University Medical Center .

[ 66 ] In addition to NewYork-Presbyterian, Cornell's teaching hospitals include Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and its Westchester Division in White Plains, New York .

[ 67 ] Weill Cornell Medical College is affiliated with neighboring Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , one of the nation's leading cancer centers, Rockefeller University , and the Hospital for Special Surgery . Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program , which is available to selected entering Cornell medical students.

[ 68 ] From 1942 to 1979, the Weill Cornell Medical campus also housed the Cornell School of Nursing .

[ 69 ] Cornell Tech [ edit ] Main article: Cornell Tech Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in New York City, a graduate campus and research center On 19 December 2011, Cornell and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City. The competition, established by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , was designed to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in New York City's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square foot state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island , on the site of the former Coler Specialty Hospital . The following year, in fall 2012, instruction began at a temporary location at space donated by Google, located at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan .

[ 101 ] Cornell University is governed by a 64-member board of trustees, which includes both privately and publicly appointed trustees appointed by the Governor of New York , alumni-elected trustees, faculty-elected trustees, student-elected trustees, [ 102 ] and non-academic staff-elected trustees. The Governor, Temporary President of the Senate , Speaker of the Assembly , and president of the university serve in ex officio voting capacities. The board is responsible for electing a President to serve as the university's chief executive and educational officer.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] From 2014 to 2022, Robert Harrison served as chairman of the board. He was succeeded by Kraig Kayser.

[ 105 ] The Board of Trustees holds four regular meetings annually, which are subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.

[ 106 ] The university charter (specifically, paragraph 1.b of section 5703 of the Education Law) provides that one member of the board, the life trustee, is the eldest living lineal descendant of Ezra Cornell.

[ 101 ] As of 2024, the current and longest-serving life trustee is Ezra Cornell, class of 1971, the great-great-great-grandson of the original Ezra Cornell.

[ 107 ] He celebrated 50 years of service as a board member in 2019.

[ 128 ] Financial aid [ edit ] The sarcophagus of Jennie McGraw , a Cornell benefactor , in Sage Chapel Cornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.

[ 129 ] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in New York state.

[ 129 ] From the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.

[ 130 ] Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.

[ 131 ] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from the seven other Ivy League schools and MIT and Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.

[ 132 ] In 2008, Cornell introduced a financial aid initiative, which incrementally replaced need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from lower-income families.

[ 133 ] Despite a 27% drop in the university's endowment in 2008, attributable partly to the 2008 financial crisis , Cornell president David J. Skorton allocated additional funds to continue the initiative, and sought to raise $125 million in donations for its support.

[ 134 ] Two years later, in 2010, Cornell was able to successfully meet the full financial aid needs of 40% of full-time freshmen with financial need. The average undergraduate student debt upon graduation, as of 2010, was $21,549.

[ 220 ] Alpha Phi Alpha , the first intercollegiate Greek organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Alpha Zeta fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on 1 January 1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came to the United States to study. This organization led a movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to 1975.

[ 223 ] On 19 February 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established; [ 224 ] it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League institution.

[ 225 ] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/ Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on 16 April 1988, making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina-exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league institution.

[ 226 ] Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of Alpha-series chapters. The chapter house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by John Russell Pope .

[ 227 ] Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.

[ 218 ] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system .

[ 229 ] Housing [ edit ] Further information: Cornell North Campus and Cornell West Campus Risley Residential College on Cornell North Campus One of several footbridges that span Cornell's gorges and ease commuting from housing to the various on-campus academic buildings Cornell University's residential system is divided into North Campus , West Campus , and Collegetown. The university introduced coeducational dormitories in 1971 and has maintained a system of residential advisors (RAs) to support students. Historically, freshmen were assigned to West Campus, particularly Baker and Boldt Halls. However, a 1997 residential initiative restructured the system, designating West Campus for upper-level students while North Campus became the primary residential area for freshmen and some sophomores.

[ 230 ] In 2022, the North Campus Residential Expansion added housing for 800 sophomores, marking a shift from its previous role as predominantly first-year housing..

[ 231 ] West Campus serves upper-level undergraduates and incorporates a residential college system designed to foster academic and social engagement outside the classroom. This system, developed through a $250 million reconstruction project, [ 232 ] was influenced in part by Risley Residential College , Cornell’s oldest continuously operating residential college .

[ 233 ] Beyond North and West Campus, Cornell offers additional housing options. Schuyler House, a former part of Sage Infirmary, now functions as a residence hall.

[ 234 ] Cornell’s Greek system provides another housing option, with approximately nine percent of undergraduate students living in fraternity and sorority houses. While first-semester freshmen are not eligible for membership, the university hosts 67 Greek chapters, many of which maintain residential facilities. Additionally, independent housing options exist, such as the student-run Telluride House , the Center for Jewish Living, and other cooperative residences that emphasize community-oriented living.

Various Cornell housing facilities Baker Dormitories Balch Hall Hans Bethe House Risley Hall Dining [ edit ] As of 2025 [update] , The Princeton Review ranked Cornell’s dining program fifth in the nation.

[ 235 ] The university operates 29 dining facilities across campus, serving students in residential and academic areas.

[ 236 ] On North Campus, dining options include a mix of large dining halls and smaller venues, with facilities such as Morrison Dining and North Star Dining at Appel Commons serving as primary locations for first-year students. Risley Residential College also houses a historic dining hall modeled on the great hall at Christ Church , Oxford .

[ 237 ] West Campus follows a residential college model, where each house features its own dining hall, creating a more intimate and community-oriented dining experience. Additionally, 104West! provides specialized kosher and multicultural meal options for students with specific dietary needs.

In Central Campus, Willard Straight Hall is home to Okenshields, a dining facility that caters to students and faculty in the academic core of the university. Beyond the main dining halls, Cornell offers various cafés, eateries, and grab-and-go options throughout campus to accommodate a range of dietary preferences and schedules.

[ 249 ] Cornelliana [ edit ] Main article: Cornelliana Further information: Dragon Day , Far Above Cayuga's Waters , Give My Regards to Davy , Slope Day , and Touchdown (mascot) Started in 1901, Dragon Day is an annual tradition celebrating a feat by freshman architecture students to construct a colossal dragon that is paraded through the Ithaca campus.

The ivy-covered emblem of Ezra Cornell circumscribed by the university motto Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include Slope Day , a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day , which includes the parading of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, historically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built by the first-year architecture students in the week preceding the start of Spring Break. Taunting messages are left for the engineering students during the week leading into Dragon Day, with pranks, a "nerd walk," and even "green streak" (in which the students paint themselves green) often targeting engineers and their classes. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded around central campus by the first-year students, starting behind Rand Hall and moving through Cornell until eventually returning towards the Arts Quad. During the parade, the upper-year architecture students walk behind the dragon in various costumes, typically constructed by themselves for the event. Throughout much of its history, the dragon was then set afire upon its arrival to the arts quad, but that has since been discontinued due to environmental regulations.

[ 250 ] [ 251 ] [ 252 ] According to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.

[ 253 ] The university is also host to various student pranks. On at least two different occasions, the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower, once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.

[ 254 ] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.

[ 255 ] The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot " Touchdown " in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.
