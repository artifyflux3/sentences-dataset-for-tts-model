The **Renaissance** ( [_rin-AY-sənss_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"), [_REN-ə-sahnss_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"))[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-2)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-4) is a [period of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodization "Periodization") and a European [cultural movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_movement "Cultural movement") covering the 15th and 16th centuries. It marked the transition from the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") to [modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity "Modernity") and was characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"). Associated with great [social change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change "Social change") in most fields and disciplines, including [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art "Renaissance art"), [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture "Renaissance architecture"), politics, [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_literature "Renaissance literature"), [exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_exploration "Renaissance exploration") and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Renaissance "Science in the Renaissance"), the Renaissance was first centered in the [Republic of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence "Republic of Florence"), then spread to the [rest of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") and later throughout Europe. The term _rinascita_ ("rebirth") first appeared in _[Lives of the Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lives\_of\_the\_Artists "Lives of the Artists")_ (c. 1550) by [Giorgio Vasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Vasari "Giorgio Vasari"), while the corresponding French word _renaissance_ was adopted into English as the term for this period during the 1830s.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-5)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-6)

The Renaissance's intellectual basis was founded in its version of [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism"), derived from the concept of Roman _[humanitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitas "Humanitas")_ and the rediscovery of [classical Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greek_philosophy "Classical Greek philosophy"), such as that of [Protagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras "Protagoras"), who said that "man is the measure of all things". Although the invention of [metal movable type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#Europe "Movable type") sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of [Dante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante "Dante") and the paintings of [Giotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto "Giotto").

As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of [literary Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Latin "Renaissance Latin") and an explosion of [vernacular literatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_literature "Vernacular literature"), beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch"); the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread [educational reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education "History of education"). It saw myriad artistic developments and contributions from such [polymaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") as [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") and [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo"), who inspired the term "Renaissance man".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-7)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-8) In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"). The period also saw revolutions in other intellectual and [social scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science") pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-jkdiwan-9)

Period
------

The Renaissance period started during the [crisis of the Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages "Crisis of the Late Middle Ages") and conventionally ends with the waning of [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism "Humanism"), and the advents of the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation") and [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation "Counter-Reformation"), and in art, the [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque "Baroque") period. It had a different period and characteristics in different regions, such as the Italian Renaissance, the [Northern Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance "Northern Renaissance"), the [Spanish Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Renaissance "Spanish Renaissance"), etc.

In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a "long Renaissance" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-13)

The traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance's [early modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period") aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-14)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-15)

### Italian Renaissance

The beginnings of the period—the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian [Proto-Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance_painting#Proto-Renaissance_painting "Italian Renaissance painting") from around 1250 or 1300—overlap considerably with the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages"), conventionally dated to c. 1350–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.

The Renaissance began in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence "Republic of Florence"), one of the many states of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_in_the_Middle_Ages "Italy in the Middle Ages").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-16) The Italian Renaissance concluded in 1527 when [Holy Roman Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor") launched an [assault on Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527) "Sack of Rome (1527)") during the [war of the League of Cognac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cognac "War of the League of Cognac"). Nevertheless, its impact endured in the art of renowned Italian painters like [Tintoretto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintoretto "Tintoretto"), [Sofonisba Anguissola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofonisba_Anguissola "Sofonisba Anguissola"), and [Paolo Veronese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Veronese "Paolo Veronese"), who continued their work during the mid-to-late 16th century.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-17)

Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors, including Florence's social and civic peculiarities at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the [Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici "House of Medici"),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-strathern-18) and the migration of [Greek scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_scholars_in_the_Renaissance "Greek scholars in the Renaissance") and their texts to Italy following the [fall of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") to the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Britannica1-19)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-20)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Norwich-21) Other major centers were [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice"), [Genoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa "Republic of Genoa"), [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan "Duchy of Milan"), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States") during the [Renaissance Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Papacy "Renaissance Papacy"), and [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples "Kingdom of Naples"). From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and also to American, African and Asian territories ruled by the European colonial powers of the time or where Christian missionaries were active.

The Renaissance has a long and complex [historiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography "Historiography"), and in line with general skepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual cultural heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of _Renaissance_ as a term and as a historical delineation.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-brotton-22)

Some observers have questioned whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and [nostalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia "Nostalgia") for [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-huizinga-23) while social and economic historians, especially of the _[longue durée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longue\_dur%C3%A9e "Longue durée")_, have instead focused on [the continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_thesis "Continuity thesis") between the two eras,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-starn-24) which are linked, as [Panofsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panofsky "Panofsky") observed, "by a thousand ties".[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-25)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-27)

The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance") (8th and 9th centuries), [Ottonian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian_Renaissance "Ottonian Renaissance") (10th and 11th century), and the [Renaissance of the 12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-mur-28)

Overview
--------

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period"). Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art "Renaissance art"), [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture "Renaissance architecture"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_philosophy "Renaissance philosophy"), [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_literature "Renaissance literature"), [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music "Renaissance music"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_the_Renaissance "History of science in the Renaissance"), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_technology "Renaissance technology"), politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-perry-humanities-29)

[Renaissance humanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism") such as [Poggio Bracciolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggio_Bracciolini "Poggio Bracciolini") sought out in Europe's monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), while the [fall of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople "Fall of Constantinople") (1453) generated a wave of [émigré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89migr%C3%A9 "Émigré")[Greek scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_scholars_in_the_Renaissance "Greek scholars in the Renaissance") bringing precious manuscripts in [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It was in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the [Renaissance of the 12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century"), who had focused on studying [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") and [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") works of natural sciences, philosophy, and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

_[Portrait of a Young Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait\_of\_a\_Young\_Woman\_(Botticelli,\_Frankfurt) "Portrait of a Young Woman (Botticelli, Frankfurt)")_ (c. 1480–85) ([Simonetta Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonetta_Vespucci "Simonetta Vespucci")) by [Sandro Botticelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli "Sandro Botticelli")

In the revival of [neoplatonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism"), Renaissance humanists did not reject [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"); on the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] But a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-openuni-30)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from [Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium "Byzantium") to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists [Lorenzo Valla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla "Lorenzo Valla") and [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus "Erasmus"), helped pave the way for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Well after the first artistic return to [classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism "Classicism") had been exemplified in the sculpture of [Nicola Pisano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pisano "Nicola Pisano"), Florentine painters led by [Masaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaccio "Masaccio") strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)") and light more naturally. [Political philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"), most famously [Niccolò Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli "Niccolò Machiavelli"), sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism, [Giovanni Pico della Mirandola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola "Giovanni Pico della Mirandola") wrote _De hominis dignitate_ (_[Oration on the Dignity of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oration\_on\_the\_Dignity\_of\_Man "Oration on the Dignity of Man")_, 1486), a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith, and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press"), this allowed many more people access to books, especially the Bible.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-31)

In all, the Renaissance can be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought. Political philosopher [Hans Kohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kohn "Hans Kohn") describes it as an age where "Men looked for new foundations"; some like [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus "Erasmus") and [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More") envisioned new reformed spiritual foundations, others. in the words of [Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavelli "Machiavelli"), _una lunga sperienza delle cose moderne ed una continua lezione delle antiche_ (a long experience with modern life and a continuous learning from antiquity).[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-32)

Sociologist [Rodney Stark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Stark "Rodney Stark") plays down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the [Italian city-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_city-states "Italian city-states") in the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages"), which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-33) This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were [absolute monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"), and others were under direct Church control, the independent [city-republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state") of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented [Commercial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Revolution "Commercial Revolution") that preceded and financed the Renaissance.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Historian [Leon Poliakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Poliakov "Leon Poliakov") offers a critical view in his seminal study of European racist thought: _The Aryan Myth_. According to Poliakov, the use of ethnic origin myths are first used by Renaissance humanists "in the service of a new born chauvinism".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-34)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-35)

Origins
-------

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Sunset_over_florence_1.jpg/250px-Sunset_over_florence_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sunset_over_florence_1.jpg)

View of [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), birthplace of the Renaissance

Many argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, in particular with the writings of [Dante Alighieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri") (1265–1321) and [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch") (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of [Giotto di Bondone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto_di_Bondone "Giotto di Bondone") (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses [Lorenzo Ghiberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ghiberti "Lorenzo Ghiberti") and [Filippo Brunelleschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi "Filippo Brunelleschi") competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the [Baptistery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Baptistery "Florence Baptistery") of the [Florence Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral "Florence Cathedral") (Ghiberti won).[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-36) Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, [Donatello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello "Donatello"), and [Masaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaccio "Masaccio") for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance.

Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins. Peter Rietbergen posits that various influential Proto-Renaissance movements started from roughly 1300 onwards across many regions of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-:02-37)

### Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Salutati.jpg/250px-Salutati.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Salutati.jpg)

[Coluccio Salutati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati "Coluccio Salutati")

In stark contrast to the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages"), when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics,[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-38) Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch"), [Coluccio Salutati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati "Coluccio Salutati") (1331–1406), [Niccolò de' Niccoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_de%27_Niccoli "Niccolò de' Niccoli") (1364–1437), and [Poggio Bracciolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggio_Bracciolini "Poggio Bracciolini") (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero"), [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius"), [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy "Livy"), and [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-39) By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-40)

Unlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics, and philosophy had been studied since the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages") in Western Europe and in the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer"), the Greek dramatists, [Demosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosthenes "Demosthenes") and [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides "Thucydides")) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval [Islamic worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world "Islamic world"); in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the [Timurid Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Renaissance "Timurid Renaissance") in [Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand "Samarkand") and [Herat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat "Herat"), whose magnificence toned with Florence as the center of a cultural rebirth,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-41)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-42) were linked to the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), whose conquests led to the migration of [Greek scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_scholars_in_the_Renaissance "Greek scholars in the Renaissance") to Italian cities.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Britannica1-19)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-43) One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity.

[Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") logicians, most notably [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") and [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes"), had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt "Muslim conquest of Egypt") and the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant "Muslim conquest of the Levant"). Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into [Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") and [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Sicily "Emirate of Sicily"), which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from [Classical Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Arabic "Classical Arabic") to [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") were established in Iberia, most notably the [Toledo School of Translators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo_School_of_Translators "Toledo School of Translators"). This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-MP-44)

The movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar [Manuel Chrysoloras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Chrysoloras "Manuel Chrysoloras") (c. 1355–1415) to teach Greek in Florence.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-45) This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from [Basilios Bessarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilios_Bessarion "Basilios Bessarion") to [Leo Allatius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Allatius "Leo Allatius").

### Social and political structures in Italy

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Italy_1494_AD.png/250px-Italy_1494_AD.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Italy_1494_AD.png)

A political map of the [Italian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Peninsula "Italian Peninsula") c. 1494

The unique political structures of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") during the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages") have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a [political entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state") in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller [city-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_city-states "Italian city-states") and territories: the [Neapolitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples "Kingdom of Naples") controlled the south, the [Florentines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence "Republic of Florence") and the [Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States") at the center, the [Milanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan "Duchy of Milan") and the [Genoese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa "Republic of Genoa") to the north and west respectively, and the [Venetians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice") to the north east. 15th-century Italy was one of the most [urbanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization "Urbanization") areas in Europe.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-46) Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-47)

Historian and political philosopher [Quentin Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Skinner "Quentin Skinner") points out that [Otto of Freising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_of_Freising "Otto of Freising") (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from [feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance [fresco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco "Fresco") cycle _[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Allegory\_of\_Good\_and\_Bad\_Government "The Allegory of Good and Bad Government")_ by [Ambrogio Lorenzetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrogio_Lorenzetti "Ambrogio Lorenzetti") (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and [Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the [Matteo Palmieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Palmieri "Matteo Palmieri") (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Skinner,_Quentin_p._69-48)

Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their [merchant republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_republics "Maritime republics"), especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were [oligarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy"), and bore little resemblance to a modern [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Skinner,_Quentin_p._69-48)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-49)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-50) The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-burckhardt-republics-51) Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. [Merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant "Merchant") brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant"). Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of [fine glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_glass "Venetian glass"), while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-burckhardt-republics-51)

### Black Death

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/The_Triumph_of_Death_by_Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder.jpg/250px-The_Triumph_of_Death_by_Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Triumph_of_Death_by_Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder.jpg)

[Pieter Bruegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Brueghel_the_Elder "Pieter Brueghel the Elder")'s _[The Triumph of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Triumph\_of\_Death "The Triumph of Death")_ (c. 1562) reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed the plague that devastated medieval Europe.

One theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") caused by the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death"), which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th century Italy. [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death_in_Italy "Black Death in Italy") was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") and the [afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-52) It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the [sponsorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron#Arts "Patron") of religious works of art.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-53) However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic "Pandemic") that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-brotton-22)

The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England "Kingdom of England"), then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the [bubonic plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague "Bubonic plague"). Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1348. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-54)

The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30–40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-55) Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.

The spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [Epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic "Epidemic") ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as [typhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") and [congenital syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_syphilis "Congenital syphilis"), target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-56)

The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-57)

### Cultural conditions in Florence

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Vasari-Lorenzo.jpg/250px-Vasari-Lorenzo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vasari-Lorenzo.jpg)

[Lorenzo de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici "Lorenzo de' Medici"), ruler of [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") and patron of arts (portrait by [Vasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasari "Vasari"))

It has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence"), and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the [Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici "House of Medici"), a banking family and later [ducal ruling house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty"), in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because "[Great Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory "Great man theory")" were born there by chance:[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-burckhardt-individual-58) Leonardo, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany "Tuscany"). Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these "Great Men" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-59)

[Lorenzo de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici "Lorenzo de' Medici") (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci"), [Sandro Botticelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli "Sandro Botticelli"), and [Michelangelo Buonarroti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Buonarroti "Michelangelo Buonarroti").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-strathern-18) Works by [Neri di Bicci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neri_di_Bicci "Neri di Bicci"), Botticelli, Leonardo, and [Filippino Lippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippino_Lippi "Filippino Lippi") had been commissioned additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-60)

The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de' Medici came to power – indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society.

Characteristics
---------------

### Humanism

In some ways, [Renaissance humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism") was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval [scholastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in their original languages and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence"). Humanist education was based on the programme of _Studia Humanitatis_, the study of five humanities: [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"), [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar"), [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History"), [moral philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_philosophy "Moral philosophy"), and [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric"). Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on "a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome".[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-61) Above all, humanists asserted "the genius of man... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind".[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-62)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Pico1.jpg/250px-Pico1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pico1.jpg)

[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola "Giovanni Pico della Mirandola"), writer of the famous _[Oration on the Dignity of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oration\_on\_the\_Dignity\_of\_Man "Oration on the Dignity of Man")_, which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance"[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-63)

Humanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More") revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government, following the Islamic steps of [Ibn Khaldun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun "Ibn Khaldun").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-64)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-65)[Pico della Mirandola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_della_Mirandola "Pico della Mirandola") wrote the "manifesto" of the Renaissance, the _[Oration on the Dignity of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oration\_on\_the\_Dignity\_of\_Man "Oration on the Dignity of Man")_, a vibrant defence of thinking.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][Matteo Palmieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Palmieri "Matteo Palmieri") (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work _Della vita civile_ ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which advocated [civic humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_republicanism "Classical republicanism"), and for his influence in refining the [Tuscan vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_language "Tuscan language") to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero"), who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also [Quintilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintilian "Quintilian"). Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work _La città di vita_, but an earlier work, _Della vita civile_, is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-66) This ideology was referred to as the _[uomo universale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath")_, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.

### Humanism and libraries

A unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. An essential tool of Renaissance librarianship was the catalog that listed, described, and classified a library's books.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-67) Some of the richest "bibliophiles" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called "court libraries", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.).

### Art

Renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. [Giotto di Bondone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto "Giotto") (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect [Filippo Brunelleschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi "Filippo Brunelleschi") (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of [Leon Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti "Leon Battista Alberti") (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-68)

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/250px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg)

[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci")'s _[Vitruvian Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian\_Man "Vitruvian Man")_ (c. 1490) demonstrates the effect writers of Antiquity had on Renaissance thinkers. Based on the specifications in [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius")' _[De architectura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_architectura "De architectura")_ (1st century BC), Leonardo tried to draw the perfectly proportioned man. ([Gallerie dell'Accademia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallerie_dell%27Accademia "Gallerie dell'Accademia"), [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice"))

The development of [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)") was part of a wider trend toward [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts) "Realism (arts)") in the arts.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-69) Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci"), [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy"). Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), with the works of Leonardo, [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo") and [Raphael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael "Raphael") representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-70) Other notable artists include [Sandro Botticelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli "Sandro Botticelli"), working for the Medici in Florence, [Donatello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello "Donatello"), another Florentine, and [Titian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian "Titian") in Venice, among others.

In the [Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries "Low Countries"), a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of [Hugo van der Goes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_van_der_Goes "Hugo van der Goes") and [Jan van Eyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck "Jan van Eyck") was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of [oil paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_paint "Oil paint") and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the work of [Pieter Brueghel the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Brueghel_the_Elder "Pieter Brueghel the Elder") would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-71)

In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius") and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of [Florence Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral "Florence Cathedral").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-72) Another building demonstrating this style is the [Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Sant%27Andrea,_Mantua "Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua"), built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the [High Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Renaissance "High Renaissance") was the rebuilding of [St. Peter's Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica "St. Peter's Basilica"), combining the skills of [Bramante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramante "Bramante"), Michelangelo, Raphael, [Sangallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_da_Sangallo_the_Younger "Antonio da Sangallo the Younger") and [Maderno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maderno "Carlo Maderno").

During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, [pilasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaster "Pilaster"), and [entablatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entablatures "Entablatures") as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: [Tuscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_order "Tuscan order") and [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_order "Composite order"). These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-73) Arches, semi-circular or (in the [Mannerist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannerism "Mannerism") style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_style "Gothic style") vault, which is frequently rectangular.

Renaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. [Nicola Pisano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pisano "Nicola Pisano") (c. 1220 – c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His _Annunciation_, from the [Pisa Baptistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa_Baptistry "Pisa Baptistry"), demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-74)

### Science

_[Portrait of Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait\_of\_Luca\_Pacioli "Portrait of Luca Pacioli")_, father of accounting, painted by [Jacopo de' Barbari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_de%27_Barbari "Jacopo de' Barbari"),[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-76) 1495 ([Museo di Capodimonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_di_Capodimonte "Museo di Capodimonte"))

Applied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century, [Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli "Luca Pacioli") published the first work on [bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping "Bookkeeping"), making him the founder of [accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting "Accounting").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-jkdiwan-9)

The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") in about 1440 democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance"), humanists favored the study of [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities") over [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") or [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics"), and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and [Ptolemaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") views of the universe. Writing around 1450, [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa "Nicholas of Cusa") anticipated the [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism") worldview of [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus"), but in a philosophical fashion.

Science and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Leonardo set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led [Fritjof Capra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritjof_Capra "Fritjof Capra") to classify him as the "father of modern science".[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-78) Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-79)

A suitable environment had developed to question classical scientific doctrine. The [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery") in 1492 of the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World") by [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation "Counter-Reformation") clashed, the [Northern Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance "Northern Renaissance") showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-80) The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.

Some view this as a "[Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution")", heralding the beginning of the modern age,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-81) others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-82) Significant scientific advances were made during this time by [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe"), and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-83) Copernicus, in _[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus\_orbium\_coelestium "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium")_ (_On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_), posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. _[De humani corporis fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_humani\_corporis\_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")_ (_On the Workings of the Human Body_) by [Andreas Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius "Andreas Vesalius"), gave a new confidence to the role of [dissection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection "Dissection"), observation, and the [mechanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy "Mechanical philosophy") view of anatomy.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-short-science-84)

Another important development was in the _process_ for discovery, the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"),[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-short-science-84) focusing on [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") and the importance of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), while discarding much of Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-85)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-86) The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-87)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-88)

### Navigation and geography

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg/250px-Cantino_planisphere_%281502%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg)

The [Cantino planisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantino_planisphere "Cantino planisphere") (1502), the earliest world map detailing [Portuguese maritime exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_maritime_exploration "Portuguese maritime exploration")

During the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650,[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-89) every continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica"). This development is depicted in the large world map _Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula_ made by the Dutch cartographer [Joan Blaeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blaeu "Joan Blaeu") in 1648 to commemorate the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia").

In 1492, [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to India of the [Delhi Sultanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate "Delhi Sultanate"). He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the [East Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies "East Indies").

In 1606, the Dutch navigator [Willem Janszoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Janszoon "Willem Janszoon") sailed from the East Indies in the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company") ship [Duyfken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duyfken "Duyfken") and landed in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"). He charted about 300 km of the west coast of [Cape York Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York_Peninsula "Cape York Peninsula") in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west, and south coasts. In 1642–1643, [Abel Tasman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman "Abel Tasman") circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.

By 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named [New Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Holland_(Australia) "New Holland (Australia)"), except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by [James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook "James Cook").

The long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as [Terra Australis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Australis "Terra Australis"), or 'Australia' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of 'Antarctica' was bestowed on the south polar continent.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-90)

### Music

From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the [polyphonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony "Polyphony") style of the [Franco-Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Flemish "Franco-Flemish") school. The development of [printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of [chansons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanson "Chanson"), [motets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motet "Motet"), and [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(music) "Mass (music)") throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as [Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina "Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina"), [Orlande de Lassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlande_de_Lassus "Orlande de Lassus"), [Tomás Luis de Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Luis_de_Victoria "Tomás Luis de Victoria"), and [William Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byrd "William Byrd").

### Religion

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg/250px-Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pope_Alexander_Vi.jpg)

[Alexander VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI "Pope Alexander VI"), a [Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Borgia "House of Borgia") Pope infamous for his corruption

The new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, especially in the [Northern Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance "Northern Renaissance"). Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-openuni-30) However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-openuni-30) Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus "Erasmus"), [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli "Huldrych Zwingli"), [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More"), [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), and [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin "John Calvin").

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Clovio_magi.jpg/250px-Clovio_magi.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clovio_magi.jpg)

_[Adoration of the Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration\_of\_the\_Magi "Adoration of the Magi")_ and _[Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon "Solomon") adored by the [Queen of Sheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen\_of\_Sheba "Queen of Sheba")_ from the _[Farnese Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnese\_Hours "Farnese Hours")_ (1546) by [Giulio Clovio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Clovio "Giulio Clovio") marks [the end of the Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance#Renaissance_end "Italian Renaissance") of [illuminated manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript "Illuminated manuscript") together with the _[Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index\_Librorum\_Prohibitorum "Index Librorum Prohibitorum")_.

The Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The Late Middle Ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the [Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papacy "Papacy"), culminating in the [Western Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism "Western Schism"), in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true [Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop "Bishop") of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Rome "Diocese of Rome").[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-91) While the schism was resolved by the [Council of Constance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Constance "Council of Constance") (1414), a resulting reform movement known as [Conciliarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conciliarism "Conciliarism") sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the [Fifth Council of the Lateran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Council_of_the_Lateran "Fifth Council of the Lateran") (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of [Pope Alexander VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI "Pope Alexander VI"), who was accused variously of [simony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simony "Simony"), [nepotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism "Nepotism"), and [fathering children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_ordained "Children of the ordained") (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church) "Cardinal (Catholic Church)").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-92)

Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist [textual criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism "Textual criticism") of the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-openuni-30) In October 1517, Luther published the _[Ninety-five Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five\_Theses "Ninety-five Theses")_, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold [indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence "Indulgence").[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-93) The 95 Theses led to the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation"), a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe"). Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.

[Pope Paul III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_III "Pope Paul III") came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the [sack of Rome in 1527](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527) "Sack of Rome (1527)"), with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated _[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus\_orbium\_coelestium "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium")_ (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of [Alessandro Farnese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Farnese_(cardinal) "Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)"), who had paintings by [Titian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian "Titian"), [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo"), and [Raphael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael "Raphael"), as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of [Giulio Clovio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Clovio "Giulio Clovio"), arguably the last major [illuminated manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript "Illuminated manuscript"), the _[Farnese Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnese\_Hours "Farnese Hours")_.

### Self-awareness

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/The_historian_Leonardo_Bruni.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_historian_Leonardo_Bruni.jpg)

[Leonardo Bruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bruni "Leonardo Bruni")

By the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as _modi antichi_ (in the antique manner) or _alle romana et alla antica_ (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch "Petrarch") referred to pre-Christian times as _antiqua_ (ancient) and to the Christian period as _nova_ (new).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-mommsen-94) From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-mommsen-94)[Leonardo Bruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bruni "Leonardo Bruni") was the first to use tripartite [periodization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodization "Periodization") in his _History of the Florentine People_ (1442).[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Hankins-95) Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. [Flavio Biondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Biondo "Flavio Biondo") used a similar framework in _Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire_ (1439–1453).

Humanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the "Middle Ages". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as _media tempestas_ (middle times).[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Albrow-96) The term _rinascita_ (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [Giorgio Vasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Vasari "Giorgio Vasari")'s _[Lives of the Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le\_Vite\_de%27\_pi%C3%B9\_eccellenti\_pittori,\_scultori,\_e\_architettori "Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori")_, 1550, revised 1568.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-panofsky-97)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-98) Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains [Cimabue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimabue "Cimabue"), [Giotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto "Giotto"), and [Arnolfo di Cambio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfo_di_Cambio "Arnolfo di Cambio"); the second phase contains [Masaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaccio "Masaccio"), [Brunelleschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi "Filippo Brunelleschi"), and [Donatello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello "Donatello"); the third centers on [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") and culminates with [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo"). It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-99)

Spread
------

In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") by German printer [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg "Johannes Gutenberg") allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.

### England

"What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god!" – from [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare")'s _[Hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")_

The [Elizabethan era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era "Elizabethan era") in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in the early 16th century during the reign of [Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII "Henry VIII").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-100)

The English Renaissance is different from the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature") and [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music"), which had a rich flowering.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-101)[Visual arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts "Visual arts") in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance period in art began far later than the Italian, which had moved into [Mannerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannerism "Mannerism") by the 1530s.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-102)

In literature the later part of the 16th century saw the flowering of [Elizabethan literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_literature "Elizabethan literature"), with poetry heavily influenced by [Italian Renaissance literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance_literature "Italian Renaissance literature") but [Elizabethan theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_theatre "Elizabethan theatre") a distinctive native style. Writers include [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") (1564–1616), [Christopher Marlowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe "Christopher Marlowe") (1564–1593), [Edmund Spenser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Spenser "Edmund Spenser") (1552–1599), Sir [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More") (1478–1535), and Sir [Philip Sidney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sidney "Philip Sidney") (1554–1586). [English Renaissance music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Renaissance_music "English Renaissance music") competed with that in Europe with composers such as [Thomas Tallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tallis "Thomas Tallis") (1505–1585), [John Taverner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taverner "John Taverner") (1490–1545), and [William Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byrd "William Byrd") (1540–1623). [Elizabethan architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_architecture "Elizabethan architecture") produced the large [prodigy houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_house "Prodigy house") of courtiers, and in the next century [Inigo Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inigo_Jones "Inigo Jones") (1573–1652), who introduced [Palladian architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladian_architecture "Palladian architecture") to England.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-103)

Elsewhere, Sir [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon") (1561–1626) was the pioneer of modern scientific thought, and is commonly regarded as one of the founders of the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-104)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-105)

### France

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Chateau_de_chambord.jpg/250px-Chateau_de_chambord.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chateau_de_chambord.jpg)

[Château de Chambord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Chambord "Château de Chambord") (1519–1547), one of the most famous examples of [Renaissance architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture "Renaissance architecture")

The word "Renaissance" is borrowed from the French language, where it means "re-birth". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French [historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian "Historian")[Jules Michelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Michelet "Jules Michelet") (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, _Histoire de France_ (History of France).[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Michelet,_Jules_1847-106)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Cronin2011-107)

In 1495 the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") arrived in France, imported by King [Charles VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France "Charles VIII of France") after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death "Black Death"). [Francis I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France "Francis I of France") imported Italian art and artists, including [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci"), [Primaticcio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Primaticcio "Francesco Primaticcio"), [Rosso Fiorentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosso_Fiorentino "Rosso Fiorentino"), [Niccolò dell'Abbate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_dell%27Abbate "Niccolò dell'Abbate") and [Benvenuto Cellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benvenuto_Cellini "Benvenuto Cellini") and built ornate palaces at great expense, like the [Palace of Fontainebleau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fontainebleau "Palace of Fontainebleau") and the [castle of Chambord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Chambord "Castle of Chambord"). Writers such as [François Rabelais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais "François Rabelais"), [Pierre de Ronsard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Ronsard "Pierre de Ronsard"), [Joachim du Bellay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_du_Bellay "Joachim du Bellay"), and [Michel de Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne "Michel de Montaigne"), painters such as [Jean Clouet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Clouet "Jean Clouet") and [François Clouet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Clouet "François Clouet"), and musicians such as [Jean Mouton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Mouton "Jean Mouton") also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance. French Renaissance sculptors include [Michel Colombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Colombe "Michel Colombe"), [Jean Goujon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Goujon "Jean Goujon"), [Pierre Bontemps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bontemps "Pierre Bontemps"), [Ligier Richier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligier_Richier "Ligier Richier") and [Germain Pilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germain_Pilon "Germain Pilon") while important architects of the time were [Pierre Lescot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Lescot "Pierre Lescot"), who built the Henri II aisle of the [Louvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Palace "Louvre Palace"), [Philibert Delorme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philibert_de_l%27Orme "Philibert de l'Orme") and [Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_I_Androuet_du_Cerceau "Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau").

In 1533, a fourteen-year-old [Catherine de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici "Catherine de' Medici") (1519–1589), born in Florence to [Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici,_Duke_of_Urbino "Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino") and [Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_de_La_Tour_d%27Auvergne "Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne"), married [Henry II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_France "Henry II of France"), second son of King Francis I and Queen [Claude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_of_France "Claude of France"). Though she became famous and infamous for her role in the [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion "French Wars of Religion"), she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences, and music (including the origins of [ballet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet "Ballet")) to the French court from her native Florence.

In the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and the [Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries "Low Countries"), where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and Renaissance artists such as [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer "Albrecht Dürer") (1471–1528) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism_in_Northern_Europe "Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe") became closely linked to the turmoil of the Reformation, and the art and writing of the [German Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Renaissance "German Renaissance") frequently reflected this dispute.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-108) However, the [Gothic style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_style "Gothic style") and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor [Maximilian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor") of [Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg "Habsburg") (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire").

### Hungarian trecento and quattrocento

After Italy, [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary "Kingdom of Hungary") was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-109) The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the [Quattrocento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattrocento "Quattrocento") (1400s) to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships — not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations– growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason– exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) [Castle in Buda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda_Castle "Buda Castle"), the castles of Visegrád, [Tata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Castle "Tata Castle"), and Várpalota. In [Sigismund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor")'s court there were patrons such as [Pippo Spano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippo_Spano "Pippo Spano"), a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and [Masolino da Pannicale](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masolino_da_Pannicale&action=edit&redlink=1 "Masolino da Pannicale (page does not exist)") to Hungary.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-110)

The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the [Florentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to [Buda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda "Buda"), helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them [Vitéz János](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vit%C3%A9z_J%C3%A1nos "Vitéz János"), archbishop of [Esztergom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esztergom "Esztergom"), one of the founders of Hungarian humanism.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-111) During the long reign of Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture "Gothic architecture") palace of the late [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). King [Matthias Corvinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Corvinus "Matthias Corvinus") (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-112)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-113)

After the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to [Beatrice of Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_of_Naples "Beatrice of Naples"), [Buda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda "Buda") became one of the most important artistic centers of the Renaissance north of the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps").[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-czigany-114) The most important humanists living in Matthias' court were [Antonio Bonfini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Bonfini "Antonio Bonfini") and the famous Hungarian poet [Janus Pannonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Pannonius "Janus Pannonius").[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-czigany-114)[András Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A1s_Hess "András Hess") set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus's library, the [Bibliotheca Corviniana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_Corviniana "Bibliotheca Corviniana"), was Europe's greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the [Vatican Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Library "Vatican Library"). (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-115) In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus's library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-116)

Matthias started at least two major building projects.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEE._Kov%C3%A1cs1990177,_180%E2%80%93181-117) The works in Buda and [Visegrád](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d "Visegrád") began in about 1479.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngel2001319-118) Two new wings and a [hanging garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_garden "Hanging garden") were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngel2001319-118)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEE._Kov%C3%A1cs1990180%E2%80%93181-119) Matthias appointed the Italian [Chimenti Camicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimenti_Camicia "Chimenti Camicia") and the Dalmatian [Giovanni Dalmata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Dalmata "Giovanni Dalmata") to direct these projects.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngel2001319-118) Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor [Benedetto da Majano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_da_Majano "Benedetto da Majano") and the painters [Filippino Lippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippino_Lippi "Filippino Lippi") and [Andrea Mantegna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna "Andrea Mantegna") worked for him.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKubinyi2008171%E2%80%93172-120) A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKubinyi2008172-121) Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer [Aristotele Fioravanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotele_Fioravanti "Aristotele Fioravanti") to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEE._Kov%C3%A1cs1990181-122) He had new monasteries built in [Late Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture "Gothic architecture") style for the [Franciscans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans "Franciscans") in Kolozsvár, [Szeged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged "Szeged") and Hunyad, and for the [Paulines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Paul_the_First_Hermit "Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit") in Fejéregyháza.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlaniczay1992168-123)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKubinyi2008183-124) In the spring of 1485, [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") travelled to [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1301%E2%80%931526) "Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)") on behalf of Sforza to meet King Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a [Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(art) "Madonna (art)").[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-125)

Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlaniczay1992166-126) The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars—mostly Italian—to settle in Buda.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge201167-127) Antonio Bonfini, [Pietro Ranzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Ranzano "Pietro Ranzano"), Bartolomeo Fonzio, and [Francesco Bandini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Bandini "Francesco Bandini") spent many years in Matthias's court.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEE._Kov%C3%A1cs1990185-128)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlaniczay1992166-126) This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of [Neoplatonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism") to Hungary.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlaniczay1992167-129)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngel2001321-130) Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHendrix201359-131)[Martius Galeotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martius_Galeotti "Martius Galeotti") described him as "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias "never did anything without consulting the stars".[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHendrix201363,_65-132) Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, [Johannes Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Regiomontanus "Johannes Regiomontanus") and [Marcin Bylica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcin_Bylica "Marcin Bylica"), set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with [astrolabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") and [celestial globes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_globe "Celestial globe").[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTETanner200999-133) Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") to Matthias.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge201167-127)

Other important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include [Bálint Balassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1lint_Balassi "Bálint Balassi") (poet), [Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebesty%C3%A9n_Tin%C3%B3di_Lantos "Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos") (poet), [Bálint Bakfark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1lint_Bakfark "Bálint Bakfark") (composer and lutenist), and [Master MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_MS "Master MS") (fresco painter).

### Renaissance in the Low Countries

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Holbein-erasmus.jpg/250px-Holbein-erasmus.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg)

[Erasmus of Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_of_Rotterdam "Erasmus of Rotterdam") in 1523, as depicted by [Hans Holbein the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger "Hans Holbein the Younger")

Culture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges "Bruges"), which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Heughebaert-134) In science, the [anatomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy "Anatomy")[Andreas Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius "Andreas Vesalius") led the way; in [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography"), [Gerardus Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator "Gerardus Mercator")'s map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, [Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_and_Flemish_Renaissance_painting "Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting") ranged from the strange work of [Hieronymus Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch "Hieronymus Bosch")[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Janson-135) to the everyday life depictions of [Pieter Brueghel the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Brueghel_the_Elder "Pieter Brueghel the Elder").[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Heughebaert-134)

Erasmus was arguably the Netherlands' best known humanist and Catholic intellectual during the Renaissance.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-:02-37)

### Northern Europe

The Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the "Northern Renaissance". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music "Renaissance music").[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-musical-quarterly-136) The music of the 15th-century [Burgundian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_School "Burgundian School") defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the [polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony "Polyphony") of the [Netherlanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Flemish_School "Franco-Flemish School"), as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music") since the standardization of [Gregorian Chant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_Chant "Gregorian Chant") in the 9th century.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-musical-quarterly-136) The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian [composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer")[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina "Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina"). At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the [Venetian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_School_(music) "Venetian School (music)"), which spread northward into Germany around 1600. In [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark "Denmark"), the Renaissance sparked the translation of the works of [Saxo Grammaticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxo_Grammaticus "Saxo Grammaticus") into [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Realm "Danish Realm") as well as [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Denmark "Frederick II of Denmark") and [Christian IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_IV_of_Denmark "Christian IV of Denmark") ordering the redecoration or construction of several important works of architecture, i.e. [Kronborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronborg "Kronborg"), [Rosenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_Castle "Rosenborg Castle") and [Børsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B8rsen "Børsen").[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-137) Danish astronomer [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") greatly contributed to turn astronomy into the first [modern science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_science "Modern science") and also helped launch the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution").[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-138)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-139)

The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer "Albrecht Dürer"). Later, the works of [Pieter Bruegel the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder "Pieter Bruegel the Elder") influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that [Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Primitives "Flemish Primitives") brothers [Hubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_van_Eyck "Hubert van Eyck") and [Jan van Eyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck "Jan van Eyck") perfected the [oil painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_painting "Oil painting") technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-140) A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of [Dante Alighieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri") on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-141) The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.

### Poland

The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Golden_Age "Polish Golden Age") of [Polish culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_culture "Polish culture"). Ruled by the [Jagiellonian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_dynasty "Jagiellonian dynasty"), the [Kingdom of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland "Crown of the Kingdom of Poland") (from 1569 known as the [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth "Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth")) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. An early Italian humanist who came to Poland in the mid-15th century was [Filippo Buonaccorsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Buonaccorsi "Filippo Buonaccorsi"), who was employed as royal advisor and councillor. The tomb of [John I Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I_Albert "John I Albert"), completed in 1505 by [Francesco Fiorentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Fiorentino "Francesco Fiorentino"), is the first example of a Renaissance composition in the country.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-142)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-143) Many Italian artists subsequently came to Poland with [Bona Sforza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bona_Sforza "Bona Sforza") of [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan"), when she married King [Sigismund I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund_I_the_Old "Sigismund I the Old") in 1518.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-144) This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-145)

The Renaissance was a period when the multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars, aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated [eastern and southern borderlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresy "Kresy"). Architecture became more refined and decorative. [Mannerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannerist_architecture_and_sculpture_in_Poland "Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland") played an important part in shaping what is now considered to be the truly Polish architectural style – high [attics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_(architecture) "Attic (architecture)") above the [cornice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornice "Cornice") with pinnacles and [pilasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaster "Pilaster").[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-146) It was also the time when the first major works of [Polish literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_literature "Polish literature") were published, particularly those of [Mikołaj Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_Rey "Mikołaj Rey") and [Jan Kochanowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kochanowski "Jan Kochanowski"), and the [Polish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language") became the _[lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua\_franca "Lingua franca")_ of East-Central Europe.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-147) The [Jagiellonian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University "Jagiellonian University") transformed into a major institution of higher education for the region and hosted many notable scholars, chiefly [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") and [Conrad Celtes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Celtes "Conrad Celtes"). Three more academies were founded at [Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg "University of Königsberg") (1544), [Vilnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_University "Vilnius University") (1579), and [Zamość](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamoyski_Academy "Zamoyski Academy") (1594). The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country, giving rise to the [Nontrinitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism "Nontrinitarianism")[Polish Brethren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Brethren "Polish Brethren").[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-148) Living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (_[szlachta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szlachta "Szlachta")_) and [magnates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnates_of_Poland_and_Lithuania "Magnates of Poland and Lithuania"). The nobles gained dominance in the new political system of [Golden Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Liberty "Golden Liberty"), a counterweight to [monarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy")[absolutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutism_(European_history) "Absolutism (European history)").[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-149)

### Portugal

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Cam%C3%B5es%2C_por_Fern%C3%A3o_Gomes.jpg/250px-Cam%C3%B5es%2C_por_Fern%C3%A3o_Gomes.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cam%C3%B5es,_por_Fern%C3%A3o_Gomes.jpg)

[Luís de Camões](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_de_Cam%C3%B5es "Luís de Camões"), and his seminal work _[Os Lusíadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os\_Lus%C3%ADadas "Os Lusíadas")_, are considered the greatest poet of the [Portuguese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language") and the pinnacle of [Portuguese literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_literature "Portuguese literature"), respectively.

Although Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Portugal "Kingdom of Portugal") was influential in broadening the European worldview,[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-JCBL-150) stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, [Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon "Lisbon") flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including [Pedro Nunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Nunes "Pedro Nunes"), [João de Castro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Castro "João de Castro"), [Abraham Zacuto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Zacuto "Abraham Zacuto"), and [Martin Behaim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Behaim "Martin Behaim"). Cartographers [Pedro Reinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Reinel "Pedro Reinel"), [Lopo Homem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopo_Homem "Lopo Homem"), [Estêvão Gomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%AAv%C3%A3o_Gomes "Estêvão Gomes"), and [Diogo Ribeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Ribeiro_(cartographer) "Diogo Ribeiro (cartographer)") made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary [Tomé Pires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A9_Pires "Tomé Pires") and physicians [Garcia de Orta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcia_de_Orta "Garcia de Orta") and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist [Carolus Clusius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Clusius "Carolus Clusius").

In architecture, the huge profits of the [spice trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_trade "Spice trade") financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the [Manueline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manueline "Manueline"), incorporating maritime elements.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-151) The primary painters were [Nuno Gonçalves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Gon%C3%A7alves "Nuno Gonçalves"), [Gregório Lopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg%C3%B3rio_Lopes "Gregório Lopes"), and [Vasco Fernandes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_Fernandes_(artist) "Vasco Fernandes (artist)"). In music, [Pedro de Escobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Escobar "Pedro de Escobar") and [Duarte Lobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duarte_Lobo "Duarte Lobo") produced four songbooks, including the [Cancioneiro de Elvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancioneiro_de_Elvas "Cancioneiro de Elvas").

In literature, [Luís de Camões](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_de_Cam%C3%B5es "Luís de Camões") inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem _[Os Lusíadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os\_Lus%C3%ADadas "Os Lusíadas")_. [Sá de Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1_de_Miranda "Sá de Miranda") introduced Italian forms of verse and [Bernardim Ribeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardim_Ribeiro "Bernardim Ribeiro") developed [pastoral romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral#Pastoral_romances "Pastoral"), while plays by [Gil Vicente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Vicente "Gil Vicente") fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times. [Travel literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_literature "Travel literature") especially flourished: [João de Barros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Barros "João de Barros"), [Fernão Lopes de Castanheda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern%C3%A3o_Lopes_de_Castanheda "Fernão Lopes de Castanheda"), [António Galvão](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Galv%C3%A3o "António Galvão"), [Gaspar Correia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_Correia "Gaspar Correia"), [Duarte Barbosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duarte_Barbosa "Duarte Barbosa"), and [Fernão Mendes Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern%C3%A3o_Mendes_Pinto "Fernão Mendes Pinto"), among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-JCBL-150) After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci "Amerigo Vespucci") coined the term [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World"),[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Bergin-152) in his letters to [Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Pierfrancesco_de%27_Medici "Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici").

The intense international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including [Francisco de Holanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Holanda "Francisco de Holanda"), [André de Resende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_de_Resende "André de Resende"), and [Damião de Góis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dami%C3%A3o_de_G%C3%B3is "Damião de Góis"), a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King [Manuel I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_I_of_Portugal "Manuel I of Portugal"). [Diogo de Gouveia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_de_Gouveia "Diogo de Gouveia") and [André de Gouveia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_de_Gouveia "André de Gouveia") made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese [factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(trading_post) "Factory (trading post)") in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp "Antwerp") attracted the interest of [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More "Thomas More")[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Bietenholz-153) and [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer "Albrecht Dürer") to the wider world.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-154) There, profits and know-how helped nurture the [Dutch Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Renaissance "Dutch Renaissance") and [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age "Dutch Golden Age"), especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community [expelled from Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews_and_Muslims_by_Manuel_I_of_Portugal "Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal").

### Spain

The [Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Escorial "El Escorial"), by [Juan de Herrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Herrera "Juan de Herrera") and [Juan Bautista de Toledo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bautista_de_Toledo "Juan Bautista de Toledo")

The Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the [Crown of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon "Crown of Aragon") and the city of [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_(city_in_Spain) "Valencia (city in Spain)"). Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Crown of Aragon, including [Ausiàs March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausi%C3%A0s_March "Ausiàs March") and [Joanot Martorell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanot_Martorell "Joanot Martorell"). In the [Crown of Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Castile "Crown of Castile"), the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as [Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8D%C3%B1igo_L%C3%B3pez_de_Mendoza,_marqu%C3%A9s_de_Santillana "Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana"), who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as [Jorge Manrique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Manrique "Jorge Manrique"), [Fernando de Rojas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_de_Rojas "Fernando de Rojas"), [Juan del Encina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_del_Encina "Juan del Encina"), [Juan Boscán Almogáver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bosc%C3%A1n_Almog%C3%A1ver "Juan Boscán Almogáver"), and [Garcilaso de la Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcilaso_de_la_Vega_(poet) "Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)"), kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. [Miguel de Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes "Miguel de Cervantes")'s [masterpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece "Masterpiece")_[Don Quixote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\_Quixote "Don Quixote")_ is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher [Juan Luis Vives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Luis_Vives "Juan Luis Vives"), grammarian [Antonio de Nebrija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Nebrija "Antonio de Nebrija") and natural historian [Pedro de Mexía](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Mex%C3%ADa "Pedro Mexía"). The poet and philosopher [Luisa de Medrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luisa_de_Medrano "Luisa de Medrano"), celebrated among her Renaissance contemporaries as one of the _puellae doctae_ ("learned girls"), was the first female professor in Europe at the [University of Salamanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Salamanca "University of Salamanca").

Later Spanish Renaissance tended toward religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as [Luis de León](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_Le%C3%B3n "Luis de León"), [Teresa of Ávila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila "Teresa of Ávila"), and [John of the Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_the_Cross "John of the Cross"), and treated issues related to the exploration of the [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World "New World"), with chroniclers and writers such as [Inca Garcilaso de la Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Garcilaso_de_la_Vega "Inca Garcilaso de la Vega") and [Bartolomé de las Casas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas "Bartolomé de las Casas"), giving rise to a body of work, now known as [Spanish Renaissance literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Renaissance_literature "Spanish Renaissance literature"). The late Renaissance in Spain produced political and religious authors such as [Tomás Fernández de Medrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Medrano "Tomás Fernández de Medrano") and artists such as [El Greco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Greco "El Greco") and composers such as [Tomás Luis de Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Luis_de_Victoria "Tomás Luis de Victoria") and [Antonio de Cabezón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Cabez%C3%B3n "Antonio de Cabezón").

### Conception

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Vite.jpg/250px-Vite.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vite.jpg)

A cover of the _Lives of the Artists_ by [Giorgio Vasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Vasari "Giorgio Vasari")

The Italian artist and critic [Giorgio Vasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Vasari "Giorgio Vasari") (1511–1574) first used the term _rinascita_ in his book _[The Lives of the Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lives\_of\_the\_Most\_Excellent\_Painters,\_Sculptors,\_and\_Architects "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects")_ (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of [Gothic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art "Gothic art"): the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") and only the [Tuscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany "Tuscany") artists, beginning with [Cimabue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimabue "Cimabue") (1240–1301) and [Giotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto "Giotto") (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw ancient art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-155)

However, only in the 19th century did the French word _renaissance_ achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late 13th century. French [historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian "Historian")[Jules Michelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Michelet "Jules Michelet") (1798–1874) defined "The Renaissance" in his 1855 work _Histoire de France_ as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-mur-28) For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from [Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") to [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus") to [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo"); that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-Michelet,_Jules_1847-106) Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, "the bizarre and monstrous" quality of the Middle Ages and the [democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy") values that he, as a vocal [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism "Republicanism"), chose to see in its character.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-brotton-22) A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-brotton-22)

The [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") historian [Jacob Burckhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Burckhardt "Jacob Burckhardt") (1818–1897) in his _[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Civilization\_of\_the\_Renaissance\_in\_Italy "The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy")_ (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between [Giotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto "Giotto") and [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo "Michelangelo") in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of [individuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism "Individualism"), which the Middle Ages had stifled.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-156) His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance").[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-157)

More recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the [University of California Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Berkeley "University of California Berkeley"), stated in 1998:

> Rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-starn-24)

### Debates about progress

There is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance toward the [modern age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_age "Modern age"). Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-burckhardt-individual-58)

> In the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-158)

Painting of the [St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_Massacre "St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre"), an event in the [French Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion "French Wars of Religion"), by [François Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Dubois "François Dubois")

On the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period– poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example– seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of Machiavellian politics, the [Wars of Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion "French Wars of Religion"), the corrupt [Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Borgia "House of Borgia")[Popes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes_from_the_Borgia_family "List of popes from the Borgia family"), and the intensified [witch-hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt "Witch-hunt") of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the "[golden age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age "Golden age")" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-159) Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-panofsky-97) Some [Marxist historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism") prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from [feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") toward [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), resulting in a [bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois "Bourgeois") class with leisure time to devote to the arts.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-160)

[Johan Huizinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Huizinga "Johan Huizinga") (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book _[The Autumn of the Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Autumn\_of\_the\_Middle\_Ages "The Autumn of the Middle Ages")_, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the [High Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages"), destroying much that was important.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-huizinga-23) The [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin "Neo-Latin") revert to its classical form. This view is however somewhat contested by [recent studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin_studies "Neo-Latin studies"). Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep [economic recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_recession "Economic recession").[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-161) Meanwhile, [George Sarton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sarton "George Sarton") and [Lynn Thorndike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Thorndike "Lynn Thorndike") have both argued that [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-162) Finally, [Joan Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Kelly "Joan Kelly") argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-163)

Some historians have begun to consider the word _Renaissance_ to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive "[Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography) "Dark Ages (historiography)")", the Middle Ages. Most political and economic historians now prefer to use the term "[early modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Europe "Early Modern Europe")" for this period (and a considerable period afterwards), a designation intended to highlight the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-164) Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-165)

The [art historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history "Art history")[Erwin Panofsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Panofsky "Erwin Panofsky") observed of this resistance to the concept of "Renaissance":

> It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization – historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science – but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-166)

Other Renaissances
------------------

The term _Renaissance_ has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries in the earlier [Medieval period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_renaissances "Medieval renaissances"). [Charles H. Haskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Haskins "Charles H. Haskins") (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a [Renaissance of the 12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_of_the_12th_century "Renaissance of the 12th century").[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-167) Other historians have argued for a [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance") in the 8th and 9th centuries, [Ottonian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian_Renaissance "Ottonian Renaissance") in the 10th century and for the [Timurid Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Renaissance "Timurid Renaissance") of the 14th century. The [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") has been also sometimes termed with the Islamic Renaissance.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#cite_note-168) The [Macedonian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_Renaissance "Macedonian Renaissance") is a term used for a period in the Roman Empire in the 9th-11th centuries CE.

Other periods of cultural rebirth in [Modern times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era "Modern era") have also been termed "renaissances", such as the [Bengal Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Renaissance "Bengal Renaissance"), [Tamil Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Renaissance "Tamil Renaissance"), [Nepal Bhasa renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal_Bhasa_renaissance "Nepal Bhasa renaissance"), [al-Nahda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nahda "Al-Nahda") or the [Harlem Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance "Harlem Renaissance"). The term can also be used in cinema. In animation, the [Disney Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Renaissance "Disney Renaissance") is a period that spanned the years from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality not witnessed since their Golden Age of Animation. The [San Francisco Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Renaissance "San Francisco Renaissance") was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction writing in [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") in the mid-20th century.
