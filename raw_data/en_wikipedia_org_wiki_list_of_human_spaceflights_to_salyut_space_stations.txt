Prior to Salyut 6, flights were referred to by the designation of the Soyuz spacecraft that transported the crew to and from the station. Flights to Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were numbered either EO- n " for long-term expedition crews, or EP- n " for short-term visiting or taxi crews, where n was sequentially increased with each flight of that type to that particular station. Salyut commanders are listed in italics . "Duration" refers to the crew and does not always correspond to "Flight up" or "Flight down". Missions which failed to reach or dock with the station are listed in red. All cosmonauts are Soviet unless otherwise indicated.

The Salyut programme was a series of Soviet space stations launched during the 1970s and 1980s. Six Salyut space stations were crewed in addition to a number of prototypes and failures. Crewed flights as part of the Salyut programme ended in 1986 as efforts were shifted to Mir .
