Sir Thomas Ming Swi Chang Born ( 1933-04-08 ) 8 April 1933 (age 92) Shantou , China Nationality Canadian Occupation(s) Physician, inventor, physiologist Awards Order of Canada Thomas Ming Swi Chang , OC (born 8 April 1933) is a Chinese-born Canadian inventor, physician, and physiologist.

While an undergraduate at McGill University in 1957, Chang invented the world's first artificial cell . Often often worked from his dormitory in McGill's Douglas Hall, using improvised materials like perfume atomizers. Ultimately, Chang managed to create a permeable plastic sack that would effectively carry haemoglobin almost as effectively as a natural blood cell .

[ 1 ] He went on to complete his B.Sc.

(1957), M.D., C.M.

(1961), and Ph.D (1965) degrees at McGill.

[ 2 ] Chang's career continued as founder and Director of the Artificial Cells and Organs Research Centre and Professor of Physiology, Medicine & Biomedical Engineering in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University.

[ 1 ] In the late 1960s he discovered enzymes carried by artificial cells could correct some metabolic disorders and also developed charcoal-filled cells to treat drug poisoning. His work on finding a safe blood substitute brought him to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, earning him an Order of Canada .

[ 3 ] The Canadian Academy of Health Sciences states, "Dr. Chang’s original ideas were years ahead of the modern era of nanotechnology, regenerative medicine, gene therapy, stem cell/cell therapy and blood substitutes. He was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize".

[ 4 ] In 2011, Dr. Chang was voted the winner of the Greatest McGillian contest organized by the McGill Alumni Association for McGill's 190th anniversary.
