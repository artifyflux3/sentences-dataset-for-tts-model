It is limited to liberal and centrist parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that the party has labeled itself as a liberal party.

History [ edit ] At the beginning of the twentieth century liberal parties emerged and played an important role in Estonia. They lost influence in the 1930s.

After the restoration of independence in 1990, both pragmatic centrist and liberal forces arose. The Estonian Reform Party ( Eesti Reformierakond ) is a free market liberal party.

[ 1 ] : 128 Despite its liberal international affiliations the Estonian Centre Party ( Eesti Keskerakond ) is generally not considered a liberal party, so therefore it is not included.
