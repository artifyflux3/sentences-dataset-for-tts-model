[ 1 ] The barotropic fluid is a useful model of fluid behavior in a wide variety of scientific fields, from meteorology to astrophysics.

The density of most liquids is nearly constant ( isopycnic ), so it can be stated that their densities vary only weakly with pressure and temperature. Water, which varies only a few percent with temperature and salinity, may be approximated as barotropic. In general, air is not barotropic, as it is a function of temperature and pressure; but, under certain circumstances, the barotropic assumption can be useful.

In astrophysics , barotropic fluids are important in the study of stellar interiors or of the interstellar medium. One common class of barotropic model used in astrophysics is a polytropic fluid . Typically, the barotropic assumption is not very realistic.

In meteorology , a barotropic atmosphere is one that for which the density of the air depends only on pressure, as a result isobaric surfaces (constant-pressure surfaces) are also constant-density surfaces. Such isobaric surfaces will also be isothermal surfaces, hence (from the thermal wind equation ) the geostrophic wind will not vary with depth. Hence, the motions of a rotating barotropic air mass is strongly constrained. The tropics are more nearly barotropic than mid-latitudes because temperature is more nearly horizontally uniform in the tropics.

A barotropic flow is a generalization of a barotropic atmosphere. It is a flow in which the pressure is a function of the density only and vice versa. In other words, it is a flow in which isobaric surfaces are isopycnic surfaces and vice versa.  One may have a barotropic flow of a non-barotropic fluid, but a barotropic fluid will always follow a barotropic flow.  Examples include barotropic layers of the oceans, an isothermal ideal gas or an isentropic ideal gas.

A fluid which is not barotropic is baroclinic , i. e., pressure is not the only factor to determine density. For a barotropic fluid or a barotropic flow (such as a barotropic atmosphere), the baroclinic vector is zero.

If ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho {}} is expressible as a function of p {\displaystyle p} only, that is, ρ ρ = ρ ρ ( p ) {\displaystyle \rho =\rho {}(p)} , the ∫ ∫ 0 p d p ρ ρ {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{p}{\frac {dp}{\rho {}}}} in Eq. 5-66 is integrable. Fluids having this characteristic are called barotropic fluids .
