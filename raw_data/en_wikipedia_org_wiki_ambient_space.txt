( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Three examples of different geometries: Euclidean , elliptical , and hyperbolic In mathematics , especially in geometry and topology , an ambient space is the space surrounding a mathematical object along with the object itself.  For example, a 1-dimensional line ( l ) {\displaystyle (l)} may be studied in isolation —in which case the ambient space of l {\displaystyle l} is l {\displaystyle l} , or it may be studied as an object embedded in 2-dimensional Euclidean space ( R 2 ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ^{2})} —in which case the ambient space of l {\displaystyle l} is R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} , or as an object embedded in 2-dimensional hyperbolic space ( H 2 ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {H} ^{2})} —in which case the ambient space of l {\displaystyle l} is H 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}} .  To see why this makes a difference, consider the statement " Parallel lines never intersect."  This is true if the ambient space is R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} , but false if the ambient space is H 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}} , because the geometric properties of R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} are different from the geometric properties of H 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}} .  All spaces are subsets of their ambient space.
