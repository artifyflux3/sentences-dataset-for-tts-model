**Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky** (;[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-15)[Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): Никола́й Ива́нович Лобаче́вский, IPA:[[nʲɪkɐˈlaj ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ ləbɐˈtɕefskʲɪj]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Russian "Help:IPA/Russian")[](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/98/Ru-Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky.ogg/Ru-Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ru-Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky.ogg "File:Ru-Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky.ogg"); 1 December[[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 20 November]1792 – 24 February[[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 12 February]1856) was a Russian mathematician and [geometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometer "Geometer"), known primarily for his work on [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), otherwise known as [Lobachevskian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobachevskian_geometry "Lobachevskian geometry"), and also for his fundamental study on [Dirichlet integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_integral "Dirichlet integral"), known as the [Lobachevsky integral formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobachevsky_integral_formula "Lobachevsky integral formula").

[William Kingdon Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford "William Kingdon Clifford") called Lobachevsky the "[Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus") of Geometry" due to the revolutionary character of his work.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-17)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-18)

Nikolai Lobachevsky was born either in or near the city of [Nizhny Novgorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizhny_Novgorod "Nizhny Novgorod") in the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") (now in [Nizhny Novgorod Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizhny_Novgorod_Oblast "Nizhny Novgorod Oblast"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia")) in 1792 to parents of Russian and [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people "Polish people") origin – Ivan Maksimovich Lobachevsky and Praskovia Alexandrovna Lobachevskaya.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Katz-19)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Hawking-20)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-22) He was one of three children. When he was seven, his father, a clerk in a [land-surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying "Surveying") office, died, and Nikolai moved with his mother to [Kazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan "Kazan"). Nikolai Lobachevsky attended [Kazan Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan_Gymnasium "Kazan Gymnasium") from 1802, graduating in 1807, and then received a scholarship to [Kazan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan_State_University "Kazan State University"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Katz-19)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Hawking-20) which had been founded just three years earlier in 1804.

At Kazan University, Lobachevsky was influenced by professor [Johann Christian Martin Bartels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christian_Martin_Bartels "Johann Christian Martin Bartels"), a former teacher and friend of the German mathematician [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") (1777–1855).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Katz-19) Lobachevsky received a [Master of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and mathematics in 1811. In 1814, he became a lecturer at Kazan University, and in 1816, he was promoted to associate professor. In 1822, at the age of 30, he became a full [professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor "Professor"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Katz-19)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Hawking-20) teaching mathematics, physics, and astronomy.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Hawking-20) He served in many administrative positions and became the [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(academia) "Rector (academia)") of Kazan University[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Katz-19) in 1827. In 1832, he married Varvara Alexeyevna Moiseyeva. They had a large number of children (eighteen according to his son's memoirs, though only seven apparently survived into adulthood). He was dismissed from the university in 1846, ostensibly due to his deteriorating health: by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. He died in poverty in 1856 and was buried in [Arskoe Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arskoe_Cemetery "Arskoe Cemetery"), Kazan.

In 1811, in his student days, Lobachevsky was accused by a vengeful supervisor of [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism") ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): признаки безбожия, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'signs of godlessness').[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-23)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-24)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-25)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-26)

Lobachevsky's main achievement is the development (independently from [János Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai")) of a [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-Hawking-20) also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry. Before him, mathematicians were trying to deduce [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s [fifth postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_postulate "Fifth postulate") from other [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"). Euclid's fifth is a rule in Euclidean geometry which states (in [John Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Playfair "John Playfair")'s reformulation) that for any given line and point not on the line, there is only one line through the point not intersecting the given line. Lobachevsky would instead develop a [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") in which the fifth postulate was not true. This idea was first reported on 23[[O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates "Old Style and New Style dates") 1826]February to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and this research was printed in the periodical 'Kazan University Course Notes' as _On the Origin of Geometry_ (_О началах геометрии_) between 1829 and 1830. In 1829, Lobachevsky wrote a paper about his ideas called "A Concise Outline of the Foundations of Geometry" that was published by the _Kazan Messenger_ but was rejected when it was submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for publication.

The non-Euclidean geometry that Lobachevsky developed is referred to as [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). Lobachevsky replaced [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom") with the statement that for any given point there exists _more than_ one line that can be extended through that point and run parallel to another line of which that point is not part. He developed the [angle of parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_parallelism "Angle of parallelism") which depends on the distance the point is off the given line. In hyperbolic geometry the sum of angles in a [hyperbolic triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_triangle "Hyperbolic triangle") must be less than 180 degrees. [Non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") stimulated the development of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") which has many applications. Hyperbolic geometry is frequently referred to as "Lobachevskian geometry" or "Bolyai–Lobachevskian geometry".

Some mathematicians and historians have wrongly claimed that Lobachevsky in his studies in non-Euclidean geometry was influenced by Gauss, which is untrue. Gauss himself appreciated Lobachevsky's published works highly, but they never had personal correspondence between them prior to the publication. Although three people—Gauss, Lobachevsky and Bolyai—can be credited with discovery of hyperbolic geometry, Gauss never published his ideas, and Lobachevsky was the first to present his views to the world mathematical community.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-27)

Lobachevsky's magnum opus _Geometriya_ was completed in 1823, but was not published in its exact original form until 1909, long after he had died. Lobachevsky was also the author of _New Foundations of Geometry_ (1835–1838). He also wrote _Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels_ (1840)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-28) and _Pangeometry_ (1855).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-29)[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-31)

Another of Lobachevsky's achievements was developing a method for the [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation") of the [roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of [algebraic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equation "Algebraic equation"). This method is now known as the [Dandelin–Gräffe method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelin%E2%80%93Gr%C3%A4ffe_method "Dandelin–Gräffe method"), named after two other mathematicians who discovered it independently. In Russia, it is called the Lobachevsky method. Lobachevsky gave the definition of a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") as a correspondence between two sets of real numbers ([Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet "Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet") gave the same definition independently soon after Lobachevsky).

[E. T. Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Temple_Bell "Eric Temple Bell") wrote about Lobachevsky's influence on the following development of mathematics in his 1937 book _[Men of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men\_of\_Mathematics "Men of Mathematics")_:[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-32)

> The boldness of his challenge and its successful outcome have inspired mathematicians and scientists in general to challenge other "axioms" or accepted "truths", for example the "law" of causality which, for centuries, have seemed as necessary to straight thinking as Euclid's postulate appeared until Lobachevsky discarded it. The full impact of the Lobachevskian method of challenging axioms has probably yet to be felt. It is no exaggeration to call Lobachevsky the Copernicus of Geometry, for geometry is only a part of the vaster domain which he renovated; it might even be just to designate him as a Copernicus of all thought.

Stamp of 1956 marking the centenary of Lobachevsky's death

Lobachevsky is the subject of songwriter/mathematician [Tom Lehrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer "Tom Lehrer")'s humorous song "[Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobachevsky_(song) "Lobachevsky (song)")" from his 1953 _[Songs by Tom Lehrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs\_by\_Tom\_Lehrer "Songs by Tom Lehrer")_ album. In the song, Lehrer portrays a Russian mathematician who sings about how Lobachevsky influenced him: "And who made me a big success / and brought me wealth and fame? / Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name." Lobachevsky's secret to mathematical success is given as "[Plagiarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism "Plagiarism")!", as long as one is always careful to "call it, please, [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research")". According to Lehrer, the song is "not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character" and the name was chosen "solely for [prosodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosodic "Prosodic") reasons".[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky#cite_note-33) The song was based on [Danny Kaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kaye "Danny Kaye") and [Sylvia Fine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Fine "Sylvia Fine")'s monologue on [Stanislavsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislavsky "Stanislavsky") and the secret of success in the acting profession.
