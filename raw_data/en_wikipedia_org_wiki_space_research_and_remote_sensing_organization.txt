SPARRSO works closely with JAXA , NASA and the ESA in environmental and meteorological research. Using Japanese and American satellites, SPARRSO monitors agro-climatic conditions and water resources in Bangladesh.

[ 1 ] In 2018, Their 1st satellite Bangladesh Satellite-1 was released, and Bangladesh Satellite-2 came soon after Activities [ edit ] Broad Category of SPARRSO Activities Category 1: Operational Activities towards National Interest Category 2: Research & Technological Development Activities Category 3: Activities to Support National Development Category 4: Nation Building Mile Stone Activities of SPARRSO Category 5: Human Resource Development on RS & GIS Technology Commandment [ edit ] SPARRSO has been applying space and remote sensing technology, in the field of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Geology, Cartography, Water Resources, Land use, Weather, Environment, Geography, Oceanography, Science, Education, science-based Knowledge and other related space research areas. It also performs research on these activities for developing this technology and its practical application.

Provides necessary information and disseminates research results to the Government and different relevant user agencies.

It provides the Government information about the development of space and remote sensing technology in other countries and gives advice for the formulation of national policy to the Government.

Conducts training, technical research, and surveys, and  cooperates with national or international organizations or institutes in the relevant matter.

SPARRSO creates development projects to perform research activities on space and remote sensing technology and implements them with approval from the Government.

SPARRSO takes measures regarding the above-mentioned work as it feels necessary.

Divisions [ edit ] At present, there are total 17 working divisions in SPARRSO(স্পারসো). They are: Atmospheric Division Agriculture Division Agro- hydrometeorology Division Forestry Division Water Resources Division Oceanography Division Fisheries Division Cartography Division Ground Station Division Photographic Division Ocean Physics Division Instrumentation and Data Processing Division Ground Truth Division Geology Division Rocket Technology Development Division Space Physics & Rocket Dynamics Division Regional Remote Sensing Center (RRSC) Ground stations [ edit ] Here is the list of total ground stations at SPARRSO: [ 2 ] Geostationary Satellite MTSAT-2 of Japan FY-2D & FY-2E of China WINDS of Japan.
