A **geocentric orbit**, **Earth-centered orbit**, or **Earth orbit** involves any object [orbiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit")[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), such as the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") or [artificial satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"). In 1997, NASA estimated there were approximately 2,465 artificial satellite payloads orbiting Earth and 6,216 pieces of [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") as tracked by the [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center "Goddard Space Flight Center").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-Goddard-1997-1) More than 16,291 objects previously launched have undergone [orbital decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay "Orbital decay") and [entered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry")[Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-Goddard-1997-1)

A spacecraft enters orbit when its [centripetal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force")[acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") due to [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") is less than or equal to the [centrifugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force") acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"), this velocity is about 7.8 km/s (28,100 km/h; 17,400 mph);[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-hill1999-2) by contrast, the fastest crewed airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was 2.2 km/s (7,900 km/h; 4,900 mph) in 1967 by the [North American X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-shiner20071101-3) The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") of 600 km (370 mi) is about 36[MJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule "Megajoule")/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-dimotakis1999-4)

Spacecraft with a [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") below about 2,000 km (1,200 mi) are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-5) which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about 300 km (190 mi), decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to 180 km (110 mi), it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-slsa-6) The [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11.2 km/s (40,300 km/h; 25,100 mph).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-williams2010-7)

Since velocity is defined as a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)"), both speed and direction are required to define it.
The following is a list of different geocentric orbit classifications.

### Altitude classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Altitude classifications")]

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Orbits_around_earth_scale_diagram.svg/250px-Orbits_around_earth_scale_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orbits_around_earth_scale_diagram.svg)

Low (cyan) and Medium (yellow) Earth orbit regions to scale. The black dashed line is the geosynchronous orbit. The green dashed line is the 20,230 km orbit used for [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") satellites.

[Transatmospheric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatmospheric_orbit "Transatmospheric orbit") (TAO)Geocentric orbits with altitudes at [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee") higher than 100 km (62 mi) and [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") that intersects with the [defined atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-8)[Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (LEO)Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 160 km (100 mi) to 2,000 km (1,200 mi) above [mean sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sea_level "Mean sea level"). At 160 km, one revolution takes approximately 90 minutes, and the circular orbital speed is 8 km/s (26,000 ft/s).[Medium Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit "Medium Earth orbit") (MEO)Geocentric orbits with altitudes at apogee ranging between 2,000 km (1,200 mi) and that of the [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") at 35,786 km (22,236 mi).[Geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") (GSO)Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi). The period of the orbit equals one [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day"), coinciding with the rotation period of the Earth. The speed is approximately 3 km/s (9,800 ft/s).[High Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit "High Earth orbit") (HEO)Geocentric orbits with altitudes at apogee higher than that of the geosynchronous orbit. A special case of high Earth orbit is the [highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit"), where altitude at perigee is less than 2,000 km (1,200 mi).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-nasa-9)

### Inclination classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Inclination classifications")]

[Inclined orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_orbit "Inclined orbit")An orbit whose [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination "Inclination") in reference to the [equatorial plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_plane "Equatorial plane") is not 0. [Polar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit "Polar orbit")A satellite that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore it has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)").[Polar Sun synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit "Sun-synchronous orbit")A nearly [polar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit "Polar orbit") that passes the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") at the same local time on every [pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_(spaceflight) "Pass (spaceflight)"). Useful for image-taking satellites because shadows will be the same on every pass.

### Eccentricity classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Eccentricity classifications")]

[Circular orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit")An orbit that has an [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") of 0 and whose path traces a circle.[Elliptic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit")An orbit with an [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"). [Hohmann transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit "Hohmann transfer orbit")An orbital maneuver that moves a spacecraft from one [circular orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit") to another using two engine [impulses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics) "Impulse (physics)"). This maneuver was named after [Walter Hohmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hohmann "Walter Hohmann").[Geosynchronous transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_transfer_orbit "Geosynchronous transfer orbit") (GTO)A geocentric-[elliptic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit") where the [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perigee "Perigee") is at the altitude of a [low Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit "Low Earth Orbit") (LEO) and the [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee") at the altitude of a [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit").[Highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit") (HEO)Geocentric orbit with apogee above 35,786 km and low perigee (about 1,000 km) that result in long dwell times near apogee. [Molniya orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit "Molniya orbit")A [highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit") with [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination "Inclination") of 63.4° and [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of ½ of a [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day") (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the Earth.[Tundra orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit "Tundra orbit")A [highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit") with [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination "Inclination") of 63.4° and [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of one [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day") (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the Earth.[Hyperbolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory "Hyperbolic trajectory")An "orbit" with eccentricity greater than 1. The object's [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") reaches some value in excess of the [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity"), therefore it will escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and continue to travel [infinitely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitely "Infinitely") with a velocity (relative to Earth) decelerating to some finite value, known as the [hyperbolic excess velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_excess_velocity "Hyperbolic excess velocity"). Escape Trajectory This trajectory must be used to launch an interplanetary probe away from Earth, because the excess over escape velocity is what changes its [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit") from that of Earth.Capture Trajectory This is the mirror image of the escape trajectory; an object traveling with sufficient speed, not aimed directly at Earth, will move toward it and accelerate. In the absence of a decelerating engine impulse to put it into orbit, it will follow the escape trajectory after periapsis.[Parabolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory "Parabolic trajectory")An "orbit" with eccentricity exactly equal to 1. The object's [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") equals the [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity"), therefore it will escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and continue to travel with a velocity (relative to Earth) decelerating to 0. A spacecraft launched from Earth with this velocity would travel some distance away from it, but follow it around the Sun in the same [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit"). It is possible, but not likely that an object approaching Earth could follow a parabolic capture trajectory, but speed and direction would have to be precise.

### Directional classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Directional classifications")]

[Prograde orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prograde_orbit "Prograde orbit")an orbit in which the projection of the object onto the equatorial plane revolves about the Earth in the same direction as the rotation of the Earth.[Retrograde orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_orbit "Retrograde orbit")an orbit in which the projection of the object onto the equatorial plane revolves about the Earth in the direction opposite that of the rotation of the Earth.

### Geosynchronous classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Geosynchronous classifications")]

[Semi-synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-synchronous_orbit "Semi-synchronous orbit") (SSO)An orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200 km (12,600 mi) and an [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of approximately 12 hours[Geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") (GEO)Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 mi). Such a satellite would trace an [analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma "Analemma") (figure 8) in the sky.

To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.[Clarke orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_orbit "Clarke orbit")Another name for a geostationary orbit. Named after the writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke"). Earth orbital [libration points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration_points "Libration points")The [libration points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration_points "Libration points") for objects orbiting Earth are at 105 degrees west and 75 degrees east. More than 160 satellites are gathered at these two points.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit#cite_note-10)[Supersynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersynchronous_orbit "Supersynchronous orbit")A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west.[Subsynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsynchronous_orbit "Subsynchronous orbit")A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.[Graveyard orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit"), disposal orbit, junk orbit An orbit a few hundred kilometers above [geosynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous "Geosynchronous") that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.

### Special classifications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geocentric_orbit&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Special classifications")]

[Sun-synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit "Sun-synchronous orbit")An orbit which combines altitude and [inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination "Inclination") in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet")'s surface at the same local [solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time "Solar time"). Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, [spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_satellite "Spy satellite"), and [weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite").[Moon orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_orbit "Moon orbit")The [orbital characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_parameters "Orbital parameters") of Earth's Moon.

[Horseshoe orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit "Horseshoe orbit")An orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a planet but is actually in [co-orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-orbital_satellite "Co-orbital satellite") with it. See asteroids [3753](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3753_Cruithne "3753 Cruithne") (Cruithne) and [2002 AA 29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_AA29 "2002 AA29").[Sub-orbital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight")A launch where a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") approaches the height of orbit but lacks the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") to sustain it.
