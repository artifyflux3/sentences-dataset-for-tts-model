It is said that Landau composed much of the series in his head while in an NKVD prison in 1938–1939.

[ 1 ] However, almost all of the actual writing of the early volumes was done by Lifshitz, giving rise to the witticism, "not a word of Landau and not a thought of Lifshitz".

[ 2 ] The first eight volumes were finished in the 1950s, written in Russian and translated into English in the late 1950s by John Stewart Bell , together with John Bradbury Sykes, M. J. Kearsley, and W. H. Reid. The last two volumes were written in the early 1980s.

Vladimir Berestetskii [ ru ] and Lev Pitaevskii also contributed to the series. The series is often referred to as " Landau and Lifshitz ", " Landafshitz " (Russian: "Ландафшиц"), [ 3 ] [ 4 ] or " Lanlifshitz " (Russian: "Ланлифшиц") in informal settings.

Impact [ edit ] The presentation of material is advanced and typically considered suitable for graduate-level study.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Despite this specialized character, it is estimated that a million volumes of the Course were sold by 2005.

[ 7 ] The series has been called "renowned" in Science and "celebrated" in American Scientist .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] A note in Mathematical Reviews states, "The usefulness and the success of this course have been proved by the great number of successive editions in Russian, English, French , German and other languages." [ 9 ] At a centenary celebration of Landau's career, it was observed that the Course had shown "unprecedented longevity." [ 10 ] In 1962, Landau and Lifshitz were awarded the Lenin Prize for their work on the Course . This was the first occasion on which the Lenin Prize had been awarded for the teaching of physics.

Butterworth-Heinemann .

ISBN 978-0-7506-3371-0 .

The original edition comprised two books, labelled part 1 and part 2. The first covered general aspects of relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory , leading onto quantum electrodynamics . The second continued with quantum electrodynamics and what was then known about the strong and weak interactions . These books were published in the early 1970s, at a time when the strong and weak forces were still not well understood. In the second edition, the corresponding sections were scrapped and replaced with more topics in the well-established quantum electrodynamics, and the two parts were unified into one, thus providing a one-volume exposition on relativistic quantum field theory with the electromagnetic interaction as the prototype of a quantum field theory.
