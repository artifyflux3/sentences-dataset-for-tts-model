They can be as small as a tennis ball, but they can also be bigger than a car.

[ 1 ] Most snow rollers are a few inches or centimeters wide.

[ 2 ] Alternative names for snow rollers include: snow bales , [ 3 ] snow donuts , snownuts and wind snowballs .

[ 2 ] Unlike snowballs made by people, snow rollers are typically cylindrical in shape, and are often hollow since the inner layers, [ 2 ] which are the first layers to form, are weak and thin compared to the outer layers. The inner sections can easily be blown away, leaving what looks like a doughnut or Swiss roll .

Several conditions are needed for snow rollers to form: There must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet, loose snow, with a temperature near the melting point of ice.

[ 2 ] Under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick, such as ice or powder snow.

[ 2 ] The wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers, [ 2 ] but not strong enough to blow them apart.

Alternatively, gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball, such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff, lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill.

[ 4 ] Because of this last condition, snow rollers are more common in hilly areas.

[ 1 ] However, the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon.
