Its foundation in Monaco during January 1959 makes it one of the world's oldest underwater diving organisations.

[ 1 ] Origins [ edit ] An international congress of diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in Brussels on 28 September 1958. National delegates attended from following countries: Belgium, Brazil, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States of America and the former Yugoslavia . Following a decision at that congress, a meeting was held in Monaco on 9–11 January 1959, which officially established the World Underwater Federation, with an acronym based on its French title as CMAS .

[ 2 ] A founding member and key proponent of CMAS was the French underwater explorer and diving pioneer Jacques-Yves Cousteau who was chosen to be the inaugural president with Luigi Ferraro , Italian underwater pioneer, appointed as vice-president.

[ 3 ] CMAS succeeded the Comité des Sports Sous-Marins (Underwater Sports Committee) of the Confédération Internationale de la Pêche Sportive (CIPS) (International Confederation of Sport Fishing), which was founded on 22 February 1952.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Organisation [ edit ] CMAS consists of three major committees – sport, technical and scientific.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] These committees are overseen by a board of directors (BoD) elected periodically at the annually convened general assembly. The BoD, the sport committee and the scientific committee oversee sub-committees known as commissions. Day-to-day operation is overseen by a steering committee appointed from the BoD. Its headquarters is currently located in Rome .

The steering committee [ edit ] The steering committee consists of eight members. As of 2020, the members were: [ 7 ] President – Anna Arzhanova (Russia) Secretary general – Kevin O'Shaughnessy (Ireland) Vice president – Alain Germain (France) Vice president – William Peña (Colombia) President sports committee – Michel Gaunard  (France) President technical committee – Flemming Holmn  (Denmark) President scientific committee – Francisco Lacase (Argentina) Treasurer – Ilias Xiarchos (Greece) Sport committee [ edit ] CMAS Sports Committee is the world governing body of 11 underwater sports : [ 8 ] Aquathlon Freediving Finswimming Spearfishing Sport diving Underwater hockey Underwater orienteering Underwater parasports Underwater rugby Underwater target shooting Visual ( Underwater photography and Underwater videography ) Across these sports, CMAS organises the several world championships: Year in brackets () denotes inaugural event' Underwater Orienteering World Championships (1973) Finswimming World Championships (1976) Underwater Hockey World Championships (1980) Underwater Rugby World Championships (1980) Underwater Photography World Championships (1985) In 2007, CMAS organised the inaugural CMAS World Games in attempt to boost popularity of underwater sports by hosting all world championships as one event. However, this ultimately failed as it brought too many sports outside of their pre-established calendars, resulting in the 2007 event being the only one ever organised and played.

Technical committee [ edit ] Role [ edit ] The role of the technical committee is the provision of "safe diving for CMAS members" and seeks to achieve this by "promoting world class standards for all aspects of Scuba Diving and ensuring adherence of them by member federations and dive providers".

[ 9 ] Its officers who are elected from persons nominated at the CMAS General Assembly by affiliated national diving federations include the following positions – president, secretary, standards director, education director, technical director, diving security director, special tasks director and a number of general members.  It oversees the two following systems – a diver training standards system known as the "CMAS International Diver Training Standards" and a certification system known as "CMAS International Diver Certificates".

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Since CMAS effectively started as a volunteer organisation for hobbyists, its courses tend to reflect the full range of European and world diving standards. Compared to other diving organisations which may be more geared towards holiday and tropical water diving, and while organisations like PADI or SSI tend to bring divers into the water immediately, CMAS entry-level training is more extensive, featuring more "classroom" delivered theory.

[ 11 ] Qualifications [ edit ] Standards, certification and training delivery [ edit ] The CMAS training system.

The CMAS Technical Committee has developed a qualification system currently known as the "CMAS International Diver Training Standards" which consists of published universal standards for recreational diving , technical diving and leadership diver grades .

[ 12 ] The CMAS Technical Committee has also developed a diving certification system called the "CMAS International Diver Training Certification System" for most of its diver training standards and which permits divers that have been trained in accordance with the CMAS International Diver Training Standards, to have their training recognised worldwide particularly in countries where CMAS affiliated federations exist. The system includes a double sided certification card format where one side depicts the achieved CMAS standard while the other side has details of the issuing organisation and the diver.

[ 10 ] [ 13 ] CMAS itself does not provide training or conduct the issuing of certifications – this is available from two sources.  Firstly, from national diving federations affiliated to the CMAS Technical Committee using their member diving clubs, their member instructors where the federation is exclusively an instructor organisation or by agreement with independent underwater diving training organizations operating in the countries where those federations are based.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Secondly, from specially accredited dive centres known as "CMAS Dive Centers" (CDC) who use dedicated CMAS training materials.

[ 17 ] Recreational diver training programmes [ edit ] CMAS four-star diver certification card issued by South African Underwater Union, the South African affiliate in the 1980s, which later became the South African Underwater Sports Federation and CMAS Instructors South Africa, the current South African federations.

Standards are offered for recreational diver training for the following grades of scuba and snorkel divers.

[ citation needed ] Qualifications [ edit ] The CMAS Scientific Committee oversees a system of diving standards and certification that operates in parallel to the CMAS International Diver Training Certification System.
The system was developed to which recognize the status of a diver who is qualified to dive in the course of research whilst employed.  This internationally recognized standard of competence is a distinct advantage for working scientists who wish to travel between laboratories and institutes in different countries.
Known as the CMAS Scientific Diver Standard, the system consists of the following diver and instructor grades: CMAS Scientific Diver (CSD) (pre-requisite of CMAS 2 Star Diver plus scientific diver training) CMAS Advanced Scientific Diver (CASD) (pre-requisite of CMAS 3 Star Diver plus advanced scientific diver training) CMAS Scientific Diving Instructor (pre-requisite: CMAS 2 Star Instructor) CMAS Confirmed Scientific Diving Instructor (pre-requisite: CMAS 3 Star Instructor) A programme of specialist courses both at entry and advanced levels in underwater archaeology , freshwater biology , marine biology , marine geology and oceanology is also offered.
Training and certification (also known as brevets) for the above qualifications is available from organisations known as CMAS Scientific Centres (CSC).
