A **parameter** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[παρά](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC#Ancient_Greek "wikt:παρά")_(\_pará\_)_'beside, subsidiary' and [μέτρον](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:μέτρον")_(\_métron\_)_'measure'), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.

_Parameter_ has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and electronic musical composition.

In addition to its technical uses, there are also extended uses, especially in non-scientific contexts, where it is used to mean defining characteristics or boundaries, as in the phrases 'test parameters' or 'game play parameters'.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

When a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_theory "System theory") is modeled by equations, the values that describe the system are called _parameters_. For example, in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), the masses, the dimensions and shapes (for solid bodies), the densities and the viscosities (for fluids), appear as parameters in the equations modeling movements. There are often several choices for the parameters, and choosing a convenient set of parameters is called _parametrization_.

For example, if one were considering the movement of an object on the surface of a sphere much larger than the object (e.g. the Earth), there are two commonly used parametrizations of its position: angular coordinates (like latitude/longitude), which neatly describe large movements along circles on the sphere, and directional distance from a known point (e.g. "10km NNW of Toronto" or equivalently "8km due North, and then 6km due West, from Toronto" ), which are often simpler for movement confined to a (relatively) small area, like within a particular country or region. Such parametrizations are also relevant to the modelization of geographic areas (i.e. [map drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection")).

Mathematical functions
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Mathematical functions")]

[Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function "Mathematical function") have one or more [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function") that are designated in the definition by [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"). A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function "Quadratic function") by declaring

![Image 1: {\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66fca4dfe28e7b4a4a336578daaab18c87397073);
Here, the variable _x_ designates the function's argument, but _a_, _b_, and _c_ are parameters (in this instance, also called _[coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient")_) that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-_b_ logarithm by the formula

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \log _{b}(x)={\frac {\log(x)}{\log(b)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3d7d1164f4d4438fa5ce485036e2fae851b87cc)
where _b_ is a parameter that indicates which logarithmic function is being used. It is not an argument of the function, and will, for instance, be a constant when considering the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(mathematics) "Derivative (mathematics)")![Image 3: {\displaystyle \textstyle \log _{b}'(x)=(x\ln(b))^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f804dda37fa98bfbc56fe5eacd08c04554306b2).

In some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. However, changing the status of symbols between parameter and variable changes the function as a mathematical object. For instance, the notation for the [falling factorial power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_factorial_power "Falling factorial power")

![Image 4: {\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8edddc122177240d34baebd656f49c30b6f80832),
defines a [polynomial function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#Polynomial_functions "Polynomial") of _n_ (when _k_ is considered a parameter), but is not a polynomial function of _k_ (when _n_ is considered a parameter). Indeed, in the latter case, it is only defined for non-negative integer arguments. More formal presentations of such situations typically start out with a function of several variables (including all those that might sometimes be called "parameters") such as

![Image 5: {\displaystyle (n,k)\mapsto n^{\underline {k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9747b56d919f6d00c0c7e9daea24878476b4f8a)
as the most fundamental object being considered, then defining functions with fewer variables from the main one by means of [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying "Currying").

Sometimes it is useful to consider all functions with certain parameters as _parametric family_, i.e. as an [indexed family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_family "Indexed family") of functions. Examples from probability theory [are given further below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#Probability_theory).

*   In a section on frequently misused words in his book _The Writer's Art_, [James J. Kilpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Kilpatrick "James J. Kilpatrick") quoted a letter from a correspondent, giving examples to illustrate the correct use of the word _parameter_:

> W.M. Woods ... a mathematician ... writes ... "... a variable is one of the many things a _parameter_ is not." ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.

> [Kilpatrick quoting Woods] "Now ... the engineers ... change the lever arms of the linkage ... the speed of the car ... will still depend on the pedal position ..._but in a ... different manner_. You have changed a parameter"

*   A [parametric equaliser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equaliser "Parametric equaliser") is an [audio filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_filter "Audio filter") that allows the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, and the size of the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency response curve, and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve. More elaborate parametric equalisers may allow other parameters to be varied, such as skew. These parameters each describe some aspect of the response curve seen as a whole, over all frequencies. A [graphic equaliser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_equaliser "Graphic equaliser") provides individual level controls for various frequency bands, each of which acts only on that particular frequency band.
*   If asked to imagine the graph of the relationship _y_=_ax_ 2, one typically visualizes a range of values of _x_, but only one value of _a_. Of course a different value of _a_ can be used, generating a different relation between _x_ and _y_. Thus _a_ is a parameter: it is less variable than the variable _x_ or _y_, but it is not an explicit constant like the exponent 2. More precisely, changing the parameter _a_ gives a different (though related) problem, whereas the variations of the variables _x_ and _y_ (and their interrelation) are part of the problem itself.
*   In calculating income based on wage and hours worked (income equals wage multiplied by hours worked), it is typically assumed that the number of hours worked is easily changed, but the wage is more static. This makes _wage_ a parameter, _hours worked_ an [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable"), and _income_ a [dependent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_variable "Dependent variable").

### Mathematical models

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mathematical models")]

In the context of a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model"), such as a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"), the distinction between variables and parameters was described by Bard as follows:

We refer to the relations which supposedly describe a certain physical situation, as a _model_. Typically, a model consists of one or more equations. The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into _variables_ and _parameters_. The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on the context in which the variables appear. Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the variables of the model. To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces "constants" which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the parameters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-1)
In [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") can be described as the image of a function whose argument, typically called the _parameter_, lies in a [real interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)").

For example, the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") can be specified in the following two ways:

*   _implicit_ form, the curve is the locus of points (_x_, _y_) in the [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") that satisfy the relation ![Image 6: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd4ba9a57bd82841e5889575e2ff3e1ef5fad8e9)
*   _parametric_ form, the curve is the image of the function ![Image 7: {\displaystyle t\mapsto (\cos t,\sin t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa92a7e0db1cc38274018d283d4a2e8f0d9b381a)
with parameter ![Image 8: {\displaystyle t\in [0,2\pi ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4e52f713bba43d916a2647b3a2b564580788537) As a [parametric equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") this can be written

![Image 9: {\displaystyle (x,y)=(\cos t,\sin t).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3b999530b7d8039bf3cc945ccb50fc9abd5559a)
The parameter t in this equation would elsewhere in mathematics be called the _[independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent\_variable "Independent variable")_.

### Mathematical analysis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Mathematical analysis")]

In [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), integrals dependent on a parameter are often considered. These are of the form

![Image 10: {\displaystyle F(t)=\int _{x_{0}(t)}^{x_{1}(t)}f(x;t)\,dx.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7bd5da1388eaf7fdc69de547f1971a7560e2434e)
In this formula, _t_ is the argument of the function _F_, and on the right-hand side the _parameter_ on which the integral depends. When evaluating the integral, _t_ is held constant, and so it is considered to be a parameter. If we are interested in the value of _F_ for different values of _t_, we then consider _t_ to be a variable. The quantity _x_ is a _[dummy variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound\_variable "Bound variable")_ or _variable of integration_ (confusingly, also sometimes called a _parameter of integration_).

### Statistics and econometrics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Statistics and econometrics")]

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics"), the probability framework above still holds, but attention shifts to [estimating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_estimation "Statistical estimation") the parameters of a distribution based on observed data, or [testing hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis_testing "Hypothesis testing") about them. In [frequentist estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference "Frequentist inference") parameters are considered "fixed but unknown", whereas in [Bayesian estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability "Bayesian probability") they are treated as random variables, and their uncertainty is described as a distribution.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-2)

In [estimation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory "Estimation theory") of statistics, "statistic" or [estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator "Estimator") refers to samples, whereas "parameter" or [estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand "Estimand") refers to populations, where the samples are taken from. A [statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic "Statistic") is a numerical characteristic of a sample that can be used as an estimate of the corresponding parameter, the numerical characteristic of the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population") from which the sample was drawn.

For example, the [sample mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean "Sample mean") (estimator), denoted ![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\overline {X}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08fd87d3502c4f9e1b02ac74644474258aeea176), can be used as an estimate of the _mean_ parameter (estimand), denoted _μ_, of the population from which the sample was drawn. Similarly, the [sample variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_variance "Sample variance") (estimator), denoted _S_ 2, can be used to estimate the _variance_ parameter (estimand), denoted _σ_ 2, of the population from which the sample was drawn. (Note that the sample standard deviation (_S_) is not an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (_σ_): see [Unbiased estimation of standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbiased_estimation_of_standard_deviation "Unbiased estimation of standard deviation").)

It is possible to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"). In that case, one speaks of _[non-parametric statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric\_statistics "Non-parametric statistics")_ as opposed to the [parametric statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics "Parametric statistics") just described. For example, a test based on [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient") would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the [Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient "Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient") are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the [population correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence "Correlation and dependence").

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Poisson_pmf.svg/250px-Poisson_pmf.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poisson_pmf.svg)

These traces all represent Poisson distributions, but with different values for the parameter λ

In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), one may describe the [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") as belonging to a _family_ of [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"), distinguished from each other by the values of a finite number of _parameters_. For example, one talks about "a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution "Poisson distribution") with mean value λ". The function defining the distribution (the [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function "Probability mass function")) is:

![Image 13: {\displaystyle f(k;\lambda )={\frac {e^{-\lambda }\lambda ^{k}}{k!}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54ab28b4e2fa2d19b1fdbb849c47fe32e5047cab)
This example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. _e_ is [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_number "Euler's number"), a fundamental [mathematical constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant "Mathematical constant"). The parameter λ is the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean") number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system. _k_ is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample. If we want to know the probability of observing _k_ 1 occurrences, we plug it into the function to get ![Image 14: {\displaystyle f(k_{1};\lambda )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b057adcffb75a0be9e9b2a9873ce4c5cd960d75). Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of _k_, but the system is always characterized by the same λ.

For instance, suppose we have a [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity") sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. The measurements exhibit different values of _k_, and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of _k_ will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. From measurement to measurement, however, λ remains constant at 5. If we do not alter the system, then the parameter λ is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter λ would increase.

Another common distribution is the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution"), which has as parameters the mean μ and the variance σ².

In these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance. In such a case, we have a parameterized distribution.

It is possible to use the sequence of [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics) "Moment (mathematics)") (mean, mean square, ...) or [cumulants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulant "Cumulant") (mean, variance, ...) as parameters for a probability distribution: see [Statistical parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter "Statistical parameter").

Computer programming
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Computer programming")]

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), two notions of [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming) "Parameter (computer programming)") are commonly used, and are referred to as [parameters and arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments "Parameter (computer programming)")—or more formally as a **formal parameter** and an **actual parameter**.

For example, in the definition of a function such as

y = _f_(_x_) = _x_ + 2,
_x_ is the _formal parameter_ (the _parameter_) of the defined function.

When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

_f_(3): or, _y_ = _f_(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,
3 is the _actual parameter_ (the _argument_) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the _formal parameter_ of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms _parameter_ and _argument_ might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") and its foundational disciplines, [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus "Lambda calculus") and [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic "Combinatory logic"). Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") define parameter and argument as given here, while [Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language) "Eiffel (programming language)") uses an [alternative convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Alternative_convention_in_Eiffel "Parameter (computer programming)").

Artificial intelligence
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Artificial intelligence")]

In [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") describes the probability that something will occur. Parameters in a model are the weight of the various probabilities. Tiernan Ray, in an article on GPT-3, described parameters this way:

> A parameter is a calculation in a neural network that applies a great or lesser weighting to some aspect of the data, to give that aspect greater or lesser prominence in the overall calculation of the data. It is these weights that give shape to the data, and give the neural network a learned perspective on the data.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-3)

In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") (especially involving data acquisition) the term _parameter_ sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term _channel_ refers to an individual measured item, with _parameter_ referring to the setup information about that channel.

"Speaking generally, **properties** are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; **parameters** are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-4)

The term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences.

Environmental science
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Environmental science")]

In [environmental science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science "Environmental science") and particularly in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [microbiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology "Microbiology"), a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or microbiological entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but may also be a logical entity (present or absent), a [statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") result such as a [95 percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile "Percentile") value or in some cases a subjective value.

Within linguistics, the word "parameter" is almost exclusively used to denote a binary switch in a [Universal Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Grammar "Universal Grammar") within a [Principles and Parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_and_Parameters "Principles and Parameters") framework.

In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an _open predicate_ are called _parameters_ by some authors (e.g., [Prawitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Prawitz "Dag Prawitz")'s _Natural Deduction_;[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-5)[Paulson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Paulson "Lawrence Paulson")'s _Designing a theorem prover_). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called _variables_. This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate _variables_, and when defining substitution have to distinguish between _[free variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_variable "Free variable")_ and _[bound variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound\_variable "Bound variable")_.

In music theory, a parameter denotes an element which may be manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)"), [loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness "Loudness"), [duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duration_(music) "Duration (music)"), and [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre "Timbre"), though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in [serial music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_music "Serial music"), where each parameter may follow some specified series. [Paul Lansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lansky "Paul Lansky") and [George Perle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Perle "George Perle") criticized the extension of the word "parameter" to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#cite_note-6) but it remains common. The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).
