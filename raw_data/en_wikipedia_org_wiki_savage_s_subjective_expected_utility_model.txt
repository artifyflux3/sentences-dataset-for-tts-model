Savage in his 1954 book The Foundations of Statistics , [ 1 ] based on previous work by Ramsey , [ 2 ] von Neumann [ 3 ] and de Finetti .

[ 4 ] Savage's model concerns with deriving a subjective probability distribution and a utility function such that an agent's choice under uncertainty can be represented via expected-utility maximization . His contributions to the theory of SEU consist of formalizing a framework under which such problem is well-posed, and deriving conditions for its positive solution.

Primitives and problem [ edit ] Savage's framework posits the following primitives to represent an agent's choice under uncertainty: [ 1 ] A set of states of the world Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , of which only one ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } is true. The agent does not know the true ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } , so Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } represents something about which the agent is uncertain.

A set of consequence s X {\displaystyle X} : consequences are the objects from which the agent derives utility.

A set of acts F {\displaystyle F} : acts are functions f : Ω Ω → → X {\displaystyle f:\Omega \rightarrow X} which map unknown states of the world ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } to tangible consequences x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} .

A preference relation ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } over acts in F {\displaystyle F} : we write f ≿ ≿ g {\displaystyle f\succsim g} to represent the scenario where, when only able to choose between f , g ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g\in F} , the agent (weakly) prefers to choose act f {\displaystyle f} . The strict preference f ≻ ≻ g {\displaystyle f\succ g} means that f ≿ ≿ g {\displaystyle f\succsim g} but it does not hold that g ≿ ≿ f {\displaystyle g\succsim f} .

The model thus deals with conditions over the primitives ( Ω Ω , X , F , ≿ ≿ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,X,F,\succsim )} —in particular, over preferences ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } —such that one can represent the agent's preferences via expected-utility with respect to some subjective probability over the states Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } : i.e., there exists a subjective probability distribution p ∈ ∈ Δ Δ ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle p\in \Delta (\Omega )} and a utility function u : X → → R {\displaystyle u:X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } such that f ≿ ≿ g ⟺ ⟺ E ω ω ∼ ∼ p ⁡ ⁡ [ u ( f ( ω ω ) ) ] ≥ ≥ E ω ω ∼ ∼ p ⁡ ⁡ [ u ( g ( ω ω ) ) ] , {\displaystyle f\succsim g\iff \mathop {\mathbb {E} } _{\omega \sim p}[u(f(\omega ))]\geq \mathop {\mathbb {E} } _{\omega \sim p}[u(g(\omega ))],} where E ω ω ∼ ∼ p ⁡ ⁡ [ u ( f ( ω ω ) ) ] := ∫ ∫ Ω Ω u ( f ( ω ω ) ) d p ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle \mathop {\mathbb {E} } _{\omega \sim p}[u(f(\omega ))]:=\int _{\Omega }u(f(\omega )){\text{d}}p(\omega )} .

The idea of the problem is to find conditions under which the agent can be thought of choosing among acts f ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f\in F} as if he considered only 1) his subjective probability of each state ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } and 2) the utility he derives from consequence f ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle f(\omega )} given at each state.

Axioms [ edit ] Savage posits the following axioms regarding ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } : [ 1 ] [ 5 ] P1 (Preference relation) : the relation ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } is complete (for all f , g ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g\in F} , it's true that f ≿ ≿ g {\displaystyle f\succsim g} or g ≿ ≿ f {\displaystyle g\succsim f} ) and transitive .

P2 ( Sure-thing Principle ) [ nb 1 ] : for any acts f , g ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g\in F} , let f E g {\displaystyle f_{E}g} be the act that gives consequence f ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle f(\omega )} if ω ω ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle \omega \in E} and g ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle g(\omega )} if ω ω ∉ ∉ E {\displaystyle \omega \notin E} . Then for any event E ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω {\displaystyle E\subset \Omega } and any acts f , g , h , h ′ ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g,h,h'\in F} , the following holds: f E h ≿ ≿ g E h ⟹ ⟹ f E h ′ ≿ ≿ g E h ′ .

{\displaystyle f_{E}h\succsim g_{E}h\implies f_{E}h'\succsim g_{E}h'.} In words: if you prefer act f {\displaystyle f} to act g {\displaystyle g} whether the event E {\displaystyle E} happens or not, then it does not matter the consequence when E {\displaystyle E} does not happen.

An event E ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω {\displaystyle E\subset \Omega } is nonnull if the agent has preferences over consequences when E {\displaystyle E} happens: i.e., there exist f , g , h ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g,h\in F} such that f E h ≻ ≻ g E h {\displaystyle f_{E}h\succ g_{E}h} .

P3 (Monotonicity in consequences) : let f ≡ ≡ x {\displaystyle f\equiv x} and g ≡ ≡ y {\displaystyle g\equiv y} be constant acts. Then f ≿ ≿ g {\displaystyle f\succsim g} if and only if f E h ≿ ≿ g E h {\displaystyle f_{E}h\succsim g_{E}h} for all nonnull events E {\displaystyle E} .

P4 (Independence of beliefs from tastes) : for all events E , E ′ ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω {\displaystyle E,E'\subset \Omega } and constant acts f ≡ ≡ x {\displaystyle f\equiv x} , g ≡ ≡ y {\displaystyle g\equiv y} , f ′ ≡ ≡ x ′ {\displaystyle f'\equiv x'} , g ′ ≡ ≡ y ′ {\displaystyle g'\equiv y'} such that f ≻ ≻ g {\displaystyle f\succ g} and f ′ ≻ ≻ g ′ {\displaystyle f'\succ g'} , it holds that f E g ≿ ≿ f E ′ g ⟺ ⟺ f E ′ g ′ ≿ ≿ f E ′ ′ g ′ {\displaystyle f_{E}g\succsim f_{E'}g\iff f'_{E}g'\succsim f'_{E'}g'} .

P5 (Non- triviality ) : there exist acts f , f ′ ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,f'\in F} such that f ≻ ≻ f ′ {\displaystyle f\succ f'} .

P6 (Continuity in events) : For all acts f , g , h ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g,h\in F} such that f ≻ ≻ g {\displaystyle f\succ g} , there is a finite partition ( E i ) i = 1 n {\displaystyle (E_{i})_{i=1}^{n}} of Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } such that f ≻ ≻ g E i h {\displaystyle f\succ g_{E_{i}}h} and h E i f ≻ ≻ g {\displaystyle h_{E_{i}}f\succ g} for all i ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle i\leq n} .

The final axiom is more technical, and of importance only when X {\displaystyle X} is infinite. For any E ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω {\displaystyle E\subset \Omega } , let ≿ ≿ E {\displaystyle \succsim _{E}} be the restriction of ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } to E {\displaystyle E} . For any act f ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f\in F} and state ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } , let f ω ω ≡ ≡ f ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle f_{\omega }\equiv f(\omega )} be the constant act with value f ( ω ω ) {\displaystyle f(\omega )} .

P7 : For all acts f , g , ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g,\in F} and events E ⊂ ⊂ Ω Ω {\displaystyle E\subset \Omega } , we have f ≿ ≿ E g ω ω ∀ ∀ ω ω ∈ ∈ E ⟹ ⟹ f ≿ ≿ E g {\displaystyle f\succsim _{E}g_{\omega }{\text{ }}\forall \omega \in E\implies f\succsim _{E}g} , f ω ω ≿ ≿ E g ∀ ∀ ω ω ∈ ∈ E ⟹ ⟹ f ≿ ≿ E g {\displaystyle f_{\omega }\succsim _{E}g{\text{ }}\forall \omega \in E\implies f\succsim _{E}g} .

Savage's representation theorem [ edit ] Theorem: Given an environment ( Ω Ω , X , F , ≿ ≿ ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,X,F,\succsim )} as defined above with X {\displaystyle X} finite, the following are equivalent: 1) ≿ ≿ {\displaystyle \succsim } satisfies axioms P1-P6 .

2) there exists a non-atomic, finitely additive probability measure p ∈ ∈ Δ Δ ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle p\in \Delta (\Omega )} defined on 2 Ω Ω {\displaystyle 2^{\Omega }} and a nonconstant function u : X → → R {\displaystyle u:X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } such that, for all f , g ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f,g\in F} , f ≿ ≿ g ⟺ ⟺ E ω ω ∼ ∼ p ⁡ ⁡ [ u ( f ( ω ω ) ) ] ≥ ≥ E ω ω ∼ ∼ p ⁡ ⁡ [ u ( g ( ω ω ) ) ] .

{\displaystyle f\succsim g\iff \mathop {\mathbb {E} } _{\omega \sim p}[u(f(\omega ))]\geq \mathop {\mathbb {E} } _{\omega \sim p}[u(g(\omega ))].} For infinite X {\displaystyle X} , one needs axiom P7. Furthermore, in both cases, the probability measure p {\displaystyle p} is unique and the function u {\displaystyle u} is unique up to positive linear transformations .
