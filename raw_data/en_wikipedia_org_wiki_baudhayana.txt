**Baudhayana** ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"): बौधायन, [Romanised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization "Romanization"): Baudhāyana) was an ancient [Indian mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics "Indian mathematics") and [Vedic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas") sage, believed to have lived around the 8th-7th century BCE. He is renowned for his contributions to early Indian mathematics and geometry, primarily through his authorship of the [Baudhayana Sutras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana_sutras "Baudhayana sutras"). His birth anniversary is known as _Baudhayana Jayanti_ or _Bodhayan Jayanti_ or _Bodhayan Janmotsav_ in the [Mithila region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithila_(region) "Mithila (region)").

Baudhayana was a revered philosopher as well as a great Indian mathematician during 700 BC. He was the author of several ancient texts composed in the ancient [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent"). He composed more than two hundred texts. He gave many important theories of mathematics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana#cite_note-:0-1) He is known for the famous mathematical theory [Baudhāyana Śulbasûtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana_sutras "Baudhayana sutras").

In the text [Ashtadhyayi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%AD%C4%81dhy%C4%81y%C4%AB "Aṣṭādhyāyī"), he is described as the guru of the famous Sanskrit grammarian [Panini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini "Pāṇini"). He was a great scholar of philosophy, theology, mathematics and language. His important works were Vedvriti, Vedanta, Ratna Manjusha, Dharmasutra and Grihasutra.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana#cite_note-:0-1)_Baudhayana Dharmasutra_ and _Baudhayana Grihya Parishishta Sutra_ are the two major texts composed by him, which emphasize the ritualistic manner and philosophy of the Hindu tradition. His school of thought in Hindu tradition is known as _Baudhayana Shakha_ or _Baudhayana school_. The Baudhayana Shakha consider the practices of image worship in Hinduism.

In the Baudhayana school, [Lord Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu") is considered as the highest being and called as _Mahapurusha_. Apart from Lord Vishnu, it also considers all other deities in [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") as "Worthy of honor".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana#cite_note-2)
