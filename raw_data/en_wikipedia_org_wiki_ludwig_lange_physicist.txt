Biography [ edit ] He was the son of the philologist and archaeologist Ludwig Lange and his wife Adelheide Blume. He studied mathematics , physics , and also psychology , epistemology , ethics at the University of Leipzig and the University of Gießen from 1882-1885. He was an assistant of Wilhelm Wundt from 1885-1887 and attained his Ph.D.

in 1886. He worked for many years as a Privatdozent , and in the field of photography . From 1887 he exhibited growing symptoms of a nervous disease . In 1936 he died in a psychiatric hospital ( Klinikum am Weissenhof ) in Weinsberg.

[ 1 ] Legacy [ edit ] Lange is known for inventing terms like inertial frame of reference and inertial time (1885), which were used by him instead of Newton's " absolute space and time ". This was very important for the development of relativistic mechanics after 1900. DiSalle describes Lange's definition in this way: [ 2 ] An inertial system is a coordinate system with respect to which three free particles, projected from a single point and moving in non-coplanar directions, move in straight lines and travel mutually-proportional distances. The law of inertia then states that relative to any inertial system, any fourth free particle will move uniformly.
