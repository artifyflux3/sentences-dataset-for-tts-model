A completely overcast sky in Mehamn , Norway.

Overcast or overcast weather , as defined by the World Meteorological Organization , is the meteorological condition of clouds obscuring at least 95% of the sky.

[ 1 ] However, the total cloud cover must not be entirely due to obscuring phenomena near the surface, such as fog .

[ 2 ] Overcast, written as "OVC" in the METAR observation, is reported when the cloud cover is observed to equal eight oktas (eighths).

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] An overcast sky may be explicitly identified as thin (mostly transparent ), but otherwise considered opaque —which always constitutes a ceiling in aviation meteorology.

[ 2 ] Sometimes clouds can be of different colors such as black or white, but overcast usually refers to darker skies.

[ 4 ] In some cases, it can be characterized by almost zero distinction of borders of clouds. Or the sky may be covered by a single type of cloud, such as stratus , turning the whole sky into a dull white color.

Periods of overcast weather can range from a few hours to several days. Overcast weather can also affect people suffering from seasonal affective disorder .

The same weather when observed from above may be referred to as undercast , generally by pilots reporting in-flight weather conditions.
