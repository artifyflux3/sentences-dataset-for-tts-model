[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Born on the Boxing Day of 1941 in Allahabad in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to Vishwambher Sharan Singh -Chandrakali Devi couple, Jamuna Sharan Singh graduated in science from the University of Allahabad in 1957 and continued at the same institution to complete his master's degree in 1959, standing first in the university in both the examinations.

[ 4 ] He would later secure a doctoral degree (PhD) in 1967 from Banaras Hindu University for his thesis, Dynamics of grassland vegetation , under the guidance of noted ecologists, Ramdeo Misra and Kailash C. Misra.

[ 5 ] He started his career in 1968 by joining Kurukshetra University as a lecturer and continued at the university till 1975, but took a break to work as a visiting scientist at Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory of Colorado State University during 1971–74.

[ 1 ] Legacy [ edit ] Chitwan National Park - a tropical grassland Singh's principal subject of study was grassland ecosystems and his studies included various types of grasslands including tropical and temperate grasslands, oak and pine forests, tropical dry forests and alpine grasslands with reference to their biomass relations, eco-physiology, energy flow, diversity and mathematical modelling .

[ 7 ] His studies are reported to have widened our understanding of the development, dynamics and disruption of natural ecosystems and assisted in developing scientific methodologies for their protection, management and conservation . He is credited with the compilation of comprehensive data on different ecosystems and he is known to have proposed new eco-management strategies and resource study protocols.

[ 2 ] His researches have been documented by way of 405 articles, [ 4 ] ResearchGate , an online repository of scientific articles has listed 300 of them.

[ 8 ] Besides, he has published five books viz.

Tropical Ecosystems: Ecology and Management , [ 9 ] Grassland vegetation: its structure, function, utilization and management , [ 10 ] Forests of Himalaya: Structure, Functioning, and Impact of Man , [ 11 ] Research Methods in Plant Ecology .
