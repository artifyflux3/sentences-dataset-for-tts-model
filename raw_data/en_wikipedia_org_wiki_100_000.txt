Terms for 100,000 [ edit ] In Bangladesh , India , Pakistan and South Asia , one hundred thousand is called a lakh , and is written as 1,00,000 . The Thai , Lao , Khmer and Vietnamese languages also have separate words for this number: แสน , ແສນ , សែន (all saen ), and ức respectively. The Malagasy word is hetsy .

[ 1 ] In the Netherlands , a ' ton ' is a colloquialism for a denomination of 100.000 monetary units. In the guilders period a ton would denote 100.000 guilders. With the introduction of the euro, a ton would come to mean 100.000 euros. The usage is mostly limited to the financial sphere and the buying and selling of houses. It is not used in official settings because of the ambiguity with commonly used metric tonne . While usage is common in the Netherlands, it sees almost no use in Belgium .

[ citation needed ] In Cyrillic numerals , it is known as the legion ( легион ): or .

Values of 100,000 [ edit ] In astronomy , 100,000 metres , 100 kilometres , or 100 km (62 miles) is the altitude at which the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) defines spaceflight to begin.

In paleoclimatology , the 100,000-year problem is a mismatch between the temperature record and the modeled incoming solar radiation .

In the Irish language , céad míle fáilte ( pronounced [ˌceːd̪ˠ ˈmʲiːlʲə ˈfˠaːl̠ʲtʲə] ) is a popular greeting meaning "a hundred thousand welcomes".
