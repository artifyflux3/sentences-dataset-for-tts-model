[ 6 ] The implication of this statement is that the forces of socialism have overwhelmingly surpassed the forces of imperialism .

[ 7 ] History [ edit ] "The East wind prevails over the West wind" was borrowed by Mao Zedong from the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber [ 8 ] in which Lin Daiyu said, "In all families, either the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevails over the East Wind".

[ 9 ] In the book, East and West are not seen as representing different sets of beliefs or values.
