Earth's atmosphere as it appears from space, as bands of different colours at the horizon. From the bottom, [afterglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterglow "Afterglow") illuminates the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") in orange with silhouettes of clouds, and the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") in white and blue. Next the **mesosphere** (pink area) extends to just below the [edge of space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") at one hundred kilometers and the pink line of [airglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow "Airglow") of the lower [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere") (dark), which hosts green and red [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora") over several hundred kilometers.

Diagram showing the five primary layers of the Earth's atmosphere: [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere"), [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"), mesosphere, [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), and [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"). From Earths surface to the top of the stratosphere (50 km) is just under 1% of Earth's radius.

The **mesosphere** (;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-1) from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[μέσος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:μέσος")_(\_mésos\_)_'middle' and _-[sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")_) is the third layer of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), directly above the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") and directly below the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"). In the mesosphere, [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") decreases as [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") increases. This characteristic is used to define limits: it begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the [stratopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratopause "Stratopause")), and ends at the [mesopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopause "Mesopause"), which is the coldest part of [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere"), with temperatures below −143°C (−225°F; 130 K). The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season (higher in winter and at the tropics, lower in summer and at the poles), but the lower boundary is usually located at altitudes from 47 to 51 km (29 to 32 mi; 154,000 to 167,000 ft) above [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level"), and the upper boundary (the mesopause) is usually from 85 to 100 km (53 to 62 mi; 279,000 to 328,000 ft).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-5)

The stratosphere and mesosphere are sometimes collectively referred to as the "middle atmosphere",[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-6) which spans altitudes approximately between 12 and 80 km (7.5 and 49.7 mi) above Earth's surface. The [mesopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopause "Mesopause"), at an altitude of 80–90 km (50–56 mi), separates the mesosphere from the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere")—the second-outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere. On Earth, the mesopause nearly co-incides with the [turbopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopause "Turbopause"), below which different chemical species are well-mixed due to turbulent [eddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics) "Eddy (fluid dynamics)"). Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform because the [scale heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height "Scale height") of different chemical species differ according to their [molecular masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass "Molecular mass").

The term _[near space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near\_space "Near space")_ is also sometimes used to refer to altitudes within the mesosphere. This term does not have a technical definition, but typically refers to the region roughly between the [Armstrong limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit "Armstrong limit") (about 62,000 ft or 19 km, above which humans require a [pressure suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_suit "Pressure suit") in order to survive) and the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line "Kármán line") (where [astrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodynamics "Astrodynamics") must take over from [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics") in order to achieve flight); or, by another definition, to the space between the highest altitude commercial [airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner "Airliner") fly at (about 40,000 ft (12.2 km)) and the lowest perigee of [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") being able to orbit the Earth (about 45 mi (73 km)). Some sources distinguish between the terms "near space" and "upper atmosphere", so that only the layers closest to the Kármán line are described as "near space".

Within the mesosphere, [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") decreases with increasing [height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height "Height"). This is a result of decreasing absorption of solar radiation by the rarefied atmosphere having a [diminishing relative ozone concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone%E2%80%93oxygen_cycle#Mesosphere "Ozone–oxygen cycle") as altitude increases (ozone being the main absorber in the UV wavelengths that survived absorption by the thermosphere).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-Photochemistry_of_Ozone-7) Additionally, this is also a result of increasing cooling by [CO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide")[radiative emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_emission "Radiative emission"). The top of the mesosphere, called the [mesopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopause "Mesopause"), is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-8) Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as about −100°C (173 K; −148°F),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-9) varying according to [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season").

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/ISS-46_Soyuz_TMA-17M_reentry.jpg/330px-ISS-46_Soyuz_TMA-17M_reentry.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISS-46_Soyuz_TMA-17M_reentry.jpg)

[Afterglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterglow "Afterglow") of the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") (orange), the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") (blue) and the **mesosphere** (dark) at which [atmospheric entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry "Atmospheric entry") begins, leaving smoke trails, such as in this case of a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") reentry.

The main most important features in this region are strong zonal (East-West) winds, [atmospheric tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_tide "Atmospheric tide"), internal atmospheric gravity waves (commonly called "[gravity waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_waves "Gravity waves")"), and [planetary waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_wave "Planetary wave"). Most of these tides and waves start in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere") and lower [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), and propagate to the mesosphere. In the mesosphere, gravity-wave amplitudes can become so large that the waves become unstable and dissipate. This dissipation deposits momentum into the mesosphere and largely drives global circulation.

[Noctilucent clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud "Noctilucent cloud") are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere") known as the _D layer_, which is only present during the day when some [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization") occurs with [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") being ionized by [Lyman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series "Lyman series")-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") form back into a neutral molecule.

A 5 km (3.1 mi; 16,000 ft) deep [sodium layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_layer "Sodium layer") is located between 80–105 km (50–65 mi; 262,000–344,000 ft). Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the [airglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow "Airglow"). The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium [sublimating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition) "Sublimation (phase transition)") from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create "guide stars" as part of the [adaptive optical correction process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics "Adaptive optics") used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-10) Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Beginning in October 2018,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-11) a distinct type of [aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora "Aurora") has been identified, originating in the mesosphere. Often referred to as 'dunes' due to their resemblance to sandy ripples on a beach, the green undulating lights extend toward the equator. They have been identified as originating about 96 km (60 mi; 315,000 ft) above the surface. Since auroras are caused by ultra-high-speed solar particles interacting with atmospheric molecules, the green color of these dunes has tentatively been explained by the interaction of those solar particles with oxygen molecules. The dunes therefore occur where mesospheric oxygen is more concentrated.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-12)

Millions of [meteors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor "Meteor") enter the Earth's atmosphere, averaging 40,000 tons per year.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-13) The ablated material, called meteoric smoke, is thought to serve as condensation nuclei for [noctilucent clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_clouds "Noctilucent clouds").

The mesosphere lies above altitude records for [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-14) while only the lowest few kilometers are accessible to [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloons "Balloons"), for which the altitude record is 53.0 kilometres (32.9 mi).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-15) Meanwhile, the mesosphere is below the minimum altitude for [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit")[spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") due to high atmospheric drag.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-18) It has only been accessed through the use of [sounding rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounding_rocket "Sounding rocket"), which are only capable of taking mesospheric measurements for a few minutes per mission.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-19) As a result, it is the least-understood part of the atmosphere, resulting in the humorous moniker _ignorosphere_.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere#cite_note-21) The presence of [red sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_sprite "Red sprite") and [blue jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jet "Blue jet") (electrical discharges or [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") within the lower mesosphere), [noctilucent clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud "Noctilucent cloud"), and density shears within this poorly understood layer are of current scientific interest.

On February 1, 2003, [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle")[_Columbia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia")[broke up on reentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster "Space Shuttle Columbia disaster") at about 62 km (39 mi) altitude, in the lower mesosphere, killing all seven crew members.
