The **Gregorian calendar** is the [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar") used in most parts of the world.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDershowitzReingold2008p._45._%22The_calendar_in_use_today_in_most_of_the_world_is_the_Gregorian_or_''new-style''_calendar_designed_by_a_commission_assembled_by_Pope_Gregory_XIII_in_the_sixteenth_century.%22-1)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-2) It went into effect in October 1582 following the [papal bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_bull "Papal bull")_[Inter gravissimas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter\_gravissimas "Inter gravissimas")_ issued by [Pope Gregory XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII "Pope Gregory XIII"), which introduced it as a modification of, and replacement for, the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar"). The principal change was to space [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year") slightly differently to make the average calendar year 365.2425 days long rather than the Julian calendar's 365.25 days, thus more closely approximating the 365.2422-day ["tropical" or "solar" year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.

The rule for leap years is that every year divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are divisible by 100, except in turn for years also divisible by 400. For example 1800 and 1900 were not leap years, but 2000 was.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-3)

There were two reasons to establish the Gregorian calendar. First, the Julian calendar was based on the estimate that the average solar year is exactly 365.25 days long, an overestimate of a little under one day per century, and thus has a leap year every four years without exception. The Gregorian reform shortened the average (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox "Equinox").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGregory_XIII1582-4) Second, in the years since the [First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea") in AD 325,[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-5) the excess leap days introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to drift such that the [March equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox") was occurring well before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the Christian churches, because it is fundamental to the [calculation of the date of Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter "Date of Easter"). To reinstate the association, the reform advanced the date by 10 days:[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-6) Thursday 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGregory_XIII1582-4) In addition, the reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring four days before the calculated dates. Whilst the reform introduced minor changes, the calendar continued to be fundamentally based on the same [geocentric theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") as its predecessor.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-7)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

The reform was adopted initially by the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") countries of Europe and their overseas possessions. Over the next three centuries, the [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation") and [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy") countries also gradually moved to what they called the "**Improved calendar**",[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-8) with Greece being the last European country to adopt the calendar (for civil use only) in 1923.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlegen2013-9) However, many Orthodox churches continue to use the Julian calendar for religious rites and the dating of major feasts. To unambiguously specify a date during the transition period (in contemporary documents or in history texts), [both notations were given](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_dating "Dual dating"), tagged as ["Old Style" or "New Style"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style "Old Style and New Style") as appropriate. During the 20th century, most non-[Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") countries also adopted the calendar, at least for [civil purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_calendar "Civil calendar").

Description
-----------

The Gregorian calendar, like the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar"), is a [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") with 12 months of 28–31 days each. The year in both calendars consists of 365 days, with a [leap day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_day "Leap day") being added to February in the [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year"). The months and length of months in the Gregorian calendar are the same as for the Julian calendar. The only difference is that the Gregorian calendar omits a leap day in _three_ centurial years every 400 years and leaves the leap day unchanged.

A leap year normally occurs every four years: the leap day, historically, was inserted by doubling 24 February– there were indeed [two days dated 24 February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissextus "Bissextus"). However, for many years it has been customary to put the extra day at the end of the month of February, adding a [29 February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29_February "29 February") for the leap day. Before the [1969 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterii_Paschalis "Mysterii Paschalis") of its [General Roman Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Roman_Calendar "General Roman Calendar"), the Catholic Church delayed February feasts after the 23rd by one day in leap years; masses celebrated according to the previous calendar still reflect this delay.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTERichards1998101-10)

A year is divided into twelve [months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month")| No. | Name | Length in days |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | January | 31 |
| 2 | February | 28 (29 in [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year")) |
| 3 | March | 31 |
| 4 | April | 30 |
| 5 | May | 31 |
| 6 | June | 30 |
| 7 | July | 31 |
| 8 | August | 31 |
| 9 | September | 30 |
| 10 | October | 31 |
| 11 | November | 30 |
| 12 | December | 31 |

Gregorian years are identified by consecutive year numbers.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-11) A calendar date is fully specified by the year (numbered according to a [calendar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era "Calendar era"), in this case _[Anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Domini "Anno Domini")_ or [Common Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era")), the month (identified by name or number), and the day of the month (numbered sequentially starting from 1). Although the calendar year currently runs from 1 January to 31 December, at previous times year numbers were based on a different starting point within the calendar (see the ["beginning of the year"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Beginning_of_the_year) section below).

Calendar cycles repeat completely every 400 years, which equals 146,097 days.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-12)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-14) Of these 400 years, 303 are regular years of 365 days and 97 are leap years of 366 days. A mean calendar year is ⁠365+97/400⁠ days = 365.2425 days, or 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds.[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-15)

The Gregorian calendar was a reform of the Julian calendar. It was instituted by the papal bull _[Inter gravissimas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter\_gravissimas "Inter gravissimas")_ dated 24 February 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGregory_XIII1582-4) after whom the calendar is named. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. The error in the Julian calendar (its assumption that there are exactly 365.25 days in a year) had led to the date of the equinox according to the calendar drifting from the observed reality, and thus an error had been introduced into the [calculation of the date of Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus"). Although a recommendation of the [First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea") in 325 specified that all Christians should celebrate Easter on the same day, it took almost five centuries before virtually all Christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the Church of Alexandria (see [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter#Controversies_over_the_date "Easter") for the issues which arose).[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-16)

### Background

Because the [date of Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter "Date of Easter") is a function– the _[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus")_– of the date of the [spring equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox") in the northern hemisphere, the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") considered unacceptable the increasing divergence between the [canonical date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law_of_the_Catholic_Church "Canon law of the Catholic Church") of the equinox and observed reality. Easter is celebrated on the Sunday after the [ecclesiastical full moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_full_moon "Ecclesiastical full moon") on or after 21 March, which was adopted as an approximation to the March equinox.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTERichards2013599-17) European scholars had been well aware of the calendar drift since the early medieval period.

[Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede"), writing in the 8th century, showed that the accumulated error in his time was more than three days. [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"), c. 1200, estimated the error at seven or eight days. [Dante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante "Dante"), writing c. 1300, was aware of the need for calendar reform. An attempt to go forward with such a reform was undertaken by [Pope Sixtus IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sixtus_IV "Pope Sixtus IV"), who in 1475 invited [Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiomontanus "Regiomontanus") to the Vatican for this purpose. However, the project was interrupted by the death of Regiomontanus shortly after his arrival in Rome.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-18) The increase of astronomical knowledge and the precision of observations towards the end of the 15th century made the question more pressing. Numerous publications over the following decades called for a calendar reform, among them two papers sent to the Vatican by the [University of Salamanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Salamanca "University of Salamanca") in 1515 and 1578,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarabias_Torres2012241-19) but the project was not taken up again until the 1540s, and implemented only under Pope Gregory XIII (r. 1572–1585).

### Preparation

In 1545, the [Council of Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent") authorised [Pope Paul III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_III "Pope Paul III") to reform the calendar, requiring that the date of the [vernal equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox "March equinox") be restored to that which it held at the time of the [First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea") in 325 and that an alteration to the calendar be designed to prevent future drift. This would allow for more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of Easter.

In 1577, a _Compendium_ was sent to expert mathematicians outside the reform commission for comments. Some of these experts, including [Giambattista Benedetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Benedetti "Giambattista Benedetti") and [Giuseppe Moleto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Moletti "Giuseppe Moletti"), believed [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter "Easter") should be computed from the true motions of the Sun and Moon, rather than using a tabular method, but these recommendations were not adopted.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZiggelaar1983211,_214-20) The reform adopted was a modification of a proposal made by the [Calabrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria "Calabria") doctor [Aloysius Lilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Lilius "Aloysius Lilius") (or Lilio).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoyer1983-21)

Lilius's proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97, by making three out of four centurial years common instead of leap years. He also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the [epacts of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epact "Epact") when calculating the annual date of Easter, solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform.

Ancient tables provided the Sun's mean longitude.[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-24) The German mathematician [Christopher Clavius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Clavius "Christopher Clavius"), the architect of the Gregorian calendar, noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the Sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year. [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") also noticed discrepancies.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-25)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-26) The Gregorian leap year rule (97 leap years in 400 years) was put forward by [Petrus Pitatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Pitatus "Petrus Pitatus") of Verona in 1560. He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the [Alfonsine tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonsine_tables "Alfonsine tables") and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (_[De revolutionibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus "De revolutionibus")_) and [Erasmus Reinhold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Reinhold "Erasmus Reinhold") (_[Prutenic tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prutenic\_tables "Prutenic tables")_). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian [sexagesimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 0;14,33,9,57 (Alfonsine), 0;14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 0;14,33,9,24 (Reinhold).[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-27) In decimal notation, these are equal to 0.24254606, 0.24255185, and 0.24254352, respectively. All values are the same to two sexagesimal places (0;14,33, equal to decimal 0.2425) and this is also the mean length of the Gregorian year. Thus Pitatus's solution would have commended itself to the astronomers.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwerdlow1986-28)

Lilius's proposals had two components. First, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") is 365.24219 days long.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeeusSavoie1992-29) A commonly used value in Lilius's time, from the Alfonsine tables, is 365.2425463 days.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoyer1983-21) As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Accuracy)). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would have drifted further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March.

Lilius's work was expanded upon by Christopher Clavius in a closely argued, 800-page volume. He would later defend his and Lilius's work against detractors. Clavius's opinion was that the correction should take place in one move, and it was this advice that prevailed with Gregory.

The second component consisted of an approximation that would provide an accurate yet simple, rule-based calendar. Lilius's formula was a 10-day correction to revert the drift since the Council of Nicaea, and the imposition of a leap day in only 97 years in 400 rather than in 1 year in 4. The proposed rule was that "years divisible by 100 would be leap years only if they were divisible by 400 as well".

The 19-year cycle used for the lunar calendar required revision because the astronomical new moon was, at the time of the reform, four days before the calculated new moon.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTERichards2013599-17) It was to be corrected by one day every 300 or 400 years (8 times in 2,500 years) along with corrections for the years that were no longer leap years (i.e. 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc.) In fact, a new method for computing the date of Easter was introduced. The method proposed by Lilius was revised somewhat in the final reform.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZiggelaar1983220-30)

When the new calendar was put in use, the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the Council of Nicaea was corrected by a deletion of 10 days. The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582 (the cycle of weekdays was not affected).

#### First printed Gregorian calendar

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Reforma_Gregoriana_del_Calendario_Juliano.jpg/250px-Reforma_Gregoriana_del_Calendario_Juliano.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reforma_Gregoriana_del_Calendario_Juliano.jpg)

_Lunario Novo, Secondo la Nuova Riforma della Correttione del l'Anno Riformato da N.S. Gregorio XIII_,[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-Lunario-31) printed in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") by Vincenzo Accolti in 1582, one of the first printed editions of the new calendar

A month after decreeing the reform, the pope (with a brief of 3 April 1582) granted to one Antoni Lilio the exclusive right to publish the calendar for a period of ten years. The _Lunario Novo secondo la nuova riforma_[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-Lunario-31) was printed by Vincenzo Accolti, one of the first calendars printed in Rome after the reform, notes at the bottom that it was signed with papal authorization and by Lilio (_Con licentia delli Superiori... et permissu Ant(onii) Lilij_). The papal brief was revoked on 20 September 1582, because Antonio Lilio proved unable to keep up with the demand for copies.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-32)

### Adoption

Although Gregory's reform was enacted in the most solemn of forms available to the Church, the bull had no authority beyond the Catholic Church (of which he was the supreme religious authority) and the [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "Papal States") (which he personally ruled). The changes that he was proposing were changes to the civil calendar, which required adoption by the civil authorities in each country to have legal effect.

The bull _Inter gravissimas_ became the law of the Catholic Church in 1582, but it was not recognised by [Protestant churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism"), [Eastern Orthodox churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_churches "Eastern Orthodox churches"), [Oriental Orthodox churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_churches "Oriental Orthodox churches"), and a few others. Consequently, the days on which Easter and related holidays were celebrated by different Christian churches again diverged.

On 29 September 1582, [Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain") decreed the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-33) This affected much of Roman Catholic Europe, as Philip was at the time ruler over [Spain and Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Union "Iberian Union") as well as [much of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_early_modern_Italy "History of early modern Italy").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-34) In these territories, as well as in the [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth "Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth")[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-35) and in the Papal States, the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull, with Julian Thursday, 4 October 1582, being followed by Gregorian Friday, 15 October. The [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") and [Portuguese colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire") followed somewhat later _de facto_ because of delay in communication.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-36) The other major Catholic power of Western Europe, France, adopted the change a few months later: 9 December was followed by 20 December.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-37)

Many [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") countries initially objected to adopting a Catholic innovation; some Protestants feared the new calendar was part of a plot to return them to the Catholic fold. For example, the British could not bring themselves to adopt the Catholic system explicitly: the Annexe to their [Calendar (New Style) Act 1750](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750 "Calendar (New Style) Act 1750") established a computation for the date of Easter that achieved the same result as Gregory's rules, without actually referring to him.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-38)

[Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "Kingdom of Great Britain") and the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") (including the eastern part of what is now the United States) adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_calendar "Swedish calendar") followed in 1753.

Prior to 1917, Turkey used the lunar [Islamic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar "Islamic calendar") with the [Hijri era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijri_year "Hijri year") for general purposes and the Julian calendar for fiscal purposes. The start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 March and the year number was roughly equivalent to the [Hijri year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijri_year "Hijri year") (see [Rumi calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi_calendar "Rumi calendar")). As the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of "escape years" every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump. From 1 March 1917 the fiscal year became Gregorian, rather than Julian. On 1 January 1926, the use of the Gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in most other countries.

Difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates
------------------------------------------------------

Conversion from Julian to Gregorian dates.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-41)| Gregorian range | Julian range | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From 15 October 1582 to 28 February 1700 | From 5 October 1582 to 18 February 1700 | 10 days |
| From 1 March 1700 to 28 February 1800 | From 19 February 1700 to 17 February 1800 | 11 days |
| From 1 March 1800 to 28 February 1900 | From 18 February 1800 to 16 February 1900 | 12 days |
| From 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100 | From 17 February 1900 to 15 February 2100 | 13 days |
| From 1 March 2100 to 28 February 2200 | From 16 February 2100 to 14 February 2200 | 14 days |

This section always places the intercalary day on 29 February even though it was always obtained by doubling 24 February (the _bissextum_ (twice sixth) or bissextile day) until the late [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). The Gregorian calendar is [proleptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar "Proleptic Gregorian calendar") before 1582 (calculated backwards on the same basis, for years before 1582), and the difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates increases by three days every four centuries (all date ranges are inclusive).

The following equation gives the number of days that the Gregorian calendar is ahead of the Julian calendar, called the "secular difference" between the two calendars. A negative difference means the Julian calendar is ahead of the Gregorian calendar.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlackburnHolford-Strevens1999788-42)![Image 6: {\displaystyle D=\left\lfloor {Y/100}\right\rfloor -\left\lfloor {Y/400}\right\rfloor -2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a313a9b32c617d13533a900c05f404cf98f63bc4) where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle D}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f34a0c600395e5d4345287e21fb26efd386990e6) is the secular difference and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961d67d6b454b4df2301ac571808a3538b3a6d3f) is the year using [astronomical year numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering "Astronomical year numbering"), that is, use 1 − (year BC) for BC years. ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \left\lfloor {x}\right\rfloor }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/646b67c5ebaa8a43d4687159565e622d08d25baf) means that if the result of the division is not an integer it is rounded down to the nearest integer.

The general rule, in years which are leap years in the Julian calendar but not the Gregorian, is:

Up to 28 February in the calendar being converted _from_, add one day less or subtract one day more than the calculated value. Give February the appropriate number of days for the calendar being converted _into_. When subtracting days to calculate the Gregorian equivalent of 29 February (Julian), 29 February is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is −4 the Gregorian equivalent of this date is 24 February.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-43)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-44)

The year used in dates during the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") and the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") was the consular year, which began on the day when consuls first entered office—probably 1 May before 222 BC, 15 March from 222 BC and 1 January from 153 BC.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-61) The Julian calendar, which began in 45 BC, continued to use 1 January as the first day of the [new year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_year "New year"). Even though the year used for dates changed, the civil year always displayed its months in the order January to December from the Roman Republican period until the present.

During the Middle Ages, under the influence of the Catholic Church, many Western European countries moved the start of the year to one of several important Christian festivals—25 December ([Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas "Christmas")), 25 March ([Annunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation "Annunciation")), or Easter,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-MS-62) while the Byzantine Empire began its year on 1 September and Russia did so on 1 March until 1492, when the new year was moved to 1 September.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-63)

In common usage, 1 January was regarded as New Year's Day and celebrated as such,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-64) but from the 12th century until 1751 the legal year in England began on 25 March ([Lady Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Day "Lady Day")).[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-65) So, for example, the Parliamentary record lists the execution of [Charles I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England "Charles I of England") on 30 January as occurring in 1648 (as the year did not end until 24 March),[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-66) although later histories adjust the start of the year to 1 January and record the execution as occurring in 1649.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-67)

Most Western European countries changed the start of the year to 1 January before they adopted the Gregorian calendar. For example, Scotland changed the start of the Scottish New Year to 1 January in 1600 (this meant that 1599 was a short year). England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of the year to 1 January in 1752 (so 1751 was a short year with only 282 days). Later in 1752 in September the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies (see the section [Adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Adoption)). These two reforms were implemented by the [Calendar (New Style) Act 1750](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750 "Calendar (New Style) Act 1750").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-NT-Perpetual-Calendar-68)

In some countries, an official decree or law specifies that the start of the year should be 1 January. For such countries, a specific date when a "1 January year" became the norm, can be identified.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBond187591%E2%80%93101-69) In other countries, customs varied, and the start of the year moved back and forth as fashion and influence from other countries dictated various customs. Neither the papal bull nor its attached canons explicitly fix such a date, though the latter states that the "[Golden number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_number_(time) "Golden number (time)")" of 1752 ends in December and a new year (and new Golden number) begins in January 1753.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-70)

Dual dating

Memorial plaque to John Etty in [All Saints' Church, North Street, York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Church,_North_Street,_York "All Saints' Church, North Street, York"), recording his date of death as 28 January⁠170+8/9⁠

During the period between 1582, when the first countries adopted the Gregorian calendar, and 1923, when the last European country adopted it, it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the Julian calendar and in the Gregorian calendar, for example, "10/21 February 1750/51", where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 January while others were still using some other date. Even before 1582, the year sometimes had to be double-dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries. Woolley, writing in his biography of [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee_(mathematician) "John Dee (mathematician)") (1527–1608/9), notes that immediately after 1582 English letter writers "customarily" used "two dates" on their letters, one OS and one NS.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-71)

### Old Style and New Style dates

"Old Style" (O.S.) and "New Style" (N.S.) indicate dating systems before and after a calendar change, respectively. Usually, this is the change from the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar") to the Gregorian calendar as enacted in various European countries between 1582 and the early 20th century.

In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England"), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland"), and Britain's [American colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies"), there were two calendar changes, both in 1752. The first adjusted the start of a new year from [Lady Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Day "Lady Day") (25 March) to 1 January (which [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") had done from 1600), while the second discarded the Julian calendar in favour of the Gregorian calendar, removing 11 days from the September 1752 calendar to do so.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPoole199595%E2%80%93139-72)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-MS2-73) To accommodate the two calendar changes, writers used [dual dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_dating "Dual dating") to identify a given day by giving its date according to both styles of dating.

For countries such as Russia where no start of year adjustment took place, O.S. and N.S. simply indicate the Julian and Gregorian dating systems. Many [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") countries continue to use the older Julian calendar for religious purposes.

Proleptic Gregorian calendar
----------------------------

Extending the Gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction produces [a proleptic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar "Proleptic Gregorian calendar"), which should be used with some caution. For ordinary purposes, the dates of events occurring prior to 15 October 1582 are generally shown as they appeared in the Julian calendar, with the year starting on 1 January, and no conversion to their Gregorian equivalents. For example, the [Battle of Agincourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt "Battle of Agincourt") is universally considered to have been fought on 25 October 1415 which is [Saint Crispin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispin "Crispin")'s Day.

Usually, the mapping of new dates onto old dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events that happened before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. But for the period between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 and its introduction in Britain on 14 September 1752, there can be considerable confusion between events in continental western Europe and in British domains in English language histories.

Events in continental western Europe are usually reported in English language histories as happening under the Gregorian calendar. For example, the [Battle of Blenheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blenheim "Battle of Blenheim") is always given as 13 August 1704. Confusion occurs when an event affects both. For example, [William III of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England "William III of England") set sail from the Netherlands on 11 November 1688 (Gregorian calendar) and arrived at [Brixham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brixham "Brixham") in England on 5 November 1688 (Julian calendar).

[Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare") and [Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes "Miguel de Cervantes") seemingly died on exactly the same date (23 April 1616), but Cervantes predeceased Shakespeare by ten days in real time (as Spain used the Gregorian calendar, but Britain used the Julian calendar). This coincidence encouraged [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") to make 23 April the [World Book and Copyright Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Book_and_Copyright_Day "World Book and Copyright Day").

Astronomers avoid this ambiguity by the use of the [Julian day number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day_number "Julian day number").

For dates before the year 1, unlike the proleptic Gregorian calendar used in the [international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard "International standard")[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 "ISO 8601"), the traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar (like the older Julian calendar) does not have a [year 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero "Year zero") and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1, 2, ... both for years AD and BC. Thus the traditional timeline is 2 BC, 1 BC, AD 1, and AD 2. ISO 8601 uses astronomical year numbering which includes a year 0 and negative numbers before it. Thus the ISO 8601 timeline is −0001, 0000, 0001, and 0002.

Months
------

The Gregorian calendar continued to employ the [Julian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar") months, which have Latinate names and irregular numbers of [days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day"):

*   [January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January "January") (31 days), from Latin _\_mēnsis Iānuārius\__, "Month of [Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(mythology) "Janus (mythology)")",[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-janoed-74) the [Roman god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology "Roman mythology") of gates, doorways, beginnings and endings
*   [February](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February "February") (28 days in [common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year "Common year") and 29 in [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year")), from Latin _\_mēnsis Februārius\__, "Month of the [Februa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercalia "Lupercalia")", the [Roman festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_festivals "Roman festivals") of purgation and purification,[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-foed-75)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-oe-76)[cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate_word "Cognate word") with [fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever "Fever"),[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-foed-75) the [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_mythology "Etruscan mythology")[death god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_god "Death god")[Februus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Februus "Februus") ("Purifier"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and the [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language "Proto-Indo-European language") word for [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur")[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-foed-75)

Europeans sometimes attempt to remember the number of days in each month by memorizing some form of the traditional verse "[Thirty Days Hath September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Days_Hath_September "Thirty Days Hath September")". It appears in Latin,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-92) Italian,[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-i4d-93) French[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-94) and Portuguese,[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-95) and belongs to a broad [oral tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Oral tradition") but the earliest currently attested form of the poem is the English [marginalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia") inserted into a [calendar of saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_of_saints "Calendar of saints")c. 1425:[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-tto-96)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-97)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-98)

The [knuckle mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle_mnemonic "Knuckle mnemonic") for the days of the months of the year

Variations appeared in _[Mother Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother\_Goose "Mother Goose")_ and continue to be taught at schools. The unhelpfulness of such involved [mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") has been parodied as "Thirty days hath September/ But all the rest I can't remember"[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-99) but it has also been called "probably the only sixteenth-century poem most ordinary citizens know by heart".[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-holly-100) A common nonverbal alternative is the [knuckle mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle_mnemonic "Knuckle mnemonic"), considering the [knuckles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle "Knuckle") of one's [hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand "Hand") as months with 31 days and the lower spaces between them as months with fewer days. Using two hands, one may start from either [pinkie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkie_finger "Pinkie finger") knuckle as January and count across, omitting the space between the [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger "Index finger") knuckles (July and August). The same procedure can be done using the knuckles of a single hand, returning from the last (July) to the first (August) and continuing through. A similar mnemonic is to move up a [piano keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard "Musical keyboard") in [semitones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone "Semitone") from an F key, taking the white keys as the longer months and the black keys as the shorter ones.

Weeks
-----

In conjunction with the system of months, there is a system of [weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week "Week"). A physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the [weekday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekday "Weekday") and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month. [Calculating the day of the week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculating_the_day_of_the_week "Calculating the day of the week") is not very simple, because of the irregularities in the Gregorian system. When the Gregorian calendar was adopted by each country, the weekly cycle continued uninterrupted. For example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by Gregory XIII for the calendar's adoption, Friday, 15 October 1582, the preceding date was Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian calendar).

Opinions vary about the numbering of the days of the week. [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 "ISO 8601"), in common use worldwide, starts with Monday=1; printed monthly calendar grids often list Mondays in the first (left) column of dates and Sundays in the last. In North America, the week typically begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

Accuracy
--------

The Gregorian calendar improves the approximation made by the Julian calendar by skipping three Julian leap days in every 400 years, giving an average year of 365.2425 [mean solar days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time "Solar time") long.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeidelmann1992580%E2%80%93581-101) This approximation has an error of about one day per 3,030 years[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-102) with respect to the current value of the [mean tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_tropical_year "Mean tropical year"). However, because of the [precession of the equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_(astronomy) "Axial precession (astronomy)"), which is not constant, and the movement of the [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion") (which affects the Earth's orbital speed) the error with respect to the _astronomical_ vernal equinox is variable; using the average interval between vernal equinoxes near 2000 of 365.24237 days[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeeusSavoie199242-103) implies an error closer to 1 day every 7,700 years. By any criterion, the Gregorian calendar is substantially more accurate than the 1 day in 128 years error of the Julian calendar (average year 365.25 days).

In the 19th century, Sir [John Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel "John Herschel") proposed a modification to the Gregorian calendar with 969 leap days every 4,000 years, instead of 970 leap days that the Gregorian calendar would insert over the same period.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-104) This would reduce the average year to 365.24225 days. Herschel's proposal would make the year 4000, and multiples thereof, common instead of leap. While this modification has often been proposed since, it has never been officially adopted.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-105)

On time scales of thousands of years, the Gregorian calendar falls behind the astronomical seasons. This is because [the Earth's speed of rotation is gradually slowing down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#Changes "Earth's rotation"), which makes each day slightly longer over time (see [tidal acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration "Tidal acceleration") and [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second "Leap second")) while the year maintains a more uniform duration.

### Calendar seasonal error

[![Image 12: Gregorian calendar seasons difference](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Gregoriancalendarleap_solstice.svg/910px-Gregoriancalendarleap_solstice.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gregoriancalendarleap_solstice.svg "Gregorian calendar seasons difference")

This image shows the difference between the Gregorian calendar and the astronomical seasons.

The _y_-axis is the date of the solstice in June and the _x_-axis is Gregorian calendar years.

Each point is the date and time of the [June solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice "Solstice") in that particular year. The error shifts by about a quarter of a day per year. Centurial years are ordinary years, unless they are divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years. This causes a correction in the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300.

For instance, these corrections cause 23 December 1903 to be the latest December solstice, and 20 December 2096 to be the earliest solstice—about 2.35 days of variation compared with the astronomical event.

Notes
-----

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-2 "Jump up")**Many countries that use other calendars for religious purposes use the Gregorian calendar as their [civil calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_calendar "Civil calendar"). [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") is a notable exception, in that it uses the [solar Hijri calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar "Solar Hijri calendar").
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-5 "Jump up")**Rather than 45 BC when the Roman Empire adopted the Julian calendar.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-6 "Jump up")**By the time Great Britain and its possessions adopted the reform [with effect from 1752](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750 "Calendar (New Style) Act 1750"), the gap had increased to 11 days; when Russia and Greece did so (for their civil calendars) in the 20th century, the jump was 13 days. For other countries and territories, see [List of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adoption_dates_of_the_Gregorian_calendar_by_country "List of adoption dates of the Gregorian calendar by country").
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-8 "Jump up")**called such to avoid any suggestion of recognising the authority of Rome. The British [Calendar (New Style) Act 1750](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750 "Calendar (New Style) Act 1750") restates the algorithm from first principles without any reference to Gregory.
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-12 "Jump up")**The cycle described applies to the solar, or civil, calendar. If one also considers the ecclesiastical lunar rules, the lunisolar Easter _computus_ cycle repeats only after 5,700,000 years of 2,081,882,250 days in 70,499,183 lunar months, based on an assumed mean lunar month of 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes ⁠2+49928114/70499183⁠ seconds. (Seidelmann (1992), p. 582) [To properly function as an Easter _[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus "Computus")_, this lunisolar cycle must have the same mean year as the Gregorian solar cycle, and indeed that is exactly the case.]
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-14 "Jump up")**The extreme length of the Gregorian Easter _computus_ is due to its being the product of the 19-year [Metonic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle "Metonic cycle"), the thirty different possible values of the [epact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epact "Epact"), and the least common multiple (10,000) of the 400-year and 2,500-year solar and lunar correction cycles.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalker1945218-13)
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-15 "Jump up")**The same result is obtained by summing the fractional parts implied by the rule: 365 + ⁠1/4⁠ − ⁠1/100⁠ + ⁠1/400⁠ = 365 + 0.25 − 0.01 + 0.0025 = 365.2425
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_ref-16 "Jump up")**The last major Christian region to accept the Alexandrian rules was the [Carolingian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire "Carolingian Empire") (most of Western Europe) during 780–800. The last monastery in England to accept the Alexandrian rules did so in 931, and a few churches in southwest Asia beyond the eastern border of the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") continued to use rules that differed slightly, causing four dates for Easter to differ every 532 years.

["Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar"](http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm). [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20141011060050/http://www.cree.name/genuki/dates.htm) from the original on 11 October 2014. Before 1752, parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the Historical Year 1734 started even though the Civil Year 1733 continued until 24th March. ... We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Civil or the Historical Year. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 OS (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.
