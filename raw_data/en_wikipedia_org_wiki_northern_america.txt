Geopolitically , according to the United Nations' scheme of geographical regions and subregions , Northern America consists of Bermuda , Canada , Greenland , Saint Pierre and Miquelon and the United States (the contiguous United States and Alaska only, excluding Hawaii , Navassa Island , Puerto Rico , the United States Virgin Islands , and other minor U.S. Pacific territories ).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Definitions [ edit ] Maps using the term Northern America date back to 1755, when the region was occupied by France , Great Britain , and Spain .

[ 5 ] The Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America in 1813 applied to Mexico.
Today, Northern America includes the Canada–US dyad , developed countries that exhibit very high Human Development Indexes and intense economic integration while sharing many socioeconomic characteristics.

[ 6 ] The World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions has "Northern America" as the seventh of its nine "botanical continents". Its definition differs from the usual political one: Mexico is included, Bermuda is excluded (being placed in the Caribbean region), Hawaii is excluded (being placed in the Pacific botanical continent) and all of the Aleutian Islands , Russian as well as American, are included.
