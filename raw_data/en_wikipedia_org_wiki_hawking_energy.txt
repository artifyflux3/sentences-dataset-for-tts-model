It is a measure of the bending of ingoing and outgoing rays of light that are orthogonal to a 2- sphere surrounding the region of space whose mass is to be defined.

Definition [ edit ] Let ( M 3 , g a b ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}}^{3},g_{ab})} be a 3-dimensional sub-manifold of a relativistic spacetime, and let Σ Σ ⊂ ⊂ M 3 {\displaystyle \Sigma \subset {\mathcal {M}}^{3}} be a closed 2-surface. Then the Hawking mass m H ( Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle m_{H}(\Sigma )} of Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is defined [ 1 ] to be m H ( Σ Σ ) := Area Σ Σ 16 π π ( 1 − − 1 16 π π ∫ ∫ Σ Σ H 2 d a ) , {\displaystyle m_{H}(\Sigma ):={\sqrt {\frac {{\text{Area}}\,\Sigma }{16\pi }}}\left(1-{\frac {1}{16\pi }}\int _{\Sigma }H^{2}da\right),} where H {\displaystyle H} is the mean curvature of Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } .

Properties [ edit ] In the Schwarzschild metric , the Hawking mass of any sphere S r {\displaystyle S_{r}} about the central mass is equal to the value m {\displaystyle m} of the central mass.

A result of Geroch [ 2 ] implies that Hawking mass satisfies an important monotonicity condition. Namely, if M 3 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}^{3}} has nonnegative scalar curvature, then the Hawking mass of Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is non-decreasing as the surface Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } flows outward at a speed equal to the inverse of the mean curvature. In particular, if Σ Σ t {\displaystyle \Sigma _{t}} is a family of connected surfaces evolving according to d x d t = 1 H ν ν ( x ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dt}}={\frac {1}{H}}\nu (x),} where H {\displaystyle H} is the mean curvature of Σ Σ t {\displaystyle \Sigma _{t}} and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the unit vector opposite of the mean curvature direction, then d d t m H ( Σ Σ t ) ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}m_{H}(\Sigma _{t})\geq 0.} Said otherwise, Hawking mass is increasing for the inverse mean curvature flow .

[ 3 ] Hawking mass is not necessarily positive. However, it is asymptotic to the ADM [ 4 ] or the Bondi mass, depending on whether the surface is asymptotic to spatial infinity or null infinity.
