Gunning Doctoral students A. Rod Gover Michael G. Eastwood FAA is a mathematician at the University of Adelaide , [ 1 ] known for his work in twistor theory , conformal differential geometry and invariant differential operators. In 1976 [ 2 ] he received a PhD at Princeton University in several complex variables under Robert C. Gunning . He was a member of the twistor research group of Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford and he coauthored the monograph The Penrose Transform: Its Interaction with Representation Theory with Robert Baston.

[ 3 ] After moving to South Australia in 1985 he was the 1992 recipient of the Australian Mathematical Society Medal [ 4 ] and made a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2005.

[ 5 ] In 2012 he was named to the inaugural (2013) class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society .
