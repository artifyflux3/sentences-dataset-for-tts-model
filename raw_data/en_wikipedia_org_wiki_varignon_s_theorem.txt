Area(_EFGH_) = (1/2)Area(_ABCD_)

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), **Varignon's theorem** holds that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary [quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral "Quadrilateral") form a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"), called the **Varignon parallelogram**. It is named after [Pierre Varignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Varignon "Pierre Varignon"), whose proof was published posthumously in 1731.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-1)

The midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form a parallelogram. If the quadrilateral is [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon "Convex polygon") or [concave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_polygon "Concave polygon") (not [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#Complex_quadrilaterals "Quadrilateral")), then the [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") of the parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral.

If one introduces the concept of oriented areas for [_n_-gons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), then this area equality also holds for complex quadrilaterals.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Coxeter-2)

The Varignon parallelogram exists even for a [skew quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral#Skew_quadrilaterals "Quadrilateral"), and is planar whether the quadrilateral is planar or not. The theorem can be generalized to the [midpoint polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_polygon "Midpoint polygon") of an arbitrary polygon.

Referring to the diagram above, [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle")_ADC_ and _HDG_ are similar by the side-angle-side criterion, so [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle")_DAC_ and _DHG_ are equal, making _HG_ parallel to _AC_. In the same way _EF_ is parallel to _AC_, so _HG_ and _EF_ are parallel to each other; the same holds for _HE_ and _GF_.

Varignon's theorem can also be proved as a theorem of [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") organized as [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") with the linear combinations restricted to coefficients summing to 1, also called affine or [barycentric coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(mathematics) "Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)"). The proof applies even to skew quadrilaterals in spaces of any dimension.

Any three points _E_, _F_, _G_ are completed to a parallelogram (lying in the plane containing _E_, _F_, and _G_) by taking its fourth vertex to be _E_−_F_+ _G_. In the construction of the Varignon parallelogram this is the point (_A_+_B_)/2−(_B_+_C_)/2+(_C_+_D_)/2 =(_A_+_D_)/2. But this is the point _H_ in the figure, whence _EFGH_ forms a parallelogram.

In short, the [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid "Centroid") of the four points _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ is the midpoint of each of the two diagonals _EG_ and _FH_ of _EFGH_, showing that the midpoints coincide.

From the first proof, one can see that the sum of the diagonals is equal to the perimeter of the parallelogram formed. Also, we can use vectors 1/2 the length of each side to first determine the area of the quadrilateral, and then to find areas of the four triangles divided by each side of the inner parallelogram.

[Proof without words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words "Proof without words") of Varignon's theorem: 

1.   An arbitrary quadrilateral and its diagonals.
2.   Bases of similar triangles are parallel to the blue diagonal.
3.   Ditto for the red diagonal.
4.   The base pairs form a parallelogram with half the area of the quadrilateral, _A q_, as the sum of the areas of the four large triangles, _A l_ is 2 _A q_ (each of the two pairs reconstructs the quadrilateral) while that of the small triangles, _A s_ is a quarter of _A l_ (half linear dimensions yields quarter area), and the area of the parallelogram is _A q_ minus _A s_.

The Varignon parallelogram
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Varignon%27s_theorem&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The Varignon parallelogram")]

A planar Varignon parallelogram also has the following properties:

*   Each pair of opposite sides of the Varignon parallelogram are parallel to a diagonal in the original quadrilateral.
*   A side of the Varignon parallelogram is half as long as the diagonal in the original quadrilateral it is parallel to.
*   The area of the Varignon parallelogram equals half the area of the original quadrilateral. This is true in convex, concave and crossed quadrilaterals provided the area of the latter is defined to be the difference of the areas of the two triangles it is composed of.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Coxeter-2)
*   The [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter") of the Varignon parallelogram equals the sum of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral.
*   The diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram are the bimedians of the original quadrilateral.
*   The two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_lines "Concurrent lines") and are all bisected by their point of intersection.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Altshiller-Court-3): p.125 

In a convex quadrilateral with sides _a_, _b_, _c_ and _d_, the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides _a_ and _c_ is

![Image 6: {\displaystyle m={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {-a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}+d^{2}+p^{2}+q^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca1cb9942329f76eb2454b706ec6c63ce8337272)
where _p_ and _q_ are the length of the diagonals.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-4) The length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides _b_ and _d_ is

![Image 7: {\displaystyle n={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}-d^{2}+p^{2}+q^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71beb3c187aab28cf32df989830aff9041280d6c)
Hence[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Altshiller-Court-3): p.126

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \displaystyle p^{2}+q^{2}=2(m^{2}+n^{2}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f0b98b4334dd6400016e189f7a1d151ce92c1e0)
This is also a [corollary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary "Corollary") to the [parallelogram law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law "Parallelogram law") applied in the Varignon parallelogram.

The lengths of the bimedians can also be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the distance _x_ between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is possible when using Euler's quadrilateral theorem in the above formulas. Whence[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-5)

![Image 9: {\displaystyle m={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {2(b^{2}+d^{2})-4x^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9903d87f5dc01b783a55324c992bfe6771ff37d2)
and

![Image 10: {\displaystyle n={\tfrac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {2(a^{2}+c^{2})-4x^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3e358f396a3695ce1f75f9f1c10cc5119b9d864)
The two opposite sides in these formulas are not the two that the bimedian connects.

In a convex quadrilateral, there is the following [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics) "Duality (mathematics)") connection between the bimedians and the diagonals:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Josefsson-6)

*   The two bimedians have equal length [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") the two diagonals are [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular").
*   The two bimedians are perpendicular if and only if the two diagonals have equal length.

The Varignon parallelogram is a [rhombus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus "Rhombus") if and only if the two diagonals of the quadrilateral have equal length, that is, if the quadrilateral is an [equidiagonal quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidiagonal_quadrilateral "Equidiagonal quadrilateral").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-deV-7)

The Varignon parallelogram is a [rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") if and only if the diagonals of the quadrilateral are [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular"), that is, if the quadrilateral is an [orthodiagonal quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodiagonal_quadrilateral "Orthodiagonal quadrilateral").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-Josefsson-6): p. 14 [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-deV-7): p. 169

For a [self-crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_self-intersecting_polygons "List of self-intersecting polygons") quadrilateral, the Varignon parallelogram can degenerate to four collinear points, forming a line segment traversed twice. This happens whenever the polygon is formed by replacing two parallel sides of a [trapezoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid "Trapezoid") by the two diagonals of the trapezoid, such as in the [antiparallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparallelogram "Antiparallelogram").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varignon's_theorem#cite_note-8)
