Sunbeams in Nevada during a sunset Daytime sunbeams as seen from the ISS , illustrating their parallel nature A sunbeam , in meteorological optics , is a beam of sunlight that appears to radiate from the position of the Sun . Shining through openings in clouds or between other objects such as mountains and buildings, these beams of particle-scattered sunlight are essentially parallel shafts separated by darker shadowed volumes. Their apparent convergence in the sky is a visual illusion from linear perspective . The same illusion causes the apparent convergence of parallel lines on a long straight road or hallway at a distant vanishing point .

[ 1 ] The scattering particles that make sunlight visible may be air molecules or particulates .

[ 2 ] Crepuscular rays [ edit ] Main article: Crepuscular rays Crepuscular rays as seen from Taipei , Taiwan (2018) Crepuscular rays or god rays are sunbeams that originate when the sun is just below the horizon, during twilight hours.

[ 3 ] Crepuscular rays are noticeable when the contrast between light and dark is most obvious. Crepuscular comes from the Latin word "crepusculum", meaning twilight.

[ 4 ] Crepuscular rays usually appear orange because the path through the atmosphere at sunrise and sunset passes through up to 40 times as much air as rays from a high midday sun. Particles in the air scatter short wavelength light (blue and green) through Rayleigh scattering much more strongly than longer wavelength yellow and red light.

Loosely, the term "crepuscular rays" is sometimes extended to the general phenomenon of rays of sunlight that appear to converge at a point in the sky, irrespective of time of day.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Anticrepuscular rays [ edit ] Main article: Anticrepuscular rays These anticrepuscular rays appear to converge at the antisolar point , as viewed from an aircraft above the clouded ocean.

In some cases, sunbeams may extend across the sky and appear to converge at the antisolar point , the point on the celestial sphere opposite of the Sun's direction. In this case, they are called antisolar rays (anytime not during astronomical night) or anticrepuscular rays (during the twilight period).

[ 7 ] This apparent dual convergence (at both the solar and the antisolar points) is a perspective effect analogous to the apparent dual convergence of the parallel lines of a long straight road or hallway at directly opposite points (to an observer above the ground).
