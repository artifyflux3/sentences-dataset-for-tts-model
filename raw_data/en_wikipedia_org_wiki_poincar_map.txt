( November 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A two-dimensional Poincaré section of the forced Duffing equation In mathematics , particularly in dynamical systems , a first recurrence map or Poincaré map , named after Henri Poincaré , is the intersection of a periodic orbit in the state space of a continuous dynamical system with a certain lower-dimensional subspace, called the Poincaré section , transversal to the flow of the system. More precisely, one considers a periodic orbit with initial conditions within a section of the space, which leaves that section afterwards, and observes the point at which this orbit first returns to the section. One then creates a map to send the first point to the second, hence the name first recurrence map . The transversality of the Poincaré section means that periodic orbits starting on the subspace flow through it and not parallel to it.

A Poincaré map can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system with a state space that is one dimension smaller than the original continuous dynamical system. Because it preserves many properties of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the original system and has a lower-dimensional state space, it is often used for analyzing the original system in a simpler way.

[ citation needed ] In practice this is not always possible as there is no general method to construct a Poincaré map.

A Poincaré map differs from a recurrence plot in that space, not time, determines when to plot a point. For instance, the locus of the Moon when the Earth is at perihelion is a recurrence plot; the locus of the Moon when it passes through the plane perpendicular to the Earth's orbit and passing through the Sun and the Earth at perihelion is a Poincaré map.

[ citation needed ] It was used by Michel Hénon to study the motion of stars in a galaxy , because the path of a star projected onto a plane looks like a tangled mess, while the Poincaré map shows the structure more clearly.

Definition [ edit ] In the Poincaré section S , the Poincaré map P projects a point x onto the point P ( x ).

Let ( R , M , φ ) be a global dynamical system , with R the real numbers , M the phase space and φ the evolution function . Let γ be a periodic orbit through a point p and S be a local differentiable and transversal section of φ through p , called a Poincaré section through p .

Given an open and connected neighborhood U ⊂ ⊂ S {\displaystyle U\subset S} of p , a function P : U → → S {\displaystyle P:U\to S} is called Poincaré map for the orbit γ on the Poincaré section S through the point p if P ( p ) = p P ( U ) is a neighborhood of p and P : U → P ( U ) is a diffeomorphism for every point x in U , the positive semi-orbit of x intersects S for the first time at P ( x ) Example [ edit ] Consider the following system of differential equations in polar coordinates, ( θ θ , r ) ∈ ∈ S 1 × × R + {\displaystyle (\theta ,r)\in \mathbb {S} ^{1}\times \mathbb {R} ^{+}} : { θ θ ˙ ˙ = 1 r ˙ ˙ = ( 1 − − r 2 ) r {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\dot {\theta }}=1\\{\dot {r}}=(1-r^{2})r\end{cases}}} The flow of the system can be obtained by integrating the equation: for the θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } component we simply have θ θ ( t ) = θ θ 0 + t {\displaystyle \theta (t)=\theta _{0}+t} while for the r {\displaystyle r} component we need to separate the variables and integrate: ∫ ∫ 1 ( 1 − − r 2 ) r d r = ∫ ∫ d t ⟹ ⟹ log ⁡ ⁡ ( r 1 − − r 2 ) = t + c {\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{(1-r^{2})r}}dr=\int dt\Longrightarrow \log \left({\frac {r}{\sqrt {1-r^{2}}}}\right)=t+c} Inverting last expression gives r ( t ) = e 2 ( t + c ) 1 + e 2 ( t + c ) {\displaystyle r(t)={\sqrt {\frac {e^{2(t+c)}}{1+e^{2(t+c)}}}}} and since r ( 0 ) = e 2 c 1 + e 2 c {\displaystyle r(0)={\sqrt {\frac {e^{2c}}{1+e^{2c}}}}} we find r ( t ) = e 2 t r 0 2 1 + r 0 2 ( e 2 t − − 1 ) = 1 1 + e − − 2 t ( 1 r 0 2 − − 1 ) {\displaystyle r(t)={\sqrt {\frac {e^{2t}r_{0}^{2}}{1+r_{0}^{2}(e^{2t}-1)}}}={\sqrt {\frac {1}{1+e^{-2t}\left({\frac {1}{r_{0}^{2}}}-1\right)}}}} The flow of the system is therefore Φ Φ t ( θ θ , r ) = ( θ θ 0 + t , 1 1 + e − − 2 t ( 1 r 0 2 − − 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \Phi _{t}(\theta ,r)=\left(\theta _{0}+t,{\sqrt {\frac {1}{1+e^{-2t}\left({\frac {1}{r_{0}^{2}}}-1\right)}}}\right)} The behaviour of the flow is the following: The angle θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } increases monotonically and at constant rate.

The radius r {\displaystyle r} tends to the equilibrium r ¯ ¯ = 1 {\displaystyle {\bar {r}}=1} for every value.

Therefore, the solution with initial data ( θ θ 0 , r 0 ≠ ≠ 1 ) {\displaystyle (\theta _{0},r_{0}\neq 1)} draws a spiral that tends towards the radius 1 circle.

We can take as Poincaré section for this flow the positive horizontal axis, namely Σ Σ = { ( θ θ , r ) : θ θ = 0 } {\displaystyle \Sigma =\{(\theta ,r)\ :\ \theta =0\}} : obviously we can use r {\displaystyle r} as coordinate on the section. Every point in Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } returns to the section after a time t = 2 π π {\displaystyle t=2\pi } (this can be understood by looking at the evolution of the angle): we can take as Poincaré map the restriction of Φ Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } to the section Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } computed at the time 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } , Φ Φ 2 π π | Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Phi _{2\pi }|_{\Sigma }} .
The Poincaré map is therefore : Ψ Ψ ( r ) = 1 1 + e − − 4 π π ( 1 r 2 − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \Psi (r)={\sqrt {\frac {1}{1+e^{-4\pi }\left({\frac {1}{r^{2}}}-1\right)}}}} The behaviour of the orbits of the discrete dynamical system ( Σ Σ , Z , Ψ Ψ ) {\displaystyle (\Sigma ,\mathbb {Z} ,\Psi )} is the following: The point r = 1 {\displaystyle r=1} is fixed, so Ψ Ψ n ( 1 ) = 1 {\displaystyle \Psi ^{n}(1)=1} for every n {\displaystyle n} .

Every other point tends monotonically to the equilibrium, Ψ Ψ n ( z ) → → 1 {\displaystyle \Psi ^{n}(z)\to 1} for n → → ± ± ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle n\to \pm \infty } .

Poincaré maps and stability analysis [ edit ] Poincaré maps can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system . The stability of a periodic orbit of the original system is closely related to the stability of the fixed point of the corresponding Poincaré map.

Let ( R , M , φ ) be a differentiable dynamical system with periodic orbit γ through p . Let P : U → → S {\displaystyle P:U\to S} be the corresponding Poincaré map through p . We define P 0 := id U {\displaystyle P^{0}:=\operatorname {id} _{U}} P n + 1 := P ∘ ∘ P n {\displaystyle P^{n+1}:=P\circ P^{n}} P − − n − − 1 := P − − 1 ∘ ∘ P − − n {\displaystyle P^{-n-1}:=P^{-1}\circ P^{-n}} and P ( n , x ) := P n ( x ) {\displaystyle P(n,x):=P^{n}(x)} then ( Z , U , P ) is a discrete dynamical system with state space U and evolution function P : Z × × U → → U .

{\displaystyle P:\mathbb {Z} \times U\to U.} Per definition this system has a fixed point at p .

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is stable if and only if the fixed point p of the discrete dynamical system is stable.

The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is asymptotically stable if and only if the fixed point p of the discrete dynamical system is asymptotically stable.
