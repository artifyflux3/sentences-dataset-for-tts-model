A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body bounded below by a core and above by a crust . Mantles are made of rock or ices , and are generally the largest and most massive layer of the planetary body. Mantles are characteristic of planetary bodies that have undergone differentiation by density .  All terrestrial planets (including Earth ), half of the giant planets , specifically ice giants , a number of asteroids , and some planetary moons have mantles.

Examples Earth The internal structure of Earth Main article: Earth's mantle The Earth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core . Its mass of 4.01 × 10 24 kg is 67% the mass of the Earth.

[ 1 ] It has a thickness of 2,900 kilometres (1,800 mi) [ 1 ] making up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is predominantly solid, but in geological time it behaves as a viscous fluid .

Partial melting of the mantle at mid-ocean ridges produces oceanic crust , and partial melting of the mantle at subduction zones produces continental crust .

[ 2 ] Other planets Mercury has a silicate mantle approximately 490 kilometers (300 miles) thick, constituting only 28% of its mass.

[ 1 ] Venus 's silicate mantle is approximately 2,800 kilometers (1,700 miles) thick, constituting around 70% of its mass.

[ 1 ] Mars 's silicate mantle is approximately 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) thick, constituting ~74–88% of its mass, [ 1 ] and may be represented by chassignite meteorites.

Uranus and Neptune 's ice mantles are approximately 30,000 km thick, composing 80% of both masses.

[ 3 ] Moons Jupiter 's moons Io , Europa , and Ganymede have silicate mantles; Io's ~1,100 kilometers (680 miles) silicate mantle is overlain by a volcanic crust, Ganymede's ~1,315 kilometers (817 miles) thick silicate mantle is overlain by ~835 kilometers (519 miles) of ice, and Europa's ~1,165 kilometers (724 miles) km silicate mantle is overlain by ~85 kilometers (53 miles) of ice and possibly liquid water.

[ 1 ] The silicate mantle of the Earth's moon is approximately 1300–1400 km thick, and is the source of mare basalts .

[ 4 ] The lunar mantle might be exposed in the South Pole-Aitken basin or the Crisium basin .

[ 4 ] The lunar mantle contains a seismic discontinuity at ~500 kilometers (310 miles) depth, most likely related to a change in composition.

[ 4 ] Titan and Triton each have a mantle made of ice or other solid volatile substances.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Asteroids See also: 4 Vesta § Geology Some of the largest asteroids have mantles; [ 7 ] for example, Vesta has a silicate mantle similar in composition to diogenite meteorites.
