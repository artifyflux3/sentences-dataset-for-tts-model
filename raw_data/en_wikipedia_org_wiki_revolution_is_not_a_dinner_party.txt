Revolution is not a dinner party Initiator Mao Zedong Origin Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan [ 1 ] Revolution is not a dinner party Simplified Chinese 革命不是请客吃饭 Traditional Chinese 革命 不是 請客 吃飯 Literal meaning revolution is not having guests to eat a meal Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin Gémìng bùshì qǐngkè chīfàn Wade–Giles Ko-ming pu-shih ch'ing-k'o ch’ih-fan Revolution is not a dinner party , [ 2 ] or making revolution is not inviting people over for dinner , [ 3 ] is a phrase coined by Mao Zedong .

[ 4 ] It is taken from Mao's essay titled Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan written in 1927 during the Land Revolution.

[ 5 ] It means that a revolution cannot be gentle and soft, but determined and thorough, and it is a violent and bloody action of one class overthrowing another.

[ 6 ] In this report, Mao stated that "A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another." [ 7 ] Based on this view, historian Zhang Ming further pointed out that "a revolution is not a dinner party, a revolution is a petition to eat".

[ 8 ] The saying is also the basis of a political joke: "for many cadres Geming bushi qingke jiushi chifan 'Revolution is not entertaining guests, just eating dinner [at public expense or at the cost of the nouveaux riches]."
