This form of model is also well-suited for modelling objects with complex material behavior such as those with nonlinearity or viscoelasticity .

As well as engineering simulation, these systems have applications in computer graphics and computer animation .

[ 1 ] Derivation (Single Mass) [ edit ] Deriving the equations of motion for this model is usually done by summing the forces on the mass (including any applied external forces F external ) {\displaystyle F_{\text{external}})} : Σ Σ F = − − k x − − c x ˙ ˙ + F external = m x ¨ ¨ {\displaystyle \Sigma F=-kx-c{\dot {x}}+F_{\text{external}}=m{\ddot {x}}} By rearranging this equation, we can derive the standard form: x ¨ ¨ + 2 ζ ζ ω ω n x ˙ ˙ + ω ω n 2 x = u {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+2\zeta \omega _{n}{\dot {x}}+\omega _{n}^{2}x=u} where ω ω n = k m ; ζ ζ = c 2 m ω ω n ; u = F external m {\displaystyle \omega _{n}={\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}};\quad \zeta ={\frac {c}{2m\omega _{n}}};\quad u={\frac {F_{\text{external}}}{m}}} ω ω n {\displaystyle \omega _{n}} is the undamped natural frequency and ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } is the damping ratio . The homogeneous equation for the mass spring system is: x ¨ ¨ + 2 ζ ζ ω ω n x ˙ ˙ + ω ω n 2 x = 0 {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+2\zeta \omega _{n}{\dot {x}}+\omega _{n}^{2}x=0} This has the solution: x = A e − − ω ω n t ( ζ ζ + ζ ζ 2 − − 1 ) + B e − − ω ω n t ( ζ ζ − − ζ ζ 2 − − 1 ) {\displaystyle x=Ae^{-\omega _{n}t\left(\zeta +{\sqrt {\zeta ^{2}-1}}\right)}+Be^{-\omega _{n}t\left(\zeta -{\sqrt {\zeta ^{2}-1}}\right)}} If ζ ζ < 1 {\displaystyle \zeta <1} then ζ ζ 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle \zeta ^{2}-1} is negative, meaning the square root will be imaginary and therefore the solution will have an oscillatory component.
