For example, if X is a finite-dimensional vector space , then the automorphism group of X is the group of invertible linear transformations from X to itself (the general linear group of X ).  If instead X is a group, then its automorphism group Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (X)} is the group consisting of all group automorphisms of X .

Especially in geometric contexts, an automorphism group is also called a symmetry group . A subgroup of an automorphism group is sometimes called a transformation group .

Automorphism groups are studied in a general way in the field of category theory .

Examples [ edit ] If X is a set with no additional structure, then any bijection from X to itself is an automorphism, and hence the automorphism group of X in this case is precisely the symmetric group of X .  If the set X has additional structure, then it may be the case that not all bijections on the set preserve this structure, in which case the automorphism group will be a subgroup of the symmetric group on X .  Some examples of this include the following: The automorphism group of a field extension L / K {\displaystyle L/K} is the group consisting of field automorphisms of L that fix K . If the field extension is Galois , the automorphism group is called the Galois group of the field extension.

The automorphism group of the projective n -space over a field k is the projective linear group PGL n ⁡ ⁡ ( k ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {PGL} _{n}(k).} [ 1 ] The automorphism group G {\displaystyle G} of a finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to ( Z / n Z ) × × {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} )^{\times }} , the multiplicative group of integers modulo n , with the isomorphism given by a ¯ ¯ ↦ ↦ σ σ a ∈ ∈ G , σ σ a ( x ) = x a {\displaystyle {\overline {a}}\mapsto \sigma _{a}\in G,\,\sigma _{a}(x)=x^{a}} .

[ 2 ] In particular, G {\displaystyle G} is an abelian group .

The automorphism group of a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} has the structure of a (real) Lie group (in fact, it is even a linear algebraic group : see below ). If G is a Lie group with Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , then the automorphism group of G has a structure of a Lie group induced from that on the automorphism group of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ a ] If G is a group acting on a set X , the action amounts to a group homomorphism from G to the automorphism group of X and conversely.  Indeed, each left G -action on a set X determines G → → Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) , g ↦ ↦ σ σ g , σ σ g ( x ) = g ⋅ ⋅ x {\displaystyle G\to \operatorname {Aut} (X),\,g\mapsto \sigma _{g},\,\sigma _{g}(x)=g\cdot x} , and, conversely, each homomorphism φ φ : G → → Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( X ) {\displaystyle \varphi :G\to \operatorname {Aut} (X)} defines an action by g ⋅ ⋅ x = φ φ ( g ) x {\displaystyle g\cdot x=\varphi (g)x} .  This extends to the case when the set X has more structure than just a set.  For example, if X is a vector space, then a group action of G on X is a group representation of the group G , representing G as a group of linear transformations (automorphisms) of X ; these representations are the main object of study in the field of representation theory .

Here are some other facts about automorphism groups: Let A , B {\displaystyle A,B} be two finite sets of the same cardinality and Iso ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Iso} (A,B)} the set of all bijections A → → ∼ ∼ B {\displaystyle A\mathrel {\overset {\sim }{\to }} B} . Then Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (B)} , which is a symmetric group (see above), acts on Iso ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Iso} (A,B)} from the left freely and transitively ; that is to say, Iso ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Iso} (A,B)} is a torsor for Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (B)} (cf.

#In category theory ).

Let P be a finitely generated projective module over a ring R . Then there is an embedding Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( P ) ↪ ↪ GL n ⁡ ⁡ ( R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (P)\hookrightarrow \operatorname {GL} _{n}(R)} , unique up to inner automorphisms .

[ 5 ] In category theory [ edit ] Automorphism groups appear very naturally in category theory .

If X is an object in a category, then the automorphism group of X is the group consisting of all the invertible morphisms from X to itself. It is the unit group of the endomorphism monoid of X . (For some examples, see PROP .) If A , B {\displaystyle A,B} are objects in some category, then the set Iso ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Iso} (A,B)} of all A → → ∼ ∼ B {\displaystyle A\mathrel {\overset {\sim }{\to }} B} is a left Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (B)} - torsor . In practical terms, this says that a different choice of a base point of Iso ⁡ ⁡ ( A , B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Iso} (A,B)} differs unambiguously by an element of Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (B)} , or that each choice of a base point is precisely a choice of a trivialization of the torsor.

If X 1 {\displaystyle X_{1}} and X 2 {\displaystyle X_{2}} are objects in categories C 1 {\displaystyle C_{1}} and C 2 {\displaystyle C_{2}} , and if F : C 1 → → C 2 {\displaystyle F:C_{1}\to C_{2}} is a functor mapping X 1 {\displaystyle X_{1}} to X 2 {\displaystyle X_{2}} , then F {\displaystyle F} induces a group homomorphism Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( X 1 ) → → Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( X 2 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (X_{1})\to \operatorname {Aut} (X_{2})} , as it maps invertible morphisms to invertible morphisms.

In particular, if G is a group viewed as a category with a single object * or, more generally, if G is a groupoid, then each functor F : G → → C {\displaystyle F:G\to C} , C a category, is called an action or a representation of G on the object F ( ∗ ∗ ) {\displaystyle F(*)} , or the objects F ( Obj ⁡ ⁡ ( G ) ) {\displaystyle F(\operatorname {Obj} (G))} . Those objects are then said to be G {\displaystyle G} -objects (as they are acted by G {\displaystyle G} ); cf.

S {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} } -object . If C {\displaystyle C} is a module category like the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then G {\displaystyle G} -objects are also called G {\displaystyle G} -modules.

Automorphism group functor [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field k that is equipped with some algebraic structure (that is, M is a finite-dimensional algebra over k ). It can be, for example, an associative algebra or a Lie algebra .

Now, consider k - linear maps M → → M {\displaystyle M\to M} that preserve the algebraic structure: they form a vector subspace End alg ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\text{alg}}(M)} of End ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} (M)} . The unit group of End alg ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\text{alg}}(M)} is the automorphism group Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (M)} . When a basis on M is chosen, End ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} (M)} is the space of square matrices and End alg ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\text{alg}}(M)} is the zero set of some polynomial equations , and the invertibility is again described by polynomials. Hence, Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (M)} is a linear algebraic group over k .

Now base extensions applied to the above discussion determines a functor: [ 6 ] namely, for each commutative ring R over k , consider the R -linear maps M ⊗ ⊗ R → → M ⊗ ⊗ R {\displaystyle M\otimes R\to M\otimes R} preserving the algebraic structure: denote it by End alg ⁡ ⁡ ( M ⊗ ⊗ R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\text{alg}}(M\otimes R)} . Then the unit group of the matrix ring End alg ⁡ ⁡ ( M ⊗ ⊗ R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} _{\text{alg}}(M\otimes R)} over R is the automorphism group Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( M ⊗ ⊗ R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (M\otimes R)} and R ↦ ↦ Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( M ⊗ ⊗ R ) {\displaystyle R\mapsto \operatorname {Aut} (M\otimes R)} is a group functor : a functor from the category of commutative rings over k to the category of groups . Even better, it is represented by a scheme (since the automorphism groups are defined by polynomials): this scheme is called the automorphism group scheme and is denoted by Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (M)} .

In general, however, an automorphism group functor may not be represented by a scheme.

See also [ edit ] Outer automorphism group Level structure , a technique to remove an automorphism group Holonomy group Notes [ edit ] ^ First, if G is simply connected, the automorphism group of G is that of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} . Second, every connected Lie group is of the form G ~ ~ / C {\displaystyle {\widetilde {G}}/C} where G ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\widetilde {G}}} is a simply connected Lie group and C is a central subgroup and the automorphism group of G is the automorphism group of G {\displaystyle G} that preserves C . Third, by convention, a Lie group is second countable and has at most coutably many connected components; thus, the general case reduces to the connected case.
