It is usually built within a fire station facility for routine exercises and training.

[ 1 ] The drill tower is  typically a multi-level structure simulating high-rise buildings. Heights vary by location.

Towers can help firefighters deal with real-life situations, including running upstairs with heavy equipment, using rope and safety nets , and operating a fire engine in a confined space.
