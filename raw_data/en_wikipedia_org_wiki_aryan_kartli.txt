Overview [ edit ] The Georgian Chronicles relate the apocryphal story of Alexander the Great 's campaign into inner Georgia. Alexander reportedly brought Azoy (Azo), the son of the unnamed "king of Aryan-Kartli", together with followers, to Mtskheta , principal city of Kartli, and charged him with the administration of Kartli in his absence. The 11th-century Georgian monk Arsen, the author of metaphrastical reduction of "The life of St. Nino " and tutor of King David IV of Georgia , comments on this passage: "We, Georgians, are descendants of the newcomers from Aryan-Kartli, we speak their language and all the kings of Kartli are descendants of their kings".

[ 2 ] Classical sources scholars have inferred that this land lay within the orbit of the Achaemenid Persian Empire .

Herodotus ' list of the Achaemenid provinces , which places the proto-Georgian tribes within the 13th and 19th satrapies , is significant in this regard.

[ 3 ] These territories partially correspond to the historical Georgian southwest where a number of Georgian scholars, notably Giorgi Melikishvili , tend to place Aryan Kartli.

According to the modern historian Stephen H. Rapp , risen in the last phase of the Achaemenid Empire, Aryan Kartli was the first known autonomous kingdom in eastern Georgia.

[ 1 ] Even though prior to Aryan Kartli there had been small political entities in the western area's of Georgia, closer to the Black Sea (such as Egrisi/Colchis), it would be the polities to the east of the Surami Pass that "came to embody Georgian political life".

[ 1 ] Little is known about Aryan Kartli, however, according to Rapp, it appears to have been an "Achaemenid client on the northern fringe of Iranian domains".

[ 1 ] Rapp notes that Aryan Kartli "may well be associated with a remarkable palace built according to Achaemenid styles and techniques" at Gumbat'i in Kakheti in eastern Georgia.

[ 1 ] However, other locations have been proposed as well for Aryan Kartli, including to the southwest of Kartli, in the Armeno-Kartvelian marchlands.

[ 1 ] The early Georgian kingdom of Kartli/Iberia, which clearly emerges in historical accounts of Hellenistic period, seems to have shared the Iranian bonds of Aryan Kartli.

[ 3 ] Cyril Toumanoff equates the region with the Aranē ( Greek : 'Αράνη ) of Ptolemy (V.6.18) and the Harrana of the Hittites .
