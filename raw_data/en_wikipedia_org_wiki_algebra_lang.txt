( August 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Algebra First edition Author Serge Lang Language English Series Addison-Wesley Series in Mathematics Subject Algebra Genre Textbook Publisher Addison-Wesley Publication date 1965 Pages 508 Algebra is a graduate level textbook on Algebra written by Serge Lang , originally published by Addison-Wesley in 1965.

Serge Lang was awarded the Steele Prize for exposition in 1999, the citation stating that Algebra is among his most famous texts.

[ 1 ] The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) strongly recommends undergraduate mathematics libraries have a copy of Algebra available.

[ 2 ] Topics [ edit ] The third edition is divided into four parts.

[ 3 ] The first part, The Basic Objects of Algebra , covers groups , rings , modules , and polynomials . The second part, Algebraic Equations , focuses on field theory and includes a chapter on Noetherian rings and modules . The third part, Linear Algebra and Representations , contains chapters on the tensor product of modules and semi-simplicity . The final part, Homological Algebra , covers general homology theory and finite free resolutions .

Audience and reception [ edit ] The book was designed by Lang to be intended for a one year graduate level course and for readers who have previously studied algebra at an undergraduate level.

[ 3 ] The book in its latest third edition lists over 10,000 citations on Google Scholar and has been noted as a common reference material for papers in algebra.

[ 4 ] Algebra received praise from mathematicians Gerry Leversha and Gerry Brandstein in The Mathematical Gazette in its 1967 and 2003 issues respectively.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Professor George Bergman of Berkeley wrote Companion to Lang's Algebra , a 222 page book of notes combined into a collection when teaching Berkeley’s basic graduate algebra course from Lang’s book.
