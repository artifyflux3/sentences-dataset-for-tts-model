Flora Sinensis is one of the first European natural history books about China, published in Vienna in 1656.

[ 1 ] Its author, Michał Boym , was a Jesuit missionary from Poland (then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ).

[ 2 ] Focus on the ecosystem of the Far East [ edit ] The book was the first description of an ecosystem of the Far East published in Europe . Boym underlined the medicinal properties of the Chinese plants.

Seeking patronage by the Shunzhi Emperor and Leopold I, King of Hungary [ edit ] The book also included pleas for support of the Catholic Church to the Shunzhi Emperor , the Chinese emperor at the time; each page contained a chronogram pointing to the date of 1655, the date of coronation of Emperor Leopold I as the King of Hungary , as Boym wanted to gain the support of that monarch for his mission.
