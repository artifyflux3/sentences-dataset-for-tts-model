Plot [ edit ] Gus Matthews, Richie Goodman, and Clark Reedy are adult " nerds " who spent their childhoods wishing to play baseball, but never got the chance. One day, Gus and Clark witness overweight, timid Nelson Carmichael and his friends being bullied and kicked off a baseball diamond by a local little league team led by Troy and Kyle, so they chase them away. When Gus and Clark go with Richie to the field to play a game, the bullies return, demanding they leave, but Gus challenges them to play for the field. Despite Richie and Clark's terrible ballplaying, the trio win the game due to Gus' surprising capability. The trio are soon befriended by Nelson's billionaire father Mel, during an altercation with Richie and Clark's childhood bully/Troy's uncle Jerry, and Gus defends them. Later, Brad, another childhood bully, challenges them to another game, and the trio wins again.

Later, Mel feels inspired to hold a statewide little league round-robin, including their team, where the winners will get access to a new multimillion-dollar baseball park built by Mel, and the trio join the tournament as the 'Benchwarmers'. As the tournament advances, the Benchwarmers win every game, with Clark and Richie gradually improving, and the team becomes popular among many nerds, athletically-challenged children, and the general public, while Jerry and his fellow little league coaches Brad, Karl, and Wayne conspire together to defeat the Benchwarmers. Richie's brother Howie, who suffers from agoraphobia and has not left home for months, eventually joins the team, while Gus' baby-obsessed wife Liz becomes annoyed that Gus keeps putting off her ovulating schedule.

At the semi-final , the desperate competing team's coach Wayne inserts 30-year-old Dominican ringer Carlos, a professional baseball player. Despite Carlos clearly being an adult and having a falsified birth certificate written in crayon , Wayne bribes the home plate umpire to successfully get Carlos onto his team. The impact is immediate as Carlos's superb pitching and hitting get Wayne's team back in the game. However, the Benchwarmers, quickly seeing Carlos is a recovering alcoholic , give him copious amounts of alcohol. Gus manages to tie the game, and then Carlos stomps on his wrist, making pitching difficult. After a bunt from Gus, the Benchwarmers load the bases for the first time, leading to Howie's first at-bat being the only Benchwarmer on-deck . Howie is hit by a pitch due to Carlos' intoxication, which drives in the game-winning run for the Benchwarmers.

After their victory, Brad and Karl discover evidence from fellow poker player Steven that Gus was a bully himself as a child, known for using name calling instead of physical intimidation , and had severely bullied one boy named Marcus so much that he was institutionalised. Taking advantage, the bullies expose Gus' secret to the public, causing Gus to be ostracized by the team, leading to his quitting. When Liz hears, she realizes Gus had been avoiding their attempt to start a family, as he fears his kids would suffer bullying growing up, as a form of karma punishing him. Liz encourages him to apologize to Marcus, which Gus does sincerely just before the final game.

On the day of the big game against Jerry's baseball team at Mel's newly-built stadium, Marcus publicly forgives Gus, and Gus re-joins the team, announcing that Marcus is the Benchwarmers' new third-base coach. In the final game, the trio rearrange the team, so Nelson and other non-athletic children replace them, so they have a chance to participate. In the final inning, the Benchwarmers are losing, but Jerry's team sees the Benchwarmers are having fun playing anyway. Realizing the true spirit of the game and the fact that Jerry is going too far, Troy and Kyle decide to throw the shut-out and let Nelson hit the ball, giving him the one point. The Benchwarmers storm the field, celebrating not being shut out , and a furious Jerry is humiliated by being left hanging by his underwear on a fence after getting a wedgie by Gus, Richie, Clark, Howie and Mel.

The entire Benchwarmers team, along with Jerry's players, Marcus, Brad's speedo friend, and even Carlos and Wayne, celebrate at Pizza Hut. Richie and Clark get girlfriends, Howie informs Wayne that he has overcome his heliophobia (though is still afraid of the moon), and Gus announces he is going to become a father.
