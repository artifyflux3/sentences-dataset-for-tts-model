The sea stretches to the north of the island of Crete , east of the islands of Kythera and Antikythera , south of the Cyclades , and west of the Dodecanese islands of Rhodes , Karpathos and Kassos . The bounding sea to the west is the Ionian Sea . To the northwest is the Myrtoan Sea , a subdivision of the Mediterranean Sea that lies between the Cyclades and Peloponnese . To the east-southeast is the rest of the Mediterranean Sea , sometimes credited as the Levantine Sea . Across the island of Crete , to the opposite shore of it begins the Libyan Sea . Ferry routes to and from Piraeus and Heraklion , as well as the southern islands of the Aegean and the Dodecanese, run in this area.

Just off the coastline of Northeastern Crete, the sea reaches a maximum depth of near 3,293 m (10,000 ft).

[ citation needed ] Other sources (maps) show a maximum depth of 2,591 m (8,500 ft).
