The year 2005 was named the World Year of Physics , also known as Einstein Year , in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein 's " Miracle Year ", in which he published four landmark papers, and the subsequent advances in the field of physics .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Physics has been the basis for understanding the physical world and nature as a whole. The applications of physics are the basis for much of today's technology. In order to both raise worldwide awareness of physics and celebrate the major advances made in the field, the World Congress of Physical Societies proposed [ 2 ] and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics resolved that 2005 should be commemorated as the World Year of Physics. This was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO .

[ 2 ] Selected celebrations [ edit ] The mass–energy equivalence formula displayed on Taipei 101 in celebration of World Year of Physics 2005 The World Year of Physics officially began with a conference held in mid-January in Paris, titled Physics for Tomorrow .
