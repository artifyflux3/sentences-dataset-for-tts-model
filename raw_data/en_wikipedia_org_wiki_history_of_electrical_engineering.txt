Ancient developments
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_electrical_engineering&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Ancient developments")]

Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from [electric fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_fish "Electric fish"). [Ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the "Thunderer of the [Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile "Nile")", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") and [Arabic naturalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Science in the medieval Islamic world") and [physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_medicine "Islamic medicine").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-1) Several ancient writers, such as [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") and [Scribonius Largus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribonius_Largus "Scribonius Largus"), attested to the numbing effect of [electric shocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock "Electric shock") delivered by [electric catfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_catfish "Electric catfish") and [electric rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_ray "Electric ray"), and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Electroreception-2) Patients with ailments such as [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout "Gout") or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-morris-3) Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the [Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"), who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning _ra‘ad_ (رعد‎) applied to the [electric ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_ray "Electric ray").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-EncyclopediaAmericana-4)

Ancient cultures around the [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") knew that certain objects, such as rods of [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber "Amber"), could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. [Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus "Thales of Miletus"), an ancient Greek philosopher, writing at around 600 BCE, described a form of [static electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity "Static electricity"), noting that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber "Amber"), would cause a particular attraction between the two. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get a [spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge "Electrostatic discharge") to jump.

At around 450 BCE [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus"), a later Greek philosopher, developed an [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory") that was similar to modern atomic theory. His mentor, Leucippus, is credited with this same theory. The hypothesis of Leucippus and Democritus held everything to be composed of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms"). But these _atoms_, called "atomos", were indivisible, and indestructible. He presciently stated that between atoms lies empty space, and that atoms are constantly in motion. He was incorrect only in stating that atoms come in different sizes and shapes, and that each object had its own shaped and sized atom.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-russel1-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Barnes1-6)

An object found in [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq") in 1938, dated to about 250 BCE and called the [Baghdad Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery "Baghdad Battery"), resembles a [galvanic cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell "Galvanic cell") and is claimed by some to have been used for [electroplating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating "Electroplating") in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), although there is no evidence for this.

17th-century developments
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_electrical_engineering&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: 17th-century developments")]

Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia. In 1600, the English scientist, [William Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer) "William Gilbert (astronomer)") extended the study of Cardano on electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the [lodestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone") effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-stewart-7) He coined the [Neo-Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Latin "Neo-Latin") word _electricus_ ("of amber" or "like amber", from _ήλεκτρον_ [_elektron_], the Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-8) This association gave rise to the English words "electric" and "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in [Thomas Browne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Browne "Thomas Browne")'s _[Pseudodoxia Epidemica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudodoxia\_Epidemica "Pseudodoxia Epidemica")_ of 1646.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-9)

Further work was conducted by [Otto von Guericke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Guericke "Otto von Guericke") who showed electrostatic repulsion. [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle") also published work.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-10)

18th-century developments
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_electrical_engineering&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 18th-century developments")]

Though electrical phenomena had been known for centuries, in the 18th century, the systematic study of electricity became known as "the youngest of the sciences", and the public became electrified by the newest discoveries in the field.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-11)

By 1705, [Francis Hauksbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hauksbee "Francis Hauksbee") had discovered that if he placed a small amount of mercury in the glass of his modified version of [Otto von Guericke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Guericke "Otto von Guericke")'s generator, evacuated the air from it to create a mild vacuum and rubbed the ball to build up a charge, a glow was visible if he placed his hand on the outside of the ball. This glow was bright enough to read by. It seemed to be similar to [St. Elmo's Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_Fire "St. Elmo's Fire"). This effect later became the basis of the [gas-discharge lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp "Gas-discharge lamp"), which led to [neon lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_lighting "Neon lighting") and [mercury vapor lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-vapor_lamp "Mercury-vapor lamp"). In 1706 he produced an 'Influence machine' to generate this effect.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-12) He was elected a [Fellow of the Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society "Fellow of the Royal Society") the same year.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-13)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Joseph_Siffrein_Duplessis_-_Benjamin_Franklin_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-Joseph_Siffrein_Duplessis_-_Benjamin_Franklin_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Joseph_Siffrein_Duplessis_-_Benjamin_Franklin_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

[Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin")

Hauksbee continued to experiment with electricity, making numerous observations and developing machines to generate and demonstrate various electrical phenomena. In 1709 he published _Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects_ which summarized much of his scientific work.

[Stephen Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gray_(scientist) "Stephen Gray (scientist)") discovered the importance of insulators and conductors. [C. F. du Fay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._du_Fay "C. F. du Fay") seeing his work, developed a "two-fluid" theory of electricity. [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-10)

In the 18th century, [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin") conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-14) A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") was indeed electrical in nature.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-15) He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the [Leyden jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar "Leyden jar") as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge, by coming up with the single fluid, two states theory of electricity.

In 1791, Italian [Luigi Galvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani "Luigi Galvani") published his discovery of [bioelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectricity "Bioelectricity"), demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which [nerve cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_cell "Nerve cell") passed signals to the muscles.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-guarnieri_7-1-10)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-guarnieri_7-2-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-kirby-17)[Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "Alessandro Volta")'s battery, or [voltaic pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile "Voltaic pile"), of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the [electrostatic machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_machine "Electrostatic machine") previously used.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-guarnieri_7-2-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-kirby-17)

19th-century developments
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_electrical_engineering&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 19th-century developments")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Simple_electromagnet2.gif/250px-Simple_electromagnet2.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_electromagnet2.gif)

A simple electromagnet, consisting of an insulated wire wound around an iron core. An electric current passing through the wire creates a [Magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), with a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other

The first application of electricity that was put to practical use was [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-18)[William Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sturgeon "William Sturgeon") invented the [electromagnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet "Electromagnet") in 1825.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-19) Electromagnets were then used in the first practical engineering application of electricity by [William Fothergill Cooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke "William Fothergill Cooke") and [Charles Wheatstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone "Charles Wheatstone") who co-developed a [telegraph system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooke_and_Wheatstone_telegraph "Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph") that used a number of needles on a board which were moved to point to letters of the alphabet. A five needle system was used initially, but was given up as too expensive. In 1838 an improvement reduced the number of needles to two, and a patent for this version was taken out by Cooke and Wheatstone.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurnley1887102%E2%80%93103-20) Cooke tested the invention, with the [London & Blackwall Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_%26_Blackwall_Railway "London & Blackwall Railway"), the [London & Birmingham Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_%26_Birmingham_Railway "London & Birmingham Railway"), and the [Great Western Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway "Great Western Railway") companies, successively allowing the use of their lines for the experiment. Subsequently, railways developed systems with signal boxes along the line communicating with their neighbouring boxes by telegraphic sounding of [single-stroke bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bell#Single-stroke_bells "Electric bell") and three-position [needle telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_telegraph "Needle telegraph") instruments. Such systems implementing [signalling block systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_block_system "Signalling block system") remained in use on rural lines well into the 21st century.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-21)

Sir Francis Ronalds

Electrical engineering became a profession in the late 19th century. Practitioners had created a global [electric telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_telegraph "Electric telegraph") network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and US. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [Francis Ronalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ronalds "Francis Ronalds") stands ahead of the field, who created a working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-23) Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the [Institution of Electrical Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Electrical_Engineers "Institution of Electrical Engineers")) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-24) The donation of his extensive electrical library was a considerable boon for the fledgling Society.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg/250px-M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg)

Michael Faraday portrayed by [Thomas Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Phillips "Thomas Phillips") c. 1841–1842[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-25)

Development of the scientific basis for electrical engineering, using research techniques, intensified during the 19th century. Notable developments early in this century include the work of [Georg Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "Georg Ohm"), who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") and [potential difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_difference "Potential difference") in a conductor, [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday"), the discoverer of [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") in 1831.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-26) In the 1830s, Georg Ohm also constructed an early electrostatic machine. The [homopolar generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_generator "Homopolar generator") was developed first by [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") during his memorable experiments in 1831. It was the beginning of modern dynamos – that is, electrical generators which operate using a magnetic field. The invention of the industrial [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator "Electric generator") in 1866 by [Werner von Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_von_Siemens "Werner von Siemens") – which did not need external magnetic power – made a large series of other inventions possible.

In 1873, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") published a unified treatment of electricity and [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism") in [A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_on_Electricity_and_Magnetism "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism") which stimulated several theorists to think in terms of [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)") described by [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"). In 1878, the British inventor [James Wimshurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wimshurst "James Wimshurst") developed an apparatus that had two glass disks mounted on two shafts. It was not until 1883 that the [Wimshurst machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimshurst_machine "Wimshurst machine") was more fully reported to the scientific community.

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Thomas_Edison%2C_1878.jpg/250px-Thomas_Edison%2C_1878.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Edison,_1878.jpg)

[Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison "Thomas Edison") built the world's first large-scale electrical supply network

During the latter part of the 1800s, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). It was not until the late 19th century that universities started to offer degrees in electrical engineering. In 1882, [Darmstadt University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt_University_of_Technology "Darmstadt University of Technology") founded the first chair and the first faculty of electrical engineering worldwide. In the same year, under Professor Charles Cross, the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") began offering the first option of Electrical Engineering within a physics department.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-27) In 1883, [Darmstadt University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt_University_of_Technology "Darmstadt University of Technology") and [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") introduced the world's first courses of study in electrical engineering and in 1885 the [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London") founded the first chair of electrical engineering in the United Kingdom. The [University of Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri "University of Missouri") subsequently established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-28)

During this period commercial use of electricity increased dramatically. Starting in the late 1870s cities started installing large scale electric street lighting systems based on [arc lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_lamp "Arc lamp").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-29) After the development of a practical [incandescent lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_lamp "Incandescent lamp") for indoor lighting, [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison "Thomas Edison") switched on the world's first public electric supply utility in 1882, using what was considered a relatively safe 110 volts [direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current") system to supply customers. Engineering advances in the 1880s, including the invention of the [transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer "Transformer"), led to electric utilities starting to adopting [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current"), up until then used primarily in arc lighting systems, as a distribution standard for outdoor and indoor lighting (eventually replacing direct current for such purposes). In the US there was a rivalry, primarily between a Westinghouse AC and the Edison DC system known as the "[war of the currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents "War of the currents")".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-30)

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/George_Westinghouse.jpg/250px-George_Westinghouse.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Westinghouse.jpg)

[George Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Westinghouse "George Westinghouse"), American entrepreneur and engineer, financially backed the development of a practical AC power network.

"By the mid-1890s the four "Maxwell equations" were recognized as the foundation of one of the strongest and most successful theories in all of physics; they had taken their place as companions, even rivals, to Newton's laws of mechanics. The equations were by then also being put to practical use, most dramatically in the emerging new technology of radio communications, but also in the telegraph, telephone, and electric power industries."[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-31) By the end of the 19th century, figures in the progress of electrical engineering were beginning to emerge.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-32)

[Charles Proteus Steinmetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz "Charles Proteus Steinmetz") helped foster the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers.

[Charles Proteus Steinmetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz "Charles Proteus Steinmetz") circa 1915

During the [development of radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_radio "Invention of radio"), many scientists and inventors contributed to [radio technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") and electronics. In his classic [UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency "Ultra high frequency") experiments of 1888, [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves ([radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves")) leading many inventors and scientists to try to adapt them to commercial applications, such as [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi "Guglielmo Marconi") (1895) and [Alexander Popov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Popov_(physicist) "Alexander Popov (physicist)") (1896).

[Millimetre wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre_wave "Millimetre wave") communication was first investigated by [Jagadish Chandra Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagadish_Chandra_Bose "Jagadish Chandra Bose") during 1894–1896, when he reached an [extremely high frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency "Extremely high frequency") of up to 60[GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHz "GHz") in his experiments.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-33) He also introduced the use of [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor") junctions to detect radio waves,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-emerson-34) when he patented the radio [crystal detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_detector "Crystal detector") in 1901.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-computerhistory-timeline-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-computerhistory-1901-36)

[John Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ambrose_Fleming "John Ambrose Fleming") invented the first radio tube, the [diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"), in 1904.

[Reginald Fessenden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Fessenden "Reginald Fessenden") recognized that a continuous wave needed to be generated to make speech transmission possible, and by the end of 1906 he sent the first radio broadcast of voice. Also in 1906, [Robert von Lieben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_von_Lieben "Robert von Lieben") and [Lee De Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_De_Forest "Lee De Forest") independently developed the amplifier tube, called the [triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-37)[Edwin Howard Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Howard_Armstrong "Edwin Howard Armstrong") enabling technology for [electronic television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television"), in 1931.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-38)

In the early 1920s, there was a growing interest in the development of domestic applications for electricity.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-39) Public interest led to exhibitions such featuring "homes of the future" and in the UK, the Electrical Association for Women was established with [Caroline Haslett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Haslett "Caroline Haslett") as its director in 1924 to encourage women to become involved in electrical engineering.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-40)

The second world war saw tremendous advances in the field of electronics; especially in [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") and with the invention of the [magnetron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetron "Magnetron") by [Randall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randall_(physicist) "John Randall (physicist)") and [Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Boot "Harry Boot") at the [University of Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham "University of Birmingham") in 1940. [Radio location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_location "Radio location"), [radio communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_communication "Radio communication") and [radio guidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_guidance "Radio guidance") of aircraft were all developed at this time. An early electronic computing device, [Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer "Colossus computer") was built by [Tommy Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Flowers "Tommy Flowers") of the [GPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Post_Office "General Post Office") to decipher the coded messages of the German [Lorenz cipher machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_SZ_40/42 "Lorenz SZ 40/42"). Also developed at this time were advanced clandestine radio transmitters and receivers for use by secret agents.

An American invention at the time was a device to scramble the telephone calls between [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") and [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt"). This was called the [Green Hornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGSALY "SIGSALY") system and worked by inserting noise into the signal. The noise was then extracted at the receiving end. This system was never broken by the Germans.

A great amount of work was undertaken in the United States as part of the War Training Program in the areas of radio direction finding, pulsed linear networks, [frequency modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation "Frequency modulation"), [vacuum tube circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube_circuit "Vacuum tube circuit"), [transmission line theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transmission_line_theory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Transmission line theory (page does not exist)") and fundamentals of [electromagnetic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electromagnetic_engineering&action=edit&redlink=1 "Electromagnetic engineering (page does not exist)"). These studies were published shortly after the war in what became known as the 'Radio Communication Series' published by McGraw-Hill in 1946.

In 1941 [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse "Konrad Zuse") presented the [Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer) "Z3 (computer)"), the world's first fully functional and programmable computer.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-41)

Prior to the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the subject was commonly known as '[radio engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_engineering "Radio engineering")' and was primarily restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio and early television. At this time, the study of radio engineering at universities could only be undertaken as part of a physics degree.

Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi and latterly computers and microprocessors. In 1946 the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC "ENIAC") (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of [John Presper Eckert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Presper_Eckert "John Presper Eckert") and [John Mauchly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly "John Mauchly") followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the [Apollo missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Apollo "Project Apollo") and the [NASA Moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing "Moon landing").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-42)

In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name [electronics engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_engineering "Electronics engineering"), which then became a stand-alone university degree subject, usually taught alongside electrical engineering with which it had become associated due to some similarities.

[Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93oxide%E2%80%93semiconductor_field-effect_transistor "Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor") (MOSFET), the basic building of modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics").

The first working [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") was a [point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor "Point-contact transistor") invented by [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen") and [Walter Houser Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain "Walter Houser Brattain") while working under [William Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley "William Shockley") at the [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories "Bell Telephone Laboratories") (BTL) in 1947.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-43) They then invented the [bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") in 1948.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-44) While early [junction transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_transistor "Junction transistor") were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a [mass-production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-production "Mass-production") basis,[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Moskowitz-45) they opened the door for more compact devices.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-46)

The first [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") were the [hybrid integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_integrated_circuit "Hybrid integrated circuit") invented by [Jack Kilby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kilby "Jack Kilby") at [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments") in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by [Robert Noyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce "Robert Noyce") at [Fairchild Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor") in 1959.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Saxena140-47)

In 1955, [Carl Frosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Frosch "Carl Frosch") and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-:0-48) By 1957 Frosch and Derrick, using masking and predeposition, published their manufactured silicon dioxide planar transistors, the first field effect transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-49) They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-:0-48)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-50)

Following this research, [Mohamed Atalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atalla "Mohamed Atalla") and [Dawon Kahng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawon_Kahng "Dawon Kahng") proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Bassett22-51) and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-53) Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-55) This was a culmination of decades of field-effect research that began with Lilienfeld.

The [MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET "MOSFET") was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Moskowitz-45) It revolutionized the [electronics industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_industry "Electronics industry"),[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Chan-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Grant-57) becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-computerhistory-transistor-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-Golio-59)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electrical_engineering#cite_note-computerhistory2018-60)
