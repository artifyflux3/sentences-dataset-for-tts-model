He attended the lectures of his brother Crates, [ 1 ] but he is otherwise connected with the Megarian school of philosophy, because Diogenes Laërtius calls him a pupil of Euclid of Megara , [ 2 ] and the Suda calls him a pupil of an unknown "Dioclides the Megarian." [ 3 ] Pasicles is said to have been the teacher of Stilpo , who became leader of the Megarian school.

[ 1 ] Thus we have the implausible (although not impossible) situation of Pasicles teaching Stilpo, Stilpo teaching Crates, [ 4 ] and Crates teaching Pasicles. Crates named his son Pasicles.

[ 5 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ a b Suda , Stilpo ^ Diogenes Laërtius , vi. 89 ^ Suda, Stilpo . But possibly Dioclides is merely a misreading of Euclides (Euclid).
