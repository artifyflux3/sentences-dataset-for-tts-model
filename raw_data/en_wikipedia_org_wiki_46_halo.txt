Sun dogs with a larger and fainter 46° halo and a 22° halo with an upper tangent arc A 46° halo is a rare atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a halo with an apparent radius of approximately 46° around the Sun . At solar elevations of 15–27°, 46° halos are often confused with the less rare and more colourful supralateral and infralateral arcs , which cross the parhelic circle at about 46° to the left and right of the sun.

[ 1 ] The 46° halo is similar to, but much larger and fainter than, the more common 22° halo . The 46° halo forms when sunlight enters randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals through a prism face and exits through a hexagonal base.

[ 2 ] The 90° inclination between the two faces of the crystals causes the colours of the 46° halo to be more widely dispersed than those of the 22° halo. In addition, as many rays are deflected at larger angles than the angle of minimum deviation , the outer edge of the halo is more diffuse.

[ 3 ] To tell the difference between a 46° halo and the infralateral or supralateral arcs, one should carefully observe sun elevation and the fluctuating shapes and orientations of the arcs. The supralateral arc always touches the circumzenithal arc , while the 46° halo only achieves this when the sun is located 15–27° over the horizon, leaving a gap between the two at other elevations. In contrast, supralateral arcs cannot form when the Sun is over 32°, so a halo in the region of 46° is always a 46° halo at higher elevations. If the Sun is near the zenith , however, circumhorizontal or infralateral arcs are located 46° under the Sun and can be confused with the 46° halo.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] References [ edit ] ^ The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edmé Mariotte (1620–1684). See:  Mariotte, Quatrieme Essay. De la Nature des Couleur (Paris, France: Estienne Michallet, 1681). Sun dogs as well as the 22° and 46° halos are explained in terms of refractions from ice crystals on pages 466–524 .
