He also called the third track "Perfectly Out of Key", "an extremely high point." [ 10 ] Kill Your Stereo praised the EP lyrically stating, "you'll see that the lyrics are, in fact, incredibly real, and they are an obvious reflection of whatever stage the writer was going through when writing these songs, and the result is more than just some great lyrics, it's something that is incredibly relatable as well." [ 11 ] Nathan Cornell of Into the Crowd magazine called the EP, "a mostly sad album, but John O'Callaghan wears the sad song very well.
