William Swain Cleveland II (born 1943) is an American computer scientist and professor of statistics and professor of computer science at Purdue University , known for his work on data visualization , particularly on nonparametric regression [ 1 ] and local regression .

[ 2 ] He is remembered as one of the developers of the S programming language .

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] Cleveland obtained his AB in Mathematics mid 1960s from Princeton University, where he graduated under William Feller . For his PhD studies in Statistics he moved to Yale University, where he graduated in 1969 under Leonard Jimmie Savage .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] After graduation Cleveland started at Bell Labs , where he was staff member of the Statistics Research Department and Department Head for 12 years. While at Bell Labs, he helped to develop the S programming language , a precursor to R .

[ 3 ] Eventually he moved to the Purdue University, where he became Professor of Statistics and Courtesy Professor of Computer Science.
In 1982 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association .

[ 6 ] His research interests are in the fields of "data visualization, computer networking, machine learning , data mining , time series, statistical modeling, visual perception, environmental science, and seasonal adjustment." [ 7 ] Cleveland is credited with defining and naming the field of data science , which he did in a 2001 publication.
