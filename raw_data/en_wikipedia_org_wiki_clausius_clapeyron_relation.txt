For a state equation, see ideal gas law .

The Clausius–Clapeyron relation , in chemical thermodynamics , specifies the temperature dependence of pressure, most importantly vapor pressure , at a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent.  It is named after Rudolf Clausius [ 1 ] and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron .

[ 2 ] However, this relation was in fact originally derived by Sadi Carnot in his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire , which was published in 1824 but largely ignored until it was rediscovered by Clausius, Clapeyron, and Lord Kelvin decades later.

[ 3 ] Kelvin said of Carnot's argument that "nothing in the whole range of Natural Philosophy is more remarkable than the establishment of general laws by such a process of reasoning." [ 4 ] Kelvin and his brother James Thomson confirmed the relation experimentally in 1849–50, and it was historically important as a very early successful application of theoretical thermodynamics.

[ 5 ] Its relevance to meteorology and climatology is the increase of the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere by about 7% for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) rise in temperature.

Definition [ edit ] Exact Clapeyron equation [ edit ] On a pressure – temperature ( P – T ) diagram, for any phase change the line separating the two phases is known as the coexistence curve . The Clapeyron relation [ 6 ] [ 7 ] gives the slope of the tangents to this curve. Mathematically, d P d T = L T Δ Δ v = Δ Δ s Δ Δ v , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {L}{T\,\Delta v}}={\frac {\Delta s}{\Delta v}},} where d P / d T {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} P/\mathrm {d} T} is the slope of the tangent to the coexistence curve at any point, L {\displaystyle L} is the molar change in enthalpy ( latent heat , the amount of energy absorbed in the transformation), T {\displaystyle T} is the temperature , Δ Δ v {\displaystyle \Delta v} is the molar volume change of the phase transition, and Δ Δ s {\displaystyle \Delta s} is the molar entropy change of the phase transition. Alternatively, the specific values may be used instead of the molar ones.

Clausius–Clapeyron equation [ edit ] The Clausius–Clapeyron equation [ 8 ] : 509 applies to vaporization of liquids where vapor follows ideal gas law using the ideal gas constant R {\displaystyle R} and liquid volume is neglected as being much smaller than vapor volume V . It is often used to calculate vapor pressure of a liquid.

[ 9 ] d P d T = P L T 2 R , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {PL}{T^{2}R}},} v = V n = R T P .

{\displaystyle v={\frac {V}{n}}={\frac {RT}{P}}.} The equation expresses this in a more convenient form just in terms of the latent heat, for moderate temperatures and pressures.

Derivations [ edit ] A typical phase diagram . The dotted green line gives the anomalous behavior of water . The Clausius–Clapeyron relation can be used to find the relationship between pressure and temperature along phase boundaries .

Derivation from state postulate [ edit ] Using the state postulate , take the molar entropy s {\displaystyle s} for a homogeneous substance to be a function of molar volume v {\displaystyle v} and temperature T {\displaystyle T} .

[ 8 ] : 508 d s = ( ∂ ∂ s ∂ ∂ v ) T d v + ( ∂ ∂ s ∂ ∂ T ) v d T .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s=\left({\frac {\partial s}{\partial v}}\right)_{T}\,\mathrm {d} v+\left({\frac {\partial s}{\partial T}}\right)_{v}\,\mathrm {d} T.} The Clausius–Clapeyron relation describes a Phase transition in a closed system composed of two contiguous phases, condensed matter and ideal gas, of a single substance, in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium, at constant temperature and pressure . Therefore, [ 8 ] : 508 d s = ( ∂ ∂ s ∂ ∂ v ) T d v .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s=\left({\frac {\partial s}{\partial v}}\right)_{T}\,\mathrm {d} v.} Using the appropriate Maxwell relation gives [ 8 ] : 508 d s = ( ∂ ∂ P ∂ ∂ T ) v d v , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s=\left({\frac {\partial P}{\partial T}}\right)_{v}\,\mathrm {d} v,} where P {\displaystyle P} is the pressure. Since pressure and temperature are constant, the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature does not change.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] : 57, 62, 671 Therefore, the partial derivative of molar entropy may be changed into a total derivative d s = d P d T d v , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s={\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}\,\mathrm {d} v,} and the total derivative of pressure with respect to temperature may be factored out when integrating from an initial phase α α {\displaystyle \alpha } to a final phase β β {\displaystyle \beta } , [ 8 ] : 508 to obtain d P d T = Δ Δ s Δ Δ v , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\Delta s}{\Delta v}},} where Δ Δ s ≡ ≡ s β β − − s α α {\displaystyle \Delta s\equiv s_{\beta }-s_{\alpha }} and Δ Δ v ≡ ≡ v β β − − v α α {\displaystyle \Delta v\equiv v_{\beta }-v_{\alpha }} are respectively the change in molar entropy and molar volume. Given that a phase change is an internally reversible process , and that our system is closed, the first law of thermodynamics holds: d u = δ δ q + δ δ w = T d s − − P d v , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} u=\delta q+\delta w=T\,\mathrm {d} s-P\,\mathrm {d} v,} where u {\displaystyle u} is the internal energy of the system. Given constant pressure and temperature (during a phase change) and the definition of molar enthalpy h {\displaystyle h} , we obtain d h = T d s + v d P , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} h=T\,\mathrm {d} s+v\,\mathrm {d} P,} d h = T d s , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} h=T\,\mathrm {d} s,} d s = d h T .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s={\frac {\mathrm {d} h}{T}}.} Given constant pressure and temperature (during a phase change), we obtain [ 8 ] : 508 Δ Δ s = Δ Δ h T .

{\displaystyle \Delta s={\frac {\Delta h}{T}}.} Substituting the definition of molar latent heat L = Δ Δ h {\displaystyle L=\Delta h} gives Δ Δ s = L T .

{\displaystyle \Delta s={\frac {L}{T}}.} Substituting this result into the pressure derivative given above ( d P / d T = Δ Δ s / Δ Δ v {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} P/\mathrm {d} T=\Delta s/\Delta v} ), we obtain [ 8 ] : 508 [ 12 ] d P d T = L T Δ Δ v .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {L}{T\,\Delta v}}.} This result (also known as the Clapeyron equation ) equates the slope d P / d T {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} P/\mathrm {d} T} of the coexistence curve P ( T ) {\displaystyle P(T)} to the function L / ( T Δ Δ v ) {\displaystyle L/(T\,\Delta v)} of the molar latent heat L {\displaystyle L} , the temperature T {\displaystyle T} , and the change in molar volume Δ Δ v {\displaystyle \Delta v} . Instead of the molar values, corresponding specific values may also be used.

Derivation from Gibbs–Duhem relation [ edit ] Suppose two phases, α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } , are in contact and at equilibrium with each other. Their chemical potentials are related by μ μ α α = μ μ β β .

{\displaystyle \mu _{\alpha }=\mu _{\beta }.} Furthermore, along the coexistence curve , d μ μ α α = d μ μ β β .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mu _{\alpha }=\mathrm {d} \mu _{\beta }.} One may therefore use the Gibbs–Duhem relation d μ μ = M ( − − s d T + v d P ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mu =M(-s\,\mathrm {d} T+v\,\mathrm {d} P)} (where s {\displaystyle s} is the specific entropy , v {\displaystyle v} is the specific volume , and M {\displaystyle M} is the molar mass ) to obtain − − ( s β β − − s α α ) d T + ( v β β − − v α α ) d P = 0.

{\displaystyle -(s_{\beta }-s_{\alpha })\,\mathrm {d} T+(v_{\beta }-v_{\alpha })\,\mathrm {d} P=0.} Rearrangement gives d P d T = s β β − − s α α v β β − − v α α = Δ Δ s Δ Δ v , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {s_{\beta }-s_{\alpha }}{v_{\beta }-v_{\alpha }}}={\frac {\Delta s}{\Delta v}},} from which the derivation of the Clapeyron equation continues as in the previous section .

Ideal gas approximation at low temperatures [ edit ] When the phase transition of a substance is between a gas phase and a condensed phase ( liquid or solid ), and occurs at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature of that substance, the specific volume of the gas phase v g {\displaystyle v_{\text{g}}} greatly exceeds that of the condensed phase v c {\displaystyle v_{\text{c}}} . Therefore, one may approximate Δ Δ v = v g ( 1 − − v c v g ) ≈ ≈ v g {\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{\text{g}}\left(1-{\frac {v_{\text{c}}}{v_{\text{g}}}}\right)\approx v_{\text{g}}} at low temperatures . If pressure is also low, the gas may be approximated by the ideal gas law , so that v g = R T P , {\displaystyle v_{\text{g}}={\frac {RT}{P}},} where P {\displaystyle P} is the pressure, R {\displaystyle R} is the specific gas constant , and T {\displaystyle T} is the temperature. Substituting into the Clapeyron equation d P d T = L T Δ Δ v , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {L}{T\,\Delta v}},} we can obtain the Clausius–Clapeyron equation [ 8 ] : 509 d P d T = P L T 2 R {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {PL}{T^{2}R}}} for low temperatures and pressures, [ 8 ] : 509 where L {\displaystyle L} is the specific latent heat of the substance. Instead of the specific, corresponding molar values (i.e.

L {\displaystyle L} in kJ/mol and R = 8.31 J/(mol⋅K)) may also be used.

Let ( P 1 , T 1 ) {\displaystyle (P_{1},T_{1})} and ( P 2 , T 2 ) {\displaystyle (P_{2},T_{2})} be any two points along the coexistence curve between two phases α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } . In general, L {\displaystyle L} varies between any two such points, as a function of temperature. But if L {\displaystyle L} is approximated as constant, d P P ≅ ≅ L R d T T 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{P}}\cong {\frac {L}{R}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} T}{T^{2}}},} ∫ ∫ P 1 P 2 d P P ≅ ≅ L R ∫ ∫ T 1 T 2 d T T 2 , {\displaystyle \int _{P_{1}}^{P_{2}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{P}}\cong {\frac {L}{R}}\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} T}{T^{2}}},} ln ⁡ ⁡ P | P = P 1 P 2 ≅ ≅ − − L R ⋅ ⋅ 1 T | T = T 1 T 2 , {\displaystyle \ln P{\Big |}_{P=P_{1}}^{P_{2}}\cong -{\frac {L}{R}}\cdot \left.{\frac {1}{T}}\right|_{T=T_{1}}^{T_{2}},} or [ 11 ] : 672 [ 13 ] ln ⁡ ⁡ P 2 P 1 ≅ ≅ − − L R ( 1 T 2 − − 1 T 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \ln {\frac {P_{2}}{P_{1}}}\cong -{\frac {L}{R}}\left({\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right).} These last equations are useful because they relate equilibrium or saturation vapor pressure and temperature to the latent heat of the phase change without requiring specific-volume data. For instance, for water near its normal boiling point , with a molar enthalpy of vaporization of 40.7 kJ/mol and R = 8.31 J/(mol⋅K), P vap ( T ) ≅ ≅ 1 bar ⋅ ⋅ exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − 40 700 K 8.31 ( 1 T − − 1 373 K ) ] .

{\displaystyle P_{\text{vap}}(T)\cong 1~{\text{bar}}\cdot \exp \left[-{\frac {40\,700~{\text{K}}}{8.31}}\left({\frac {1}{T}}-{\frac {1}{373~{\text{K}}}}\right)\right].} Clapeyron's derivation [ edit ] In the original work by Clapeyron, the following argument is advanced.

[ 14 ] Clapeyron considered a Carnot process of saturated water vapor with horizontal isobars. As the pressure is a function of temperature alone, the isobars are also isotherms. If the process involves an infinitesimal amount of water, d x {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} x} , and an infinitesimal difference in temperature d T {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T} , the heat absorbed is Q = L d x , {\displaystyle Q=L\,\mathrm {d} x,} and the corresponding work is W = d p d T d T ( V ″ − − V ′ ) , {\displaystyle W={\frac {\mathrm {d} p}{\mathrm {d} T}}\,\mathrm {d} T(V''-V'),} where V ″ − − V ′ {\displaystyle V''-V'} is the difference between the volumes of d x {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} x} in the liquid phase and vapor phases.
The ratio W / Q {\displaystyle W/Q} is the efficiency of the Carnot engine, d T / T {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T/T} .

[ a ] Substituting and rearranging gives d p d T = L T ( v ″ − − v ′ ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} p}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {L}{T(v''-v')}},} where lowercase v ″ − − v ′ {\displaystyle v''-v'} denotes the change in specific volume during the transition.

Applications [ edit ] Chemistry and chemical engineering [ edit ] For transitions between a gas and a condensed phase with the approximations described above, the expression may be rewritten as [ 7 ] ln ⁡ ⁡ ( P 1 P 0 ) = L R ( 1 T 0 − − 1 T 1 ) {\displaystyle \ln \left({\frac {P_{1}}{P_{0}}}\right)={\frac {L}{R}}\left({\frac {1}{T_{0}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)} where P 0 , P 1 {\displaystyle P_{0},P_{1}} are the pressures at temperatures T 0 , T 1 {\displaystyle T_{0},T_{1}} respectively and R {\displaystyle R} is the ideal gas constant . For a liquid–gas transition, L {\displaystyle L} is the molar latent heat (or molar enthalpy ) of vaporization ; for a solid–gas transition, L {\displaystyle L} is the molar latent heat of sublimation . If the latent heat is known, then knowledge of one point on the coexistence curve , for instance (1 bar, 373 K) for water, determines the rest of the curve. Conversely, the relationship between ln ⁡ ⁡ P {\displaystyle \ln P} and 1 / T {\displaystyle 1/T} is linear, and so linear regression is used to estimate the latent heat.

Meteorology and climatology [ edit ] Atmospheric water vapor drives many important meteorologic phenomena (notably, precipitation ), motivating interest in its dynamics . The Clausius–Clapeyron equation for water vapor under typical atmospheric conditions (near standard temperature and pressure ) is d e s d T = L v ( T ) e s R v T 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} e_{s}}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {L_{v}(T)e_{s}}{R_{v}T^{2}}},} where e s {\displaystyle e_{s}} is saturation vapor pressure , T {\displaystyle T} is temperature , L v {\displaystyle L_{v}} is the specific latent heat of evaporation of water, R v {\displaystyle R_{v}} is the gas constant of water vapor.

The temperature dependence of the latent heat L v ( T ) {\displaystyle L_{v}(T)} can be neglected in this application. The August – Roche – Magnus formula provides a solution under that approximation: [ 15 ] [ 16 ] e s ( T ) = 6.1094 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 17.625 T T + 243.04 ) , {\displaystyle e_{s}(T)=6.1094\exp \left({\frac {17.625T}{T+243.04}}\right),} where e s {\displaystyle e_{s}} is in hPa , and T {\displaystyle T} is in degrees Celsius (whereas everywhere else on this page, T {\displaystyle T} is an absolute temperature, e.g. in kelvins).

This is also sometimes called the Magnus or Magnus–Tetens approximation, though this attribution is historically inaccurate.

[ 17 ] But see also the discussion of the accuracy of different approximating formulae for saturation vapour pressure of water .

Under typical atmospheric conditions, the denominator of the exponent depends weakly on T {\displaystyle T} (for which the unit is degree Celsius). Therefore, the August–Roche–Magnus equation implies that saturation water vapor pressure changes approximately exponentially with temperature under typical atmospheric conditions, and hence the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7% for every 1 °C rise in temperature.

[ 18 ] Example [ edit ] One of the uses of this equation is to determine if a phase transition will occur in a given situation.  Consider the question of how much pressure is needed to melt ice at a temperature Δ Δ T {\displaystyle {\Delta T}} below 0 °C. Note that water is unusual in that its change in volume upon melting is negative. We can assume Δ Δ P = L T Δ Δ v Δ Δ T , {\displaystyle \Delta P={\frac {L}{T\,\Delta v}}\,\Delta T,} and substituting in L = 3.34 × × 10 5 J / k g {\displaystyle L=3.34\times 10^{5}~\mathrm {J/kg} } (latent heat of fusion for water), T = 273 K {\displaystyle T=273\,\mathrm {K} } (absolute temperature in kelvins ), Δ Δ v = − − 9.05 × × 10 − − 5 m 3 / k g {\displaystyle \Delta v=-9.05\times 10^{-5}~\mathrm {m^{3}/kg} } (change in specific volume from solid to liquid), we obtain Δ Δ P Δ Δ T = − − 13.5 MPa / K .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta T}}=-13.5~{\text{MPa}}/{\text{K}}.} To provide a rough example of how much pressure this is, to melt ice at −7 °C (the temperature many ice skating rinks are set at) would require balancing a small car (mass ~ 1000 kg [ 19 ] ) on a thimble (area ~ 1 cm 2 ). This shows that ice skating cannot be simply explained by pressure-caused melting point depression, and in fact the mechanism is quite complex.

[ 20 ] Second derivative [ edit ] While the Clausius–Clapeyron relation gives the slope of the coexistence curve, it does not provide any information about its curvature or second derivative . The second derivative of the coexistence curve of phases 1 and 2 is given by [ 21 ] d 2 P d T 2 = 1 v 2 − − v 1 [ c p 2 − − c p 1 T − − 2 ( v 2 α α 2 − − v 1 α α 1 ) d P d T ] + 1 v 2 − − v 1 [ ( v 2 κ κ T 2 − − v 1 κ κ T 1 ) ( d P d T ) 2 ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}P}{\mathrm {d} T^{2}}}&={\frac {1}{v_{2}-v_{1}}}\left[{\frac {c_{p2}-c_{p1}}{T}}-2(v_{2}\alpha _{2}-v_{1}\alpha _{1}){\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}\right]\\{}&+{\frac {1}{v_{2}-v_{1}}}\left[(v_{2}\kappa _{T2}-v_{1}\kappa _{T1})\left({\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}\right)^{2}\right],\end{aligned}}} where subscripts 1 and 2 denote the different phases, c p {\displaystyle c_{p}} is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, α α = ( 1 / v ) ( d v / d T ) P {\displaystyle \alpha =(1/v)(\mathrm {d} v/\mathrm {d} T)_{P}} is the thermal expansion coefficient , and κ κ T = − − ( 1 / v ) ( d v / d P ) T {\displaystyle \kappa _{T}=-(1/v)(\mathrm {d} v/\mathrm {d} P)_{T}} is the isothermal compressibility .
