In the study of ordinary differential equations and their associated boundary value problems in mathematics, Lagrange's identity , named after Joseph Louis Lagrange , gives the boundary terms arising from integration by parts of a self-adjoint linear differential operator .  Lagrange's identity is fundamental in Sturm–Liouville theory .  In more than one independent variable, Lagrange's identity is generalized by Green's second identity .

Statement [ edit ] In general terms, Lagrange's identity for any pair of functions u and v in function space C 2 (that is, twice differentiable) in n dimensions is: [ 1 ] v L [ u ] − − u L ∗ ∗ [ v ] = ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ M , {\displaystyle vL[u]-uL^{*}[v]=\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {M}},} where: M i = ∑ ∑ j = 1 n a i j ( v ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ x j − − u ∂ ∂ v ∂ ∂ x j ) + u v ( b i − − ∑ ∑ j = 1 n ∂ ∂ a i j ∂ ∂ x j ) , {\displaystyle M_{i}=\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}\left(v{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x_{j}}}-u{\frac {\partial v}{\partial x_{j}}}\right)+uv\left(b_{i}-\sum _{j=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial a_{ij}}{\partial x_{j}}}\right),} and ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ M = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x i M i , {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {M}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{i}}}M_{i},} The operator L and its adjoint operator L * are given by: L [ u ] = ∑ ∑ i , j = 1 n a i , j ∂ ∂ 2 u ∂ ∂ x i ∂ ∂ x j + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n b i ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ x i + c u {\displaystyle L[u]=\sum _{i,\ j=1}^{n}a_{i,j}{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}b_{i}{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x_{i}}}+cu} and L ∗ ∗ [ v ] = ∑ ∑ i , j = 1 n ∂ ∂ 2 ( a i , j v ) ∂ ∂ x i ∂ ∂ x j − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ ( b i v ) ∂ ∂ x i + c v .

{\displaystyle L^{*}[v]=\sum _{i,\ j=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial ^{2}(a_{i,j}v)}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}}-\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial (b_{i}v)}{\partial x_{i}}}+cv.} If Lagrange's identity is integrated over a bounded region, then the divergence theorem can be used to form Green's second identity in the form: ∫ ∫ Ω Ω v L [ u ] d Ω Ω = ∫ ∫ Ω Ω u L ∗ ∗ [ v ] d Ω Ω + ∫ ∫ S M ⋅ ⋅ n d S , {\displaystyle \int _{\Omega }vL[u]\,d\Omega =\int _{\Omega }uL^{*}[v]\ d\Omega +\int _{S}{\boldsymbol {M\cdot n}}\,dS,} where S is the surface bounding the volume Ω and n is the unit outward normal to the surface S .

Ordinary differential equations [ edit ] Any second order ordinary differential equation of the form: a ( x ) d 2 y d x 2 + b ( x ) d y d x + c ( x ) y + λ λ w ( x ) y = 0 , {\displaystyle a(x){\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}+b(x){\frac {dy}{dx}}+c(x)y+\lambda w(x)y=0,} can be put in the form: [ 2 ] d d x ( p ( x ) d y d x ) + ( q ( x ) + λ λ w ( x ) ) y ( x ) = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)+\left(q(x)+\lambda w(x)\right)y(x)=0.} This general form motivates introduction of the Sturm–Liouville operator L , defined as an operation upon a function f such that: L f = d d x ( p ( x ) d f d x ) + q ( x ) f .

{\displaystyle Lf={\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {df}{dx}}\right)+q(x)f.} It can be shown that for any u and v for which the various derivatives exist, Lagrange's identity for ordinary differential equations holds: [ 2 ] u L v − − v L u = − − d d x [ p ( x ) ( v d u d x − − u d v d x ) ] .

{\displaystyle uLv-vLu=-{\frac {d}{dx}}\left[p(x)\left(v{\frac {du}{dx}}-u{\frac {dv}{dx}}\right)\right].} For ordinary differential equations defined in the interval [0, 1], Lagrange's identity can be integrated to obtain an integral form (also known as Green's formula): [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] ∫ ∫ 0 1 d x ( u L v − − v L u ) = [ p ( x ) ( u d v d x − − v d u d x ) ] 0 1 , {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}dx\ (uLv-vLu)=\left[p(x)\left(u{\frac {dv}{dx}}-v{\frac {du}{dx}}\right)\right]_{0}^{1},} where p = P ( x ) {\displaystyle p=P(x)} , q = Q ( x ) {\displaystyle q=Q(x)} , u = U ( x ) {\displaystyle u=U(x)} and v = V ( x ) {\displaystyle v=V(x)} are functions of x {\displaystyle x} .

u {\displaystyle u} and v {\displaystyle v} having continuous second derivatives on the interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} .

Proof of form for ordinary differential equations [ edit ] We have: u L v = u [ d d x ( p ( x ) d v d x ) + q ( x ) v ] , {\displaystyle uLv=u\left[{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {dv}{dx}}\right)+q(x)v\right],} and v L u = v [ d d x ( p ( x ) d u d x ) + q ( x ) u ] .

{\displaystyle vLu=v\left[{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {du}{dx}}\right)+q(x)u\right].} Subtracting: u L v − − v L u = u d d x ( p ( x ) d v d x ) − − v d d x ( p ( x ) d u d x ) .

{\displaystyle uLv-vLu=u{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {dv}{dx}}\right)-v{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x){\frac {du}{dx}}\right).} The leading multiplied u and v can be moved inside the differentiation, because the extra differentiated terms in u and v are the same in the two subtracted terms and simply cancel each other. Thus, u L v − − v L u = d d x ( p ( x ) u d v d x ) − − d d x ( v p ( x ) d u d x ) , = d d x [ p ( x ) ( u d v d x − − v d u d x ) ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}uLv-vLu&={\frac {d}{dx}}\left(p(x)u{\frac {dv}{dx}}\right)-{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(vp(x){\frac {du}{dx}}\right),\\&={\frac {d}{dx}}\left[p(x)\left(u{\frac {dv}{dx}}-v{\frac {du}{dx}}\right)\right],\end{aligned}}} which is Lagrange's identity. Integrating from zero to one: ∫ ∫ 0 1 d x ( u L v − − v L u ) = [ p ( x ) ( u d v d x − − v d u d x ) ] 0 1 , {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}dx\ (uLv-vLu)=\left[p(x)\left(u{\frac {dv}{dx}}-v{\frac {du}{dx}}\right)\right]_{0}^{1},} as was to be shown.
