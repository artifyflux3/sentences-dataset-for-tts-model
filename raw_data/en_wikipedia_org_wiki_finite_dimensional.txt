[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is sometimes called Hamel dimension (after Georg Hamel ) or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other types of dimension .

For every vector space there exists a basis, [ a ] and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality; [ b ] as a result, the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined. We say V {\displaystyle V} is finite-dimensional if the dimension of V {\displaystyle V} is finite , and infinite-dimensional if its dimension is infinite .

The dimension of the vector space V {\displaystyle V} over the field F {\displaystyle F} can be written as dim F ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) {\displaystyle \dim _{F}(V)} or as [ V : F ] , {\displaystyle [V:F],} read "dimension of V {\displaystyle V} over F {\displaystyle F} ". When F {\displaystyle F} can be inferred from context, dim ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) {\displaystyle \dim(V)} is typically written.

Examples [ edit ] The vector space R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} has { ( 1 0 0 ) , ( 0 1 0 ) , ( 0 0 1 ) } {\displaystyle \left\{{\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}\right\}} as a standard basis , and therefore dim R ⁡ ⁡ ( R 3 ) = 3.

{\displaystyle \dim _{\mathbb {R} }(\mathbb {R} ^{3})=3.} More generally, dim R ⁡ ⁡ ( R n ) = n , {\displaystyle \dim _{\mathbb {R} }(\mathbb {R} ^{n})=n,} and even more generally, dim F ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) = n {\displaystyle \dim _{F}(F^{n})=n} for any field F .

{\displaystyle F.} The complex numbers C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } are both a real and complex vector space; we have dim R ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) = 2 {\displaystyle \dim _{\mathbb {R} }(\mathbb {C} )=2} and dim C ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) = 1.

{\displaystyle \dim _{\mathbb {C} }(\mathbb {C} )=1.} So the dimension depends on the base field.

The only vector space with dimension 0 {\displaystyle 0} is { 0 } , {\displaystyle \{0\},} the vector space consisting only of its zero element.

Properties [ edit ] If W {\displaystyle W} is a linear subspace of V {\displaystyle V} then dim ⁡ ⁡ ( W ) ≤ ≤ dim ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) .

{\displaystyle \dim(W)\leq \dim(V).} To show that two finite-dimensional vector spaces are equal, the following criterion can be used: if V {\displaystyle V} is a finite-dimensional vector space and W {\displaystyle W} is a linear subspace of V {\displaystyle V} with dim ⁡ ⁡ ( W ) = dim ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) , {\displaystyle \dim(W)=\dim(V),} then W = V .

{\displaystyle W=V.} The space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} has the standard basis { e 1 , … … , e n } , {\displaystyle \left\{e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n}\right\},} where e i {\displaystyle e_{i}} is the i {\displaystyle i} -th column of the corresponding identity matrix . Therefore, R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} has dimension n .

{\displaystyle n.} Any two finite dimensional vector spaces over F {\displaystyle F} with the same dimension are isomorphic . Any bijective map between their bases can be uniquely extended to a bijective linear map between the vector spaces. If B {\displaystyle B} is some set, a vector space with dimension | B | {\displaystyle |B|} over F {\displaystyle F} can be constructed as follows: take the set F ( B ) {\displaystyle F(B)} of all functions f : B → → F {\displaystyle f:B\to F} such that f ( b ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(b)=0} for all but finitely many b {\displaystyle b} in B .

{\displaystyle B.} These functions can be added and multiplied with elements of F {\displaystyle F} to obtain the desired F {\displaystyle F} -vector space.

An important result about dimensions is given by the rank–nullity theorem for linear maps .

If F / K {\displaystyle F/K} is a field extension , then F {\displaystyle F} is in particular a vector space over K .

{\displaystyle K.} Furthermore, every F {\displaystyle F} -vector space V {\displaystyle V} is also a K {\displaystyle K} -vector space. The dimensions are related by the formula dim K ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) = dim K ⁡ ⁡ ( F ) dim F ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) .

{\displaystyle \dim _{K}(V)=\dim _{K}(F)\dim _{F}(V).} In particular, every complex vector space of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is a real vector space of dimension 2 n .

{\displaystyle 2n.} Some formulae relate the dimension of a vector space with the cardinality of the base field and the cardinality of the space itself.
If V {\displaystyle V} is a vector space over a field F {\displaystyle F} and if the dimension of V {\displaystyle V} is denoted by dim ⁡ ⁡ V , {\displaystyle \dim V,} then: If dim V {\displaystyle V} is finite then | V | = | F | dim ⁡ ⁡ V .

{\displaystyle |V|=|F|^{\dim V}.} If dim V {\displaystyle V} is infinite then | V | = max ( | F | , dim ⁡ ⁡ V ) .

{\displaystyle |V|=\max(|F|,\dim V).} Generalizations [ edit ] A vector space can be seen as a particular case of a matroid , and in the latter there is a well-defined notion of dimension. The length of a module and the rank of an abelian group both have several properties similar to the dimension of vector spaces.

The Krull dimension of a commutative ring , named after Wolfgang Krull (1899–1971), is defined to be the maximal number of strict inclusions in an increasing chain of prime ideals in the ring.

Trace [ edit ] See also: Trace (linear algebra) The dimension of a vector space may alternatively be characterized as the trace of the identity operator . For instance, tr ⁡ ⁡ id R 2 = tr ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 0 0 1 ) = 1 + 1 = 2.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {tr} \ \operatorname {id} _{\mathbb {R} ^{2}}=\operatorname {tr} \left({\begin{smallmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{smallmatrix}}\right)=1+1=2.} This appears to be a circular definition , but it allows useful generalizations.

Firstly, it allows for a definition of a notion of dimension when one has a trace but no natural sense of basis. For example, one may have an algebra A {\displaystyle A} with maps η η : K → → A {\displaystyle \eta :K\to A} (the inclusion of scalars, called the unit ) and a map ϵ ϵ : A → → K {\displaystyle \epsilon :A\to K} (corresponding to trace, called the counit ). The composition ϵ ϵ ∘ ∘ η η : K → → K {\displaystyle \epsilon \circ \eta :K\to K} is a scalar (being a linear operator on a 1-dimensional space) corresponds to "trace of identity", and gives a notion of dimension for an abstract algebra. In practice, in bialgebras , this map is required to be the identity, which can be obtained by normalizing the counit by dividing by dimension ( ϵ ϵ := 1 n tr {\displaystyle \epsilon :=\textstyle {\frac {1}{n}}\operatorname {tr} } ), so in these cases the normalizing constant corresponds to dimension.

Alternatively, it may be possible to take the trace of operators on an infinite-dimensional space; in this case a (finite) trace is defined, even though no (finite) dimension exists, and gives a notion of "dimension of the operator". These fall under the rubric of " trace class operators" on a Hilbert space , or more generally nuclear operators on a Banach space .

A subtler generalization is to consider the trace of a family of operators as a kind of "twisted" dimension. This occurs significantly in representation theory , where the character of a representation is the trace of the representation, hence a scalar-valued function on a group χ χ : G → → K , {\displaystyle \chi :G\to K,} whose value on the identity 1 ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle 1\in G} is the dimension of the representation, as a representation sends the identity in the group to the identity matrix: χ χ ( 1 G ) = tr ⁡ ⁡ I V = dim ⁡ ⁡ V .

{\displaystyle \chi (1_{G})=\operatorname {tr} \ I_{V}=\dim V.} The other values χ χ ( g ) {\displaystyle \chi (g)} of the character can be viewed as "twisted" dimensions, and find analogs or generalizations of statements about dimensions to statements about characters or representations. A sophisticated example of this occurs in the theory of monstrous moonshine : the j {\displaystyle j} -invariant is the graded dimension of an infinite-dimensional graded representation of the monster group , and replacing the dimension with the character gives the McKay–Thompson series for each element of the Monster group.
