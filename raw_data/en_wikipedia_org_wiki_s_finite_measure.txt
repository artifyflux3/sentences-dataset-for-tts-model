( May 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In measure theory , a branch of mathematics that studies generalized notions of volumes, an s-finite measure is a special type of measure . An s-finite measure is more general than a finite measure, but allows one to generalize certain proofs for finite measures.

The s-finite measures should not be confused with the σ-finite (sigma-finite) measures .

Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , A ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}})} be a measurable space and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } a measure on this measurable space. The measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is called an s-finite measure, if it can be written as a countable sum of finite measures ν ν n {\displaystyle \nu _{n}} ( n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } ), [ 1 ] μ μ = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ν ν n .

{\displaystyle \mu =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\nu _{n}.} Example [ edit ] The Lebesgue measure λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is an s-finite measure. For this, set B n = ( − − n , − − n + 1 ] ∪ ∪ [ n − − 1 , n ) {\displaystyle B_{n}=(-n,-n+1]\cup [n-1,n)} and define the measures ν ν n {\displaystyle \nu _{n}} by ν ν n ( A ) = λ λ ( A ∩ ∩ B n ) {\displaystyle \nu _{n}(A)=\lambda (A\cap B_{n})} for all measurable sets A {\displaystyle A} . These measures are finite, since ν ν n ( A ) ≤ ≤ ν ν n ( B n ) = 2 {\displaystyle \nu _{n}(A)\leq \nu _{n}(B_{n})=2} for all measurable sets A {\displaystyle A} , and by construction satisfy λ λ = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ν ν n .

{\displaystyle \lambda =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\nu _{n}.} Therefore the Lebesgue measure is s-finite.

Properties [ edit ] Relation to σ-finite measures [ edit ] Every σ-finite measure is s-finite, but not every s-finite measure is also σ-finite.

To show that every σ-finite measure is s-finite, let μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be σ-finite. Then there are measurable disjoint sets B 1 , B 2 , … … {\displaystyle B_{1},B_{2},\dots } with μ μ ( B n ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (B_{n})<\infty } and ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ B n = X {\displaystyle \bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }B_{n}=X} Then the measures ν ν n ( ⋅ ⋅ ) := μ μ ( ⋅ ⋅ ∩ ∩ B n ) {\displaystyle \nu _{n}(\cdot ):=\mu (\cdot \cap B_{n})} are finite and their sum is μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . This approach is just like in the example above.

An example for an s-finite measure that is not σ-finite can be constructed on the set X = { a } {\displaystyle X=\{a\}} with the σ-algebra A = { { a } , ∅ ∅ } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}=\{\{a\},\emptyset \}} . For all n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } , let ν ν n {\displaystyle \nu _{n}} be the counting measure on this measurable space and define μ μ := ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ν ν n .

{\displaystyle \mu :=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\nu _{n}.} The measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is by construction s-finite (since the counting measure is finite on a set with one element). But μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is not σ-finite, since μ μ ( { a } ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ν ν n ( { a } ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 = ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \mu (\{a\})=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\nu _{n}(\{a\})=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }1=\infty .} So μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } cannot be σ-finite.

Equivalence to probability measures [ edit ] For every s-finite measure μ μ = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ν ν n {\displaystyle \mu =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\nu _{n}} , there exists an equivalent probability measure P {\displaystyle P} , meaning that μ μ ∼ ∼ P {\displaystyle \mu \sim P} .

[ 1 ] One possible equivalent probability measure is given by P = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 2 − − n ν ν n ν ν n ( X ) .

{\displaystyle P=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }2^{-n}{\frac {\nu _{n}}{\nu _{n}(X)}}.} References [ edit ] ^ a b Kallenberg, Olav (2017).
