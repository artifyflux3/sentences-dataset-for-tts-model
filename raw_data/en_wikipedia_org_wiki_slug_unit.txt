BGS base units 1 ft −1 ⋅lbf⋅s 2 SI units 14.59390 kg US customary units 32.17404 lb The slug is a derived unit of mass in a weight-based system of measures , most notably within the British Imperial measurement system and the United States customary measures system . Systems of measure either define mass and derive a force unit or define a base force and derive a mass unit [ 1 ] (cf.

poundal , a derived unit of force in a mass-based system). A slug is defined as a mass that is accelerated by 1 ft/s 2 when a net force of one pound (lbf) is exerted on it.

[ 2 ] 1 slug = 1 lbf ⋅ ⋅ s 2 ft ⟺ ⟺ 1 lbf = 1 slug ⋅ ⋅ ft s 2 {\displaystyle 1~{\text{slug}}=1~{\text{lbf}}{\cdot }{\frac {{\text{s}}^{2}}{\text{ft}}}\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad 1~{\text{lbf}}=1~{\text{slug}}{\cdot }{\frac {\text{ft}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}} One slug is a mass equal to 32.17405 lb (14.59390 kg ) based on standard gravity , the international foot , and the avoirdupois pound .

[ 3 ] In other words, at the Earth's surface (in standard gravity), an object with a mass of 1 slug weighs approximately 32.17405 lbf or 143.1173 N.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] History [ edit ] The slug is part of a subset of units known as the gravitational FPS system , one of several such specialized systems of mechanical units developed in the late 19th and the early 20th century.

Geepound was another name for this unit in early literature.

[ 6 ] The name "slug" was coined before 1900 by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington , [ 7 ] but it did not see any significant use until decades later.

[ 8 ] It is derived from the meaning "solid block of metal" (cf.

"slug" fake coin or "slug" projectile ), not from the slug mollusc.

[ 9 ] A 1928 textbook says: No name has yet been given to the unit of mass and, in fact, as we have developed the theory of dynamics no name is necessary.  Whenever the mass, m , appears in our formulae, we substitute the ratio of the convenient force-acceleration pair (w/g) , and measure the mass in lbs. per ft./sec.

2 or in grams per cm./sec.

This regulation defines the units of weights and measures, both regular and metric, in Australia.

Related units [ edit ] The inch version of the slug (equal to 1 lbf⋅s 2 /in, or 12 slugs) has no official name, [ 3 ] but is commonly referred to as a blob , [ 12 ] slinch (a portmanteau of the words slug and inch), [ 13 ] [ 14 ] slugette , [ 15 ] or snail .

[ 16 ] It is equivalent to 386.0886 pounds (175.1268 kg) based on standard gravity.

[ 3 ] Similar (but long-obsolete) metric units included the glug (980.665 g) in a gravitational system related to the centimetre–gram–second system , [ 17 ] : 358 , 377 [ 18 ] and the mug , hyl , par , or TME ( German : technische Masseneinheit , lit.

'technical mass unit', 9.80665 kg) in a gravitational system related to the metre–kilogram–second system .
