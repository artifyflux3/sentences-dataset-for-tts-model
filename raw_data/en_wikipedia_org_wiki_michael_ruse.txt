Ruse began his career teaching at The University of Guelph and spent many years at Florida State University .

Early life and career [ edit ] Ruse was born in Birmingham , England, attending Bootham School , York.

[ 2 ] He took his undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol (1962), his master's degree at McMaster University , Hamilton, Ontario (1964), and Ph.D. at the University of Bristol (1970).

Ruse taught at the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada for 35 years. Since his retirement from Guelph, he had taught at Florida State University and was the Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy (2000–20??). In 1986, he was elected as a Fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the American Association for the Advancement of Science . He received honorary doctorates from the University of Bergen , Norway (1990), McMaster University , Ontario, Canada (2003) and the University of New Brunswick , Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada (2007). In September 2014 he was made an Honorary Doctor of Science by University College London.

Ruse was a key witness for the plaintiff in the 1981 test case ( McLean v. Arkansas ) of the state law permitting the teaching of " creation science " in the Arkansas school system.

[ 3 ] The federal judge ruled that the state law was unconstitutional .

His 1996 book on the idea of progress in biology (orthogenesis) , Monad to Man , had a mixed reception from other philosophers of biology.

Peter J. Bowler described it as an important and controversial book on the status of evolutionism.

[ 4 ] Ron Amundson called Ruse an analytic and empiricist philosopher, but found Ruse's handling of structuralism "less satisfactory" than of the adaptationist , Darwinian traditions.

[ 4 ] He called Ruse's writing style "bluff, unselfconscious, and opinionated" and finds Ruse sarcastic, "scarcely a neutral observer".

[ 4 ] Michael Ghiselin criticised Ruse as a "politically correct" "academic bigot", disagreed with Ruse's narrative about phylogenetics, and accused him of "completely ignor[ing] recent work such as by Carl Woese , "neglect[ing] data" that contradict his thesis. Ironically, in Ghiselin's view, Ruse's own epistemological ideal for science relied on the idea of Progress.

[ 5 ] Ruse delivered some of the 2001 Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology at the University of Glasgow . His lectures on Evolutionary Naturalism, "A Darwinian Understanding of Epistemology" and "A Darwinian Understanding of Ethics," are collected in The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding (ed. Anthony Sanford, T & T Clark, 2003). Ruse debated regularly with William A. Dembski , a proponent of intelligent design .

[ 6 ] Ruse takes the position that it is possible to reconcile the Christian faith with evolutionary theory.

[ 7 ] Ruse founded the journal Biology and Philosophy , of which he was Emeritus Editor, [ 8 ] and had published numerous books and articles. He cited the influence of his late colleague Ernan McMullin .

[ 9 ] From 2013, Ruse was listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education .

[ 10 ] In 2014, Ruse was named the Bertrand Russell Society 's award winner for his dedication to science and reason.

[ 11 ] Ruse sought to reconcile science and religion, a position which brought him into conflict with Richard Dawkins and Pharyngula science blogger PZ Myers .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Ruse had engaged in heated exchanges with new atheists .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] According to Ruse in 2009, "Richard Dawkins, in his best selling The God Delusion , likens me to Neville Chamberlain , the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler at Munich.

Jerry Coyne reviewed one of my books (Can a Darwinian be a Christian?) using the Orwellian quote that only an intellectual could believe the nonsense I believe in. And non-stop blogger P. Z. Myers has referred to me as a 'clueless gobshite.'"  Ruse said new atheists do the side of science a "grave disservice", a "disservice to scholarship", and that "Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course", [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and that The God Delusion makes him "ashamed to be an atheist".  Ruse concluded, saying "I am proud to be the focus of the invective of the new atheists. They are a bloody disaster".

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Ruse had two children from his first marriage, and was married to his second wife from 1985, with whom he had three children. Ruse was an atheist. He rejected the New Atheism movement.

[ 13 ] Ruse died on 1 November 2024, at the age of 84.

… the new atheists do the side of science a grave disservice … these people do a disservice to scholarship … Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course. Proudly he criticizes that whereof he knows nothing … the poor quality of the argumentation in Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and all of the others in that group … the new atheists are doing terrible political damage to the cause of Creationism fighting. Americans are religious people … They want to be science-friendly, although it is certainly true that many have been seduced by the Creationists. We evolutionists have got to speak to these people. We have got to show them that Darwinism is their friend not their enemy. We have got to get them onside when it comes to science in the classroom. And criticizing good men like Francis Collins, accusing them of fanaticism, is just not going to do the job. Nor is criticizing everyone, like me, who wants to build a bridge to believers – not accepting the beliefs, but willing to respect someone who does have them … The God Delusion makes me ashamed to be an atheist … They are a bloody disaster … ^ a b c Dougherty, T; Gage, LP (2015).
