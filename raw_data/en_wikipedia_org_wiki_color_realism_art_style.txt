Find sources: "Color realism" art style – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Color realism is a fine art style where accurately portrayed colors create a sense of space and form. It employs a flattening of objects into areas of color, where the modulations occur more as a result of an object interacting with the color and light of its environment than the sculptural modeling of form or presentation of textural detail. The actual color of an object, or 'local color', is held secondary to how that color interacts with surrounding light sources that may alter the look of the original color. Warm light of the sun, cool light from the sky, and warm reflected light bouncing off other objects are all examples of how a local color may be affected by its location in space.

[ citation needed ] Earliest proponents of this style include the Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer and Hendrick Terbrugghen .

[ citation needed ] Recent artists working with this style include the Boston School of painters, such as Edmund Tarbell and William McGregor Paxton . These artists combined vibrant Impressionist pastel colors with a more traditional palette, to create color-realist works that have a full range of dark to light values.
