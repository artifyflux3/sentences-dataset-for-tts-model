This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy , which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.

Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution , which is the general study of galaxies , their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take.

The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System is located, is in many ways the best-studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust . The development of radio astronomy , infrared astronomy and submillimetre astronomy in the 20th century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

Subcategories [ edit ] A standard set of subcategories is used by astronomical journals to split up the subject of Galactic Astronomy: [ 1 ] [ citation needed ] abundances – the study of the location of elements heavier than helium bulge – the study of the bulge around the center of the Milky Way center – the study of the central region of the Milky Way disk – the study of the Milky Way disk (the plane upon which most galactic objects are aligned) evolution – the evolution of the Milky Way formation – the formation of the Milky Way fundamental parameters – the fundamental parameters of the Milky Way (mass, size etc.) globular cluster – globular clusters within the Milky Way halo – the large halo around the Milky Way kinematics, and dynamics – the motions of stars and clusters nucleus – the region around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way ( Sagittarius A* ) open clusters and associations – open clusters and associations of stars Solar neighborhood – nearby stars stellar content – numbers and types of stars in the Milky Way structure – the structure (spiral arms etc.) Stellar populations [ edit ] Star clusters Globular clusters Open clusters Interstellar medium [ edit ] Interplanetary space - Interplanetary medium - interplanetary dust Interstellar space - Interstellar medium - interstellar dust Intergalactic space - Intergalactic medium - Intergalactic dust See also [ edit ] Galaxy Milky Way Extragalactic astronomy References [ edit ] ^ "Galactic Astronomy - Subcategories | The English knowledge database" .
