It is a dimensionless quantity that is invariant under similarity transformations of the curve, and that can be used to measure how far the curve is from being a convex curve .

[ 1 ] If the curve is parameterized by its arc length , the total absolute curvature can be expressed by the formula ∫ ∫ | κ κ ( s ) | d s , {\displaystyle \int |\kappa (s)|ds,} where s is the arc length parameter and κ is the curvature.
This is almost the same as the formula for the total curvature , but differs in using the absolute value instead of the signed curvature.

[ 2 ] Because the total curvature of a simple closed curve in the Euclidean plane is always exactly 2 π , the total absolute curvature of a simple closed curve is also always at least 2 π . It is exactly 2 π for a convex curve , and greater than 2 π whenever the curve has any non-convexities.

[ 2 ] When a smooth simple closed curve undergoes the curve-shortening flow , its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically until the curve becomes convex, after which its total absolute curvature remains fixed at 2 π until the curve collapses to a point.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The total absolute curvature may also be defined for curves in three-dimensional Euclidean space . Again, it is at least 2 π (this is Fenchel's theorem ), but may be larger. If a space curve is surrounded by a sphere, the total absolute curvature of the sphere equals the expected value of the central projection of the curve onto a plane tangent to a random point of the sphere.

[ 5 ] According to the Fáry–Milnor theorem , every nontrivial smooth knot must have total absolute curvature greater than 4 π .
