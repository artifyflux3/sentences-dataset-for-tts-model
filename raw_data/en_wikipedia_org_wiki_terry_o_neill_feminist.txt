She was the president of the National Organization for Women (NOW) from 2009 to 2017, as well as president of the NOW Foundation and chair of the NOW Political Action Committees.

[ 1 ] According to O'Neill her first husband beat her after a dispute when she was 22 years old, and she left him to live with her parents in New Orleans.

[ 2 ] She is amicably divorced from her second husband.

[ 2 ] Early career [ edit ] O'Neill got her start in politics in the early 1990s when David Duke ran for governor of Louisiana. At the time she was a professor of Law at Tulane University in New Orleans. She signed on with the Stop Duke Campaign and contributed by going door to door in her uptown neighborhood getting out the vote against Duke. The following year she joined NOW.

She served as NOW's vice president for membership from 2001 to 2005.

[ 3 ] She taught feminist legal theory and international women's rights law, corporate law and legal ethics at Tulane and the UC Davis School of Law .

[ 2 ] Agenda [ edit ] The Washington Post said she "campaigned to reenergize what she called an outsider strategy of 'tapping into energy and outrage' felt by grass-roots feminists across the country over 'the ground we lost' during the Bush administration".

[ 2 ] NOW addresses are abortion rights , reproductive rights issues, violence against women , constitutional equality , promoting diversity , ending racism, LGBT rights , and economic justice .

[ 8 ] She was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment , which attempted to place limits on taxpayer-funding of abortions (except in the cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother) in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Care Act .

[ 9 ] The amendment was ultimately not included in the bill.

O'Neill has said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue.
