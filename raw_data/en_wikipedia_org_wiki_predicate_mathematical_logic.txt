In logic , a predicate is a symbol that represents a property or a relation. For instance, in the first-order formula P ( a ) {\displaystyle P(a)} , the symbol P {\displaystyle P} is a predicate that applies to the individual constant a {\displaystyle a} . Similarly, in the formula R ( a , b ) {\displaystyle R(a,b)} , the symbol R {\displaystyle R} is a predicate that applies to the individual constants a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} .

According to Gottlob Frege , the meaning of a predicate is exactly a function from the domain of objects to the truth values "true" and "false".

In the semantics of logic , predicates are interpreted as relations . For instance, in a standard semantics for first-order logic, the formula R ( a , b ) {\displaystyle R(a,b)} would be true on an interpretation if the entities denoted by a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} stand in the relation denoted by R {\displaystyle R} . Since predicates are non-logical symbols , they can denote different relations depending on the interpretation given to them. While first-order logic only includes predicates that apply to individual objects, other logics may allow predicates that apply to collections of objects defined by other predicates.

Predicates in different systems [ edit ] A predicate is a statement or mathematical assertion that contains variables, sometimes referred to as predicate variables, and may be true or false depending on those variables’ value or values.

In propositional logic , atomic formulas are sometimes regarded as zero-place predicates.

[ 1 ] In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0- arity ) predicates.

In first-order logic , a predicate forms an atomic formula when applied to an appropriate number of terms .

In set theory with the law of excluded middle , predicates are understood to be characteristic functions or set indicator functions (i.e., functions from a set element to a truth value ).

Set-builder notation makes use of predicates to define sets.

In autoepistemic logic , which rejects the law of excluded middle, predicates may be true, false, or simply unknown . In particular, a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.

In fuzzy logic , the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.
