Whittington Richard Alan Fortey (15 February 1946 – 7 March 2025) was a British palaeontologist , natural historian, writer and television presenter, who served as president of the Geological Society of London for its bicentennial year of 2007. As a paleontologist, he specialised on trilobites and other extinct arthropods, as well as the life and paleogeography of the Paleozoic era, particularly the Ordovician .

Background [ edit ] Fortey was born in Ealing , west London in 1946, to Frank Fortey, who ran two fishing tackle shops, and Margaret Wilshin. He spent much of his early years "half-wild in the countryside" near Newbury in Berkshire, where his family owned a caravan and later a cottage by a chalk stream.

[ 1 ] During a school trip to Pembrokeshire when he was 14, Fortey discovered his first trilobite. He later recalled this moment with poetic intensity: The rock simply parted around the animal like some sort of revelation. Surely what I held was the textbook come alive. The long, thin eyes of the trilobite regarded me and I returned the gaze. More compelling than any pair of blue eyes, there was a shiver of recognition across 500 million years.

[ 2 ] [ 1 ] He won a place at Ealing Grammar School for Boys . While preparing to sit his scholarship exams for King's College, Cambridge , his father died in a car crash.

[ 3 ] He read Natural Sciences specialising in geology [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and got a first class degree in 1968. His natural sciences tutor as an undergraduate was Harry B Whittington , [ 1 ] one of the world’s foremost experts on trilobites.

As a 21-year-old undergraduate, Fortey went on an expedition to Spitsbergen in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard collecting triobites. The trilobites he discovered attracted international attention, including from the palaeontologist, David Bruton, who organised a second expedition to Spitsbergen in 1971 to collect further samples. All the 100 species of trilobites he discovered were new to science and provided the basis for his PhD.

[ 6 ] [ 1 ] He received a PhD and DSc from the University of Cambridge . He did his PhD under Harry B Whttington.

'I thought: "I’d like to be that,"' Fortey recalled".

[ 7 ] In 1970, he became a research fellow at the Natural History Museum, and spent his entire career there as a palaeontologist.

[ 8 ] He retired in 2006.

[ 7 ] His speciality was trilobites and graptolites , especially those from the Ordovician and their systematics, evolution and modes of life. He was also involved in research on Ordovician palaeogeography and correlation; arthropod evolution, especially the origin of major groups and the relationships between divergence times, as revealed by molecular evidence and the fossil record.

His scientific output includes over 250 papers on trilobites, Ordovician stratigraphy and palaeogeography. In addition, he was the author of popular science books on a range of subjects including geology, palaeontology, evolution and natural history, e.g. Trilobite! or Dry Store Room no.1.

[ 9 ] Television [ edit ] From 2012, he was a television presenter appearing on BBC Four presenting natural history programmes; was Collier Professor for the Public Understanding of Science and Technology at the Institute of Advanced Studies in the University of Bristol 2002 and visiting professor of Palaeobiology at the University of Oxford 1999–2009.

Fortey appeared in several of David Attenborough's programmes, including the second episode of David Attenborough 's Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives in 1989, as well as First Life in 2010, travelling with the presenter to the Atlas mountains to find and film trilobite fossils. He contributed to the speculative Discovery Channel documentary series The Future Is Wild .

In 2012, Fortey presented the BBC Four series Survivors: Nature's Indestructible Creatures , which took a global look at modern-day species whose ancestors survived mass extinction events in the Earth's history, [ 10 ] while in 2013 he presented the BBC Four programme The Secret Life of Rock Pools , which aired on 16 April 2013.

[ 11 ] In 2014, Fortey presented the BBC Four three part series Fossil Wonderlands: Nature's Hidden Treasures , [ 12 ] followed by The Magic of Mushrooms , in which he showed that fungi had close but still poorly understood inter-relationships with plants and animals including man.
In 2016, he presented the BBC Four programme Nature’s Wonderlands: Islands of Evolution , a three part series on evolution on islands.

[ 13 ] He appeared on BBC Two 's University Challenge – The Professionals in 2004, as a member of the Palaeontological Association team, who beat the Eden Project .

[ 14 ] Grim’s Dyke Wood [ edit ] Using the money he made from his TV work Fortey bought four acres of woodland in Lambridge Wood , the section of the wood being called Grim’s Dyke Wood (Named after Grim's Ditch) and he wrote up his investigation into its fauna and flora in the book: The Wood for the Trees .

[ 15 ] Honours [ edit ] Fortey was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to palaeontology and geology.

[ 16 ] Death [ edit ] Fortey died after a short illness on 7 March 2025, at the age of 79.
