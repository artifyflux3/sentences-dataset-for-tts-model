Social model of disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Discrimination of excellence [ 1 ] is the violation of formal equality of opportunity [ 2 ] and meritocracy , [ 3 ] which reward merits of individuals and overachievement .

[ 1 ] Discrimination of excellence can be caused by different reasons, including legacy preferences , [ 4 ] nepotism , substantive equality , [ 2 ] affirmative action [ 5 ] or random luck .

[ 6 ] Gifted education [ edit ] Gifted education has been criticized on substantive equality grounds.

[ 7 ] College admissions [ edit ] Legacy preferences for college admissions have been criticized.

[ 4 ] Discrimination against excellent students during admissions to Ivy League has been debated during 2019 college admissions bribery scandal . The United States Department of Justice scrutinized higher education over potential systemic biases in college admission standards that would underweight transparent standardized testing criteria due to affirmative action .

[ 8 ] Harvard College has been sued in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College due to individuals outperforming on standardized college admission tests but not being admitted. Non-merit-based admissions practices, degree conferral or promotion standards have been criticized.

[ 9 ] Severe discrimination of excellence [ edit ] Academics, teacher and students were intentionally targeted during Cambodian genocide .

[ 5 ] Khmer Rouge chose new teachers by ideology , affirmative action , and not by teaching excellence, which resulted in high illiteracy .

[ 5 ] See also [ edit ] Law of Jante Merit, excellence, and intelligence (MEI) – framework that emphasizes selecting candidates based solely on their merit, achievements, skills, abilities, intelligence and contributions Tall poppy syndrome References [ edit ] ^ a b Puaschunder, Julia (August 2019).
