Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result which is the inverse of the result with unswapped arguments. The notion inverse refers to a group structure on the operation's codomain , possibly with another operation.

Subtraction is an anticommutative operation because commuting the operands of a − b gives b − a = −( a − b ); for example, 2 − 10 = −(10 − 2) = −8.

Another prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the Lie bracket .

In mathematical physics , where symmetry is of central importance, or even just in multilinear algebra these operations are mostly (multilinear with respect to some vector structures and then) called antisymmetric operations , and when they are not already of arity greater than two, extended in an associative setting to cover more than two arguments .

Definition [ edit ] If A , B {\displaystyle A,B} are two abelian groups , a bilinear map f : : A 2 → → B {\displaystyle f\colon A^{2}\to B} is anticommutative if for all x , y ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle x,y\in A} we have f ( x , y ) = − − f ( y , x ) .

{\displaystyle f(x,y)=-f(y,x).} More generally, a multilinear map g : A n → → B {\displaystyle g:A^{n}\to B} is anticommutative if for all x 1 , … … x n ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle x_{1},\dots x_{n}\in A} we have g ( x 1 , x 2 , … … x n ) = sgn ( σ σ ) g ( x σ σ ( 1 ) , x σ σ ( 2 ) , … … x σ σ ( n ) ) {\displaystyle g(x_{1},x_{2},\dots x_{n})={\text{sgn}}(\sigma )g(x_{\sigma (1)},x_{\sigma (2)},\dots x_{\sigma (n)})} where sgn ( σ σ ) {\displaystyle {\text{sgn}}(\sigma )} is the sign of the permutation σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } .

Properties [ edit ] If the abelian group B {\displaystyle B} has no 2- torsion , implying that if x = − − x {\displaystyle x=-x} then x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} , then any anticommutative bilinear map f : : A 2 → → B {\displaystyle f\colon A^{2}\to B} satisfies f ( x , x ) = 0.

{\displaystyle f(x,x)=0.} More generally, by transposing two elements, any anticommutative multilinear map g : : A n → → B {\displaystyle g\colon A^{n}\to B} satisfies g ( x 1 , x 2 , … … x n ) = 0 {\displaystyle g(x_{1},x_{2},\dots x_{n})=0} if any of the x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} are equal; such a map is said to be alternating . Conversely, using multilinearity, any alternating map is anticommutative. In the binary case this works as follows: if f : : A 2 → → B {\displaystyle f\colon A^{2}\to B} is alternating then by bilinearity we have f ( x + y , x + y ) = f ( x , x ) + f ( x , y ) + f ( y , x ) + f ( y , y ) = f ( x , y ) + f ( y , x ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x+y,x+y)=f(x,x)+f(x,y)+f(y,x)+f(y,y)=f(x,y)+f(y,x)=0} and the proof in the multilinear case is the same but in only two of the inputs.

Examples [ edit ] Examples of anticommutative binary operations include: Cross product Lie bracket of a Lie algebra Lie bracket of a Lie ring Subtraction See also [ edit ] Commutativity Commutator Exterior algebra Graded-commutative ring Operation (mathematics) Symmetry in mathematics Particle statistics (for anticommutativity in physics).
