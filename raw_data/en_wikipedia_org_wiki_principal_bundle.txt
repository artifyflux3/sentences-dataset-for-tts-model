( June 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a principal bundle [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] is a mathematical object that formalizes some of the essential features of the Cartesian product X × × G {\displaystyle X\times G} of a space X {\displaystyle X} with a group G {\displaystyle G} . In the same way as with the Cartesian product, a principal bundle P {\displaystyle P} is equipped with An action of G {\displaystyle G} on P {\displaystyle P} , analogous to ( x , g ) h = ( x , g h ) {\displaystyle (x,g)h=(x,gh)} for a product space (where ( x , g ) {\displaystyle (x,g)} is an element of P {\displaystyle P} and h {\displaystyle h} is the group element from G {\displaystyle G} ; the group action is conventionally a right action).

A projection onto X {\displaystyle X} . For a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, ( x , g ) ↦ ↦ x {\displaystyle (x,g)\mapsto x} .

Unless it is the product space X × × G {\displaystyle X\times G} , a principal bundle lacks a preferred choice of identity cross-section; it has no preferred analog of x ↦ ↦ ( x , e ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto (x,e)} . Likewise, there is not generally a projection onto G {\displaystyle G} generalizing the projection onto the second factor, X × × G → → G {\displaystyle X\times G\to G} that exists for the Cartesian product. They may also have a complicated topology that prevents them from being realized as a product space even if a number of arbitrary choices are made to try to define such a structure by defining it on smaller pieces of the space.

A common example of a principal bundle is the frame bundle F ( E ) {\displaystyle F(E)} of a vector bundle E {\displaystyle E} , which consists of all ordered bases of the vector space attached to each point.  The group G , {\displaystyle G,} in this case, is the general linear group , which acts on the right in the usual way : by changes of basis .  Since there is no natural way to choose an ordered basis of a vector space, a frame bundle lacks a canonical choice of identity cross-section.

Principal bundles have important applications in topology and differential geometry and mathematical gauge theory . They have also found application in physics where they form part of the foundational framework of physical gauge theories .

Formal definition [ edit ] A principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle, where G {\displaystyle G} denotes any topological group , is a fiber bundle π π : P → → X {\displaystyle \pi :P\to X} together with a continuous right action P × × G → → P {\displaystyle P\times G\to P} such that G {\displaystyle G} preserves the fibers of P {\displaystyle P} (i.e. if y ∈ ∈ P x {\displaystyle y\in P_{x}} then y g ∈ ∈ P x {\displaystyle yg\in P_{x}} for all g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} ) and acts freely and transitively (meaning each fiber is a G-torsor ) on them in such a way that for each x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and y ∈ ∈ P x {\displaystyle y\in P_{x}} , the map G → → P x {\displaystyle G\to P_{x}} sending g {\displaystyle g} to y g {\displaystyle yg} is a homeomorphism. In particular each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group G {\displaystyle G} itself. Frequently, one requires the base space X {\displaystyle X} to be Hausdorff and possibly paracompact .

Since the group action preserves the fibers of π π : P → → X {\displaystyle \pi :P\to X} and acts transitively, it follows that the orbits of the G {\displaystyle G} -action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space P / G {\displaystyle P/G} is homeomorphic to the base space X {\displaystyle X} . Because the action is free and transitive, the fibers have the structure of G-torsors. A G {\displaystyle G} -torsor is a space that is homeomorphic to G {\displaystyle G} but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element .

An equivalent definition of a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle is as a G {\displaystyle G} -bundle π π : P → → X {\displaystyle \pi :P\to X} with fiber G {\displaystyle G} where the structure group acts on the fiber by left multiplication. Since right multiplication by G {\displaystyle G} on the fiber commutes with the action of the structure group, there exists an invariant notion of right multiplication by G {\displaystyle G} on P {\displaystyle P} . The fibers of π π {\displaystyle \pi } then become right G {\displaystyle G} -torsors for this action.

The definitions above are for arbitrary topological spaces. One can also define principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundles in the category of smooth manifolds . Here π π : P → → X {\displaystyle \pi :P\to X} is required to be a smooth map between smooth manifolds, G {\displaystyle G} is required to be a Lie group , and the corresponding action on P {\displaystyle P} should be smooth.

Examples [ edit ] Trivial bundle and sections [ edit ] Over an open ball U ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , or R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , with induced coordinates x 1 , … … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}} , any principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle is isomorphic to a trivial bundle π π : U × × G → → U {\displaystyle \pi :U\times G\to U} and a smooth section s ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( π π ) {\displaystyle s\in \Gamma (\pi )} is equivalently given by a (smooth) function s ^ ^ : U → → G {\displaystyle {\hat {s}}:U\to G} since s ( u ) = ( u , s ^ ^ ( u ) ) ∈ ∈ U × × G {\displaystyle s(u)=(u,{\hat {s}}(u))\in U\times G} for some smooth function. For example, if G = U ( 2 ) {\displaystyle G=U(2)} , the Lie group of 2 × × 2 {\displaystyle 2\times 2} unitary matrices , then a section can be constructed by considering four real-valued functions ϕ ϕ ( x ) , ψ ψ ( x ) , Δ Δ ( x ) , θ θ ( x ) : U → → R {\displaystyle \phi (x),\psi (x),\Delta (x),\theta (x):U\to \mathbb {R} } and applying them to the parameterization s ^ ^ ( x ) = e i ϕ ϕ ( x ) [ e i ψ ψ ( x ) 0 0 e − − i ψ ψ ( x ) ] [ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ( x ) sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ( x ) − − sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ( x ) cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ( x ) ] [ e i Δ Δ ( x ) 0 0 e − − i Δ Δ ( x ) ] .

{\displaystyle {\hat {s}}(x)=e^{i\phi (x)}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\psi (x)}&0\\0&e^{-i\psi (x)}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta (x)&\sin \theta (x)\\-\sin \theta (x)&\cos \theta (x)\\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\Delta (x)}&0\\0&e^{-i\Delta (x)}\end{bmatrix}}.} This same procedure valids by taking a parameterization of a collection of matrices defining a Lie group G {\displaystyle G} and by considering the set of functions from a patch of the base space U ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle U\subset X} to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and inserting them into the parameterization.

Other examples [ edit ] Non-trivial Z /2 Z principal bundle over the circle. There is no well-defined way to identify which point corresponds to +1 or -1 in each fibre. This bundle is non-trivial as there is no globally defined section of the projection π .

The prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} , often denoted F M {\displaystyle FM} or G L ( M ) {\displaystyle GL(M)} . Here the fiber over a point x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} is the set of all frames (i.e. ordered bases) for the tangent space T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} . The general linear group G L ( n , R ) {\displaystyle GL(n,\mathbb {R} )} acts freely and transitively on these frames. These fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal G L ( n , R ) {\displaystyle GL(n,\mathbb {R} )} -bundle over M {\displaystyle M} .

Variations on the above example include the orthonormal frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold . Here the frames are required to be orthonormal with respect to the metric . The structure group is the orthogonal group O ( n ) {\displaystyle O(n)} . The example also works for bundles other than the tangent bundle; if E {\displaystyle E} is any vector bundle of rank k {\displaystyle k} over M {\displaystyle M} , then the bundle of frames of E {\displaystyle E} is a principal G L ( k , R ) {\displaystyle GL(k,\mathbb {R} )} -bundle, sometimes denoted F ( E ) {\displaystyle F(E)} .

A normal (regular) covering space p : C → → X {\displaystyle p:C\to X} is a principal bundle where the structure group G = π π 1 ( X ) / p ∗ ∗ ( π π 1 ( C ) ) {\displaystyle G=\pi _{1}(X)/p_{*}(\pi _{1}(C))} acts on the fibres of p {\displaystyle p} via the monodromy action . In particular, the universal cover of X {\displaystyle X} is a principal bundle over X {\displaystyle X} with structure group π π 1 ( X ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(X)} (since the universal cover is simply connected and thus π π 1 ( C ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(C)} is trivial).

Let G {\displaystyle G} be a Lie group and let H {\displaystyle H} be a closed subgroup (not necessarily normal ). Then G {\displaystyle G} is a principal H {\displaystyle H} -bundle over the (left) coset space G / H {\displaystyle G/H} . Here the action of H {\displaystyle H} on G {\displaystyle G} is just right multiplication. The fibers are the left cosets of H {\displaystyle H} (in this case there is a distinguished fiber, the one containing the identity, which is naturally isomorphic to H {\displaystyle H} ).

Consider the projection π π : S 1 → → S 1 {\displaystyle \pi :S^{1}\to S^{1}} given by z ↦ ↦ z 2 {\displaystyle z\mapsto z^{2}} . This principal Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} -bundle is the associated bundle of the Möbius strip .   Besides the trivial bundle, this is the only principal Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} -bundle over S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} .

Projective spaces provide some more interesting examples of principal bundles. Recall that the n {\displaystyle n} - sphere S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} is a two-fold covering space of real projective space R P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \mathbb {P} ^{n}} . The natural action of O ( 1 ) {\displaystyle O(1)} on S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} gives it the structure of a principal O ( 1 ) {\displaystyle O(1)} -bundle over R P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \mathbb {P} ^{n}} . Likewise, S 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle S^{2n+1}} is a principal U ( 1 ) {\displaystyle U(1)} -bundle over complex projective space C P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \mathbb {P} ^{n}} and S 4 n + 3 {\displaystyle S^{4n+3}} is a principal S p ( 1 ) {\displaystyle Sp(1)} -bundle over quaternionic projective space H P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} \mathbb {P} ^{n}} . We then have a series of principal bundles for each positive n {\displaystyle n} : O ( 1 ) → → S ( R n + 1 ) → → R P n {\displaystyle {\mbox{O}}(1)\to S(\mathbb {R} ^{n+1})\to \mathbb {RP} ^{n}} U ( 1 ) → → S ( C n + 1 ) → → C P n {\displaystyle {\mbox{U}}(1)\to S(\mathbb {C} ^{n+1})\to \mathbb {CP} ^{n}} Sp ( 1 ) → → S ( H n + 1 ) → → H P n .

{\displaystyle {\mbox{Sp}}(1)\to S(\mathbb {H} ^{n+1})\to \mathbb {HP} ^{n}.} Here S ( V ) {\displaystyle S(V)} denotes the unit sphere in V {\displaystyle V} (equipped with the Euclidean metric). For all of these examples the n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} cases give the so-called Hopf bundles .

Basic properties [ edit ] Trivializations and cross sections [ edit ] One of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial , i.e.

isomorphic to a product bundle. For principal bundles there is a convenient characterization of triviality: Proposition .

A principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global section .

The same is not true in general for other fiber bundles. For instance, vector bundles always have a zero section whether they are trivial or not and sphere bundles may admit many global sections without being trivial.

The same fact applies to local trivializations of principal bundles. Let π : P → X be a principal G -bundle. An open set U in X admits a local trivialization if and only if there exists a local section on U . Given a local trivialization Φ Φ : π π − − 1 ( U ) → → U × × G {\displaystyle \Phi :\pi ^{-1}(U)\to U\times G} one can define an associated local section s : U → → π π − − 1 ( U ) ; s ( x ) = Φ Φ − − 1 ( x , e ) {\displaystyle s:U\to \pi ^{-1}(U);s(x)=\Phi ^{-1}(x,e)\,} where e is the identity in G . Conversely, given a section s one defines a trivialization Φ by Φ Φ − − 1 ( x , g ) = s ( x ) ⋅ ⋅ g .

{\displaystyle \Phi ^{-1}(x,g)=s(x)\cdot g.} The simple transitivity of the G action  on the fibers of P guarantees that this map is a bijection , it is also a homeomorphism . The local trivializations defined by local sections are G - equivariant in the following sense. If we write Φ Φ : π π − − 1 ( U ) → → U × × G {\displaystyle \Phi :\pi ^{-1}(U)\to U\times G} in the form Φ Φ ( p ) = ( π π ( p ) , φ φ ( p ) ) , {\displaystyle \Phi (p)=(\pi (p),\varphi (p)),} then the map φ φ : P → → G {\displaystyle \varphi :P\to G} satisfies φ φ ( p ⋅ ⋅ g ) = φ φ ( p ) g .

{\displaystyle \varphi (p\cdot g)=\varphi (p)g.} Equivariant trivializations therefore preserve the G -torsor structure of the fibers. In terms of the associated local section s the map φ is given by φ φ ( s ( x ) ⋅ ⋅ g ) = g .

{\displaystyle \varphi (s(x)\cdot g)=g.} The local version of the cross section theorem then states that the equivariant local trivializations of a principal bundle are in one-to-one correspondence with local sections.

Given an equivariant local trivialization ({ U i }, {Φ i }) of P , we have local sections s i on each U i . On overlaps these must be related by the action of the structure group G . In fact, the relationship is provided by the transition functions t i j : U i ∩ ∩ U j → → G .

{\displaystyle t_{ij}:U_{i}\cap U_{j}\to G\,.} By gluing the local trivializations together using these transition functions, one may reconstruct the original principal bundle. This is an example of the fiber bundle construction theorem .
For any x ∈ U i ∩ U j we have s j ( x ) = s i ( x ) ⋅ ⋅ t i j ( x ) .

{\displaystyle s_{j}(x)=s_{i}(x)\cdot t_{ij}(x).} Characterization of smooth principal bundles [ edit ] If π π : P → → X {\displaystyle \pi :P\to X} is a smooth principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle then G {\displaystyle G} acts freely and properly on P {\displaystyle P} so that the orbit space P / G {\displaystyle P/G} is diffeomorphic to the base space X {\displaystyle X} . It turns out that these properties completely characterize smooth principal bundles. That is, if P {\displaystyle P} is a smooth manifold, G {\displaystyle G} a Lie group and μ μ : P × × G → → P {\displaystyle \mu :P\times G\to P} a smooth, free, and proper right action then P / G {\displaystyle P/G} is a smooth manifold, the natural projection π π : P → → P / G {\displaystyle \pi :P\to P/G} is a smooth submersion , and P {\displaystyle P} is a smooth principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle over P / G {\displaystyle P/G} .

Use of the notion [ edit ] Reduction of the structure group [ edit ] See also: Reduction of the structure group Given a subgroup H of G one may consider the  bundle P / H {\displaystyle P/H} whose fibers are homeomorphic to the coset space G / H {\displaystyle G/H} .  If the new bundle admits a global section, then one says that the section is a reduction of the structure group from G {\displaystyle G} to H {\displaystyle H} .  The reason for this name is that the (fiberwise) inverse image of the values of this section form a subbundle of P {\displaystyle P} that is a principal H {\displaystyle H} -bundle. If H {\displaystyle H} is the identity, then a section of P {\displaystyle P} itself is a reduction of the structure group to the identity. Reductions of the structure group do not in general exist.

Many topological questions about the structure of a manifold or the structure of bundles over it that are associated to a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle may be rephrased as questions about the admissibility of the reduction of the structure group (from G {\displaystyle G} to H {\displaystyle H} ). For example: The frame bundle F ( E ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(E)} of the Möbius strip E {\displaystyle E} is a non-trivial principal Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } -bundle over the circle.

A 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} -dimensional real manifold admits an almost-complex structure if the frame bundle on the manifold, whose fibers are G L ( 2 n , R ) {\displaystyle GL(2n,\mathbb {R} )} , can be reduced to the group G L ( n , C ) ⊆ ⊆ G L ( 2 n , R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (n,\mathbb {C} )\subseteq \mathrm {GL} (2n,\mathbb {R} )} .

An n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional real manifold admits a k {\displaystyle k} -plane field if the frame bundle can be reduced to the structure group G L ( k , R ) ⊆ ⊆ G L ( n , R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (k,\mathbb {R} )\subseteq \mathrm {GL} (n,\mathbb {R} )} .

A manifold is orientable if and only if its frame bundle can be reduced to the special orthogonal group , S O ( n ) ⊆ ⊆ G L ( n , R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)\subseteq \mathrm {GL} (n,\mathbb {R} )} .

A manifold has spin structure if and only if its frame bundle can be further reduced from S O ( n ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)} to S p i n ( n ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} (n)} the Spin group , which maps to S O ( n ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)} as a double cover.

Also note: an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold admits n {\displaystyle n} vector fields that are linearly independent at each point if and only if its frame bundle admits a global section. In this case, the manifold is called parallelizable .

Associated vector bundles and frames [ edit ] See also: Frame bundle If P {\displaystyle P} is a principal G {\displaystyle G} -bundle and V {\displaystyle V} is a linear representation of G {\displaystyle G} , then one can construct a vector bundle E = P × × G V {\displaystyle E=P\times _{G}V} with fibre V {\displaystyle V} , as the quotient of the product P {\displaystyle P} × V {\displaystyle V} by the diagonal action of G {\displaystyle G} . This is a special case of the associated bundle construction, and E {\displaystyle E} is called an associated vector bundle to P {\displaystyle P} . If the representation of G {\displaystyle G} on V {\displaystyle V} is faithful , so that G {\displaystyle G} is a subgroup of the general linear group GL( V {\displaystyle V} ), then E {\displaystyle E} is a G {\displaystyle G} -bundle and P {\displaystyle P} provides a reduction of structure group of the frame bundle of E {\displaystyle E} from G L ( V ) {\displaystyle GL(V)} to G {\displaystyle G} . This is the sense in which principal bundles provide an abstract formulation of the theory of frame bundles.

Classification of principal bundles [ edit ] Main article: Classifying space Any topological group G admits a classifying space BG : the quotient by the action of G of some weakly contractible space, e.g.

, a topological space with vanishing homotopy groups . The classifying space has the property that any G principal bundle over a paracompact manifold B is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle EG → BG .

[ 5 ] In fact, more is true, as the set of isomorphism classes of principal G bundles over the base B identifies with the set of homotopy classes of maps B → BG .
