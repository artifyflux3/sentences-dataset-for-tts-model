[ 1 ] Although it was founded in 1901, the press did not actually publish any books until 1911.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The press originally printed only examination books and the university calendar.

[ 3 ] Its first scholarly book was a work by a classics professor at University College, Toronto .

[ 3 ] The press took control of the university bookstore in 1933.

[ 3 ] It employed a novel typesetting method to print issues of the Canadian Journal of Mathematics , founded in 1949.

[ 4 ] The press has always had close ties with University of Toronto Libraries . The press was partially located in the library from 1910-1920. The University Librarian Hugh Hornby Langton, the lead librarian of the University of Toronto Libraries, served as the first general editor of the University of Toronto Press.

[ 5 ] Sidney Earle Smith , president of the University of Toronto in the late 1940s and 1950s, instituted a new governance arrangement for the press modelled on the governing structure of the university as a whole (on the standard Canadian university governance model defined by the Flavelle commission ). Henceforth, the press's business affairs and editorial decision-making would be governed by separate committees, the latter by academic faculty.

[ 6 ] A committee composed of Vincent Bladen , George Williams Brown (general editor of the press from 1951 [ 7 ] ), and A. S. P. Woodhouse studied the publishing policies of American university presses to inform the structure of the press's publishing division.

[ 6 ] Beginning in 1971, the press printed its books simultaneously on paper and microfiche .

[ 8 ] The press is currently a member of the Association of University Presses .
