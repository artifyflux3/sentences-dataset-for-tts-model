1033 Area 371 ha UNESCO Region Europe and North America Endangered 2017 ( 2017 ) –present [ 7 ] Vienna ( / v i ˈ ɛ n ə / ⓘ vee- EN -ə ; [ 8 ] [ 9 ] German: Wien [viːn] ⓘ ; Austro-Bavarian : Wean [veɐ̯n] ) is the capital , most populous city , and one of nine states of Austria . It is Austria's primate city , with just over two million inhabitants.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Its larger metropolitan area has a population of nearly 2.9 million, [ 12 ] representing nearly one-third of the country's population. Vienna is the cultural , economic , and political center of the country, the fifth-largest city by population in the European Union , and the most populous of the cities on the river Danube .

The city lies on the eastern edge of the Vienna Woods ( Wienerwald ), the northeasternmost foothills of the Alps , that separate Vienna from the more western parts of Austria, at the transition to the Pannonian Basin . It sits on the Danube , and is traversed by the highly regulated Wienfluss ( Vienna River ). Vienna is completely surrounded by Lower Austria , and lies around 50 km (31 mi) west of Slovakia and its capital Bratislava , 60 km (37 mi) northwest of Hungary , and 60 km (37 mi) south of Moravia ( Czech Republic ).

The Romans founded a castrum at Vienna, which they called Vindobona , in the 1st century, when the region belonged to the province of Pannonia . It was elevated to a municipium with Roman city rights in 212. This was followed by a time in the sphere of influence of the Lombards and later the Pannonian Avars , when Slavs formed the majority of the region's population.

[ a ] From the 8th century on, the region was settled by the Baiuvarii . In 1155, Vienna became the seat of the Babenbergs , who ruled Austria from 976 to 1246. In 1221, Vienna was granted city rights. During the 16th century, the Habsburgs , who had succeeded the Babenbergs, established Vienna as the seat of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire , a position it held until the empire's dissolution in 1806, with only a brief interruption. With the formation of the Austrian Empire in 1804, Vienna became the capital of it and all its successor states.

Throughout the modern era , Vienna has been among the largest German-speaking cities in the world. It was the largest in the 18th and 19th century, peaking at two million inhabitants before it was overtaken by Berlin at the beginning of the 20th century.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Vienna is host to many major international organizations , including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE . In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . In July 2017, it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger .

[ 16 ] Vienna is renowned for its rich musical heritage, having been home to many celebrated classical composers, including Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner , Haydn , Mahler , Mozart , Schoenberg , Schubert , Johann Strauss I , and Johann Strauss II .

[ 17 ] It played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The city was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud .

[ 18 ] The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße , which is lined with grand buildings, monuments, and parks.

[ 19 ] Etymology See also: Names of European cities in different languages: U–Z § V Vienna was known to the Romans as Vindobona , a borrowing of a Celtic toponym meaning either "white place" or "place of Vindos" (a personal name).

[ 20 ] This name disappeared from the record after the 6th century, occurring for the last time in Jordanes ' Getica . The German name for the city, Wien – of which Vienna is a Latinized form – is unrelated, deriving from the River Wien (compare Steyr , Enns , and Krems , which all take their names from the rivers whose mouths they lie at). It occurs for the first time in the Salzburg Annals , which note that a battle was fought at a place named Wenia in the year 881. The name may ultimately mean "forest river", from Celtic * Vedunia .

[ 21 ] Bécs , the Hungarian name for Vienna (borrowed into Serbo-Croatian as Beč and into Ottoman Turkish as Beç ), probably derives from a word meaning "kiln", and may date from a period in the 10th century when the region came under temporary Hungarian domination.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In Slovene, the city is called Dunaj , which in other Slavic languages denotes the River Danube.

History Main article: History of Vienna For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Vienna .

Historical affiliations Duchy of Austria 1156–1453 Archduchy of Austria 1453–1485 Kingdom of Hungary 1485–1490 Archduchy of Austria 1490–1804 Austrian Empire 1804–1867 Austria-Hungary 1867–1918 First Austrian Republic 1919–1934 Federal State of Austria 1934–1938 Nazi Germany 1938–1945 Allied-occupied Austria 1945–1955 Austria 1955–present Roman period Main article: Vindobona In the 1st century, the Romans set up the military camp of Vindobona in Pannonia on the site of today's Vienna city center near the Danube with an adjoining civilian town to secure the borders of the Roman Empire . Construction of the legionary camp began around 97 AD. At its peak, Vindobona had a population of around 15,000 people. It was a part of a trade and communications network across the Empire. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius may have died here in 180 AD during a campaign against the Marcomanni .

After a Germanic invasion in the second century the city was rebuilt. It served as a seat of the Roman government until the fifth century, when the population fled due to the Huns invasion of Pannonia. The city was abandoned for several centuries.

Evidence of the Romans in the city is plentiful. Remains of the military camp have been found under the city, as well as fragments of the canal system and figurines.

Middle Ages Close ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk Saint Colman (or Koloman, Irish Colmán , derived from colm "dove") is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil (Virgil the Geometer) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna's great Schottenstift monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.
In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March , a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria . This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria . Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1155, Henry II, Duke of Austria moved the Babenberg family residence with the founding of the Schottenstift from Klosterneuburg in Lower Austria to Vienna.

[ 24 ] From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.

[ 25 ] Hungary occupied the city between 1485 and 1490. Vienna became at the turn to the 16th century the seat of the Aulic Council [ 26 ] and subsequently later in the 16th century of the Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire with an interruption between at the turn to the 17th century until 1806, becoming an important center in the empire.

[ 27 ] In the 16th and 17th centuries, Christian forces twice stopped Ottoman armies outside Vienna, in the 1529 siege of Vienna and the 1683 Battle of Vienna . The Great Plague of Vienna ravaged the city in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.

[ 28 ] Austrian Empire and early 20th century Further information: Austrian Empire Revolutionaries in Vienna with German tricolor flags , 1848 In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars , Vienna became the capital of the newly formed Austrian Empire . The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15. The city also saw major uprisings against Habsburg rule in 1848 , which were suppressed. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 , Vienna remained the capital of what became the Austro-Hungarian Empire . The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the First Viennese School (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied. During the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the Ringstraße , a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I , Vienna became the capital of the Republic of German-Austria , and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria .

From the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of modernism . A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as Johannes Brahms , Anton Bruckner , Gustav Mahler , and Richard Strauss .
The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the Vienna Secession movement in art, the Second Viennese School , the architecture of Adolf Loos , the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein , and the Vienna Circle .

Red Vienna Karl-Marx-Hof , a Gemeindebau building and a symbol of Red Vienna Main article: Red Vienna The city of Vienna became the center of socialist politics from 1919 to 1934, a period referred to as Red Vienna ( Das rote Wien ). After a new breed of socialist politicians won the local elections they engaged in a brief but ambitious municipal experiment.

[ 29 ] Social democrats had won an absolute majority in the May 1919 municipal election and commanded the city council with 100 of the 165 seats.

Jakob Reumann was appointed by the city council as city mayor.

[ 30 ] The theoretical foundations of so-called Austromarxism were established by Otto Bauer , Karl Renner , and Max Adler .

[ 31 ] Red Vienna is perhaps most well known for its Gemeindebauten , public housing buildings. Between 1925 and 1934, over 60,000 new apartments were built in the Gemeindebauten. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.

[ 32 ] July Revolt and Civil War The Palace of Justice burning, 1927 In July 1927 , after three nationalist far-right paramilitary members were acquitted of the killing of two social democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund members, a riot broke out in the city. The protestors, enraged by the decision, set the Palace of Justice ablaze. The police attempted to end the revolt with force and killed at least 84 protestors, with 5 policemen also dying.

[ 33 ] In 1933, right-wing Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss dissolved the parliament , essentially letting him run the country as a dictatorship , banned the Communist Party and severely limited the influence of the Social Democratic Party . This led to a civil war between the right-wing government and socialist forces the following year, which started in Linz and quickly spread to Vienna. Socialist members of the Republikanischer Schutzbund barricaded themselves inside the housing estates and exchanged fire with the police and paramilitary groups. The fighting in Vienna ended after the Austrian Armed Forces shelled the Karl-Marx-Hof , a civilian housing estate, and the Schutzbund surrendered.

[ 34 ] Anschluss and World War II Crowds greet German Chancellor Adolf Hitler as he rides in an open car in Vienna following the March 1938 annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany Main article: Anschluss On 15 March 1938, three days after German troops first entered Austria, Adolf Hitler arrived in Vienna. 200,000 Austrians greeted him at the Heldenplatz , where he delivered a speech from a balcony of the Neue Burg , announcing that Austria would be absorbed into Nazi Germany . The persecution of Jews began almost immediately: Viennese Jews were harassed and hounded, and their homes and businesses plundered. Some were forced to scrub pro-independence slogans off the streets. This culminated in the Kristallnacht , a nationwide pogrom against Jews carried out by the Schutzstaffel and the Sturmabteilung , with the support of the Hitler Youth and German civilians. All synagogues and prayer houses in the city were destroyed, except for the Stadttempel , due to its proximity to residential buildings.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin , as Austria had ceased to exist. The few resistors in the city were arrested.

Adolf Eichmann held office in the expropriated Palais Rothschild and organised the expropriation and persecution of Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in Vienna, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate, and approximately 65,000 were killed. After the war, Vienna's Jewish population was only about 5,000.

In 1942, the city suffered its first air raid , carried out by the Soviet air force . Only after the Allies had taken Italy did the next raids commence. From 17 March 1944, a total of 51 air raids were carried out in Vienna. Targets of the bombings were primarily the city's oil refineries . However, around a third of the city centre was destroyed, and culturally important buildings such as the State Opera and the Burgtheater were burned, and the Albertina was heavily damaged. These air raids lasted until March 1945, just before the Soviet troops started the Vienna Offensive .

The Red Army , which had previously marched through Hungary , first entered Vienna on 6 April. Initially, they attacked the eastern and southern suburbs before advancing to the western suburbs. By the 8th, they had surrounded the city centre. The following day, the Soviets started with the infiltration of the city centre. Fighting continued for a few more days until the Soviet Navy ’s Danube Flotilla naval force arrived with reinforcements. The remaining defending soldiers surrendered that same day.

Soviet soldiers entering Vienna in Spring 1945 Four-power Vienna Allied-occupied zones between 1945 and 1955 following World War II Further information: Allied-occupied Austria After the war, Vienna was part of Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria until September 1945. That month, Vienna was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an Allied Commission . The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an international zone in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The city was policed by the four powers on a day-to-day basis using the "four soldiers in a jeep" method, which had one soldier from each nation sitting together. The four powers all had separate headquarters, the Soviets in Palais Epstein next to the Parliament, the French in Hotel Kummer on Mariahilferstraße, the Americans in the National Bank , and the British in Schönnbrunn Palace . The division of the city was not comparable to that of Berlin . Although the borders between the sectors were marked, travel between them was freely possible.

During the ten years of the four-power occupation, Vienna was a hotbed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs , which deeply distrusted each other. The city experienced an economic upturn due to the Marshall Plan . The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for Graham Greene 's screenplay for the film The Third Man (1949). The film's theme music was composed and performed by Viennese musician Anton Karas using a zither . Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it.

Austrian State Treaty and subsequent sovereignty The Graben in 1966 Main article: Austrian State Treaty The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the Austrian State Treaty was signed in May 1955 and came into force on 27 July 1955. By October, all soldiers had left the country. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater , both on the Ringstraße reopened to the public.

In the Autumn of 1956, Vienna accepted many Hungarian refugees , who had fled Hungary after an attempted revolution . The city experienced another wave of refugees after the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, as well as after the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991.

In 1972 the construction of the Donauinsel and the excavation of the New Danube began. In the same decade, Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky inaugurated the Vienna International Centre , a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organisations, such as the United Nations.

In 1910, Vienna had more than two million inhabitants and was the third largest city in Europe after London and Paris.

[ 43 ] Around the start of the 20th century, Vienna was the city with the second-largest Czech population in the world (after Prague ).

[ 44 ] After World War I, many Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy.

[ citation needed ] The population of Vienna generally stagnated or declined through the remainder of the 20th century, not demonstrating significant growth again until the census of 2000. In 2020, Vienna's population remained significantly below its reported peak in 1916.

Under the Nazi regime, 65,000 Jews were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.

[ 45 ] By 2001, 16% of people living in Austria had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of whom were from former Yugoslavia ; [ 46 ] [ 47 ] the next most numerous nationalities in Vienna were Turks (39,000; 2.5%), Poles (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).

As of 2012 [update] , an official report from Statistics Austria showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary.

[ 11 ] [ 48 ] From 2005 to 2015 the city's population grew by 10.1%.

[ 49 ] According to UN-Habitat , Vienna could be the fastest growing city out of 17 European metropolitan areas until 2025 with an increase of 4.65% of its population, compared to 2010.

[ 53 ] One sources estimates that Vienna's Jewish community is of 8,000 members meanwhile another suggest 15,000.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Based on information provided to city officials by various religious organizations about their membership, Vienna's Statistical Yearbook 2019 reports in 2018 an estimated 610,269 Roman Catholics, or 32.3% of the population, and 200,000 (10.4%) Muslims, 70,298 (3.7%) Orthodox, 57,502 (3.0%) other Christians, and 9,504 (0.5%) other religions.

[ 56 ] A study conducted by the Vienna Institute of Demography estimated the 2018 proportions to be 34% Catholic, 30% unaffiliated, 15% Muslim, 10% Orthodox, 4% Protestant, and 6% other religions.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] As of the spring of 2014, Muslims made up 30% of the total proportion of schoolchildren in Vienna.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Vienna is the seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna , in which is also vested the exempt Ordinariate for Byzantine-Rite Catholics in Austria; its Archbishop is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn . Many Catholic Churches in central Vienna feature performances of religious or other music, including masses sung to classical music and organ. Some of Vienna's most significant historical buildings are Catholic churches, including the St. Stephen's Cathedral ( Stephansdom ), Karlskirche , Peterskirche and the Votivkirche . On the banks of the Danube is a Buddhist Peace Pagoda , built in 1983 by the monks and nuns of Nipponzan Myohoji .

Geography A 2018 satellite photo by Sentinel-2 Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin . The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city , was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 542 m (495 to 1,778 ft). The city has a total area of 414.78 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.

Climate Whereas the higher elevated north/western edges of Vienna have a borderline oceanic ( Köppen : Cfb ) and humid continental climate ( Köppen : Dfb ), most parts of the urban core are warm enough for a humid subtropical ( Köppen : Cfa ) classification with dozens of days exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) and night temperatures not dropping below  20 °C (68 °F).

The city has warm to hot showery summers, with average high temperatures ranging between 27 and 32 °C (81 and 90 °F) and a record maximum exceeding 38 °C (100 °F). Winters are relatively dry and cool to cold with daily mean temperatures at or well above freezing point. Spring is variable and autumn cool, with a chance of snow in or after November. Snowfall and frequent frost have become rare though in the last decades, with snow cover mostly ranging from zero to a few inches for a short period of time.

Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging around 600 mm (23.6 in) annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part (700 to 800 mm (28 to 31 in) annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in) annually). Snow in winter is not common anymore and not so frequent compared to the mostly alpine Western and Southern regions of Austria.

In the provinces represented in the Imperial Council , men had enjoyed universal suffrage at the national level since 1907. However, Mayor Karl Lueger of the Christian Social Party prevented the adoption of this right to vote in municipal council elections, effectively excluding many working-class people. The first elections in which all adult men and women were entitled to vote took place in 1919, after the end of the monarchy. Since 1919, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has consistently provided the mayor in all free elections, and the Vienna City Council (the city parliament) has maintained a Social Democratic majority.

On 10 November 1920, the Federal Constitution of Austria came into force. This constitution defined Vienna as a separate state , enabling its separation from Lower Austria . Since then, the mayor of Vienna has also served as the governor of the state, the city senate has functioned as the state government and the municipal council the state parliament. Vienna continued to serve as the seat of the Lower Austrian government until 1997, when it relocated to St. Pölten .

From 1934 to 1945, during the Austrofascist and Nazi periods, no democratic elections were held, and the city was governed under a dictatorship . During this time, the SPÖ was banned, and many of its members were imprisoned. Vienna's city constitution was reinstated in 1945.

The city has enacted numerous social democratic policies. One notable example is the Gemeindebauten , social housing assets that are well-integrated into the city's architecture outside the inner district. These low-cost rentals provide comfortable accommodation and good access to city amenities. Many of the projects were built after World War II on vacant lots left by bombings during the war, with a strong emphasis on high construction standards. Today, Vienna's social housing accommodates over 500,000 people.

[ 67 ] Government Main article: Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna Michael Ludwig (SPÖ), mayor of Vienna In the 1996 City Council election, the SPÖ lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SPÖ had previously held an outright majority in every free municipal election since 1919. In the same election, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) won 29 seats, an increase from 21 in 1991, and surpassed the ÖVP , who finished in third place for the second consecutive election. From 1996 to 2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a coalition with the ÖVP.

In 2001 , the SPÖ regained their overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote. In 2005 , this majority increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). However, in the 2010 elections , the SPÖ lost their overall majority again and subsequently formed a coalition with the Green Party – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria. This coalition remained in place following the 2015 election .

After the 2020 election , the SPÖ formed a coalition with NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum . The next elections are scheduled to take place on 27 April 2025 .

They now stand empty and serve no function, though various other such towers in the city were repurposed, such as the Haus des Meeres in Esterhazy Park.

The Donauinsel , part of Vienna's flood defences, is a 21.1 km (13.1 mi) long artificial island between the Danube and New Danube dedicated to leisure activities. It was constructed from 1972 to 1988 for flood protection measures .

[ 128 ] Sporting amenities, such as volleyball courts , playgrounds , skate spots , dog parks , and multiple toilet facilities, some with showers, are available on the island. To transform the island into a green space, approximately 1.8 million trees and shrubs, along with 170 hectares of forest, were planted.

Rivers Danube (l-r) Donaukanal, Danube, New Danube, Old Danube Vienna is the largest city on the Danube , which flows from the north and exits to the southeast.

The plan for the regulation Until 1870, the Danube in Vienna remained unregulated, with the river flowing through multiple branching side arms, making the area highly susceptible to flooding. The first major Danube regulation project involved cutting a new, straight main channel to improve flood control and navigation. As part of the project, the arm that ran closer to the city center was preserved and is now known as the Donaukanal (Danube Canal). Additionally, another former arm north of the river was transformed into an oxbow lake , today called the Alte Donau ( Old Danube ).

[ 135 ] Despite these measures, Vienna remained vulnerable to flooding . To further mitigate flood risks, a second Danube regulation was undertaken starting in the 1970s. This project involved the construction of a parallel flood relief channel, the Neue Donau ( New Danube ), designed to divert excess water during high discharge periods. The excavated material from this project was used to create the Donauinsel ( Danube Island ), a long, narrow artificial island situated between the New Danube and the regulated main river. The effectiveness of these flood protection measures was demonstrated during the 2024 European floods , when Vienna remained largely unaffected.

[ 136 ] The four parts of the Danube: The main Danube is the widest of the river’s branches and serves as the primary route for shipping.

The Neue Donau ( New Danube ) is a side channel located to the east of the main river, running for approximately 21 kilometers. The water flows more slowly than in the main Danube, making it ideal for water sports such as swimming, rowing, and sailing. Motorboats are prohibited in this section.

The Alte Donau ( Old Danube ) is a lake situated to the east of the New Danube, which effectively separates Kaisermühlen from the rest of the city. This lake is a popular recreational area for swimming, with freely accessible piers and beaches. Motorboats and pedalos are permitted on the lake and can be rented from nearby vendors.

The Donaukanal ( Danube Canal ) branches off from the main river and re-enters close to the southern and northern edges of the city. Unlike the main river, it flows through the city center. While primarily used by boats, the paths along both sides of the canal are popular among pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists.

The New Danube in the front, the main Danube in the back, with the Donauinsel in-between.

The Old Danube The Donaukanal by Schwedenplatz at night Wien The Wien in the Stadtpark The river Wien ( die Wien or Wienfluss ) is a 34-kilometer-long tributary of the Danube, with approximately half of its course flowing through Vienna. It originates in the Vienna Woods ( Wienerwald ) and flows eastward through the city, ultimately joining the Donaukanal. Historically, the river was prone to flooding, which prompted several regulatory measures and modifications, including the canalisation of its course in the 19th century. Today, much of the river Wien is contained within underground channels in the urban area. It enters Vienna in Penzing , flowing above ground past Schönbrunn before being covered by the Naschmarkt . The river reemerges in the Stadtpark in the 1st district, before flowing into the Donaukanal.

[ 137 ] Sport Football Allianz Stadion, home of Rapid Wien The city is home to numerous football clubs . The two biggest teams are FK Austria Wien (21 Austrian Bundesliga titles and a record 27-time cup winners ), who play at the Generali Arena in Favoriten, and SK Rapid Wien (a record 32 Austrian Bundesliga titles), who play at the Allianz Stadion in Penzing. The oldest team in Austria, First Vienna FC , and Floridsdorfer AC both play in the 2. Liga , while the football team of the Wiener Sport-Club , one of the oldest athletics clubs in the country, play in the Austrian Regionalliga East , the third division.

Ernst-Happel-Stadion in the Prater The Ernst-Happel-Stadion is the largest stadium in Austria with 50,865 seats, and serves as the home stadium of the Austria national football team . It has hosted multiple European Cup finals ( 1963–64 , 1986–87 , 1989–90 , 1994–95 ), as well as seven matches during the 2008 European Championship , including the final , which saw Spain secure a  1–0 victory over Germany .

Vienna City Marathon crossing the Reichsbrücke in 2015 In addition to team sports, Vienna offers a wide range of individual sports. The paths in the Prater or along the Donauinsel are popular running routes. The Vienna City Marathon , which attracts more than 10,000 participants annually, typically takes place in May. Cyclists can choose from over 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths and numerous mountain bike trails in the Viennese mountains.
