The set of all Gaussian rationals forms the Gaussian rational field , denoted Q ( i ), obtained by adjoining the imaginary number i to the field of rationals Q .

Properties of the field [ edit ] The field of Gaussian rationals provides an example of an algebraic number field that is both a quadratic field and a cyclotomic field (since i is a 4th root of unity ).  Like all quadratic fields it is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group cyclic of order two, in this case generated by complex conjugation , and is thus an abelian extension of Q , with conductor 4.

[ 1 ] As with cyclotomic fields more generally, the field of Gaussian rationals is neither ordered nor complete (as a metric space). The Gaussian integers Z [ i ] form the ring of integers of Q ( i ). The set of all Gaussian rationals is countably infinite .

The field of Gaussian rationals is also a two-dimensional vector space over Q with natural basis { 1 , i } {\displaystyle \{1,i\}} .

Ford spheres [ edit ] The concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to the Gaussian rationals, giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex numbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space , and for each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent to the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest terms as p / q {\displaystyle p/q} (i.e.

⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ and ⁠ q {\displaystyle q} ⁠ are relatively prime), the radius of this sphere should be 1 / 2 | q | 2 {\displaystyle 1/2|q|^{2}} where | q | 2 = q q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle |q|^{2}=q{\bar {q}}} is the squared modulus, and ⁠ q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {q}}} ⁠ is the complex conjugate . The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian rationals P / Q {\displaystyle P/Q} and p / q {\displaystyle p/q} with | P q − − p Q | = 1 {\displaystyle |Pq-pQ|=1} , and otherwise they do not intersect each other.
