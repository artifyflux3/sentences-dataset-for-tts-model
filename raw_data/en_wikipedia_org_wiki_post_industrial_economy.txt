[ 1 ] Such economies are often marked by a declining manufacturing sector, resulting in de-industrialization , and a large service sector as well as an increase in the amount of information technology , often leading to an " Information Age "; information , knowledge , and creativity are the new raw materials of such an economy. The industry aspect of a post-industrial economy is sent into less developed nations which manufacture what is needed at lower costs through outsourcing . This occurrence is typical of nations that industrialized in the past such as the United Kingdom (first industrialised nation), most of Western Europe and the United States .
