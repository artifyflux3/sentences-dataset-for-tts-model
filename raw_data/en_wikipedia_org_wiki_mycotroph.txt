Find sources: "Mycotroph" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A mycotroph is a plant that gets all or part of its carbon, water, or nutrient supply through symbiotic association with fungi . The term can refer to plants that engage in either of two distinct symbioses with fungi: Many mycotrophs have a mutualistic association with fungi in any of several forms of mycorrhiza . The majority of plant species are mycotrophic in this sense. Examples include Burmanniaceae .

Some mycotrophs are parasitic upon fungi in an association known as myco-heterotrophy .
