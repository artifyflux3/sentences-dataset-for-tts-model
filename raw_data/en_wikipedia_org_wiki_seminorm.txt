Seminorms are intimately connected with convex sets : every seminorm is the Minkowski functional of some absorbing disk and, conversely, the Minkowski functional of any such set is a seminorm.

A topological vector space is locally convex if and only if its topology is induced by a family of seminorms.

Definition [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a vector space over either the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } or the complex numbers C .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} .} A real-valued function p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is called a seminorm if it satisfies the following two conditions: Subadditivity [ 1 ] / Triangle inequality : p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) + p ( y ) {\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq p(x)+p(y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x,y\in X.} Absolute homogeneity : [ 1 ] p ( s x ) = | s | p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(sx)=|s|p(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and all scalars s .

{\displaystyle s.} These two conditions imply that p ( 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle p(0)=0} [ proof 1 ] and that every seminorm p {\displaystyle p} also has the following property: [ proof 2 ] Nonnegativity : [ 1 ] p ( x ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle p(x)\geq 0} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} Some authors include non-negativity as part of the definition of "seminorm" (and also sometimes of "norm"), although this is not necessary since it follows from the other two properties.

By definition, a norm on X {\displaystyle X} is a seminorm that also separates points, meaning that it has the following additional property: Positive definite /Positive [ 1 ] / Point-separating : whenever x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} satisfies p ( x ) = 0 , {\displaystyle p(x)=0,} then x = 0.

{\displaystyle x=0.} A seminormed space is a pair ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} consisting of a vector space X {\displaystyle X} and a seminorm p {\displaystyle p} on X .

{\displaystyle X.} If the seminorm p {\displaystyle p} is also a norm then the seminormed space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is called a normed space .

Since absolute homogeneity implies positive homogeneity, every seminorm is a type of function called a sublinear function . A map p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is called a sublinear function if it is subadditive and positive homogeneous . Unlike a seminorm, a sublinear function is not necessarily nonnegative. Sublinear functions are often encountered in the context of the Hahn–Banach theorem . 
A real-valued function p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is a seminorm if and only if it is a sublinear and balanced function .

Examples [ edit ] The trivial seminorm on X , {\displaystyle X,} which refers to the constant 0 {\displaystyle 0} map on X , {\displaystyle X,} induces the indiscrete topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Let μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be a measure on a space Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } . For an arbitrary constant c ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle c\geq 1} , let X {\displaystyle X} be the set of all functions f : Ω Ω → → R {\displaystyle f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } for which ‖ ‖ f ‖ ‖ c := ( ∫ ∫ Ω Ω | f | c d μ μ ) 1 / c {\displaystyle \lVert f\rVert _{c}:=\left(\int _{\Omega }|f|^{c}\,d\mu \right)^{1/c}} exists and is finite. It can be shown that X {\displaystyle X} is a vector space, and the functional ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ c {\displaystyle \lVert \cdot \rVert _{c}} is a seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} . However, it is not always a norm (e.g. if Ω Ω = R {\displaystyle \Omega =\mathbb {R} } and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the Lebesgue measure ) because ‖ ‖ h ‖ ‖ c = 0 {\displaystyle \lVert h\rVert _{c}=0} does not always imply h = 0 {\displaystyle h=0} . To make ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ c {\displaystyle \lVert \cdot \rVert _{c}} a norm, quotient X {\displaystyle X} by the closed subspace of functions h {\displaystyle h} with ‖ ‖ h ‖ ‖ c = 0 {\displaystyle \lVert h\rVert _{c}=0} . The resulting space , L c ( μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{c}(\mu )} , has a norm induced by ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ c {\displaystyle \lVert \cdot \rVert _{c}} .

If f {\displaystyle f} is any linear form on a vector space then its absolute value | f | , {\displaystyle |f|,} defined by x ↦ ↦ | f ( x ) | , {\displaystyle x\mapsto |f(x)|,} is a seminorm.

A sublinear function f : X → → R {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} } on a real vector space X {\displaystyle X} is a seminorm if and only if it is a symmetric function , meaning that f ( − − x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(-x)=f(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} Every real-valued sublinear function f : X → → R {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} } on a real vector space X {\displaystyle X} induces a seminorm p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } defined by p ( x ) := max { f ( x ) , f ( − − x ) } .

{\displaystyle p(x):=\max\{f(x),f(-x)\}.} [ 2 ] Any finite sum of seminorms is a seminorm. The restriction of a seminorm (respectively, norm) to a vector subspace is once again a seminorm (respectively, norm).

If p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } and q : Y → → R {\displaystyle q:Y\to \mathbb {R} } are seminorms (respectively, norms) on X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} then the map r : X × × Y → → R {\displaystyle r:X\times Y\to \mathbb {R} } defined by r ( x , y ) = p ( x ) + q ( y ) {\displaystyle r(x,y)=p(x)+q(y)} is a seminorm (respectively, a norm) on X × × Y .

{\displaystyle X\times Y.} In particular, the maps on X × × Y {\displaystyle X\times Y} defined by ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ p ( x ) {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto p(x)} and ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ q ( y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto q(y)} are both seminorms on X × × Y .

{\displaystyle X\times Y.} If p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} then so are [ 3 ] ( p ∨ ∨ q ) ( x ) = max { p ( x ) , q ( x ) } {\displaystyle (p\vee q)(x)=\max\{p(x),q(x)\}} and ( p ∧ ∧ q ) ( x ) := inf { p ( y ) + q ( z ) : x = y + z with y , z ∈ ∈ X } {\displaystyle (p\wedge q)(x):=\inf\{p(y)+q(z):x=y+z{\text{ with }}y,z\in X\}} where p ∧ ∧ q ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle p\wedge q\leq p} and p ∧ ∧ q ≤ ≤ q .

{\displaystyle p\wedge q\leq q.} [ 4 ] The space of seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} is generally not a distributive lattice with respect to the above operations. For example, over R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} , p ( x , y ) := max ( | x | , | y | ) , q ( x , y ) := 2 | x | , r ( x , y ) := 2 | y | {\displaystyle p(x,y):=\max(|x|,|y|),q(x,y):=2|x|,r(x,y):=2|y|} are such that ( ( p ∨ ∨ q ) ∧ ∧ ( p ∨ ∨ r ) ) ( x , y ) = inf { max ( 2 | x 1 | , | y 1 | ) + max ( | x 2 | , 2 | y 2 | ) : x = x 1 + x 2 and y = y 1 + y 2 } {\displaystyle ((p\vee q)\wedge (p\vee r))(x,y)=\inf\{\max(2|x_{1}|,|y_{1}|)+\max(|x_{2}|,2|y_{2}|):x=x_{1}+x_{2}{\text{ and }}y=y_{1}+y_{2}\}} while ( p ∨ ∨ q ∧ ∧ r ) ( x , y ) := max ( | x | , | y | ) {\displaystyle (p\vee q\wedge r)(x,y):=\max(|x|,|y|)} If L : X → → Y {\displaystyle L:X\to Y} is a linear map and q : Y → → R {\displaystyle q:Y\to \mathbb {R} } is a seminorm on Y , {\displaystyle Y,} then q ∘ ∘ L : X → → R {\displaystyle q\circ L:X\to \mathbb {R} } is a seminorm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} The seminorm q ∘ ∘ L {\displaystyle q\circ L} will be a norm on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if L {\displaystyle L} is injective and the restriction q | L ( X ) {\displaystyle q{\big \vert }_{L(X)}} is a norm on L ( X ) .

{\displaystyle L(X).} Minkowski functionals and seminorms [ edit ] Main article: Minkowski functional Seminorms on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} are intimately tied, via Minkowski functionals, to subsets of X {\displaystyle X} that are convex , balanced , and absorbing .  Given such a subset D {\displaystyle D} of X , {\displaystyle X,} the Minkowski functional of D {\displaystyle D} is a seminorm.  Conversely, given a seminorm p {\displaystyle p} on X , {\displaystyle X,} the sets { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}} and { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)\leq 1\}} are convex, balanced, and absorbing and furthermore, the Minkowski functional of these two sets (as well as of any set lying "in between them") is p .

{\displaystyle p.} [ 5 ] Algebraic properties [ edit ] Every seminorm is a sublinear function , and thus satisfies all properties of a sublinear function , including convexity , p ( 0 ) = 0 , {\displaystyle p(0)=0,} and for all vectors x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y\in X} :
the reverse triangle inequality : [ 2 ] [ 6 ] | p ( x ) − − p ( y ) | ≤ ≤ p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle |p(x)-p(y)|\leq p(x-y)} and also 0 ≤ ≤ max { p ( x ) , p ( − − x ) } {\textstyle 0\leq \max\{p(x),p(-x)\}} and p ( x ) − − p ( y ) ≤ ≤ p ( x − − y ) .

{\displaystyle p(x)-p(y)\leq p(x-y).} [ 2 ] [ 6 ] For any vector x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and positive real r > 0 : {\displaystyle r>0:} [ 7 ] x + { y ∈ ∈ X : p ( y ) < r } = { y ∈ ∈ X : p ( x − − y ) < r } {\displaystyle x+\{y\in X:p(y)<r\}=\{y\in X:p(x-y)<r\}} and furthermore, { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<r\}} is an absorbing disk in X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 3 ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a sublinear function on a real vector space X {\displaystyle X} then there exists a linear functional f {\displaystyle f} on X {\displaystyle X} such that f ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle f\leq p} [ 6 ] and furthermore, for any linear functional g {\displaystyle g} on X , {\displaystyle X,} g ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle g\leq p} on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if g − − 1 ( 1 ) ∩ ∩ { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle g^{-1}(1)\cap \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}=\varnothing .} [ 6 ] Other properties of seminorms Every seminorm is a balanced function . 
A seminorm p {\displaystyle p} is a norm on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}} does not contain a non-trivial vector subspace.

If p : X → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle p:X\to [0,\infty )} is a seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} then ker ⁡ ⁡ p := p − − 1 ( 0 ) {\displaystyle \ker p:=p^{-1}(0)} is a vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} and for every x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} p {\displaystyle p} is constant on the set x + ker ⁡ ⁡ p = { x + k : p ( k ) = 0 } {\displaystyle x+\ker p=\{x+k:p(k)=0\}} and equal to p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(x).} [ proof 3 ] Furthermore, for any real r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} [ 3 ] r { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } = { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } = { x ∈ ∈ X : 1 r p ( x ) < 1 } .

{\displaystyle r\{x\in X:p(x)<1\}=\{x\in X:p(x)<r\}=\left\{x\in X:{\tfrac {1}{r}}p(x)<1\right\}.} If D {\displaystyle D} is a set satisfying { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } ⊆ ⊆ D ⊆ ⊆ { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}\subseteq D\subseteq \{x\in X:p(x)\leq 1\}} then D {\displaystyle D} is absorbing in X {\displaystyle X} and p = p D {\displaystyle p=p_{D}} where p D {\displaystyle p_{D}} denotes the Minkowski functional associated with D {\displaystyle D} (that is, the gauge of D {\displaystyle D} ).

[ 5 ] In particular, if D {\displaystyle D} is as above and q {\displaystyle q} is any seminorm on X , {\displaystyle X,} then q = p {\displaystyle q=p} if and only if { x ∈ ∈ X : q ( x ) < 1 } ⊆ ⊆ D ⊆ ⊆ { x ∈ ∈ X : q ( x ) ≤ ≤ } .

{\displaystyle \{x\in X:q(x)<1\}\subseteq D\subseteq \{x\in X:q(x)\leq \}.} [ 5 ] If ( X , ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ ) {\displaystyle (X,\|\,\cdot \,\|)} is a normed space and x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y\in X} then ‖ ‖ x − − y ‖ ‖ = ‖ ‖ x − − z ‖ ‖ + ‖ ‖ z − − y ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|x-y\|=\|x-z\|+\|z-y\|} for all z {\displaystyle z} in the interval [ x , y ] .

{\displaystyle [x,y].} [ 8 ] Every norm is a convex function and consequently, finding a global maximum of a norm-based objective function is sometimes tractable.

Relationship to other norm-like concepts [ edit ] Let p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } be a non-negative function. The following are equivalent: p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm.

p {\displaystyle p} is a convex F {\displaystyle F} -seminorm .

p {\displaystyle p} is a convex balanced G -seminorm .

[ 9 ] If any of the above conditions hold, then the following are equivalent: p {\displaystyle p} is a norm; { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}} does not contain a non-trivial vector subspace.

[ 10 ] There exists a norm on X , {\displaystyle X,} with respect to which, { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}} is bounded.

If p {\displaystyle p} is a sublinear function on a real vector space X {\displaystyle X} then the following are equivalent: [ 6 ] p {\displaystyle p} is a linear functional ; p ( x ) + p ( − − x ) ≤ ≤ 0 for every x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p(x)+p(-x)\leq 0{\text{ for every }}x\in X} ; p ( x ) + p ( − − x ) = 0 for every x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p(x)+p(-x)=0{\text{ for every }}x\in X} ; Inequalities involving seminorms [ edit ] If p , q : X → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle p,q:X\to [0,\infty )} are seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} then: p ≤ ≤ q {\displaystyle p\leq q} if and only if q ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle q(x)\leq 1} implies p ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1.

{\displaystyle p(x)\leq 1.} [ 11 ] If a > 0 {\displaystyle a>0} and b > 0 {\displaystyle b>0} are such that p ( x ) < a {\displaystyle p(x)<a} implies q ( x ) ≤ ≤ b , {\displaystyle q(x)\leq b,} then a q ( x ) ≤ ≤ b p ( x ) {\displaystyle aq(x)\leq bp(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} [ 12 ] Suppose a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are positive real numbers and q , p 1 , … … , p n {\displaystyle q,p_{1},\ldots ,p_{n}} are seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} such that for every x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} if max { p 1 ( x ) , … … , p n ( x ) } < a {\displaystyle \max\{p_{1}(x),\ldots ,p_{n}(x)\}<a} then q ( x ) < b .

{\displaystyle q(x)<b.} Then a q ≤ ≤ b ( p 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + p n ) .

{\displaystyle aq\leq b\left(p_{1}+\cdots +p_{n}\right).} [ 10 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a vector space over the reals and f {\displaystyle f} is a non-zero linear functional on X , {\displaystyle X,} then f ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle f\leq p} if and only if ∅ ∅ = f − − 1 ( 1 ) ∩ ∩ { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } .

{\displaystyle \varnothing =f^{-1}(1)\cap \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}.} [ 11 ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} and f {\displaystyle f} is a linear functional on X {\displaystyle X} then: | f | ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle |f|\leq p} on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if Re ⁡ ⁡ f ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} f\leq p} on X {\displaystyle X} (see footnote for proof).

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] f ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle f\leq p} on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if f − − 1 ( 1 ) ∩ ∩ { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 = ∅ ∅ } .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}(1)\cap \{x\in X:p(x)<1=\varnothing \}.} [ 6 ] [ 11 ] If a > 0 {\displaystyle a>0} and b > 0 {\displaystyle b>0} are such that p ( x ) < a {\displaystyle p(x)<a} implies f ( x ) ≠ ≠ b , {\displaystyle f(x)\neq b,} then a | f ( x ) | ≤ ≤ b p ( x ) {\displaystyle a|f(x)|\leq bp(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} [ 12 ] Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms [ edit ] Seminorms offer a particularly clean formulation of the Hahn–Banach theorem : If M {\displaystyle M} is a vector subspace of a seminormed space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} and if f {\displaystyle f} is a continuous linear functional on M , {\displaystyle M,} then f {\displaystyle f} may be extended to a continuous linear functional F {\displaystyle F} on X {\displaystyle X} that has the same norm as f .

{\displaystyle f.} [ 15 ] A similar extension property also holds for seminorms: Theorem [ 16 ] [ 12 ] (Extending seminorms) — If M {\displaystyle M} is a vector subspace of X , {\displaystyle X,} p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm on M , {\displaystyle M,} and q {\displaystyle q} is a seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} such that p ≤ ≤ q | M , {\displaystyle p\leq q{\big \vert }_{M},} then there exists a seminorm P {\displaystyle P} on X {\displaystyle X} such that P | M = p {\displaystyle P{\big \vert }_{M}=p} and P ≤ ≤ q .

{\displaystyle P\leq q.} Proof : Let S {\displaystyle S} be the convex hull of { m ∈ ∈ M : p ( m ) ≤ ≤ 1 } ∪ ∪ { x ∈ ∈ X : q ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 } .

{\displaystyle \{m\in M:p(m)\leq 1\}\cup \{x\in X:q(x)\leq 1\}.} Then S {\displaystyle S} is an absorbing disk in X {\displaystyle X} and so the Minkowski functional P {\displaystyle P} of S {\displaystyle S} is a seminorm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} This seminorm satisfies p = P {\displaystyle p=P} on M {\displaystyle M} and P ≤ ≤ q {\displaystyle P\leq q} on X .

{\displaystyle X.} ◼ ◼ {\displaystyle \blacksquare } Topologies of seminormed spaces [ edit ] Pseudometrics and the induced topology [ edit ] A seminorm p {\displaystyle p} on X {\displaystyle X} induces a topology, called the seminorm-induced topology , via the canonical translation-invariant pseudometric d p : X × × X → → R {\displaystyle d_{p}:X\times X\to \mathbb {R} } ; d p ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) = p ( y − − x ) .

{\displaystyle d_{p}(x,y):=p(x-y)=p(y-x).} This topology is Hausdorff if and only if d p {\displaystyle d_{p}} is a metric, which occurs if and only if p {\displaystyle p} is a norm .

[ 4 ] This topology makes X {\displaystyle X} into a locally convex pseudometrizable topological vector space that has a bounded neighborhood of the origin and a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of the following open balls (or the closed balls) centered at the origin: { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } or { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ r } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<r\}\quad {\text{ or }}\quad \{x\in X:p(x)\leq r\}} as r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} ranges over the positive reals. 
Every seminormed space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} should be assumed to be endowed with this topology unless indicated otherwise. A topological vector space whose topology is induced by some seminorm is called seminormable .

Equivalently, every vector space X {\displaystyle X} with seminorm p {\displaystyle p} induces a vector space quotient X / W , {\displaystyle X/W,} where W {\displaystyle W} is the subspace of X {\displaystyle X} consisting of all vectors x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} with p ( x ) = 0.

{\displaystyle p(x)=0.} Then X / W {\displaystyle X/W} carries a norm defined by p ( x + W ) = p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(x+W)=p(x).} The resulting topology, pulled back to X , {\displaystyle X,} is precisely the topology induced by p .

{\displaystyle p.} Any seminorm-induced topology makes X {\displaystyle X} locally convex , as follows.  If p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} and r ∈ ∈ R , {\displaystyle r\in \mathbb {R} ,} call the set { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<r\}} the open ball of radius r {\displaystyle r} about the origin ; likewise the closed ball of radius r {\displaystyle r} is { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ r } .

{\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)\leq r\}.} The set of all open (resp. closed) p {\displaystyle p} -balls at the origin forms a neighborhood basis of convex balanced sets that are open (resp. closed) in the p {\displaystyle p} -topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Stronger, weaker, and equivalent seminorms [ edit ] The notions of stronger and weaker seminorms are akin to the notions of stronger and weaker norms .  If p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are seminorms on X , {\displaystyle X,} then we say that q {\displaystyle q} is stronger than p {\displaystyle p} and that p {\displaystyle p} is weaker than q {\displaystyle q} if any of the following equivalent conditions holds: The topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by q {\displaystyle q} is finer than the topology induced by p .

{\displaystyle p.} If x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a sequence in X , {\displaystyle X,} then q ( x ∙ ∙ ) := ( q ( x i ) ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ → → 0 {\displaystyle q\left(x_{\bullet }\right):=\left(q\left(x_{i}\right)\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }\to 0} in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } implies p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} in R .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .} [ 4 ] If x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a net in X , {\displaystyle X,} then q ( x ∙ ∙ ) := ( q ( x i ) ) i ∈ ∈ I → → 0 {\displaystyle q\left(x_{\bullet }\right):=\left(q\left(x_{i}\right)\right)_{i\in I}\to 0} in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } implies p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} in R .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .} p {\displaystyle p} is bounded on { x ∈ ∈ X : q ( x ) < 1 } .

{\displaystyle \{x\in X:q(x)<1\}.} [ 4 ] If inf { q ( x ) : p ( x ) = 1 , x ∈ ∈ X } = 0 {\displaystyle \inf {}\{q(x):p(x)=1,x\in X\}=0} then p ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle p(x)=0} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} [ 4 ] There exists a real K > 0 {\displaystyle K>0} such that p ≤ ≤ K q {\displaystyle p\leq Kq} on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 4 ] The seminorms p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are called equivalent if they are both weaker (or both stronger) than each other.  This happens if they satisfy any of the following conditions: The topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by q {\displaystyle q} is the same as the topology induced by p .

{\displaystyle p.} q {\displaystyle q} is stronger than p {\displaystyle p} and p {\displaystyle p} is stronger than q .

{\displaystyle q.} [ 4 ] If x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a sequence in X {\displaystyle X} then q ( x ∙ ∙ ) := ( q ( x i ) ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ → → 0 {\displaystyle q\left(x_{\bullet }\right):=\left(q\left(x_{i}\right)\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }\to 0} if and only if p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0.

{\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0.} There exist positive real numbers r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} and R > 0 {\displaystyle R>0} such that r q ≤ ≤ p ≤ ≤ R q .

{\displaystyle rq\leq p\leq Rq.} Normability and seminormability [ edit ] See also: Normed space and Local boundedness § locally bounded topological vector space A topological vector space (TVS) is said to be a seminormable space (respectively, a normable space ) if its topology is induced by a single seminorm (resp. a single norm). 
A TVS is normable if and only if it is seminormable and Hausdorff or equivalently, if and only if it is seminormable and T 1 (because a TVS is Hausdorff if and only if it is a T 1 space ). 
A locally bounded topological vector space is a topological vector space that possesses a bounded neighborhood of the origin.

Normability of topological vector spaces is characterized by Kolmogorov's normability criterion . 
A TVS is seminormable if and only if it has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin.

[ 17 ] Thus a locally convex TVS is seminormable if and only if it has a non-empty bounded open set.

[ 18 ] A TVS is normable if and only if it is a T 1 space and admits a bounded convex neighborhood of the origin.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff locally convex TVS then the following are equivalent: X {\displaystyle X} is normable.

X {\displaystyle X} is seminormable.

X {\displaystyle X} has a bounded neighborhood of the origin.

The strong dual X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} of X {\displaystyle X} is normable.

[ 19 ] The strong dual X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} of X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable .

[ 19 ] Furthermore, X {\displaystyle X} is finite dimensional if and only if X σ σ ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{\sigma }^{\prime }} is normable (here X σ σ ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{\sigma }^{\prime }} denotes X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} endowed with the weak-* topology ).

The product of infinitely many seminormable space is again seminormable if and only if all but finitely many of these spaces trivial (that is, 0-dimensional).

[ 18 ] Topological properties [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS and p {\displaystyle p} is a continuous seminorm on X , {\displaystyle X,} then the closure of { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<r\}} in X {\displaystyle X} is equal to { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ r } .

{\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)\leq r\}.} [ 3 ] The closure of { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} in a locally convex space X {\displaystyle X} whose topology is defined by a family of continuous seminorms P {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}} is equal to ⋂ ⋂ p ∈ ∈ P p − − 1 ( 0 ) .

{\displaystyle \bigcap _{p\in {\mathcal {P}}}p^{-1}(0).} [ 11 ] A subset S {\displaystyle S} in a seminormed space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is bounded if and only if p ( S ) {\displaystyle p(S)} is bounded.

[ 20 ] If ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is a seminormed space then the locally convex topology that p {\displaystyle p} induces on X {\displaystyle X} makes X {\displaystyle X} into a pseudometrizable TVS with a canonical pseudometric given by d ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=p(x-y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x,y\in X.} [ 21 ] The product of infinitely many seminormable spaces is again seminormable if and only if all but finitely many of these spaces are trivial (that is, 0-dimensional).

[ 18 ] Continuity of seminorms [ edit ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm on a topological vector space X , {\displaystyle X,} then the following are equivalent: [ 5 ] p {\displaystyle p} is continuous.

p {\displaystyle p} is continuous at 0; [ 3 ] { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)<1\}} is open in X {\displaystyle X} ; [ 3 ] { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)\leq 1\}} is closed neighborhood of 0 in X {\displaystyle X} ; [ 3 ] p {\displaystyle p} is uniformly continuous on X {\displaystyle X} ; [ 3 ] There exists a continuous seminorm q {\displaystyle q} on X {\displaystyle X} such that p ≤ ≤ q .

{\displaystyle p\leq q.} [ 3 ] In particular, if ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is a seminormed space then a seminorm q {\displaystyle q} on X {\displaystyle X} is continuous if and only if q {\displaystyle q} is dominated by a positive scalar multiple of p .

{\displaystyle p.} [ 3 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a real TVS, f {\displaystyle f} is a linear functional on X , {\displaystyle X,} and p {\displaystyle p} is a continuous seminorm (or more generally, a sublinear function) on X , {\displaystyle X,} then f ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle f\leq p} on X {\displaystyle X} implies that f {\displaystyle f} is continuous.

[ 6 ] Continuity of linear maps [ edit ] If F : ( X , p ) → → ( Y , q ) {\displaystyle F:(X,p)\to (Y,q)} is a map between seminormed spaces then let [ 15 ] ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p , q := sup { q ( F ( x ) ) : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 , x ∈ ∈ X } .

{\displaystyle \|F\|_{p,q}:=\sup\{q(F(x)):p(x)\leq 1,x\in X\}.} If F : ( X , p ) → → ( Y , q ) {\displaystyle F:(X,p)\to (Y,q)} is a linear map between seminormed spaces then the following are equivalent: F {\displaystyle F} is continuous; ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p , q < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \|F\|_{p,q}<\infty } ; [ 15 ] There exists a real K ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle K\geq 0} such that p ≤ ≤ K q {\displaystyle p\leq Kq} ; [ 15 ] In this case, ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p , q ≤ ≤ K .

{\displaystyle \|F\|_{p,q}\leq K.} If F {\displaystyle F} is continuous then q ( F ( x ) ) ≤ ≤ ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p , q p ( x ) {\displaystyle q(F(x))\leq \|F\|_{p,q}p(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} [ 15 ] The space of all continuous linear maps F : ( X , p ) → → ( Y , q ) {\displaystyle F:(X,p)\to (Y,q)} between seminormed spaces is itself a seminormed space under the seminorm ‖ ‖ F ‖ ‖ p , q .

{\displaystyle \|F\|_{p,q}.} This seminorm is a norm if q {\displaystyle q} is a norm.

[ 15 ] Generalizations [ edit ] The concept of norm in composition algebras does not share the usual properties of a norm.

A composition algebra ( A , ∗ ∗ , N ) {\displaystyle (A,*,N)} consists of an algebra over a field A , {\displaystyle A,} an involution ∗ ∗ , {\displaystyle \,*,} and a quadratic form N , {\displaystyle N,} which is called the "norm".  In several cases N {\displaystyle N} is an isotropic quadratic form so that A {\displaystyle A} has at least one null vector , contrary to the separation of points required for the usual norm discussed in this article.

An ultraseminorm or a non-Archimedean seminorm is a seminorm p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } that also satisfies p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ max { p ( x ) , p ( y ) } for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq \max\{p(x),p(y)\}{\text{ for all }}x,y\in X.} Weakening subadditivity: Quasi-seminorms A map p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is called a quasi-seminorm if it is (absolutely) homogeneous and there exists some b ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle b\leq 1} such that p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ b p ( p ( x ) + p ( y ) ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq bp(p(x)+p(y)){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X.} The smallest value of b {\displaystyle b} for which this holds is called the multiplier of p .

{\displaystyle p.} A quasi-seminorm that separates points is called a quasi-norm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Weakening homogeneity - k {\displaystyle k} -seminorms A map p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is called a k {\displaystyle k} -seminorm if it is subadditive and there exists a k {\displaystyle k} such that 0 < k ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle 0<k\leq 1} and for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and scalars s , {\displaystyle s,} p ( s x ) = | s | k p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(sx)=|s|^{k}p(x)} A k {\displaystyle k} -seminorm that separates points is called a k {\displaystyle k} -norm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} We have the following relationship between quasi-seminorms and k {\displaystyle k} -seminorms: Suppose that q {\displaystyle q} is a quasi-seminorm on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} with multiplier b .

{\displaystyle b.} If 0 < k < log 2 ⁡ ⁡ b {\displaystyle 0<{\sqrt {k}}<\log _{2}b} then there exists k {\displaystyle k} -seminorm p {\displaystyle p} on X {\displaystyle X} equivalent to q .

{\displaystyle p(z)=p(0z)=|0|p(z)=0p(z)=0.} ◼ ◼ {\displaystyle \blacksquare } ^ Suppose p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is a seminorm and let x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} Then absolute homogeneity implies p ( − − x ) = p ( ( − − 1 ) x ) = | − − 1 | p ( x ) = p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(-x)=p((-1)x)=|-1|p(x)=p(x).} The triangle inequality now implies p ( 0 ) = p ( x + ( − − x ) ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) + p ( − − x ) = p ( x ) + p ( x ) = 2 p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(0)=p(x+(-x))\leq p(x)+p(-x)=p(x)+p(x)=2p(x).} Because x {\displaystyle x} was an arbitrary vector in X , {\displaystyle X,} it follows that p ( 0 ) ≤ ≤ 2 p ( 0 ) , {\displaystyle p(0)\leq 2p(0),} which implies that 0 ≤ ≤ p ( 0 ) {\displaystyle 0\leq p(0)} (by subtracting p ( 0 ) {\displaystyle p(0)} from both sides). Thus 0 ≤ ≤ p ( 0 ) ≤ ≤ 2 p ( x ) {\displaystyle 0\leq p(0)\leq 2p(x)} which implies 0 ≤ ≤ p ( x ) {\displaystyle 0\leq p(x)} (by multiplying through by 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} ).

◼ ◼ {\displaystyle \blacksquare } ^ Let x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and k ∈ ∈ p − − 1 ( 0 ) .

{\displaystyle k\in p^{-1}(0).} It remains to show that p ( x + k ) = p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(x+k)=p(x).} The triangle inequality implies p ( x + k ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) + p ( k ) = p ( x ) + 0 = p ( x ) .

{\displaystyle p(x+k)\leq p(x)+p(k)=p(x)+0=p(x).} Since p ( − − k ) = 0 , {\displaystyle p(-k)=0,} p ( x ) = p ( x ) − − p ( − − k ) ≤ ≤ p ( x − − ( − − k ) ) = p ( x + k ) , {\displaystyle p(x)=p(x)-p(-k)\leq p(x-(-k))=p(x+k),} as desired.
