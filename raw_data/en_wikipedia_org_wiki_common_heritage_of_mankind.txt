**Common heritage of humanity** (also termed the **common heritage of mankind**, **common heritage of humankind** or **common heritage principle**) is a principle of [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") that holds the defined territorial areas and elements of humanity's common heritage ([cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage "Cultural heritage") and [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_heritage "Natural heritage")) should be held in trust for [future generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_generations "Future generations") and be protected from exploitation by individual [nation states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_states "Nation states") or [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations "Corporations").

In tracing the origins of the common heritage principle, it is important to distinguish its history as a term from its [conceptual history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_history "Conceptual history"). The common heritage principle was developed under different names, including common "heritage", common "property", and common "patrimony" of mankind. These terms have at times described different concepts; for instance, in 1813 the "property of mankind" might mean the arts and sciences,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-1) rather than items or areas. By the early 20th century, "common heritage" and similar terms usually referred to areas and the resources in them,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-2) while other referents had become known under terms like "cultural heritage of all mankind", such as in the preamble to the 1954 [Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Cultural_Property_in_the_Event_of_Armed_Conflict "Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-3)

Conceptually, the common heritage arose in response to the [Roman civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis "Corpus Juris Civilis") principle of _[res communis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res\_communis "Res communis")_, which described items or areas that anyone could access or use, but none could own.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-4) Common heritage instead described areas or items that were owned by humanity as a collective. For example, in his essay _Toward Perpetual Peace_, [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-5)

The first known use of _Common Heritage of Mankind_ by a state representative in the United Nations, constituting [state practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_international_law#State_practice "Sources of international law"), was at the [First UN Conference on the Law of the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea#UNCLOS_I "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea") by [Prince Wan Waithayakon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wan_Waithayakon "Wan Waithayakon") of [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand") in 1958.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-6) The role of 'mankind' as a legal subject was mentioned in negotiations for the 1967 [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty"), and mentions of 'mankind' appear across the space treaties.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-7) 'Mankind' as a subject in international law also appears in the Preamble of the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter "United Nations Charter"), the Preamble of the [North Atlantic Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty "North Atlantic Treaty") (1949) and the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons") (1968).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-Gyula04-8)

In 1970, [United Nations General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly") Resolution 2749, the _Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor_, was adopted by 108 nation states and stated that the deep seabed should be preserved for peaceful purposes and is the "Common Heritage of Mankind."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-9)

In 1982, the Common Heritage of Mankind concept was stated to relate to "the seabed and ocean floor and [subsoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsoil "Subsoil") thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction" under Article 136 of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")[Law of the Sea Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Sea_Treaty "Law of the Sea Treaty") (UNCLOS).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-10)

In his book titled _Cries of the Sea: World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity,_ Payoyo argues that the _common heritage of humanity_ principle in Part XI of the [Law of the Sea Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Sea_Treaty "Law of the Sea Treaty") should favour developing states who were the voice of [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience "Conscience") in establishing it, and not merely in some transient 'affirmative action' manner.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-11) He claims, however, that the 1994 _Implementation Agreement_ facilitated control by industrialised countries of the [International Seabed Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Seabed_Authority "International Seabed Authority") (ISA), allowing access by the private sector to the deep [sea bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_bed "Sea bed") and inhibiting constructive dialogue on sustainable development.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-12)

In July 2024, during the International Seabed Authorityâ€™s 29th General Assembly, [Palau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau "Palau")'s President [Surangel Whipps Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surangel_Whipps_Jr. "Surangel Whipps Jr."), in his address entitled Upholding the Common Heritage of Humankind," emphasized the importance of safeguarding the ocean from exploitation and modern-day colonialism.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-15)

Core conceptual components
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_heritage_of_humanity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Core conceptual components")]

Former Maltese Ambassador [Arvid Pardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvid_Pardo "Arvid Pardo"), one of the founders of the _common heritage of humanity_ concept under international law, has claimed that it challenges the "structural relationship between rich and poor countries" and represents a "revolution not merely in the law of the sea, but also in international relations".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-16) One of the main architects of the principle under international [space law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law") has claimed that it is "the most important legal principle achieved by man throughout thousands of years during which law has existed as the regulating element of social exchange".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-17) This praise relates to the fact that [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") in the _common heritage of humanity_ principle is seeking to protect, respect and fulfill the interests of human beings independently of any politically motivated [sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state"); the concept covering all humans wherever they are living, as well as future generations.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-Gyula04-8)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-18)

Jennifer Frakes has identified five core components of the Common Heritage of Humanity concept.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-Frakes03-19) First, there can be no private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of [global public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_public_good "Global public good"). Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a "[tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons "Tragedy of the commons")" scenario.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-Frakes03-19) Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a [moratorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law) "Moratorium (law)") on resource exploitation should be enforced.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-21) Such a position does not appear to have been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-22)

A similar principle of international law holds that the world's [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage "Cultural heritage") and natural heritage (as nominated for listing by nation states) must be protected by states parties to the [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO")[World Heritage Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Convention "World Heritage Convention").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-23)

A case study in the use of these provisions was provided by the [Franklin Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Dam "Franklin Dam")[non-violent protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-violent_protest "Non-violent protest") campaign against the construction of a dam of [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia")'s last wild river; they being held by the [Australian High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Court "Australian High Court") to provide a valid basis for legislation protecting the [Franklin River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_River "Franklin River"). Justice Lionel Murphy wrote in that case (_[Commonwealth v Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth\_v\_Tasmania "Commonwealth v Tasmania")_) about the Common Heritage of Humanity principle: "The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war... [t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity."[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-24)

UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_heritage_of_humanity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights")]

The UNESCO _Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights_ declares in Article 1 that: "The [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome "Human genome") underlies the fundamental unity of all members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diversity. In a symbolic sense, it is the heritage of humanity." Article 4 states: "The human genome in its natural state shall not give rise to financial gains."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-25) Such Declarations do not create binding obligations under [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") (unless over time there is sufficient _[opinio juris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources\_of\_international\_law#Opinio\_juris "Sources of international law")_ and state practise to make them part of [international customary law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_customary_law "International customary law")) so the impact of such principles of [commercialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialisation "Commercialisation") of the [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome "Human genome") will be problematic.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-26) Whether the principle prohibits the [patenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patenting "Patenting") of the [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome "Human genome") is contested by the corporate sector.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-27)

UNESCO Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_heritage_of_humanity&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: UNESCO Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations")]

Proclaimed on November 12, 1997, the [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO")_Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations_ is an international agreement (potentially part of international customary law) which includes provisions related to the _common heritage of mankind_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-28)

> 'The present generations have the responsibility to bequeath to future generations an Earth which will not one day be irreversibly damaged by human activity. Each generation inheriting the Earth temporarily should take care to use natural resources reasonably and ensure that life is not prejudiced by harmful modifications of the ecosystems and that scientific and technological progress in all fields does not harm life on Earth.'

â€” UNESCO, _Declaration on Future Generations Article 4_

> 'With due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the present generations should take care to preserve the cultural diversity of humankind. The present generations have the responsibility to identify, protect and safeguard the tangible and intangible cultural heritage and to transmit this common heritage to future generations.'

â€” UNESCO, _Declaration on Future Generations Article 7_

> 'The present generations may use the common heritage of humankind, as defined in international law, provided that this does not entail compromising it irreversibly.'

â€” UNESCO, _Declaration on Future Generations Article 8_

> '1. The present generations should ensure that both they and future generations learn to live together in peace, security, respect for international law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
> 
> 2. The present generations should spare future generations the scourge of war. To that end, they should avoid exposing future generations to the harmful consequences of armed conflicts as well as all other forms of aggression and use of weapons, contrary to humanitarian principles.'

The declaration affirms in its [preamble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble "Preamble") that Indigenous Peoples contribute to humanity's common heritage.

Potential applications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_heritage_of_humanity&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Potential applications")]

It was argued at the [World Summit on the Information Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society "World Summit on the Information Society") and has been advocated by academics that global communication between individuals over the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") should be regarded as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-29) Equatorial countries have proposed that the [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") over the [high seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_seas "High seas") should be declared the _common heritage of mankind_.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-30)

Controversies about the principle
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_heritage_of_humanity&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Controversies about the principle")]

Kemal Baslar has stated that the Common Heritage of Mankind principle "is a philosophical idea that questions the regimes of globally important resources regardless of their situation, and requires major changes in the world to apply its provisions. In other words, the application and enforcement of the common heritage of mankind require a critical reexamination of many well-established principles and doctrines of classical [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law"), such as acquisition of territory, consent-based sources of international law, [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty"), [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law "Equality before the law"), [resource allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation "Resource allocation") and international personality."[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-31)

The _common heritage of humanity_ principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons "Tragedy of the commons") dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin "Garrett Hardin") in the journal _[Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_(journal) "Science (journal)")_ in 1968.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-hardin68-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-33) The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience "Conscience") in achieving justice and equality in society.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-34) Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting [economic rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rationalism "Economic rationalism") on such social and ecosystems.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-35)

The extent to which the Common Heritage of Mankind principle does or should control the activities of private [multinational corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporations "Multinational corporations") as well as [nation states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_states "Nation states"), particularly with regard to [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") activities, remains controversial.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-36)[Least developed nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_nations "Least developed nations") often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-Frakes03-19) As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-37) It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-38) It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind#cite_note-39)
