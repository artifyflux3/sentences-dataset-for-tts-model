x 2 + α α ( α α − − 1 ) ( α α − − 2 ) 3 !

x 3 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(1+x)^{\alpha }&=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\!{\binom {\alpha }{k}}x^{k}\\&=1+\alpha x+{\frac {\alpha (\alpha -1)}{2!}}x^{2}+{\frac {\alpha (\alpha -1)(\alpha -2)}{3!}}x^{3}+\cdots \end{aligned}}} 1 where α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is any complex number , and the power series on the right-hand side is expressed in terms of the (generalized) binomial coefficients ( α α k ) = α α ( α α − − 1 ) ( α α − − 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( α α − − k + 1 ) k !

.

{\displaystyle {\binom {\alpha }{k}}={\frac {\alpha (\alpha -1)(\alpha -2)\cdots (\alpha -k+1)}{k!}}.} The binomial series is the MacLaurin series for the function f ( x ) = ( 1 + x ) α α {\displaystyle f(x)=(1+x)^{\alpha }} . It converges when | x | < 1 {\displaystyle |x|<1} .

If α is a nonnegative integer n then the x n + 1 term and all later terms in the series are 0 , since each contains a factor of ( n − n ) . In this case, the series is a finite polynomial, equivalent to the binomial formula.

Convergence [ edit ] Conditions for convergence [ edit ] Whether ( 1 ) converges depends on the values of the complex numbers α and x . More precisely: If | x | < 1 , the series converges absolutely for any complex number α .

If | x | = 1 , the series converges absolutely if and only if either Re( α ) > 0 or α = 0 , where Re( α ) denotes the real part of α .

If | x | = 1 and x ≠ −1 , the series converges if and only if Re( α ) > −1 .

If x = −1 , the series converges if and only if either Re( α ) > 0 or α = 0 .

If | x | > 1 , the series diverges except when α is a non-negative integer, in which case the series is a finite sum.

In particular, if α is not a non-negative integer, the situation at the boundary of the disk of convergence , | x | = 1 , is summarized as follows: If Re( α ) > 0 , the series converges absolutely.

If −1 < Re( α ) ≤ 0 , the series converges conditionally if x ≠ −1 and diverges if x = −1 .

If Re( α ) ≤ −1 , the series diverges.

Identities to be used in the proof [ edit ] The following hold for any complex number α : ( α α 0 ) = 1 , {\displaystyle {\alpha  \choose 0}\!=1,} ( α α k + 1 ) = ( α α k ) α α − − k k + 1 , {\displaystyle {\alpha  \choose k+1}\!=\!{\alpha  \choose k}{\frac {\alpha -k}{k+1}},} 2 ( α α k − − 1 ) + ( α α k ) = ( α α + 1 k ) .

{\displaystyle {\alpha  \choose k-1}\!+\!{\alpha  \choose k}\!=\!{\alpha +1 \choose k}.} 3 Unless α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is a nonnegative integer (in which case the binomial coefficients vanish as k {\displaystyle k} is larger than α α {\displaystyle \alpha } ), a useful asymptotic relationship for the binomial coefficients is, in Landau notation : ( α α k ) = ( − − 1 ) k Γ Γ ( − − α α ) k 1 + α α ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) , as k → → ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle {\alpha  \choose k}\!={\frac {(-1)^{k}}{\Gamma (-\alpha )k^{1+\alpha }}}\,(1+o(1)),\quad {\text{as }}k\to \infty .} 4 This is essentially equivalent to Euler's definition of the Gamma function : Γ Γ ( z ) = lim k → → ∞ ∞ k !

k z z ( z + 1 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( z + k ) , {\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{k\to \infty }{\frac {k!\,k^{z}}{z(z+1)\cdots (z+k)}},} and implies immediately the coarser bounds m k 1 + Re α α ≤ ≤ | ( α α k ) | ≤ ≤ M k 1 + Re ⁡ ⁡ α α , {\displaystyle {\frac {m}{k^{1+\operatorname {Re} \,\alpha }}}\leq \left|{\alpha  \choose k}\right|\leq {\frac {M}{k^{1+\operatorname {Re} \alpha }}},} 5 for some positive constants m and M .

Formula ( 2 ) for the generalized binomial coefficient can be rewritten as ( α α k ) = ∏ ∏ j = 1 k ( α α + 1 j − − 1 ) .

{\displaystyle {\alpha  \choose k}\!=\prod _{j=1}^{k}\!\left({\frac {\alpha +1}{j}}-1\right).} 6 Proof [ edit ] To prove (i) and (v), apply the ratio test and use formula ( 2 ) above to show that whenever α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is not a nonnegative integer, the radius of convergence is exactly 1.  Part (ii) follows from formula ( 5 ), by comparison with the p -series ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 k p , {\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{k^{p}}},} with p = 1 + Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) {\displaystyle p=1+\operatorname {Re} (\alpha )} . To prove (iii), first use formula ( 3 ) to obtain ( 1 + x ) ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( α α k ) x k = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( α α + 1 k ) x k + ( α α n ) x n + 1 , {\displaystyle (1+x)\sum _{k=0}^{n}\!{\alpha  \choose k}x^{k}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}\!{\alpha +1 \choose k}x^{k}+{\alpha  \choose n}x^{n+1},} 7 and then use (ii) and formula ( 5 ) again to prove convergence of the right-hand side when Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) > − − 1 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (\alpha )>-1} is assumed. On the other hand, the series does not converge if | x | = 1 {\displaystyle |x|=1} and Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) ≤ ≤ − − 1 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (\alpha )\leq -1} , again by formula ( 5 ). Alternatively, we may observe that for all j {\displaystyle j} , | α α + 1 j − − 1 | ≥ ≥ 1 − − Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) + 1 j ≥ ≥ 1 {\textstyle \left|{\frac {\alpha +1}{j}}-1\right|\geq 1-{\frac {\operatorname {Re} (\alpha )+1}{j}}\geq 1} . Thus, by formula ( 6 ), for all k , | ( α α k ) | ≥ ≥ 1 {\textstyle k,\left|{\alpha  \choose k}\right|\geq 1} . This completes the proof of (iii). Turning to (iv), we use identity ( 7 ) above with x = − − 1 {\displaystyle x=-1} and α α − − 1 {\displaystyle \alpha -1} in place of α α {\displaystyle \alpha } , along with formula ( 4 ), to obtain ∑ ∑ k = 0 n ( α α k ) ( − − 1 ) k = ( α α − − 1 n ) ( − − 1 ) n = 1 Γ Γ ( − − α α + 1 ) n α α ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{n}\!{\alpha  \choose k}(-1)^{k}=\!{\alpha -1 \choose n}(-1)^{n}={\frac {1}{\Gamma (-\alpha +1)n^{\alpha }}}(1+o(1))} as n → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle n\to \infty } . Assertion (iv) now follows from the asymptotic behavior of the sequence n − − α α = e − − α α log ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle n^{-\alpha }=e^{-\alpha \log(n)}} . (Precisely, | e − − α α log ⁡ ⁡ n | = e − − Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle \left|e^{-\alpha \log n}\right|=e^{-\operatorname {Re} (\alpha )\log n}} certainly converges to 0 {\displaystyle 0} if Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) > 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (\alpha )>0} and diverges to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } if Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) < 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (\alpha )<0} . If Re ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) = 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (\alpha )=0} , then n − − α α = e − − i Im ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle n^{-\alpha }=e^{-i\operatorname {Im} (\alpha )\log n}} converges if and only if the sequence Im ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} (\alpha )\log n} converges mod 2 π π {\displaystyle {\bmod {2\pi }}} , which is certainly true if α α = 0 {\displaystyle \alpha =0} but false if Im ⁡ ⁡ ( α α ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} (\alpha )\neq 0} : in the latter case the sequence is dense mod 2 π π {\displaystyle \!{\bmod {2\pi }}} , due to the fact that log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle \log n} diverges and log ⁡ ⁡ ( n + 1 ) − − log ⁡ ⁡ n {\displaystyle \log(n+1)-\log n} converges to zero).

Summation of the binomial series [ edit ] The usual argument to compute the sum of the binomial series goes as follows.

Differentiating term-wise the binomial series within the disk of convergence | x | < 1 and using formula ( 1 ), one has that the sum of the series is an analytic function solving the ordinary differential equation (1 + x ) u ′( x ) − αu ( x ) = 0 with initial condition u (0) = 1 .

The unique solution of this problem is the function u ( x ) = (1 + x ) α . Indeed, multiplying by the integrating factor (1 + x ) − α −1 gives 0 = ( 1 + x ) − − α α u ′ ( x ) − − α α ( 1 + x ) − − α α − − 1 u ( x ) = [ ( 1 + x ) − − α α u ( x ) ] ′ , {\displaystyle 0=(1+x)^{-\alpha }u'(x)-\alpha (1+x)^{-\alpha -1}u(x)={\big [}(1+x)^{-\alpha }u(x){\big ]}'\,,} so the function (1 + x ) −α u ( x ) is a constant, which the initial condition tells us is 1 .  That is, u ( x ) = (1 + x ) α is the sum of the binomial series for | x | < 1 .

The equality extends to | x | = 1 whenever the series converges, as a consequence of Abel's theorem and by continuity of (1 + x ) α .

Negative binomial series [ edit ] Closely related is the negative binomial series defined by the MacLaurin series for the function g ( x ) = ( 1 − − x ) − − α α {\displaystyle g(x)=(1-x)^{-\alpha }} , where α α ∈ ∈ C {\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {C} } and | x | < 1 {\displaystyle |x|<1} . Explicitly, 1 ( 1 − − x ) α α = ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ g ( k ) ( 0 ) k !

x k = 1 + α α x + α α ( α α + 1 ) 2 !

x 2 + α α ( α α + 1 ) ( α α + 2 ) 3 !

x 3 + ⋯ ⋯ , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{(1-x)^{\alpha }}}&=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\;{\frac {g^{(k)}(0)}{k!}}\;x^{k}\\&=1+\alpha x+{\frac {\alpha (\alpha +1)}{2!}}x^{2}+{\frac {\alpha (\alpha +1)(\alpha +2)}{3!}}x^{3}+\cdots ,\end{aligned}}} which is written in terms of the multiset coefficient ( ( α α k ) ) = ( α α + k − − 1 k ) = α α ( α α + 1 ) ( α α + 2 ) ⋯ ⋯ ( α α + k − − 1 ) k !

.

{\displaystyle \left(\!\!{\alpha  \choose k}\!\!\right)={\alpha +k-1 \choose k}={\frac {\alpha (\alpha +1)(\alpha +2)\cdots (\alpha +k-1)}{k!}}\,.} When α is a positive integer, several common sequences are apparent.  The case α = 1 gives the series 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + ...

, where the coefficient of each term of the series is simply 1 .  The case α = 2 gives the series 1 + 2 x + 3 x 2 + 4 x 3 + ...

, which has the counting numbers as coefficients.  The case α = 3 gives the series 1 + 3 x + 6 x 2 + 10 x 3 + ...

, which has the triangle numbers as coefficients.  The case α = 4 gives the series 1 + 4 x + 10 x 2 + 20 x 3 + ...

, which has the tetrahedral numbers as coefficients, and similarly for higher integer values of α .

The negative binomial series includes the case of the geometric series , the power series [ 1 ] 1 1 − − x = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ x n {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1-x}}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }x^{n}} (which is the negative binomial series when α α = 1 {\displaystyle \alpha =1} , convergent in the disc | x | < 1 {\displaystyle |x|<1} ) and, more generally, series obtained by differentiation of the geometric power series: 1 ( 1 − − x ) n = 1 ( n − − 1 ) !

d n − − 1 d x n − − 1 1 1 − − x {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(1-x)^{n}}}={\frac {1}{(n-1)!}}{\frac {d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}}{\frac {1}{1-x}}} with α α = n {\displaystyle \alpha =n} , a positive integer.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The first results concerning binomial series for other than positive-integer exponents were given by Sir Isaac Newton in the study of areas enclosed under certain curves.

John Wallis built upon this work by considering expressions of the form y = (1 − x 2 ) m where m is a fraction. He found that (written in modern terms) the successive coefficients c k of (− x 2 ) k are to be found by multiplying the preceding coefficient by ⁠ m − ( k − 1) / k ⁠ (as in the case of integer exponents), thereby implicitly giving a formula for these coefficients. He explicitly writes the following instances [ a ] ( 1 − − x 2 ) 1 / 2 = 1 − − x 2 2 − − x 4 8 − − x 6 16 ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle (1-x^{2})^{1/2}=1-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {x^{4}}{8}}-{\frac {x^{6}}{16}}\cdots } ( 1 − − x 2 ) 3 / 2 = 1 − − 3 x 2 2 + 3 x 4 8 + x 6 16 ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle (1-x^{2})^{3/2}=1-{\frac {3x^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {3x^{4}}{8}}+{\frac {x^{6}}{16}}\cdots } ( 1 − − x 2 ) 1 / 3 = 1 − − x 2 3 − − x 4 9 − − 5 x 6 81 ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle (1-x^{2})^{1/3}=1-{\frac {x^{2}}{3}}-{\frac {x^{4}}{9}}-{\frac {5x^{6}}{81}}\cdots } The binomial series is therefore sometimes referred to as Newton's binomial theorem . Newton gives no proof and is not explicit about the nature of the series. Later, on 1826 Niels Henrik Abel discussed the subject in a paper published on Crelle's Journal , treating notably questions of convergence.
