The organisation is affiliated with NASA .

[ 1 ] The society is mainly made up of members from the United Kingdom but also has international members. The society was created in 2003, when it emerged from the e-mailing list-based UK Astrobiology Forum and Network at the UK's first Astrobiology Conference in 2003 in Cambridge.

The ASB has official affiliations with the Royal Astronomical Society [ 2 ] and the NASA Astrobiology Institute .
