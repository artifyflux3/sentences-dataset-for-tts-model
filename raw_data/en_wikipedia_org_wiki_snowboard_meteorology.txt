The board is 42.5 cm (16.7 in) square and 2 cm (0.79 in) high. The lip extends 1 cm (0.39 in) above the actual board. The stick is 38.5 cm (15.2 in) high.

A snowboard (US) or weaverboard [ 1 ] (Canada) is a meteorological tool used to aid in the obtaining of accurate measurement of snow accumulation.

Specifications [ edit ] Snowboards are typically flat pieces of plywood painted a light color (most commonly white), around 16 to 24 in (41 to 61 cm) in length and width and around 0.5 to 0.75 in (1.3 to 1.9 cm) thick.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In addition, the weaverboard used in Canada has a white stick with a black tip placed in the centre. This allows the board to be found if the newly fallen snow was to completely cover the board.

Reasons for use [ edit ] When measuring snow in grass, the blades will produce inflated snow totals, whereas with a snowboard, this effect is absent.

[ 4 ] The light or white color of a snowboard serves to minimize heating by sunlight, which often occurs on paved surfaces.

[ 5 ] These qualities make snowfall measurement using a snowboard more accurate than measurements without one.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Usage [ edit ] Snowboards should be placed at ground level at a distance away from a building of at least two times the height of that building.

[ 2 ] When measuring snowfall on a snowboard, the snowfall is measured to the nearest 0.1 in (0.25 cm).

[ 2 ] The snow may be measured as often as necessary during a 6-hour period in order to record the greatest depth on the board, since snow may both accumulate and melt during the same 6-hour period.

[ 5 ] All snow is cleaned from the snowboard once every 6 hours.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] At the end of the snow event, the maximum depths recorded on the snowboard during each 6-hour period are summed to provide the storm total; the same measurements during a single day are summed to produce the daily snowfall total.

[ 5 ] Usage in Canada is similar to that of the United States, with some minor differences. The board is checked every 6 hours at the synoptic hours of 12 Z , 18Z, 00Z and 06Z. The depth of snow on the board should be checked in several different places and an average depth obtained rounded to the nearest 0.2 cm (0.08 in).
