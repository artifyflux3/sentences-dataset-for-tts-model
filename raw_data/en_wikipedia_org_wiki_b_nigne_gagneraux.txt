In the Dijon Museum are pictures of Soranus and Servilius, Battle of Senef, Passage of the Rhine by the French Army under Condé, a Bacchanal, a Cavalry Charge, and a Triumph of Neptune.

Owing to the disturbances in Rome he quit that city, and retired to Florence, where he died in 1795. In the Uffizi at Florence are his own portrait, a Battle Scene, and a Lion Hunt .
