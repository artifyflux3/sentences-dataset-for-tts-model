It was introduced by Radó (1925) and named after Heinz Prüfer .

Construction [ edit ] The Prüfer manifold can be constructed as follows ( Spivak 1979 , appendix A). Take an uncountable number of copies X a of the plane, one for each real number a , and take a copy H of the upper half plane (of pairs ( x , y ) with y > 0). Then glue the open upper half of each plane X a to the upper half plane H by identifying ( x , y )∈ X a for y > 0 with the point ( a + yx , y ) in H . The resulting quotient space Q is the Prüfer manifold. The images in Q of the points (0,0) of the spaces X a under identification form an uncountable discrete subset.
