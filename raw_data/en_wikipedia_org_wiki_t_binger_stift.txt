( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Tübinger Stift The Tübinger Stift ( German: [ˈtyːbɪŋɐ ˈʃtɪft] ⓘ ) is a hall of residence and teaching; it is owned and supported by the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg , and located in the university city of Tübingen , in South West Germany. The Stift was founded as an Augustinian monastery in the Middle Ages . After the Reformation , in 1536, Duke Ulrich turned the Stift into a seminary which served to prepare Protestant pastors for Württemberg. To this day the scholarship is still given to students in preparation for the ministry or teaching in Baden-Württemberg . Students receive a scholarship which consists of boarding, lodging and further academic support.

Some of the well known "Stiftlers" are the astronomer Johannes Kepler and his associate, statesman Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg , the poet Friedrich Hölderlin who had as roommates the philosophers G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Schelling (although the latter was five years their junior), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the theologians David Friedrich Strauß , Johann Albrecht Bengel , Friedrich Christoph Oetinger , Ferdinand Christian Baur and Eberhard Nestle , and the philologist August Pauly .

The curriculum included two years of philosophical studies and three years of theological studies.

[ 3 ] The teaching staff imparted a traditional type of education, applying strict discipline and considerable censorship on the students' readings.

[ 3 ] Nonetheless, during Hegel's tenure, students privately had access to the 'forbidden' texts of Spinoza , Kant and Voltaire .

^ A solid fraternal and close friendship began between the three, which was followed by uninterrupted correspondence throughout their lives. This happened when, immediately after graduation, they ventured into precarious work as tutors in different cities. There was no lack of new momentary reuniins: between Hegel and Hölderlin, in Frankfurt ; then between Hegel and Schelling, in Jena .
