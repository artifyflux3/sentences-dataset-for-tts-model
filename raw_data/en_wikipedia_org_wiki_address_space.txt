In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), an **address space** defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a [network host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_host "Network host"), [peripheral device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_device "Peripheral device"), [disk sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector "Disk sector"), a [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage") cell or other logical or physical entity.

For [software programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_program "Software program") to save and retrieve stored data, each datum must have an address where it can be located. The number of address spaces available depends on the underlying address structure, which is usually limited by the [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture "Computer architecture") being used. Often an address space in a system with [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory "Virtual memory") corresponds to a highest level translation table, e.g., a [segment table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation "Memory segmentation") in [IBM System/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370 "IBM System/370").

Address spaces are created by combining enough uniquely identified qualifiers to make an address unambiguous within the address space. For a person's physical address, the _address space_ would be a combination of locations, such as a neighborhood, town, city, or country. Some elements of a data address space may be the same, but if any element in the address is different, addresses in said space will reference different entities. For example, there could be multiple buildings at the same address of "32 Main Street" but in different towns, demonstrating that different towns have different, although similarly arranged, [street address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_address "Street address") spaces.

An address space usually provides (or allows) a partitioning to several regions according to the [mathematical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure") it has. In the case of [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order"), as for [memory addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address"), these are simply [chunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)"). Like the hierarchical design of [postal addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_address "Postal address"), some nested domain hierarchies appear as a [directed ordered tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory) "Arborescence (graph theory)"), such as with the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") or a [directory structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_structure "Directory structure"). In the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority") (IANA) allocates ranges of [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") to various registries so each can manage their parts of the global Internet address space.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space#cite_note-1)

Uses of addresses include, but are not limited to the following:

*   [Memory addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") for [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory "Main memory"), [memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O "Memory-mapped I/O"), as well as for [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory "Virtual memory");
*   Device addresses on an [expansion bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_bus "Expansion bus");
*   [Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector "Disk sector") addressing for [disk drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_drive "Disk drive");
*   [File names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_name "File name") on a particular [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(computing) "Volume (computing)");
*   Various kinds of network host addresses in [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network");
*   [Uniform resource locators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator "Uniform resource locator") in the Internet.

Illustration of translation from logical block addressing to physical geometry

Another common feature of address spaces are [mappings and translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics) "Map (mathematics)"), often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. For example, a [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") on a [logical disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disk "Logical disk") operates using [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_array "One-dimensional array") sector numbers, which have to be translated to _absolute_[LBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_block_addressing "Logical block addressing") sector addresses, in simple cases, via [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via [Parallel ATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA "Parallel ATA"), each of them must be converted to _logical_[cylinder-head-sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector "Cylinder-head-sector") address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the [disk controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_controller "Disk controller"), then, finally, to _physical_[cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(disk_drive) "Cylinder (disk drive)"), [head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_head "Disk head") and [sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_(disk_drive) "Track (disk drive)") numbers.

The [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") maps its names to and from network-specific addresses (usually IP addresses), which in turn may be mapped to [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer "Link layer") network addresses via [Address Resolution Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol "Address Resolution Protocol"). [Network address translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation "Network address translation") may also occur on the edge of _different_ IP spaces, such as a [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") and the Internet.

Virtual address space and physical address space relationship

An iconic example of virtual-to-physical address translation is [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory "Virtual memory"), where different [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory) "Page (computer memory)") of [virtual address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space "Virtual address space") map either to [page file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging "Paging") or to main memory [physical address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address "Physical address") space. It is possible that several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access_memory "Random access memory"). It is also possible that a single virtual address maps to zero, one, or [more than one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#Homonym_and_synonym_problems "CPU cache") physical address.
