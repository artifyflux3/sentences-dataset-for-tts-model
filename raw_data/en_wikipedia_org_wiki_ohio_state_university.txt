A member of the University System of Ohio , it was founded in 1870. It is one of the largest universities by enrollment in the United States, with nearly 50,000 undergraduate students and nearly 15,000 graduate students. The university consists of sixteen colleges and offers over 400 degree programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

[ 7 ] It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity". As of 2024, [update] the university has an endowment of $7.9 billion. Its athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I as the Ohio State Buckeyes as a member of the Big Ten Conference for the majority of fielded sports.

It is a member of the Association of American Universities . Past and present alumni and faculty include 6 Nobel Prize laureates, 9 Rhodes Scholars , 7 Churchill Scholars , 1 Fields Medalist , 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, 64 Goldwater scholars , 1 Costa Rican president , 1 U.S. vice president , 7 U.S. senators , 15 U.S. representatives , and 104 Olympic medalists .

History Main article: History of Ohio State University Overview 1870–1899 Foundational era University Hall was the first building on campus, built in 1873 and reconstructed in 1976 The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests, and with competition for resources from Ohio University , which was chartered by the Northwest Ordinance and Miami University .

[ 8 ] Championed by the Republican governor Rutherford B. Hayes , the Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a land-grant university under the Morrill Act of 1862 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College .

[ 8 ] The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.

[ 9 ] Also in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to "the Ohio State University." [ 10 ] [ 11 ] 1900–1980 Middle era A view of The Oval green space in the early 20th century In 1906, Ohio State segregationist [ 12 ] president William Oxley Thompson , along with the university's supporters in the state legislature, put forth the Lybarger Bill with the aim of shifting virtually all higher education support to the continued development of Ohio State while funding only the " normal school " functions of the state's other public universities. Although the Lybarger Bill failed narrowly to gain passage, in its place the Eagleson Bill was passed as a compromise, which determined that all doctoral education and research functions would be the role of Ohio State, and that Miami University and Ohio University would not offer instruction beyond the master's degree level – an agreement that would remain in place until the 1950s. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the Association of American Universities .

[ 13 ] In 1911, president Thompson wrote in a letter, "the race problem is growing in intensity every year, and I am disposed to doubt the wisdom on the part of the colored people of taking any move that practically forces the doctrine of social equality." [ 14 ] At the same time, Ohio State "practiced racial segregation " that was widespread across the country at the time against Black students, and "there is no known evidence [Thompson] saw benefits in addressing it".

[ 14 ] In 2024, after attempts were made to remove Thompson's statue from the Oval, university spokesperson Ben Johnson stated "the naming review process is thoughtful and thorough and therefore could take several years", but the statue has not been removed.

[ 12 ] With the onset of the Great Depression , Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families. By the mid-1930s, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and later the National Youth Administration .

[ 15 ] By the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to over 17,500. In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was founded to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects. In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support.

In 1952, Ohio State founded the interdisciplinary Mershon Center for International Security Studies , which it still houses. The work of this program led to the United States Department of Homeland Security basing the National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security at the university in 2003.

1980–present Modern era Ohio State had an open admissions policy until the late 1980s. Since the early 2000s, the college has raised standards for admission, and been increasingly cited as one of the best public universities in the United States.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The main campus in Columbus has grown into the fifth-largest university campus in the United States.

[ 23 ] On January 12, 2015, OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] On June 22, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the university a trademark on the word "the" in relation to clothing, such as T-shirts, baseball caps and hats distributed and/or sold through athletic or collegiate channels.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] In recent years, Ohio State and its fans, in particular those of its athletics program, have frequently emphasized the word "THE" when referring to the school.

[ 29 ] Main article: List of presidents of Ohio State University Michael V. Drake became the 15th president of Ohio State in 2014.

[ 30 ] In 2020, Kristina M. Johnson took office as the 16th president.

[ 31 ] And in 2023, Walter E. Carter Jr.

took office as the 17th president.

[ 32 ] Significant events 1969–1970 Vietnam War protests Throughout 1969, anti-Vietnam War protest tensions grew on Ohio State's campus. What is now Bricker Hall was occupied by students, but after being told they had "five minutes to leave, or they'd be arrested", students departed from the building. In late April 1970, anti-war riots ensued on Ohio State campus, leading to nearly 300 arrests, over 60 injuries, and seven gunshot wounds.

[ 33 ] Students began "boycotting classes with a student strike, protesting the university's rejection of a list of demands presented the week before. Specific demands included adding black and women's studies to the university's courses." On April 29, 1970, five days before the Kent State shootings , students picketed buildings, but this initially peaceful protest "started to spiral out of control" after Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers arrived in riot gear. When a man was assaulted by three students, tear gas was deployed, in response to which protesters threw rocks at the National Guard. Seven students were struck with a shotgun blast near the Student Union. There were no casualties, and the shooter was not identified.

1978–1998 Richard Strauss sexual abuse scandal This section is an excerpt from Ohio State University abuse scandal .

[ edit ] The Ohio State University abuse scandal centered on allegations of sexual abuse that occurred between 1978 and 1998, while Richard Strauss was employed as a physician by the Ohio State University (OSU) in the Athletics Department and in the Student Health Center. An independent investigation into the allegations was announced in April 2018 and was conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie .

In July 2018, several former wrestlers accused former head coach Russ Hellickson and U.S. representative Jim Jordan , who was an assistant coach at OSU between 1987 and 1994, of knowing about Strauss's alleged abuse but failing to take action to stop it. Jordan has denied that he had any student-athlete report sexual abuse to him.

The report, released in May 2019, concluded that Strauss abused at least 177 male student-patients and that OSU was aware of the abuse as early as 1979, but the abuse was not widely known outside of athletics or student health until 1996, when he was suspended from his duties. Strauss continued to abuse OSU students at an off-campus clinic until his retirement from the university in 1998. OSU was faulted in the report for failing to report Strauss's conduct to law enforcement.

In May 2020, the university entered into a settlement and agreed to pay $40.9 million to 162 sexual abuse survivors.

[ 34 ] Five lawsuits against the university are pending.

( March 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) On November 28, 2016, a terrorist vehicle-ramming and stabbing attack occurred at 9:52 a.m. EST at Ohio State University's Watts Hall in Columbus, Ohio . The attacker, Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan, was shot and killed by the first responding OSU police officer, and 13 people were hospitalized for injuries.

Authorities began investigating the possibility of the attack being an act of terrorism. On the next day, law enforcement officials stated that Artan was inspired by terrorist propaganda from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the late radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki .

Amaq News Agency released a statement claiming the attacker responded to an ISIL call to attack coalition citizens, though there is no evidence of direct contact between the group and Artan.

2023-2025 pro-Palestinian campus protests Officers arresting a pro-Palestinian protester at the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, April 25, 2024 These paragraphs are an excerpt from Ohio State University pro-Palestinian campus protests during the Gaza war .

[ edit ] A series of ongoing protests at Ohio State University by pro-Palestinian demonstrators occurred on-campus in response to the Gaza war beginning on October 7, 2023 . A solidarity encampment was constructed on OSU's South Oval on April 25, 2024, during which there were at least 36 arrests, [ 36 ] making for the largest en masse arrests on campus since the 1969–1970 Vietnam War protests .

[ 37 ] The protester demands of OSU include " financial divestment, academic boycott, financial disclosure , acknowledging the genocide , and ending targeted policing".

[ 38 ] Pro-Palestinian groups have been critical of the university's responses to the protests, which have included allowing state troopers to aim long-range rifles at students during the dispersal of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, [ 39 ] suspending a pro-Palestinian student organization, [ 40 ] and blocking the Undergraduate Student Government's attempts at passing legislation for financial divestment from Israel after receiving pressure from officials in Zionist organization Hillel International .

[ 41 ] Following protests, the OSU administration coordinated multi-agency police operations and implemented a campus-wide chalking ban; state-level officials floated invoking a 1953 anti- KKK statute against pro-Palestinian protesters who wore face coverings, suggested terminating faculty members who encourage or engage in "violence on campus", and enacted the "CAMPUS" Act to formalize expressive activity restrictions; and officials in the Trump administration revoked the student visa of at least one pro-Palestinian student protester and threatened to withdraw funding from OSU if they did not sufficiently "combat antisemitism" on campus.

The university has insisted their actions are politically neutral, with President Carter stating the "university's long-standing space rules are content neutral and are enforced uniformly".

[ 42 ] Critics argue the university engages in selective enforcement of university space rules, enforcing policies disproportionately against pro-Palestinian groups and not similarly against other groups on campus.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Campus See also: List of buildings at Ohio State University Interactive map of the university's main campus in Columbus Ohio State's 1,764-acre (7.14 km 2 ) main campus is about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of Columbus' downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a quad of about 11 acres (4.5 ha).

[ 45 ] The original campus was laid out in the English country style with University Hall overlooking what would become the Oval. From 1905 to 1913, the Olmsted brothers , who had designed New York City's Central Park , were contracted as architectural consultants. Under their leadership, a more formal landscape plan was created with its center axis through the Oval. This axis shifted the university's street grid 12.25 degrees from the City of Columbus' street grid. Construction of the main library in 1915 reinforced this grid shift.

[ 46 ] The East Atrium at the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library Ohio State's research library system has a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral Richard E. Byrd and other polar research materials; the Hilandar Research Library , which has the world's largest collection of medieval Slavic manuscripts on microform; the Ohio State Cartoon Library & Museum , the world's largest repository of original cartoons; the Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator John Glenn .

Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 Wexner Center for the Arts . Designed by architects Peter Eisenman of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus Les Wexner's gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking deconstructivist architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of the Wexner Center's permanent collection is Picasso 's Nude on a Black Armchair , which was purchased by Wexner at auction for $45 million.

At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone Greek theatre ) and Mirror Lake .

Knowlton Hall , dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to Ohio Stadium . Knowlton Hall along with the Fisher College of Business and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall was designed by Atlanta-based Mack Scogin Merrill Elam along with WSA Studio from Columbus. The Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton , the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested that five white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of architecture .

[ 47 ] The Ohio State College of Medicine is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the James Cancer Hospital , a cancer research institute and one of the National Cancer Institute 's 41 comprehensive cancer centers , along with the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital , a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The campus is served by the Campus Area Bus Service .

[ 99 ] This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review.

[ 100 ] The Columbus Dispatch and the school newspaper, The Lantern , reported that "[SCE] failed to properly report students' sexual-assault complaints" and that some victims were told that they were " 'lying', 'delusional', 'suffering from mental illness', 'have an active imagination', that they 'didn't understand their own experience', and also 'fabricated their story ' ".

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor , the university will be creating [ when?

] a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program.

On July 20, 2018, BBC News reported that over 100 male students, including athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct by a deceased university team physician, Richard Strauss.

[ 103 ] The reports dated back to 1978, and included claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. Four former wrestlers filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of "rampant sexual misconduct" by Strauss. U.S. representative Jim Jordan was named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers' claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university.

[ 104 ] [ better source needed ] In May 2020, the university entered into a settlement and agreed to pay $40.9 million to the sexual abuse survivors.

[ 105 ] Activities and organizations Hale Hall was the original home of the Ohio Union.

The Ohio Union was the first student union built by an American public university.

[ 74 ] It is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.

[ 106 ] The university has over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, fraternities and sororities ; and three student governments.

Student organizations Student organizations at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including academic , social , religious , artistic , service-based , diversity and many more.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.
