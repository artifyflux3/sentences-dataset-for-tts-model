[ 1 ] He was one of the founders of neuropsychology [ 2 ] and studied perception. He coined the term double dissociation .

[ 3 ] He also introduced the "Corollary Discharge" hypothesis.

[ 4 ] He gave the classic definition of agnosia as "a normal percept stripped of its meaning".

[ 5 ] He was the recipient of the Karl Spencer Lashley Award in 1966.

Biography [ edit ] He was born in Berlin on August 7, 1916.

[ 1 ] He studied at the French College in Berlin and at the University of Basel in Switzerland (1935-1939). He immigrated to the United States in 1941 and in August of the same year married Marianne Liepe. In 1947, he earned his PhD in social psychology at Harvard University , under the mentorship of Gordon Allport .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] His thesis studied the efficacy of psychiatric treatments on delinquent adolescents. After graduating, his early work was in San Diego with neurologist Morris Bender.

[ 8 ] While living in Dobbs Ferry , New York from 1946 to 1961, he headed the Psychophysiology Lab at the New York University-Bellevue Medical Center.

[ 9 ] His work focused on assessing brain injuries from World War II veterans, [ 10 ] with a focus on the effects of frontal lobe injury. From this research, he introduced the "corollary discharge" hypothesis, which says that the frontal lobe is involved in the anticipation of movement.

[ 11 ] In 1960, Teuber moved to Massachusetts to start a Department of Psychology at MIT after previous attempts had failed.

[ 6 ] Today, it is known as the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. He hired Jerry Fodor , Thomas Bever , and Merrill Garrett.

[ 12 ] At MIT, he was one of the researchers who studied the case of H.M.

[ 13 ] He died in a sailing accident in the Virgin Islands .
