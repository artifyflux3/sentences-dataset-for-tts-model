Historical Russian units of measurement were standardized and used in the Russian Empire and after the Russian Revolution , but were abandoned after 21 July 1925, when the Soviet Union adopted the metric system .

The Tatar system is very similar to the Russian one, but some names are different.

[ citation needed ] The Polish system is also very close to the Russian system.

The system existed since Kievan Rus' , but under Peter the Great , the Russian units were redefined relative to the English system .

[ 1 ] The system also used Cyrillic numerals until the 18th century, when Peter the Great replaced it with the Hindu–Arabic numeral system .

[ 1 ] Length [ edit ] The basic unit was the Russian ell , called the arshin , which came into use in the 16th century.  It was standardized by Peter the Great in the 18th century to measure exactly twenty-eight English inches (71.12 cm). Thus, 80 vershoks = 20 pyad's = 5 arshins = 140 English inches (355.60 cm).

[ 2 ] A pyad' ( пядь , "palm", "five") or chyetvyert' ( че́тверть , "quarter") is a hand span , the distance between ends of the spread thumb and index finger .

Note that the chyetvyert' appears in both lists with vastly differing values.

[ citation needed ] It may still be encountered in documents dealing with agricultural production (especially with reference to cereals), and has been revived in determining weights when casting bells in belfries following the rebirth of the Orthodox Churches in the former Soviet lands.

Apothecaries' system [ edit ] The Imperial Russian apothecaries' weight was defined by setting the grain ( Russian : гран ) to be exactly seven-fifths of a dolya .  The only unit name shared between the two was the funt (pound), but the one in the apothecaries' system is exactly seven-eighths of the ordinary funt .

In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of "very much" and "very", as well as "most surely".

[ 3 ] The adjective stopudovy and the adverb stopudovo derive from this expression.

Семь пядей во лбу : Seven pyad across the forehead – very smart Не семь пядей во лбу : Not seven pyad across the forehead – not so smart Мал золотник , да до́рог : A zolotnik is small, but expensive: when quality rather than quantity is important Идти семимильными шагами : To walk in 7-mile steps – any kind of very fast progress, e.g., of improvement Узнать, почём фунт лиха : To learn how much a pound of likho costs – to experience something bad Ни пяди земли (не уступить) : Do not give up (even) a pyad of land Съесть пуд соли (вместе с кем-либо) : To eat a 'pood' of salt (with somebody) – to have a long common experience with somebody (with the implication "to know someone well") See also [ edit ] Petrograd Standard References [ edit ] ^ a b Шостьин Н.
