This is because a king can move diagonally, so that the jumps to cover the smaller distance parallel to a row or column is effectively absorbed into the jumps covering the larger. Above are the Chebyshev distances of each square from the square f6.

In mathematics , Chebyshev distance (or Tchebychev distance ), maximum metric , or L ∞ metric [ 1 ] is a metric defined on a real coordinate space where the distance between two points is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension.

[ 2 ] It is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev .

It is also known as chessboard distance , since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square on a chessboard to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board.

[ 3 ] For example, the Chebyshev distance between f6 and e2 equals 4.

Definition [ edit ] The Chebyshev distance between two vectors or points x and y , with standard coordinates x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} and y i {\displaystyle y_{i}} , respectively, is D ( x , y ) = max i ( | x i − − y i | ) .

{\displaystyle D(x,y)=\max _{i}(|x_{i}-y_{i}|).\ } This equals the limit of the L p metrics : D ( x , y ) = lim p → → ∞ ∞ ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n | x i − − y i | p ) 1 / p , {\displaystyle D(x,y)=\lim _{p\to \infty }{\bigg (}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left|x_{i}-y_{i}\right|^{p}{\bigg )}^{1/p},} hence it is also known as the L ∞ metric.

Mathematically, the Chebyshev distance is a metric induced by the supremum norm or uniform norm . It is an example of an injective metric .

In two dimensions, i.e.

plane geometry , if the points p and q have Cartesian coordinates ( x 1 , y 1 ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} and ( x 2 , y 2 ) {\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} , their Chebyshev distance is D C h e b y s h e v = max ( | x 2 − − x 1 | , | y 2 − − y 1 | ) .

{\displaystyle D_{\rm {Chebyshev}}=\max \left(\left|x_{2}-x_{1}\right|,\left|y_{2}-y_{1}\right|\right).} Under this metric, a circle of radius r , which is the set of points with Chebyshev distance r from a center point, is a square whose sides have the length 2 r and are parallel to the coordinate axes.

On a chessboard, where one is using a discrete Chebyshev distance, rather than a continuous one, the circle of radius r is a square of side lengths 2 r, measuring from the centers of squares, and thus each side contains 2 r +1 squares; for example, the circle of radius 1 on a chess board is a 3×3 square.

Properties [ edit ] Comparison of Chebyshev, Euclidean and Manhattan distances for the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle on a chessboard In one dimension, all L p metrics are equal – they are just the absolute value of the difference.

The two dimensional Manhattan distance has "circles" i.e.

level sets in the form of squares, with sides of length √ 2 r , oriented at an angle of π/4 (45°) to the coordinate axes, so the planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to (i.e. a linear transformation of) the planar Manhattan distance.

However, this geometric equivalence between L 1 and L ∞ metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions. A sphere formed using the Chebyshev distance as a metric is a cube with each face perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, but a sphere formed using Manhattan distance is an octahedron : these are dual polyhedra , but among cubes, only the square (and 1-dimensional line segment) are self-dual polytopes . Nevertheless, it is true that in all finite-dimensional spaces the L 1 and L ∞ metrics are mathematically dual to each other.

On a grid (such as a chessboard), the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 of a point are the Moore neighborhood of that point.

The Chebyshev distance is the limiting case of the order- p {\displaystyle p} Minkowski distance , when p {\displaystyle p} reaches infinity .

Applications [ edit ] The Chebyshev distance is sometimes used in warehouse logistics , [ 4 ] as it effectively measures the time an overhead crane takes to move an object (as the crane can move on the x and y axes at the same time but at the same speed along each axis).

It is also widely used in electronic computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) applications, in particular, in optimization algorithms for these.

Generalizations [ edit ] For the sequence space of infinite-length sequences of real or complex numbers, the Chebyshev distance generalizes to the ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }} -norm ; this norm is sometimes called the Chebyshev norm. For the space of (real or complex-valued) functions, the Chebyshev distance generalizes to the uniform norm .
