about petroleum resources , or their transportation, consumption, or regulation. The term may also refer generally to any conflict in a region that contains oil reserves or is geographically positioned in a location where an entity has or may wish to develop production or transportation infrastructure for petroleum products . It is also used to refer to any of a number of specific oil wars.

Research by Emily Meierding has characterized oil wars as largely a myth.

[ 1 ] She argues that proponents of oil wars underestimate the ability to seize and exploit foreign oil fields , and thus exaggerate the value of oil wars. She has examined four cases commonly described as oil wars ( Japan 's attack on the Dutch East Indies in World War II , Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , the Iran-Iraq War , and the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay ), finding that control of additional oil resources was not the main cause of aggression in the conflicts.

[ 2 ] A 2024 study found that the presence of oil in contested territory can make states less likely to seek to acquire the territory.

[ 3 ] List of wars described as oil wars [ edit ] During World War I (1914–1918), certain operations were planned specifically to secure oil resources.

Global Policy Forum . August 6, 2002.

The United States and the United Kingdom, who use their veto power to prolong the sanctions, bear special responsibility for the UN action. No-fly zones, periodic military attacks, and threats of regime-change block peaceful outcomes, as do vilification of Saddam Hussein, pro-sanctions propaganda, and other politicization of the crisis. Though real concerns about Iraq's security threat undoubtedly are legitimate, commercial interests, especially control over Iraq's oil resources, appear to be a driving force behind much of the policy making.
