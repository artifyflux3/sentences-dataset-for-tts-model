General information Unit system SI Unit of angular speed Symbol rad/s, rad⋅s −1 The radian per second (symbol: rad⋅s −1 or rad/s ) is the unit of angular velocity in the International System of Units (SI). The radian per second is also the SI unit of angular frequency (symbol ω , omega). The radian per second is defined as the angular frequency that results in the angular displacement increasing by one radian every second.

[ 1 ] Relation to other units [ edit ] A frequency of one hertz (1 Hz), or one cycle per second (1 cps), corresponds to an angular frequency of 2 π radians per second. This is because one cycle of rotation corresponds to an angular rotation of 2 π radians.

[ 2 ] Since the radian is a dimensionless unit in the SI , the radian per second is dimensionally equivalent to the hertz—both can be expressed as reciprocal seconds , s −1 . So, context is necessary to specify which kind of quantity is being expressed, angular frequency or ordinary frequency.

One radian per second also corresponds to about 9.55 revolutions per minute (rpm).

[ 3 ] Degrees per second may also be defined, based on degree of arc , where 1 degree per second (°/s) is equivalent to ⁠ π / 180 ⁠ rad⋅s −1 .

Quantity correspondence Angular frequency ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } Frequency ν ν = ω ω / 2 π π {\displaystyle \nu =\omega /{2\pi }} 2π rad/s 1 Hz 1 rad/s ≈ 0.159155 Hz 1 rad/s ≈ 9.5493 rpm 0.1047 rad/s ≈ 1 rpm Coherent units [ edit ] A use of the unit radian per second is in calculation of the power transmitted by a shaft. In the International System of Quantities (SI) and the International System of Units , widely used in physics and engineering , the power p is equal to the angular speed ω multiplied by the torque τ applied to the shaft: p = ω ⋅ τ .  When coherent units are used for these quantities, which are respectively the watt , the radian per second, and the newton-metre , and thus W = rad/s × N·m , no numerical factor needed when performing the numerical calculation. When the units are not coherent (e.g.

horsepower , turn /min, and pound-foot ), an additional factor will generally be necessary.
