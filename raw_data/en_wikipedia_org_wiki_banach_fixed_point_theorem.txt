It can be understood as an abstract formulation of Picard's method of successive approximations .

[ 1 ] The theorem is named after Stefan Banach (1892–1945) who first stated it in 1922.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Statement [ edit ] Definition.

Let ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} be a metric space . Then a map T : X → → X {\displaystyle T:X\to X} is called a contraction mapping on X if there exists q ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle q\in [0,1)} such that d ( T ( x ) , T ( y ) ) ≤ ≤ q d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d(T(x),T(y))\leq qd(x,y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x,y\in X.} Banach fixed-point theorem.

Let ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} be a non- empty complete metric space with a contraction mapping T : X → → X .

{\displaystyle T:X\to X.} Then T admits a unique fixed-point x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle x^{*}} in X (i.e.

T ( x ∗ ∗ ) = x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle T(x^{*})=x^{*}} ). Furthermore, x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle x^{*}} can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element x 0 ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x_{0}\in X} and define a sequence ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} by x n = T ( x n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle x_{n}=T(x_{n-1})} for n ≥ ≥ 1.

{\displaystyle n\geq 1.} Then lim n → → ∞ ∞ x n = x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }x_{n}=x^{*}} .

Remark 1.

The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the speed of convergence : d ( x ∗ ∗ , x n ) ≤ ≤ q n 1 − − q d ( x 1 , x 0 ) , d ( x ∗ ∗ , x n + 1 ) ≤ ≤ q 1 − − q d ( x n + 1 , x n ) , d ( x ∗ ∗ , x n + 1 ) ≤ ≤ q d ( x ∗ ∗ , x n ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d(x^{*},x_{n})&\leq {\frac {q^{n}}{1-q}}d(x_{1},x_{0}),\\[5pt]d(x^{*},x_{n+1})&\leq {\frac {q}{1-q}}d(x_{n+1},x_{n}),\\[5pt]d(x^{*},x_{n+1})&\leq qd(x^{*},x_{n}).\end{aligned}}} Any such value of q is called a Lipschitz constant for T {\displaystyle T} , and the smallest one is sometimes called "the best Lipschitz constant" of T {\displaystyle T} .

Remark 2.

d ( T ( x ) , T ( y ) ) < d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d(T(x),T(y))<d(x,y)} for all x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map T : [ 1 , ∞ ∞ ) → → [ 1 , ∞ ∞ ) , T ( x ) = x + 1 x , {\displaystyle T:[1,\infty )\to [1,\infty ),\,\,T(x)=x+{\tfrac {1}{x}}\,,} which lacks a fixed point. However, if X {\displaystyle X} is compact , then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of d ( x , T ( x ) ) {\displaystyle d(x,T(x))} , indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of T .

{\displaystyle T.} It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of T .

{\displaystyle T.} Remark 3.

When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define X {\displaystyle X} properly so that T ( X ) ⊆ ⊆ X .

{\displaystyle T(X)\subseteq X.} Proof [ edit ] Let x 0 ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x_{0}\in X} be arbitrary and define a sequence ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} by setting x n = T ( x n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle x_{n}=T(x_{n-1})} . We first note that for all n ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} ,} we have the inequality d ( x n + 1 , x n ) ≤ ≤ q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) .

{\displaystyle d(x_{n+1},x_{n})\leq q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0}).} This follows by induction on n {\displaystyle n} , using the fact that T {\displaystyle T} is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} is a Cauchy sequence . In particular, let m , n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle m,n\in \mathbb {N} } such that m > n {\displaystyle m>n} : d ( x m , x n ) ≤ ≤ d ( x m , x m − − 1 ) + d ( x m − − 1 , x m − − 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + d ( x n + 1 , x n ) ≤ ≤ q m − − 1 d ( x 1 , x 0 ) + q m − − 2 d ( x 1 , x 0 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) = q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ∑ ∑ k = 0 m − − n − − 1 q k ≤ ≤ q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ∑ ∑ k = 0 ∞ ∞ q k = q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ( 1 1 − − q ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d(x_{m},x_{n})&\leq d(x_{m},x_{m-1})+d(x_{m-1},x_{m-2})+\cdots +d(x_{n+1},x_{n})\\[5pt]&\leq q^{m-1}d(x_{1},x_{0})+q^{m-2}d(x_{1},x_{0})+\cdots +q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0})\\[5pt]&=q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0})\sum _{k=0}^{m-n-1}q^{k}\\[5pt]&\leq q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0})\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }q^{k}\\[5pt]&=q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0})\left({\frac {1}{1-q}}\right).\end{aligned}}} Let ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} be arbitrary. Since q ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle q\in [0,1)} , we can find a large N ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle N\in \mathbb {N} } so that q N < ε ε ( 1 − − q ) d ( x 1 , x 0 ) .

{\displaystyle q^{N}<{\frac {\varepsilon (1-q)}{d(x_{1},x_{0})}}.} Therefore, by choosing m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} greater than N {\displaystyle N} we may write: d ( x m , x n ) ≤ ≤ q n d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ( 1 1 − − q ) < ( ε ε ( 1 − − q ) d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ) d ( x 1 , x 0 ) ( 1 1 − − q ) = ε ε .

{\displaystyle d(x_{m},x_{n})\leq q^{n}d(x_{1},x_{0})\left({\frac {1}{1-q}}\right)<\left({\frac {\varepsilon (1-q)}{d(x_{1},x_{0})}}\right)d(x_{1},x_{0})\left({\frac {1}{1-q}}\right)=\varepsilon .} This proves that the sequence ( x n ) n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }} is Cauchy. By completeness of ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} , the sequence has a limit x ∗ ∗ ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x^{*}\in X.} Furthermore, x ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle x^{*}} must be a fixed point of T {\displaystyle T} : x ∗ ∗ = lim n → → ∞ ∞ x n = lim n → → ∞ ∞ T ( x n − − 1 ) = T ( lim n → → ∞ ∞ x n − − 1 ) = T ( x ∗ ∗ ) .

{\displaystyle x^{*}=\lim _{n\to \infty }x_{n}=\lim _{n\to \infty }T(x_{n-1})=T\left(\lim _{n\to \infty }x_{n-1}\right)=T(x^{*}).} As a contraction mapping, T {\displaystyle T} is continuous, so bringing the limit inside T {\displaystyle T} was justified. Lastly, T {\displaystyle T} cannot have more than one fixed point in ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} , since any pair of distinct fixed points p 1 {\displaystyle p_{1}} and p 2 {\displaystyle p_{2}} would contradict the contraction of T {\displaystyle T} : d ( T ( p 1 ) , T ( p 2 ) ) = d ( p 1 , p 2 ) > q d ( p 1 , p 2 ) .

{\displaystyle d(T(p_{1}),T(p_{2}))=d(p_{1},p_{2})>qd(p_{1},p_{2}).} Applications [ edit ] A standard application is the proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain ordinary differential equations . The sought solution of the differential equation is expressed as a fixed point of a suitable integral operator on the space of continuous functions under the uniform norm . The Banach fixed-point theorem is then used to show that this integral operator has a unique fixed point.

One consequence of the Banach fixed-point theorem is that small Lipschitz perturbations of the identity are bi-lipschitz homeomorphisms. Let Ω be an open set of a Banach space E ; let I : Ω → E denote the identity (inclusion) map and let g : Ω → E be a Lipschitz map of constant k < 1. Then Ω′ := ( I + g )(Ω) is an open subset of E : precisely, for any x in Ω such that B ( x , r ) ⊂ Ω one has B (( I + g )( x ), r (1 − k )) ⊂ Ω′; I + g : Ω → Ω′ is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism; precisely, ( I + g ) −1 is still of the form I + h : Ω → Ω′ with h a Lipschitz map of constant k /(1 − k ). A direct consequence of this result yields the proof of the inverse function theorem .

It can be used to give sufficient conditions under which Newton's method of successive approximations is guaranteed to work, and similarly for Chebyshev's third-order method.

It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to integral equations.

It can be used to give a proof to the Nash embedding theorem .

[ 4 ] It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to value iteration, policy iteration, and policy evaluation of reinforcement learning .

[ 5 ] It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in Cournot competition , [ 6 ] and other dynamic economic models.

[ 7 ] Converses [ edit ] Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to Czesław Bessaga , from 1959: Let f : X → X be a map of an abstract set such that each iterate f n has a unique fixed point. Let q ∈ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , {\displaystyle q\in (0,1),} then there exists a complete metric on X such that f is contractive, and q is the contraction constant.

Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if f : X → → X {\displaystyle f:X\to X} is a map on a T 1 topological space with a unique fixed point a , such that for each x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} we have f n ( x ) → a , then there already exists a metric on X with respect to which f satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2.

[ 8 ] In this case the metric is in fact an ultrametric .

Generalizations [ edit ] There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries ).

[ 9 ] Let T : X → X be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are: Assume that some iterate T n of T is a contraction. Then T has a unique fixed point.

Assume that for each n , there exist c n such that d ( T n ( x ), T n ( y )) ≤ c n d ( x , y ) for all x and y , and that ∑ ∑ n c n < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \sum \nolimits _{n}c_{n}<\infty .} Then T has a unique fixed point.

In applications, the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map T a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for generalizations.

In a non-empty compact metric space , any function T {\displaystyle T} satisfying d ( T ( x ) , T ( y ) ) < d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d(T(x),T(y))<d(x,y)} for all distinct x , y {\displaystyle x,y} , has a unique fixed point. The proof is simpler than the Banach theorem, because the function d ( T ( x ) , x ) {\displaystyle d(T(x),x)} is continuous, and therefore assumes a minimum, which is easily shown to be zero.

A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of metric space , e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric.

[ 10 ] Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.

[ 11 ] Example [ edit ] An application of the Banach fixed-point theorem and fixed-point iteration can be used to quickly obtain an approximation of π with high accuracy. Consider the function f ( x ) = sin ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) + x {\displaystyle f(x)=\sin(x)+x} . It can be verified that π is a fixed point of f , and that f maps the interval [ 3 π π / 4 , 5 π π / 4 ] {\displaystyle \left[3\pi /4,5\pi /4\right]} to itself. Moreover, f ′ ( x ) = 1 + cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle f'(x)=1+\cos(x)} , and it can be verified that 0 ≤ ≤ 1 + cos ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ≤ ≤ 1 − − 1 2 < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq 1+\cos(x)\leq 1-{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}<1} on this interval. Therefore, by an application of the mean value theorem , f has a Lipschitz constant less than 1 (namely 1 − − 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1-1/{\sqrt {2}}} ). Applying the Banach fixed-point theorem shows that the fixed point π is the unique fixed point on the interval, allowing for fixed-point iteration to be used.

For example, the value 3 may be chosen to start the fixed-point iteration, as 3 π π / 4 ≤ ≤ 3 ≤ ≤ 5 π π / 4 {\displaystyle 3\pi /4\leq 3\leq 5\pi /4} . The Banach fixed-point theorem may be used to conclude that π π = f ( f ( f ( ⋯ ⋯ f ( 3 ) ⋯ ⋯ ) ) ) ) .

{\displaystyle \pi =f(f(f(\cdots f(3)\cdots )))).} Applying f to 3 only three times already yields an expansion of π accurate to 33 digits: f ( f ( f ( 3 ) ) ) = 3.141592653589793238462643383279502 … … .

{\displaystyle f(f(f(3)))=3.141592653589793238462643383279502\ldots \,.} See also [ edit ] Brouwer fixed-point theorem Caristi fixed-point theorem Contraction mapping Fichera's existence principle Fixed-point iteration Fixed-point theorems Infinite compositions of analytic functions Kantorovich theorem Notes [ edit ] ^ Kinderlehrer, David ; Stampacchia, Guido (1980).
