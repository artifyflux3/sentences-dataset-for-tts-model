[ citation needed ] It potentially encompasses the extraction , transmission , generation , distribution and storage of fuels .  It is also sometimes called energy flow .

This supply of energy can be disrupted by several factors, including imposition of higher energy prices due to action by OPEC or other cartel , war, political disputes, economic disputes, or physical damage to the energy infrastructure due to terrorism .  The security of the energy supply is a major concern of national security and energy law .

Other uses [ edit ] New York Consolidated Laws includes a statutory code called " Energy Law ".

[ 1 ] Article 21 of this code is called "Energy Supply and Production", but rather than a comprehensive code, only consists of one section dealing with renewable energy .
