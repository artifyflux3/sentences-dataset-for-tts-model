[Intelsat I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_I "Intelsat I") (1965), the world's first commercial [communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite"), was used among others to relay the [Our World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_World_(1967_TV_program) "Our World (1967 TV program)") multi-national broadcast (1967), the first multi-[satellite relayed television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television "Satellite television") broadcast.

**Space economy** refers to the set of activities, industries, technologies, services, and resources that generate [economic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_value "Economic value") through the [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration"), understanding, management, and exploitation of [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-1)

Commercial satellite use began in 1962 with [Telstar 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_1 "Telstar 1"), transmitting TV signals across the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"). [Syncom 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncom_3 "Syncom 3") expanded possibilities in 1964, broadcasting the [Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympics "Olympics"). [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [TIROS satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite "Television Infrared Observation Satellite") advanced [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") research, while [Intelsat I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_I "Intelsat I") in 1965 showed commercial viability. Later, France's [Arianespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianespace "Arianespace") and USA's [Iridium Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_Communications "Iridium Communications") furthered satellite services. By 2004, global investment in all space sectors was estimated to be US$50.8 billion.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-2) As of 2010, 31% of all space launches were commercial.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-3) By the year 2035, the space economy is projected to have grown to $1.8 trillion.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-4)

The commercial spaceflight sector primarily generates revenue by launching satellites into Earth's orbit, facilitated by providers deploying satellites into [Low Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_Orbit "Low Earth Orbit") and [Geostationary Earth Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Earth_Orbit "Geostationary Earth Orbit"). The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA) licenses six U.S. [spaceports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceport "Spaceport") and oversees commercial rocket launches, with global capacity expanding from sites in Russia, France, and China. Investment in [reusable launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle "Reusable launch vehicle") by companies like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") and [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") is driving innovation in this sector. In 2022, 74 FAA-licensed commercial space operations were conducted, and this number is expected to double in the near future.

Commercial satellite manufacturing encompasses non-military, civilian, governmental, and non-profit satellite production along with ground equipment manufacturing, supporting satellite operations, and transponder leasing providing satellite access. Satellite subscription services offer access to a variety of television channels (such as [DirecTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV "DirecTV") and [Dish network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dish_network "Dish network")), radio stations (like [SiriusXM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiriusXM "SiriusXM")), and other media content through satellite transmission. Satellite imagery provides detailed views of Earth, sold by imaging companies to governments and businesses like [Apple Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps "Apple Maps"). Satellite telecommunications enable Internet services globally. Satellite navigation systems use signals from satellites for precise positioning and timing. Space tourism ventures (led by [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX"), [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic") and [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin")) envision recreational human space travel. Commercial space resource recovery involves extracting materials from asteroids and other celestial bodies for use in space or on Earth.

Space commerce regulation has historically faced challenges regarding property rights in space, but legislation like the [U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Commercial_Space_Launch_Competitiveness_Act "U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act") aims to clarify ownership and encourage commercial space exploration.

The first commercial use of satellites may have been the [Telstar 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_1 "Telstar 1") satellite, launched in 1962, which was the first privately sponsored space launch, funded by [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T "AT&T") and [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories "Bell Telephone Laboratories"). Telstar 1 was capable of relaying television signals across the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"), and was the first satellite to transmit live television, [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone "Telephone"), [fax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax "Fax"), and other data signals.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-6) Two years later, the [Hughes Aircraft Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft_Company "Hughes Aircraft Company") developed the [Syncom 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncom_3 "Syncom 3") satellite, a [geosynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous "Geosynchronous")[communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite"), leased to the [Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense"). Commercial possibilities of satellites were further realized when the Syncom 3, orbiting near the [International Date Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line "International Date Line"), was used to telecast the [1964 Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics "1964 Summer Olympics") from [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo") to the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-NASA-SP-93-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-8)

Between 1960 and 1966, the [U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") (NASA) launched a series of early [weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellites "Weather satellites") known as [Television Infrared Observation Satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite "Television Infrared Observation Satellite") (TIROS). These satellites greatly advanced [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") worldwide, as satellite imagery was used for better forecasting, for both public and commercial interests.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-10)

On April 6, 1965, the [Hughes Aircraft Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft_Company "Hughes Aircraft Company") placed the [Intelsat I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_I "Intelsat I")[communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") in [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") over the Atlantic Ocean. Intelsat I was built for the [Communications Satellite Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Satellite_Corporation "Communications Satellite Corporation") (COMSAT), and demonstrated that satellite-based communication was commercially feasible. Intelsat I allowed for near-instantaneous contact between [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") by handling television, telephone and fax transmissions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-12) Two years later, the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") launched the [Orbita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbita_(TV_system) "Orbita (TV system)") satellite, which provided television signals across [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), and started the first national [satellite television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television "Satellite television") network.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-14) Similarly, the 1972 [Anik A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anik_(satellite) "Anik (satellite)") satellite, launched by [Telesat Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telesat_Canada "Telesat Canada"), allowed the [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation") to reach [northern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada "Northern Canada") for the first time.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-16)

In 1980, Europe's [Arianespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianespace "Arianespace") became the world's first commercial [launch service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_service_provider "Launch service provider").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-Jaeger1986-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-arianespace1980-18)

Beginning in 1997, [Iridium Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_Communications "Iridium Communications") began launching a series of satellites known as the [Iridium satellite constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation "Iridium satellite constellation"), which provided the first satellites for direct [satellite telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_telephone "Satellite telephone") service.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-20)

The commercial [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") industry derives the bulk of its revenue from the launching of satellites into the Earth's orbit. Commercial launch providers typically place private and government satellites into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (LEO) and [geosynchronous Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_Earth_orbit "Geosynchronous Earth orbit") (GEO).

The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA) has licensed six commercial [spaceports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceports "Spaceports") in the United States: [Wallops Flight Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Flight_Facility "Wallops Flight Facility"), [Kodiak Launch Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodiak_Launch_Complex "Kodiak Launch Complex"), [Spaceport Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceport_Florida "Spaceport Florida"), [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center"), [Cape Canaveral Space Force Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"), and the [Vandenberg Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base "Vandenberg Air Force Base"). Launch sites within [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") have added to the global commercial launch capacity. The [Delta IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV "Delta IV"), [Atlas V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V "Atlas V"), and [Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_vehicles "SpaceX launch vehicles") family of launch vehicles are made available for commercial ventures for the United States, while Russia promotes eight families of vehicles.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Between 1996 and 2002, 245 launches were made for commercial ventures while government (non-classified) launches only totaled 167 for the same period.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Commercial space flight has spurred investment into the development of an efficient [reusable launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle "Reusable launch vehicle") (RLV) which can place larger payloads into orbit. Several companies such as [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") and [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") are currently developing new RLV designs.

In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (generally referred to as [FAA/AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA/AST "FAA/AST") or simply AST) is the branch of the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA) that approves any commercial [rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") launch operations—that is, any launches that are not classified as [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_rocket "Model rocket"), amateur, or "by and for the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government")."[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-21) In [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year "Fiscal year") 2022, there were 74 FAA-licensed commercial space operations, which includes both launches and reentries.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-:0-22) In 2023, the FAA predicted that commercial launches it licenses could more than double in the next several years.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-:0-22)

### Satellite manufacturing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Satellite manufacturing")]

Commercial satellite manufacturing is defined by the United States government as satellites manufactured for civilian, government, or [non-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit "Non-profit") use.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Not included are satellites constructed for military use, nor for activities associated with any [human space flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_space_flight "Human space flight") program. Between the years of 1996 and 2002, satellite manufacturing within the United States experienced an annual growth of 11%.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The rest of the world experienced higher growth levels of around 13%.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Ground equipment manufacturing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ground equipment manufacturing")]

Operating satellites communicate via receivers and transmitters on Earth. The manufacturing of satellite [ground station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_station "Ground station") communication terminals (including [VSATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSAT "VSAT")), mobile [satellite telephones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_telephones "Satellite telephones"), and home television receivers are a part of the ground equipment manufacturing sector. This sector grew through the latter half of the 1990s as it manufactured equipment for the satellite services sector. Between 1996 and 2002, this industry saw a 14% annual increase.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Satellite imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery "Satellite imagery") (also Earth observation imagery or spaceborne photography) are [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image "Image") of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") or other planets collected by [imaging satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite") operated by governments and businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as [Apple Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps "Apple Maps") and [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps "Google Maps").

### Satellite telecommunications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Satellite telecommunications")]

In 1994, [DirecTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV "DirecTV") debuted [direct broadcast satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_broadcast_satellite "Direct broadcast satellite") by introducing a signal receiving dish 18 inches in diameter. In 1996, [Astro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_(satellite_TV) "Astro (satellite TV)") started in [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia") with the launch of the [MEASAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEASAT "MEASAT") satellite. In November 1999, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act became law, and local stations were then made available in satellite channel packages, fueling the industry's growth in the years that followed. By the end of 2000, DTH subscriptions totaled over 67 million.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Satellite radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_radio "Satellite radio") was pioneered by [XM Satellite Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_Satellite_Radio "XM Satellite Radio") and [Sirius Satellite Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_Satellite_Radio "Sirius Satellite Radio"). XM's first satellite was launched on March 18, 2001 and its second on May 8, 2001.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-kbonsor-23) Its first broadcast occurred on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-sparker-24) Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-25) expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-sparker-24) The two companies spent over $3 billion combined to develop satellite radio technology, build and launch the satellites, and for various other business expenses.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-spacefoundation-26)

[Satellite internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet "Satellite internet") is also an emerging market, as they can be used to transmit and receive Internet services from space to any place in the planet Earth.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-27) This enables its use for markets such as [cruise ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ships "Cruise ships"), long-haul buses, flights and rural areas. [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink "Starlink") is a notable example of such a service offered by [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX").

#### Transponder leasing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Transponder leasing")]

Businesses that operate satellites often lease or sell access to their satellites to data relay and [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication") firms. This service is often referred to as transponder leasing. Between 1996 and 2002, this industry experienced a 15% annual growth. The United States accounts for about 32% of the world's transponder market.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Satellite navigation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Satellite navigation")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Magellan_GPS_Blazer12.jpg/250px-Magellan_GPS_Blazer12.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magellan_GPS_Blazer12.jpg)

A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") receivers to determine their location ([longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"), [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"), and [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude")/[elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation "Elevation")) to high precision (within a few centimeters to metres) using [time signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signal "Time signal") transmitted along a [line of sight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation "Line-of-sight propagation") by [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronization. These uses are collectively known as Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT). Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.

Space tourism is [human space travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") for recreational purposes.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-28) There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin "Blue Origin") and [Virgin Galactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic "Virgin Galactic").

Commercial recovery of space resources
--------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commercial_use_of_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Commercial recovery of space resources")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Asteroidmining.jpg/250px-Asteroidmining.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Asteroidmining.jpg)

Artist's concept of asteroid mining

Commercial recovery of space resources is the exploitation of raw materials from [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), comets and other space objects, including [near-Earth objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object "Near-Earth object").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-April_2012-29) Minerals and volatiles could be [mined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") then used in space for [in-situ utilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_resource_utilization "In-situ resource utilization") (e.g., construction materials and rocket propellant) or taken back to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). These include [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), [iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium "Iridium"), [silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver "Silver"), [osmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmium "Osmium"), [palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium "Palladium"), [platinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum "Platinum"), [rhenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhenium "Rhenium"), [rhodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodium "Rhodium"), [ruthenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenium "Ruthenium") and [tungsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten "Tungsten") for transport back to Earth; [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron"), [cobalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt "Cobalt"), [manganese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese "Manganese"), [molybdenum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum "Molybdenum"), [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel"), [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium"), and [titanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium "Titanium") for construction; water and oxygen to sustain astronauts; as well as hydrogen, ammonia, and oxygen for use as rocket propellant.

There are several commercial enterprises working in this field, including [ispace Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ispace_Inc. "Ispace Inc.") and [Moon Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Express "Moon Express").

The first in-space transaction of resources is [contracted by NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Lunar_Payload_Services "Commercial Lunar Payload Services") to four companies to sell NASA collected lunar regolith on the Moon.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-Breaking_Ground_2021_u077-30)

Beyond the many technological factors that could make space commercialization more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property"), the difficulty or inability of individuals in establishing [property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights "Property rights") in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for both human habitation and commercial development.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-tna2012fall-31)

Since the advent of [space technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_technology "Space technology") in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of [national](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state")[territorial claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_claim "Land claim") in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") and on [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_body "Celestial body") has been specifically proscribed by the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty"), which had been, as of 2012, ratified by all spacefaring nations.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-tna2012fall-31)

On November 25, 2015, President Obama signed the [U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Space_Launch_Competitiveness_Act_of_2015 "Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015") into law. The law recognizes the right of U.S. citizens to own space resources they obtain and encourages the commercial exploration and utilization of resources from asteroids. According to the law under [51 U.S.C. § 51303](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title51-section51303&num=0&edition=prelim):[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_economy#cite_note-32)

> A United States citizen engaged in commercial recovery of an asteroid resource or a space resource under this chapter shall be entitled to any asteroid resource or space resource obtained, including to possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States
