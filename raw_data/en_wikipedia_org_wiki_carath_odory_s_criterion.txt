Statement [ edit ] Carathéodory's criterion : 
Let λ λ ∗ ∗ : P ( R n ) → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}:{\mathcal {P}}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})\to [0,\infty ]} denote the Lebesgue outer measure on R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} where P ( R n ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})} denotes the power set of R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} and let M ⊆ ⊆ R n .

{\displaystyle M\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Then M {\displaystyle M} is Lebesgue measurable if and only if λ λ ∗ ∗ ( S ) = λ λ ∗ ∗ ( S ∩ ∩ M ) + λ λ ∗ ∗ ( S ∩ ∩ M c ) {\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}(S)=\lambda ^{*}(S\cap M)+\lambda ^{*}\left(S\cap M^{c}\right)} for every S ⊆ ⊆ R n , {\displaystyle S\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n},} where M c {\displaystyle M^{c}} denotes the complement of M .

{\displaystyle M.} Notice that S {\displaystyle S} is not required to be a measurable set.

[ 1 ] Generalization [ edit ] The Carathéodory criterion is of considerable importance because, in contrast to Lebesgue's original formulation of measurability, which relies on certain topological properties of R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} this criterion readily generalizes to a characterization of measurability in abstract spaces.  Indeed, in the generalization to abstract measures, this theorem is sometimes extended to a definition of measurability.

[ 1 ] Thus, we have the following definition: 
If μ μ ∗ ∗ : P ( Ω Ω ) → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}:{\mathcal {P}}(\Omega )\to [0,\infty ]} is an outer measure on a set Ω Ω , {\displaystyle \Omega ,} where P ( Ω Ω ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(\Omega )} denotes the power set of Ω Ω , {\displaystyle \Omega ,} then a subset M ⊆ ⊆ Ω Ω {\displaystyle M\subseteq \Omega } is called μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} –measurable or Carathéodory-measurable if for every S ⊆ ⊆ Ω Ω , {\displaystyle S\subseteq \Omega ,} the equality μ μ ∗ ∗ ( S ) = μ μ ∗ ∗ ( S ∩ ∩ M ) + μ μ ∗ ∗ ( S ∩ ∩ M c ) {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}(S)=\mu ^{*}(S\cap M)+\mu ^{*}\left(S\cap M^{c}\right)} holds where M c := Ω Ω ∖ ∖ M {\displaystyle M^{c}:=\Omega \setminus M} is the complement of M .

{\displaystyle M.} The family of all μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} –measurable subsets is a σ-algebra (so for instance, the complement of a μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} –measurable set is μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} –measurable, and the same is true of countable intersections and unions of μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} –measurable sets) and the restriction of the outer measure μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} to this family is a measure .
