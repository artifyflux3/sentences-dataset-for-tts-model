h ɔːr n / HARTS -horn ; born March 15, 1938) is an American mathematician who is known for his work in algebraic geometry .

Career [ edit ] Hartshorne was a Putnam Fellow in Fall 1958 while he was an undergraduate at Harvard University [ 1 ] (under the name Robert C. Hartshorne [ 2 ] ). He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1963 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled Connectedness of the Hilbert scheme under the supervision of John Coleman Moore and Oscar Zariski .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He then became a Junior Fellow at Harvard University, where he taught for several years.

[ 5 ] In 1972, he was appointed to the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley , [ 5 ] where he is a Professor Emeritus as of 2020.

[ 6 ] Hartshorne is the author of the text Algebraic Geometry .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Awards [ edit ] In 1979, Hartshorne was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for "his expository research article Equivalence relations on algebraic cycles and subvarieties of small codimension, Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics, volume 29, American Mathematical Society, 1975, pp. 129-164; and his book Algebraic geometry , Springer-Verlag, Berlin and New York, 1977." [ 9 ] In 2012, Hartshorne became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 10 ] Personal life [ edit ] Hartshorne attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy , graduating in 1955. Hartshorne is married to Edie Churchill and has two sons and an adopted daughter.

[ 5 ] He is a mountain climber and amateur flute and shakuhachi player.
