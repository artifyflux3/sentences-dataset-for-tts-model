[ 1 ] Alma mater Dartmouth College ( BA ) California Institute of Technology ( PhD ) Known for Split-brain research, cerebral lateralization , cognitive neuroscience Awards Elected to the National Academy of Sciences , honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin Scientific career Fields Psychology , neuroscience Institutions University of California, Santa Barbara Doctoral advisor Roger Sperry Doctoral students Joseph E. LeDoux Michael S. Gazzaniga (born December 12, 1939) is an American cognitive neuroscientist who is an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara .

[ 2 ] He is the founder and retired director of the SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind at UCSB (2006–2023).

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] In 1961, Gazzaniga graduated from Dartmouth College with a B.A in zoology.

[ 4 ] In 1964, he received a Ph.D.

in psychobiology from the California Institute of Technology , [ 5 ] where he carried out research on human split-brain patients for his doctoral thesis under Roger Sperry .

[ 6 ] In his subsequent work he has made important advances in our understanding of which functions are lateralized in the brain and how the left and right cerebral hemispheres communicate with one another.

[ 7 ] Career [ edit ] He has had a distinguished career in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

[ 8 ] Gazzaniga's academic career began as an assistant professor of psychology at UCSB in 1967.

[ 9 ] In 1969 he moved to New York University graduate school as an assistant professor, and in 1972 became a full professor.

[ 5 ] In 1973 he took a position as professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and later became a professor of social sciences in Medicine.

[ 10 ] This led to Cornell University Medical College , where he was appointed Director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience and a professor of Neurology and Psychology from 1977 to 1988.

[ 4 ] During this period, he coined, with George A. Miller , the term cognitive neuroscience in 1978, helping establish the framework for the scientific study of how the brain creates the mind.

[ 11 ] From the 1970s through the 1990s, Gazzaniga helped establish the field of cognitive neuroscience , which integrates the study of the brain with psychology and cognitive science to understand how mental processes emerge from neural activity .

[ 12 ] His work has contributed to the development of experimental methods to study hemispheric specialization and the brain's role in cognitive functions such as language , reasoning , and facial recognition .

[ 13 ] Gazzaniga also played a key role in organizing the scientific community of cognitive neuroscience, including the establishment of academic societies and the publication of journals in the field.

[ 14 ] From 1988 to 1992, he was the Andrew W. Thomson Jr. Professor of Psychiatry and the director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Program at Dartmouth Medical School .

[ 15 ] It was at Dartmouth Medical School that Gazzaniga founded the first cognitive neuroscience degree-granting program in the United States, establishing an educational initiative that linked the fields of psychology , neuroscience , and cognitive science .

[ 4 ] After his time at Dartmouth Medical School , Gazzaniga moved to University of California Davis in 1992.

[ 4 ] At UC Davis, he launched and served as the Director of the Center for Neuroscience, where he continued to expand his pioneering research on brain function and cognitive processes.

[ 16 ] In 1993, he founded the Cognitive Neuroscience Society , a professional organization dedicated to advancing the field.

[ 10 ] [ 17 ] From 1988 to 2003, he served as the founding editor and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience .

[ 16 ] In 1996 , he returned to Dartmouth as the David T. McLaughlin Distinguished Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences and director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.

[ 18 ] Gazzaniga served as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Dartmouth College from 2002 to 2004.

[ 19 ] During his tenure, he also played a crucial role in shaping the academic landscape at the institution.

[ 15 ] In 2006, Gazzaniga became the founding Director of the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at UC Santa Barbara , a role he took on after his time at Dartmouth .

[ 20 ] At UCSB , he continued to lead  research into cognitive neuroscience , while fostering the study of the mind's complex relationship with the brain .

[ 12 ] In 2009, he delivered the Gifford Lectures on Mental Life at the University of Edinburgh .

[ 21 ] In 2019, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate.

[ 22 ] Gazzaniga's publication career includes books for a general audience such as The Social Brain , [ 23 ] Mind Matters , [ 24 ] Nature's Mind , [ 25 ] The Ethical Brain and Who's in Charge?

, [ 26 ] which is based on the Gifford lectures he presented at the University of Edinburgh in 2009.

[ 27 ] He is also the editor of The Cognitive Neurosciences book series published by the MIT Press , which features the work of nearly 200 scientists and is a sourcebook for the field.

[ 28 ] His latest book is entitled The Consciousness Instinct: Unraveling the Mystery of How the Brain Makes Mind , published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2018.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Research [ edit ] Early research [ edit ] Gazzaniga is known for his pioneering work in the field of cognitive neuroscience .

[ 32 ] His research with split-brain patients has been instrumental in understanding the distinct roles of the left and right hemispheres of the brain .

[ 33 ] In split-brain patients the corpus callosum , the giant nerve bundle which connects the right and left hemispheres, had been severed to limit the transmission of nerve impulses across the brain in the hopes of decreasing previously intractable seizures. The original series of split-brain patients, whose callosotomies had been done in the 1930s in Rochester, New York had been previously tested, [ 34 ] and no evidence was found that there was any disruption of the interhemispheric transfer of information after callosotomy. Later, however, Sperry and his graduate student Ron Myers found that severing the corpus callosum in monkeys did block the transfer of information.

[ 35 ] As a first-year graduate student at Caltech, Gazzaniga, convinced by the monkey research that transfer of information would be interrupted, began to test the first California split-brain patient with a testing procedure that had not been done on the previous series of split-brain patients.

[ 36 ] He designed an apparatus that flashed a letter, number or symbol onto a screen to either the right or left visual field while the patient focused on a central point.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Patient W.J.

[ edit ] Patient W.J. was a World War II paratrooper, the first of a series of patients that underwent a callosotomy on the West Coast.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] He had developed grand mal seizures after a German soldier knocked him out with a rifle butt after a parachute jump behind enemy lines.

[ 41 ] Before surgery, Gazzaniga tested W.J.'s brain functions.

[ 42 ] This included presenting stimuli to the left and right visual fields and identifying objects placed in his hands that were out of view.

[ 43 ] After he had the surgery, the test results were different.

[ 44 ] When a picture of an object was flashed to his right visual field, he was asked if he saw anything: He quickly named the object.

[ 45 ] When a picture was flashed to his left visual field, he denied seeing anything.

[ 46 ] Then a circle was flashed on the screen [ 47 ] and he was asked to point to whatever he had seen with whichever hand he wished.

[ 5 ] When the circle was flashed to the right visual field , he pointed to where it had been with his left hand.

[ 48 ] When it was flashed to his left visual field, he pointed to where it had been with his right hand, even though he denied seeing anything.

[ 49 ] This seemingly simple test showed that each hemisphere saw a circle when it was shown in the opposite visual field, and each hemisphere , separate from the other, could guide the contralateral hand, which it controls, to point to the circle it had seen, but only the left hemisphere could talk about it. Neither hemisphere knew what the other had seen.

[ 50 ] This experiment opened the door to years of research by Gazzaniga and colleagues that has revealed that severing the callosum prevents the transfer of perceptual, sensory, motor, gnostic and other types of information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

[ 51 ] Extensive research has shown that many of the brains processes are lateralized, such as speech and language to the left hemisphere, [ 52 ] along with analytical thinking and the capacity to interpret behavior and unconsciously driven emotional states, [ 53 ] while visuospatial processing, [ 54 ] facial recognition, [ 55 ] attentional monitoring, [ 56 ] and the ascribing of beliefs to others are right hemisphere processes.

[ 57 ] Patient P.S.

[ edit ] Patient P.S. was a teenage boy, the first split-brain patient studied from the east coast series who had a full callosotomy.

[ 58 ] He was also the first split-brain patient in that series who demonstrated extensive language comprehension in the right hemisphere.

[ 59 ] His right hemisphere was able to label pictures of objects by spelling out the appropriate word with Scrabble tiles. Even though he was right-handed, he could roughly write words with his left hand, even though he could not speak them.

[ 53 ] All these findings led Gazzaniga and his graduate student Joe LeDoux to wonder if the right hemisphere would be able to answer subjective and personal questions, did it have its own identity?  For example, they started out by saying, "Who" and then flashed the word 'are you' to his left visual field and thus his right hemisphere. He spelled out PAUL with his left hand using the tiles.
