[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Since the mid-20th century, the term " dynamics " (or " analytical dynamics ") has largely superseded "kinetics" in physics textbooks, [ 4 ] though the term is still used in engineering.

In plasma physics , kinetics refers to the study of continua in velocity space.  This is usually in the context of non-thermal ( non-Maxwellian ) velocity distributions, or processes that perturb thermal distributions. These " kinetic plasmas " cannot be adequately described with fluid equations .

The term kinetics is also used to refer to chemical kinetics , particularly in chemical physics and physical chemistry .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In such uses, a qualifier is often used or implied, for example: "physical kinetics", "crystal growth kinetics", and so on.
