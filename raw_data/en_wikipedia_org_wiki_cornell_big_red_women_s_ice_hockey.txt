They play at the Lynah Rink in Ithaca, New York.

The Ivy League announced in July 2020 that they would suspend play for all sports, including women's ice hockey, in the Fall 2020, due to the Coronavirus outbreak . Athletics resumed in fall of 2021.

History [ edit ] The Cornell women's hockey program was started in 1971. It would only be in 1972 that the team would play its first game; it was a 4–3 victory over Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight games and lost four. In addition, the Big Red lost twice to the Pandas's program.

[ 1 ] In 1976, Brown hosted the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. Cornell bested Brown, Princeton and Yale to win the tournament.

On March 7, 2010, sophomore Kendice Ogilvie beat Clarkson goaltender Lauren Dahm at 7:52 mark in overtime. With the victory, Cornell won its first ECAC Tournament, and earns its first trip to the NCAA Frozen Four.

[ 2 ] On March 13, 2010, Cornell defeated the Crimson by a score of 6–2 [ 3 ] to earn its first ever trip to the NCAA Frozen Four. At the 2010 Frozen Four championship game, Cornell goaltender Amanda Mazzotta set a record for most saves in an NCAA Championship game with 61 saves. The former record holder was Bulldog goaltender Patricia Sautter. She had the old record of 41 set in 2003.

[ 4 ] On January 7 and 8, 2011, Cornell freshman goaltender Lauren Slebodnik earned two shutouts in her first two career starts.

[ 5 ] On January 7, she made her NCAA debut by shutting out Yale by a 5–0 margin. With Cornell dressing just 12 skaters, she stopped all 23 Yale shots. The following night, Slebodnik shut out the Brown Bears by a 3–0 mark. Cornell only dressed 11 skaters for the game and she stopped all 15 shots.

In Jillian Saulnier 's college debut versus the Colgate Raiders on October 25, she netted four goals. In her first three career NCAA games, she registered ten points (seven goals, three assists), along with a +6 rating.

[ 6 ] Her four-goal night was the first for Cornell since Jessica Campbell scored four against Robert Morris in the second game of the 2010–11 season. She scored her first career goal when she was out on the Big Red's first power play of the game. In her next game versus the Yale Bulldogs, she registered one goal and two assists, while scoring two goals in her third game versus the Brown Bears squad. For the month of October 2011, she was tied for first in the ECAC in goals scored (while the other player appeared in eight games).

[ 7 ] In a game on November 1, 2011, the Cornell Big Red scored at least nine goals in one game for the third consecutive contest. It was senior captain Chelsea Karpenko's 100th career game, as Saulnier led all Big Red players with two goals and three assists in a 9–2 triumph over the Syracuse Orange .

[ 8 ] The Big Red had a standout year in 2019, finishing the season atop the standings in the ECAC. They lost in the ECAC championship game against Clarkson.

In 2020, Cornell finished first in the ECAC for the second year in a row, with an undefeated season in conference play at 19-0-3 ( 28-2-3 overall). They dominated the league and had an unbeaten streak of 22 games from November 30, 2019 to March 7, 2020.  The Big Red easily won their 15th Ivy League championship.

[ 9 ] In the ECAC tournament, Cornell beat perennial rival Harvard Crimson in the semi-final by a score of 4-0.  In a surprising upset in the championship game, they lost in overtime to the Princeton Tigers by a score of 3-2. Jessie Eldridge finished the season fourth in the ECAC in points, with 43, followed by her teammate Kristin O'Neil, who tallied 41 points on the year.

Izzy Daniel won Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Lindsay Browning, the Big Red's junior goalie, won Ivy League Player of the Year honors, and the MAC Goaltending Goalie of the Year.

[ 10 ] Jaime Bourbonnais won Ivy League Best Defenseman honors, and was selected as a First Team All-American.

[ 11 ] Head Coach Doug Derraugh was recognized with two Coach of the Year awards: the Ivy League Coach of the Year (his fourth in a row) and the ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year (second in a row).

[ 10 ] Cornell earned a berth in the 2020 NCAA women's ice hockey tournament, but the event was cancelled due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. In July 2020, the Ivy League announced there would be no league play in the fall of 2020, due to continuing concerns about health.  Cornell, along with fellow Ivy League teams Harvard, Brown , Dartmouth , Princeton and Yale , resumed athletics in the fall of 2021.

[ 12 ] The new Toronto Six Women's National Hockey League team signed Cornell alumna Amy Curlew in 2020.
