The **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics**[[t]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-24) (**USSR**),[[u]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-25) commonly known as the **Soviet Union**,[[v]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-26) was a [transcontinental country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_transcontinental_countries#Since_1700 "List of former transcontinental countries") that spanned much of [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") from 1922 until [it dissolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") in 1991. During its existence, it was the [largest country by area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "List of countries and dependencies by area"), extending across [eleven time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Russia "Time in Russia") and sharing [borders with twelve countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Soviet_Union#Borders_and_neighbors "Geography of the Soviet Union"), and the [third-most populous country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "List of countries and dependencies by population").[[w]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-27) An overall successor to the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), it was nominally organized as a [federal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_union "Federal union") of [national republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union "Republics of the Soviet Union"), the largest and most populous of which was the [Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_SFSR "Russian SFSR").[[x]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-28) In practice, [its government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union "Government of the Soviet Union") and [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union "Economy of the Soviet Union") were [highly centralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet-type_economic_planning "Soviet-type economic planning"). As a [one-party state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state") governed by the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union") (CPSU), it was the flagship [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state"). Its capital and largest city was [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow").

The Soviet Union's roots lay in the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") of 1917. The new government, led by [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), established the Russian SFSR, the world's first constitutionally [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state"). The revolution was not accepted by all within the [Russian Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Republic "Russian Republic"), resulting in the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War"). The Russian SFSR and its subordinate republics were [merged into the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Creation_of_the_Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics "Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics") in 1922. Following [Lenin's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_death "Lenin's death") in 1924, [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") came to power, inaugurating [rapid industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Industrialization in the Soviet Union") and [forced collectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Collectivization in the Soviet Union") that led to significant economic growth but contributed to a [famine between 1930 and 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1930%E2%80%931933 "Soviet famine of 1930–1933") that killed millions. The [Soviet forced labour camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_in_the_Soviet_Union "Forced labor in the Soviet Union") system of the [Gulag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag "Gulag") was expanded. During the late 1930s, Stalin's government conducted the [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") to remove opponents, resulting in large scale deportations, arrests, and show trials accompanied by public fear. Having failed to build an anti-Nazi coalition in Europe, the Soviet Union signed [a non-aggression pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") with [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") in 1939. Despite this, in 1941 Germany [invaded the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invaded_the_Soviet_Union "Invaded the Soviet Union") in the largest land invasion in history, opening the [Eastern Front of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_of_World_War_II "Eastern Front of World War II"). The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers") while liberating much of [Central and Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe "Central and Eastern Europe"). However they would suffer an estimated [27 million casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union "World War II casualties of the Soviet Union"), which accounted for most losses among the victorious [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II"). In the [aftermath of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II "Aftermath of World War II"), the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army"), forming [satellite states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_satellite_states "Soviet satellite states"), and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a [superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower").

Geopolitical tensions with the United States led to the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). The American-led [Western Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc "Western Bloc") coalesced into [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") in 1949, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance, the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact"), in 1955. Neither side engaged in direct military confrontation, and instead fought [on an ideological basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism "Cultural imperialism") and through [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war"). In 1953, following [Stalin's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin%27s_death "Stalin's death"), the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of [de-Stalinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Stalinization "De-Stalinization") under [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev"), which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies. This campaign caused ideological tensions with the [PRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC "PRC") led by [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), culminating in the acrimonious [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split"). During the 1950s, the Soviet Union expanded [its efforts in space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program "Soviet space program") and took a lead in the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race") with the [first artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_artificial_satellite "First artificial satellite"), the [first human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_human_spaceflight "First human spaceflight"), the [first space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1"), and the [first probe to land on another planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_7 "Venera 7"). In 1985, the last Soviet leader, [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev"), sought to reform the country through his policies of _[glasnost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost")_ and _[perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika")_. In 1989, various countries of the Warsaw Pact [overthrew their Soviet-backed regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989"), leading to the fall of the Eastern Bloc. A major wave of [nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist "Nationalist") and [separatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatist "Separatist") movements erupted across the Soviet Union, primarily in [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country) "Georgia (country)") and the [Baltic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states "Baltic states"). In 1991, amid efforts to [preserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_Union_referendum "1991 Soviet Union referendum") the country as a [renewed federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Union_Treaty "New Union Treaty"), an attempted [coup against Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt "1991 Soviet coup attempt") by hardline communists prompted the largest republics—Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus—to secede. On 26 December, Gorbachev officially recognized the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"). [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin"), the leader of the [Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"), oversaw its reconstitution into the [Russian Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation "Russian Federation"), which [became](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states#Soviet_Union "Succession of states") the Soviet Union's successor state; all other republics emerged as fully independent [post-Soviet states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states"). The [Commonwealth of Independent States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States "Commonwealth of Independent States") was formed in the aftermath of the disastrous Soviet collapse, although the Baltics would never join.

During its existence, the Soviet Union produced [many significant social and technological achievements and innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Soviet_innovation "Timeline of Soviet innovation"). The USSR was one of the most advanced industrial states during its existence. It [had the world's second-largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(nominal) "List of countries by past and projected GDP (nominal)") and largest standing military. An [NPT-designated state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"), it wielded the [largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "Russia and weapons of mass destruction"). As an Allied nation, it was a [founding member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations") of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") as well as one of the [five permanent members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council") of the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"). Before its dissolution, the Soviet Union was one of the world's two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe and Asia, global diplomacy, ideological influence (particularly in the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South "Global South")), military might, economic strengths, and [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_Soviet_Union "Science and technology in the Soviet Union") accomplishments.

The word _[soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet\_(council) "Soviet (council)")_ is derived from the [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") word _sovet_ (Russian: совет), meaning 'council', 'assembly', 'advice',[[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-29) ultimately deriving from the [proto-Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Slavic "Proto-Slavic") verbal stem of *_vět-iti_ ('to inform'), related to Slavic _věst_ ('news'), English _wise_. The word _sovietnik_ means 'councillor'.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Klein-1920-30) Some organizations in Russian history were called _council_ (Russian: совет). In the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), the [State Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_(Russian_Empire) "State Council (Russian Empire)"), which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Klein-1920-30)

The soviets as [workers' councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_council "Workers' council") first appeared during the [1905 Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution "1905 Russian Revolution").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPonsService2010763-31)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMccauley2014487-32) Although they were quickly suppressed by the Imperial army, after the [February Revolution of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution_of_1917 "February Revolution of 1917"), workers' and soldiers' soviets emerged throughout the country and shared power with the [Russian Provisional Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government "Russian Provisional Government").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPonsService2010763-31)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Dewdney-33) The Bolsheviks, led by [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), demanded that all power be transferred to the soviets, and gained support from the workers and soldiers.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-34) After the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution"), in which the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of the soviets,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Dewdney-33)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-35) Lenin proclaimed the formation of the [Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Socialist_Federal_Soviet_Republic "Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic") (RSFSR).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEService200584-36)

During the [Georgian Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Affair "Georgian Affair") of 1922, Lenin called for the Russian SFSR and other national soviet republics to form a greater union which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia (Russian: Союз Советских Республик Европы и Азии, romanized:_Soyuz Sovyetskikh Respublik Evropy i Azii_).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer1964608Lewin196950Leggett1981354Volkogonov1994421Service2000452%E2%80%93455White2001175-37)[Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") initially resisted Lenin's proposal but ultimately accepted it, and with Lenin's agreement he changed the name to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), although all republics began as _socialist soviet_ and did not change to the other order until [1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Soviet_Constitution "1936 Soviet Constitution"). In addition, in the regional languages of several republics, the word _council_ or _conciliar_ in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian _soviet_ and never in others, e.g. [Ukrainian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_SSR "Ukrainian SSR").

СССР (in the Latin alphabet: _SSSR_) is the abbreviation of the Russian-language cognate of USSR, as written in [Cyrillic letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_letters "Cyrillic letters"). The soviets used this abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning. After this, the most common Russian initialization is Союз ССР (transliteration: _Soyuz SSR_) which essentially translates to _Union of SSRs_ in English. In addition, the Russian short form name Советский Союз (transliteration: _Sovyetsky Soyuz_, which literally means _Soviet Union_) is also commonly used, but only in its unabbreviated form. Since the start of the [Great Patriotic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War "Great Patriotic War") at the latest, abbreviating the Russian name of the Soviet Union as СС has been taboo, the reason being that СС as a Russian Cyrillic abbreviation is associated with the infamous _[Schutzstaffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel "Schutzstaffel")_ of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), as _SS_ is in English.

In English-language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR. The Russian SFSR dominated the Soviet Union to such an extent that, for most of the Soviet Union's existence, it was colloquially, but incorrectly, referred to as **Russia**.

History
-------

The history of the Soviet Union began with the ideals of the [Bolshevik Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik_Revolution "Bolshevik Revolution") and ended in dissolution amidst economic collapse and political disintegration. Established in 1922 following the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War"), the Soviet Union quickly became a one-party state under the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"). Its early years under [Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin "Lenin") were marked by the implementation of socialist policies and the [New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy "New Economic Policy") (NEP), which allowed for market-oriented reforms.

The rise of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") in the late 1920s ushered in an era of intense centralization and totalitarianism. Stalin's rule was characterized by the forced [collectivization of agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Collectivization in the Soviet Union"), rapid [industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Industrialization in the Soviet Union"), and the [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge"), which eliminated perceived enemies of the state. The Soviet Union, one of the [Big Four Allied powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II) "Big Four (World War II)")[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Justus-38) alongside the United States, the United Kingdom, and China, played a crucial role in the [Allied victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), but at a tremendous human cost, with millions of Soviet citizens perishing in the conflict.

The Soviet Union emerged as one of the world's two superpowers, leading the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc") in opposition to the [Western Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc "Western Bloc") during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). This period saw the USSR engage in an arms race, the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"), and [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_wars "Proxy wars") around the globe. The post-Stalin leadership, particularly under [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev"), initiated a [de-Stalinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Stalinization "De-Stalinization") process, leading to a period of liberalization and relative openness known as the [Khrushchev Thaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khrushchev_Thaw "Khrushchev Thaw"). However, the subsequent era under [Leonid Brezhnev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev "Leonid Brezhnev"), referred to as the [Era of Stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation "Era of Stagnation"), was marked by economic decline, political corruption, and a rigid [gerontocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontocracy "Gerontocracy"). Despite efforts to maintain the Soviet Union's superpower status, the economy struggled due to its centralized nature, technological backwardness, and inefficiencies. The vast military expenditures and burdens of maintaining the Eastern Bloc, further strained the Soviet economy.

In the 1980s, [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev")'s policies of [Glasnost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost") (openness) and [Perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika") (restructuring) aimed to revitalize the Soviet system but instead accelerated its unraveling. Nationalist movements gained momentum across the [Soviet republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_republics "Soviet republics"), and the control of the Communist Party weakened. The failed [coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt "1991 Soviet coup attempt") in August 1991 against Gorbachev by hardline communists hastened the [end of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_the_Soviet_Union "End of the Soviet Union"), which formally dissolved on 26 December 1991, ending nearly seven decades of Soviet rule.

Geography
---------

With an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the world's largest country,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-39) a status that is retained by the [Russian Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation "Russian Federation").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-40) Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-41) Two other successor states, [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan") and [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine"), rank among the top 10 countries by land area, and the largest country entirely in Europe, respectively. The [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area and was the cultural and economic center. The eastern part in [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia") extended to the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") to the east and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan "Democratic Republic of Afghanistan") to the south, and, except some areas in [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia"), was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone"), and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south. It had five climate zones: [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra "Tundra"), [taiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga "Taiga"), [steppes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe "Steppe"), [desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") and [mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain "Mountain").

The USSR, like [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), had the world's longest [border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border "Border"), measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or 1+1⁄2 circumferences of Earth. Two-thirds of it was a [coastline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast "Coast"). The country bordered [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan "Democratic Republic of Afghanistan"), the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_(1976%E2%80%931989) "History of the People's Republic of China (1976–1989)"), [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic"), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_People%27s_Republic "Hungarian People's Republic"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_Iran "Pahlavi Iran"), [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic "Mongolian People's Republic"), [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway"), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic "Polish People's Republic"), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania "Socialist Republic of Romania"), and [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") from 1945 to 1991. The [Bering Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait "Bering Strait") separated the USSR from the United States, while the [La Pérouse Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_P%C3%A9rouse_Strait "La Pérouse Strait") separated it from Japan.

The country's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now [Ismoil Somoni Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismoil_Somoni_Peak "Ismoil Somoni Peak")) in [Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic"), at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft). The USSR also included most of the world's largest lakes; the [Caspian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea") (shared with [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran")), and [Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal "Lake Baikal"), the world's largest (by volume) and deepest freshwater lake that is also an internal body of water in Russia.

Government and politics
-----------------------

The Soviet [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") system was based on [unified state power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_state_power "Unified state power") and [democratic centralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism "Democratic centralism"). The [highest organ of state authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_organ_of_state_authority "Highest organ of state authority"), the [Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union "Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union"), stood above all other state organs and worked under the leadership of the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"). The executive organ of the state (synonymous with government), the [Council of Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_the_Soviet_Union "Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union"), was an internal organ of the All-Union Supreme Soviet.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Sakwa-42)

### Communist Party

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Moskau_Roter_Platz_September_1964.jpg/250px-Moskau_Roter_Platz_September_1964.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moskau_Roter_Platz_September_1964.jpg)

Military parade on the [Red Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square "Red Square") in Moscow, 7 November 1964

At the top of the Communist Party was the [Central Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), elected at [Party Congresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union") and Conferences. In turn, the Central Committee voted for a [Politburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union") (called the Presidium between 1952 and 1966), [Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union") and the [general secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union") (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the _de facto_ highest office in the Soviet Union.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-43) Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-44) (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-45) They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was [democratic centralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism "Democratic centralism"), demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-46)

The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state mainly through its control over the [system of appointments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura "Nomenklatura"). All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin (1941–1953) and Khrushchev (1958–1964) were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-47) but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of [Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet "Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet"), the nominal [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_the_Soviet_Union "List of heads of state of the Soviet Union"). The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by [primary party organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraikom "Kraikom").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-48)

However, in practice the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the [state bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Bureaucracy "Soviet Bureaucracy"), particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-49) nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although [factions were officially banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_on_factions_in_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Ban on factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-50)

### Highest organ of state authority

[![Image 37](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Supreme_Soviet_1982.jpg/250px-Supreme_Soviet_1982.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supreme_Soviet_1982.jpg)

The [Grand Kremlin Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Kremlin_Palace "Grand Kremlin Palace"), the seat of the [Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union "Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union"), 1982

The Supreme Soviet (successor of the [Congress of Soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Soviets_of_the_Soviet_Union "Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union")) was nominally the [highest organ of state authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_organ_of_state_authority "Highest organ of state authority") for most of the Soviet history,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-51) at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party. However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the [Five-Year Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union "Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union") and the [government budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget "Government budget").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-52) The Supreme Soviet elected a [Presidium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet "Presidium of the Supreme Soviet") (successor of the [Central Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_of_the_Soviet_Union "Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union")) to wield its power between plenary sessions,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Benson,_Shirley-2001-53) ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Soviet_Union "Supreme Court of the Soviet Union"),[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-54) the [Procurator General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurator_General_of_the_Soviet_Union "Procurator General of the Soviet Union")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-55) and the [Council of Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_the_Soviet_Union "Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union") (known before 1946 as the [Council of People's Commissars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_People%27s_Commissars_of_the_Soviet_Union "Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union")), headed by the [Chairman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union "Premier of the Soviet Union") (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Benson,_Shirley-2001-53) State and party structures of the [constituent republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union "Republics of the Soviet Union") largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into [party committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raikom "Raikom"), [local Soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_(council) "Soviet (council)") and [executive committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_committee "Executive committee"). While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-56)

The state security police (the [KGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB") and [its predecessor agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chronology_of_Soviet_secret_police_agencies "Template:Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies")) played an important role in Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the [Red Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror") and [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge"),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-57) but was brought under strict party control after Stalin's death. Under [Yuri Andropov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Andropov "Yuri Andropov"), the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-58) culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-59)

### Unified power and reform

[![Image 38](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/RIAN_archive_699872_Dushanbe_riots%2C_February_1990.jpg/250px-RIAN_archive_699872_Dushanbe_riots%2C_February_1990.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RIAN_archive_699872_Dushanbe_riots,_February_1990.jpg)

Nationalist anti-government [riots in Dushanbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Dushanbe_riots "1990 Dushanbe riots"), [Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic"), 1990

The [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Constitution of the Soviet Union"), which was promulgated in [1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Soviet_Constitution "1924 Soviet Constitution"), [1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Soviet_Constitution "1936 Soviet Constitution") and [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution "1977 Soviet Constitution"), did not limit state power.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-60) No [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") existed in the Soviet Union, as the state system was based on the [unified state power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_power "Unified power") of the [highest organ of state authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_state_organ_of_power "Supreme state organ of power"), that is, the [All-Union Supreme Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union "Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union") which worked under the party's leadership.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-61) The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-62) and Stalin,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-63) as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-64) itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Khrushchev,_Nikita-2007-65) All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except [Georgy Malenkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Malenkov "Georgy Malenkov")[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-66) and Khrushchev, who were both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Khrushchev,_Nikita-2007-65)

Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them. The [Congress of People's Deputies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_People%27s_Deputies_of_the_Soviet_Union "Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union") was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989, the first in Soviet history. The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, and much stronger than before. For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-67) In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the [President of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Soviet_Union "President of the Soviet Union"), concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-68) now renamed the [Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_the_USSR "Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR"), to himself.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-69)

Tensions grew between the Union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin") and controlling the newly elected [Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Russian_SFSR "Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR"), and communist hardliners. On 19–21 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged a [coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt "1991 Soviet coup attempt"). The coup failed, and the [State Council of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_Soviet_Union "State Council of the Soviet Union") became the highest organ of state power 'in the period of transition'.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-70) Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-71)

### Judicial system

The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts ([People's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Soviet_Union) "People's Court (Soviet Union)")) and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the [inquisitorial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitorial_system "Inquisitorial system") of [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law"), where the judge, [procurator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurator_General_of_the_Soviet_Union "Procurator General of the Soviet Union"), and defence attorney collaborate to "establish the truth".[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-72)

### Human rights

[Human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") in the Soviet Union were severely limited. The Soviet Union was a [totalitarian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian_state "Totalitarian state") from [1927 until 1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1927%E2%80%9353) "History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)")[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-73)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-74)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-75)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-76) and a [one-party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party "One-party") state until 1990.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-77)[Freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech") was suppressed and dissent was punished. Independent political activities were not tolerated, whether these involved participation in free [labour unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_union "Labour union"), private [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"), independent churches or opposition [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties "Political parties"). The [freedom of movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement "Freedom of movement") within and especially outside the country was limited. The state restricted rights of citizens to [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property").

According to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") are the "basic [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Rights") and [freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(political) "Freedom (political)") to which all humans are entitled."[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-78) including the right to [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") and [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty "Liberty"), [freedom of expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech"), and [equality before the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law "Equality before the law"); and social, cultural and economic rights, including the right to participate in [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture"), the [right to food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food "Right to food"), the [right to work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_work "Right to work"), and the right to [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education").

The Soviet conception of human rights was very different from [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law "International human rights law"). According to [Soviet legal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Soviet_Union "Law of the Soviet Union"), "it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted _against_ the individual".[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-79) The [Soviet state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_state "Soviet state") was considered as the source of human rights.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_shiman-80) Therefore, the Soviet legal system considered [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") an arm of politics and it also considered courts agencies of the government.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes-81) Extensive [extrajudicial powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment "Extrajudicial punishment") were given to the [Soviet secret police agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Soviet_secret_police_agencies "Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies"). In practice, the Soviet government significantly curbed the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Rule of law"), [civil liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties"), [protection of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice "Criminal justice") and [guarantees of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights "Property rights"),[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes2001-82)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes1994-83) which were considered as examples of "bourgeois morality" by Soviet law theorists such as [Andrey Vyshinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky "Andrey Vyshinsky").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Vyshinsky1949-84)

The USSR and other countries in the [Soviet Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc") had abstained from affirming the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights") (1948), saying that it was "overly juridical" and potentially infringed on national sovereignty.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-85): 167–169  The Soviet Union later signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights") in 1973 (and the 1966 [International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights "International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights")), but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_thomas-hrideas-86): 117  Under [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), the [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty "Death penalty") was extended to adolescents as young as 12 years old in 1935.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-87)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-88)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-89)

[Sergei Kovalev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Kovalev "Sergei Kovalev") recalled "the famous article 125 of the Constitution which enumerated all basic civil and political rights" in the Soviet Union. But when he and other prisoners attempted to use this as a legal basis for their abuse complaints, their prosecutor's argument was that "the Constitution was written not for you, but for American Negroes, so that they know how happy the lives of Soviet citizens are".[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-90)

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, instead, it was determined as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, [a desire to make a profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation "Speculation") could be interpreted as a [counter-revolutionary activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-revolutionary "Counter-revolutionary") punishable by death.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes-81)[The liquidation and deportation of millions of peasants in 1928–31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization "Dekulakization") was carried out within the terms of the Soviet Civil Code.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes-81) Some Soviet legal scholars even said that "criminal repression" may be applied in the absence of guilt.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes-81)[Martin Latsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Latsis "Martin Latsis"), chief of [Soviet Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Ukraine "Soviet Ukraine")'s [secret police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka") explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class") he belongs, what is his background, his [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), his [profession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession "Profession"). These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the [Red Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror")."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_State-91)

The purpose of [public trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_trial "Show trial") was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate [party authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU "CPSU") – but to provide yet another forum for [political agitation and propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_propaganda "Soviet propaganda") for the instruction of the citizenry (see [Moscow Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Trials "Moscow Trials") for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be [party members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU "CPSU"), were required to take their client's guilt for granted..."[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union_Pipes-81)

During his rule, Stalin always made the final policy decisions. Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), or by the party's highest body the [Politburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"). Operations were handled by the separate [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Soviet_Union) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)"). It was known as the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (or Narkomindel), until 1946. The most influential spokesmen were [Georgy Chicherin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Chicherin "Georgy Chicherin"), [Maxim Litvinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov "Maxim Litvinov"), [Vyacheslav Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov "Vyacheslav Molotov"), [Andrey Vyshinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky "Andrey Vyshinsky"), and [Andrei Gromyko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Gromyko "Andrei Gromyko"). Intellectuals were based in the [Moscow State Institute of International Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_Institute_of_International_Relations "Moscow State Institute of International Relations").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-92)

*   Comintern (1919–1943), or [Communist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International "Communist International"), was an international communist organization based in the Kremlin that advocated [world communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_communism "World communism"). The Comintern intended to 'struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state'.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-93) It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-94)
*   [Comecon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comecon "Comecon"), the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): Совет Экономической Взаимопомощи, _Sovet Ekonomicheskoy Vzaimopomoshchi_, СЭВ, _SEV_) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under Soviet control that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with several communist states elsewhere in the world. Moscow was concerned about the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan"), and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Bloc's reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co-Operation (OEEC),[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-95)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-96)
*   The [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact") was a [collective defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_defence "Collective defence") alliance formed in 1955 among the USSR and its [satellite states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_state "Satellite state") in Eastern Europe during the Cold War.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Reinalda-2009-97)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-98) The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon, the regional economic organization for the [socialist states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state_(communism) "Socialist state (communism)") of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany") into [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO").[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrump2015-99)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Reinalda-2009-97) Although nominally a "defensive" alliance, the Pact's primary function was to safeguard the [Soviet Union's hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire "Soviet Empire") over its [Eastern European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Bloc "Soviet Bloc") satellites, with the Pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-100)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Reinalda-2009-97)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrump20151,_17-101)
*   The [Cominform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cominform "Cominform") (1947–1956), informally the Communist Information Bureau and officially the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, was the first official agency of the international Marxist-Leninist movement since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943. Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist-Leninist parties under Soviet direction. Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan"), the U.S. program of rebuilding Europe after the war and developing its economy.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-102) It also coordinated international aid to Marxist-Leninist insurgents during the Greek Civil War in 1947–1949.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-103) It expelled Yugoslavia in 1948 after [Josip Broz Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito "Josip Broz Tito") insisted on an independent program. Its newspaper, _For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!_, promoted Stalin's positions. The Cominform's concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy. By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-104)

#### Early policies (1919–1939)

[![Image 43](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/1987_CPA_5896.jpg/250px-1987_CPA_5896.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1987_CPA_5896.jpg)

1987 Soviet stamp

The Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Soviet Union intensely debated foreign policy issues and changed directions several times. Even after Stalin assumed dictatorial control in the late 1920s, there were debates, and he frequently changed positions.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-105)

During the country's early period, it was assumed that Communist revolutions would break out soon in every major industrial country, and it was the Russian responsibility to assist them. The [Comintern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern "Comintern") was the weapon of choice. A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed (the longest lasting one was in Hungary)—the [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic")—lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919. The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help.

By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon. It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead. Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany. The two came to terms in 1922 with the [Treaty of Rapallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo,_1922 "Treaty of Rapallo, 1922") that settled long-standing grievances. At the same time, the two countries secretly set up training programs for the illegal German army and air force operations at hidden camps in the USSR.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-106)

Moscow eventually stopped threatening other states, and instead worked to open peaceful relationships in terms of trade, and diplomatic recognition. The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") and a few others about a continuing Marxist-Leninist threat, and opened trade relations and _de facto_ diplomatic recognition in 1922. There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war Tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed. Formal recognition came when the new [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK) "Labour Party (UK)") came to power in 1924.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-107) All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations. [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford "Henry Ford") opened large-scale business relations with the Soviets in the late 1920s, hoping that it would lead to long-term peace. Finally, in 1933, the United States officially recognized the USSR, a decision backed by the public opinion and especially by US business interests that expected an opening of a new profitable market.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-108)

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Stalin ordered Marxist-Leninist parties across the world to strongly oppose non-Marxist political parties, labour unions or other organizations on the left, which they labelled [social fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fascists "Social fascists"). In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, the epithet _[fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist\_(insult) "Fascist (insult)")_ was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any [anti-Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Soviet "Anti-Soviet") or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-109) Stalin reversed himself in 1934 with the [Popular Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front "Popular Front") program that called on all Marxist parties to join with all [anti-Fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Fascist "Anti-Fascist") political, labour, and organizational forces that were opposed to [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), especially of the [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi "Nazi") variety.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-110)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-111)

The rapid growth of power in Nazi Germany encouraged both Paris and Moscow to form a military alliance, and the [Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance "Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance") was signed in May 1935. A firm believer in collective security, Stalin's foreign minister [Maxim Litvinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov "Maxim Litvinov") worked very hard to form a closer relationship with France and Britain.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-112)

In 1939, half a year after the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement "Munich Agreement"), the USSR attempted to form an anti-Nazi alliance with France and Britain.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-113)[Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") proposed a better deal, which would give the USSR control over much of Eastern Europe through the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact"). In September, Germany invaded Poland, and the USSR also invaded later that month, resulting in the partition of Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-114)

#### World War II (1939–1945)

Up until his death in 1953, [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") controlled all foreign relations of the Soviet Union during the [interwar period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interwar_period "Interwar period"). Despite the increasing build-up of [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")'s war machine and the outbreak of the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War"), the Soviet Union did not cooperate with any other nation, choosing to follow its own path.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-115) However, after [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa "Operation Barbarossa"), the Soviet Union's priorities changed. Despite previous conflict with the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [Vyacheslav Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov "Vyacheslav Molotov") dropped his post war border demands.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-116)

#### Cold War (1945–1991)

The [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") was a period of [geopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitical "Geopolitical") tension between the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the [Western Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc "Western Bloc") and the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc"), which began following [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") in 1945. The term _[cold war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold\_war\_(general\_term) "Cold war (general term)")_ is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two [superpowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpowers "Superpowers"), but they each supported major regional conflicts known as [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war"). The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary [alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") and [victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany "Allied-occupied Germany") against [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") in 1945. Aside from the [nuclear arsenal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race "Nuclear arms race") and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as [psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare "Psychological warfare"), propaganda campaigns, [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_espionage "Cold War espionage"), far-reaching [embargoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions "Economic sanctions"), rivalry at [sports events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_sports "Politics and sports") and technological competitions such as the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race").

Structure of the Union of SS Republics (1925)

Constitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic") or [Byelorussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byelorussian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic") (SSRs), or federations, such as [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") or [Transcaucasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasian_Socialist_Federative_Soviet_Republic "Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic") (SFSRs),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Sakwa-42) all four being the founding republics who signed the [Treaty on the Creation of the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Creation_of_the_USSR "Treaty on the Creation of the USSR") in December 1922. In 1924, during the [national delimitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_delimitation_in_the_Soviet_Union "National delimitation in the Soviet Union") in Central Asia, [Uzbekistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic") and [Turkmenistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic") were formed from parts of Russia's [Turkestan ASSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkestan_ASSR "Turkestan ASSR") and two Soviet dependencies, the [Khorezm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorezm_People%27s_Soviet_Republic "Khorezm People's Soviet Republic") and [Bukharan PSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukharan_People%27s_Soviet_Republic "Bukharan People's Soviet Republic"). In 1929, [Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic") was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic") and [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic") being elevated to Union Republics, while [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic") and [Kirghizia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirghiz_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic") were split off from the Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-117) In August 1940, [Moldavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic") was formed from parts of Ukraine and [Soviet-occupied Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_northern_Bukovina "Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina"), and Ukrainian SSR. [Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic"), [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic") and [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic") were also [annexed by the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_(1940) "Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)") and turned into SSRs, which was [not recognized by most of the international community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_continuity_of_the_Baltic_states "State continuity of the Baltic states") and was considered an [illegal occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states "Occupation of the Baltic states"). After the [Soviet invasion of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Finland "Soviet invasion of Finland"), the [Karelo-Finnish SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelo-Finnish_SSR "Karelo-Finnish SSR") was formed on annexed territory as a Union Republic in March 1940 and then incorporated into Russia as the [Karelian ASSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_ASSR "Karelian ASSR") in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-118)

A medium-range [SS-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSD-10 "RSD-10") non-[ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICBM "ICBM") ballistic missile, the deployment of which by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s launched a new [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race "Arms race") in Europe when NATO responded by deploying [Pershing II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pershing_II "Pershing II") missiles in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany"), among other things

Under the Military Law of September 1925, the [Soviet Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Armed_Forces "Soviet Armed Forces") consisted of the [Land Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Army "Soviet Army"), the [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Forces "Soviet Air Forces"), the [Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Navy "Soviet Navy"), [Joint State Political Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_State_Political_Directorate "Joint State Political Directorate") (OGPU) and the [Internal Troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Troops "Internal Troops").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-119) The OGPU later became independent and in 1934 joined the [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD "NKVD") secret police, and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats. After World War II, [Strategic Missile Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Missile_Forces "Strategic Missile Forces") (1959), [Air Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Defence_Forces "Soviet Air Defence Forces") (1948) and National Civil Defense Forces (1970) were formed, which ranked first, third, and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance (ground forces were second, Air Force fourth, and Navy fifth).

The army had the greatest political influence. In 1989, there served two million soldiers divided between 150 motorized and 52 armored divisions. Until the early 1960s, the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch, but after the [Caribbean crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_crisis "Caribbean crisis"), under the leadership of [Sergei Gorshkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Gorshkov "Sergei Gorshkov"), it expanded significantly. It became known for [battlecruisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlecruiser "Battlecruiser") and submarines. In 1989, there served 500 000 men. The [Soviet Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Air_Force "Soviet Air Force") focused on a fleet of [strategic bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bomber "Strategic bomber") and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity. The air force also had a number of [fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft "Fighter aircraft") and tactical bombers to support the army in the war. Strategic missile forces had more than 1,400 [intercontinental ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile") (ICBMs), deployed between 28 bases and 300 command centers.

In the post-war period, the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-GDP-21)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-120)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-121) These included the suppression of the [uprising in East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_uprising_of_1953 "East German uprising of 1953") (1953), [Hungarian revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 "Hungarian Revolution of 1956") (1956) and the [invasion of Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Czechoslovakia "Invasion of Czechoslovakia") (1968). The Soviet Union also participated in the [war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War "Soviet–Afghan War").

In the Soviet Union, general [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") applied, meaning all able-bodied males aged 18 and older were drafted in the armed forces.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-122)

The Soviet Union adopted a [command economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_economy "Command economy"), whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. For the overwhelming majority of its existence, the USSR did not use GDP or GNP to measure its economy, instead relying on the [Material Product System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Product_System "Material Product System"). The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of [war communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism "War communism"), which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive or forced requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"). The [barrier troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_troops "Barrier troops") were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-123) After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism") by the [New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy "New Economic Policy") (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses. The economy steadily recovered as a result.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124)

After a long debate among the members of the Politburo about the course of economic development, by 1928–1929, upon gaining control of the country, Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting [forced collectivization of agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Collectivization in the Soviet Union") and enacting draconian labour legislation. Resources were mobilized for [rapid industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1927%E2%80%9353)#Industrialization_in_practice "History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)"), which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124) The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-125) As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-126) The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-127)

By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively [self-sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky "Autarky"); for most of the period until the creation of [Comecon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comecon "Comecon"), only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-2-128) After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly. However, the influence of the [world economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy "World economy") on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on [foreign trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_trade_of_the_Soviet_Union "Foreign trade of the Soviet Union").[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-129) Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-2-128) During the [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race "Arms race") of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World "Third World"). A portion of Soviet resources during the Cold War were [allocated in aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_within_the_Comecon "International relations within the Comecon") to the Soviet-aligned states.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-2-128) The Soviet Union's [military budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget "Military budget") in the 1970s was gigantic, forming 40–60% of the entire federal budget and accounting to 15% of the USSR's GDP (13% in the 1980s).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-130)

From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by [central planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning "Economic planning"), carried out by [Gosplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan "Gosplan") and organized in [five-year plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union "Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union"). However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to _ad hoc_ intervention by superiors. All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in [rubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_ruble "Soviet ruble") rather than in physical goods. [Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit "Credit") was discouraged, but widespread. The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice they were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (e.g. between producer factories) were widespread.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124)

A number of basic [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) "Service (economics)") were state-funded, such as [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Soviet_Union "Education in the Soviet Union") and health care. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over [consumer goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_goods_in_the_Soviet_Union "Consumer goods in the Soviet Union").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-131) Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety. Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Hanson-132) A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the [reform of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_Soviet_economic_reform "1965 Soviet economic reform").[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124)

Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely,[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-133)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-134) by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-135) However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, [steadily declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation "Era of Stagnation") much more quickly and consistently than in other countries, despite a rapid increase in the capital [stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock "Stock") (the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan).[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124)

Overall, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1989 was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischerEasterly19944-136) A 1986 study published in the _[American Journal of Public Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Journal\_of\_Public\_Health "American Journal of Public Health")_ claimed that, citing [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") data, the Soviet model provided a better [quality of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life "Quality of life") and [human development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(economics) "Human development (economics)") than market economies at the same level of economic development in most cases.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-137) According to [Stanley Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Fischer "Stanley Fischer") and [William Easterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Easterly "William Easterly"), growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income in 1989 should have been twice higher than it was, considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischerEasterly19945-138) Steven Rosefielde states that the [standard of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living "Standard of living") declined due to Stalin's despotism. While there was a brief improvement after his death, it lapsed into stagnation.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-139)

In 1987, [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") attempted to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of _[perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika")_. His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives, resulting in a sharp decline in output. The economy, already suffering from [reduced petroleum export revenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_oil_glut "1980s oil glut"), started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and the property was still largely state-owned until after the country's dissolution.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Gregory-2004-124)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Hanson-132) For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP ([PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity "Purchasing power parity")) was [the second-largest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_(PPP) "List of regions by past GDP (PPP)"), and third during the second half of the 1980s,[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-140) although on a [per-capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita "List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita") basis, it was behind that of [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World "First World") countries.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-141) Compared to countries with similar per-capita GDP in 1928, the Soviet Union experienced significant growth.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-142)

In 1990, the country had a [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index") of 0.920, placing it in the 'high' category of human development. It was the third-highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic") and [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), and the 25th in the world of 130 countries.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-143)

The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s,[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983105%E2%80%93108-144) both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. The decline was very rapid between 1965 and 1970, then slowed between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 to 1980, the decline continued at an even slower rate, with fuel requirements per ruble of gross social product decreasing by only 2.6%.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983295-145) David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40% of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983297-146) According to Wilson, the Soviet Union was, in theory, well-positioned to avoid an energy crisis and could have sustained economic growth rates of 2–2.5% during the 1990s, supported by its energy resources.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983297%E2%80%93299-147) However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World "First World").[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983299-148)

In 1991, the Soviet Union had a [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline "Pipeline") network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for [crude oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil "Crude oil") and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Central_Intelligence_Agency-1991-149) Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-150) In the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn [hard currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency "Hard currency").[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-2-128) At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second-largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia").[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-151)

The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on [science and technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_Soviet_Union "Science and technology in the Soviet Union").[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-152)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-153) Lenin believed the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks and research and development organizations. In the early 1960s, 40% of chemistry PhDs in the Soviet Union were attained by women, compared with only 5% in the United States.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-154) By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding, space technology, and military technologies. However, due to rigid state planning and [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura "Nomenklatura"), the Soviets remained far behind the [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World "First World") in chemistry, biology, and computer science. Under Stalin, the Soviet government persecuted [geneticists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneticists "Geneticists") in favour of [Lysenkoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism "Lysenkoism"), a [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience "Pseudoscience") rejected by the scientific community in the Soviet Union and abroad but supported by Stalin's inner circles. Implemented in the USSR and China, it resulted in reduced crop yields and is widely believed to have contributed to the [Great Chinese Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine "Great Chinese Famine").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-155) In the 1980s, the Soviet Union had more [scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientists "Scientists") and [engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers "Engineers") relative to the world's population than any other major country, owing to strong levels of state support.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-156) Some of its most remarkable technological achievements, such as launching the [world's first space satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), were achieved through military research.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies-131)

Under the [Reagan administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_administration "Reagan administration"), [Project Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Socrates "Project Socrates") determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner radically different to the United States. The US prioritized indigenous [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development "Research and development") in both the public and private sectors. In contrast, the USSR placed greater emphasis on acquiring foreign technology, which it did through both [covert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_espionage "Industrial espionage") and overt means. However, centralized state planning kept Soviet technological development greatly inflexible. This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-157)[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-158)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-159)

At the end of the 1950s, the USSR constructed the first [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite")—[Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), which marked the beginning of the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race")—a competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability with the United States.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-160) This was followed by other successful satellites, most notably [Sputnik 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_5 "Sputnik 5"), where test dogs were sent to space. On 12 April 1961, the USSR launched [Vostok 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1 "Vostok 1"), which carried [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin"), making him the first human to ever be launched into space and complete a space journey.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-161) The first plans for [space shuttles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane "Spaceplane") and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices, but personal disputes between designers and management prevented their development.

In terms of the [Luna program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_program "Luna program"), the USSR only had automated spacecraft launches with no crewed spacecraft, passing on the 'Moon' part of [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race"), which was [won by the Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11"). The Soviet public's reaction to the American moon-landing was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about it, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it attention, and another portion was angered.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-162)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-163)

In the 1970s, specific proposals for the design of a space shuttle emerged, but shortcomings, especially in the electronics industry (rapid overheating of electronics), postponed it till the end of the 1980s. The first shuttle, the [Buran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft) "Buran (spacecraft)"), flew in 1988, but without a human crew. Another, _[Ptichka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptichka "Ptichka")_, endured prolonged construction and was canceled in 1991. For their launch into space, there is today an unused superpower rocket, [Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket) "Energia (rocket)"), which is the most powerful in the world.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-164)

In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union built the _[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir")_ orbital station. It was built on the construction of [_Salyut_ stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_programme "Salyut programme") and its only role was civilian-grade research tasks.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Harland-2020-165)[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-166) Mir was the only orbital station in operation from 1986 to 1998. Gradually, other modules were added to it, including American modules. However, the station deteriorated rapidly after a fire on board and was deorbited in 2001, burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Harland-2020-165)

### Transport

Nuclear Icebreaker _[Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin\_(1957\_icebreaker) "Lenin (1957 icebreaker)")_

Transport was a vital component of the country's economy. The [economic centralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_five-year_plan_(Soviet_Union) "First five-year plan (Soviet Union)") of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of [Aeroflot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroflot "Aeroflot"), an aviation enterprise.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-167) The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Central_Intelligence_Agency-1991-149) However, due to inadequate maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983205-168)

Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world;[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983205-168) it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1983201-169) By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burdens from the railways and to improve the Soviet [government budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget "Government budget").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985166%E2%80%93167-170) The [street network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_network "Street network") and [automotive industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_Soviet_Union "Automotive industry in the Soviet Union")[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985168-171) remained underdeveloped,[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985165-172) and [dirt roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_road "Dirt road") were common outside major cities.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985167-173) Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985167-173) Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmblerShawSymons1985169-174) The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-175)

Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-176)

The Soviet [merchant navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_navy "Merchant navy") was one of the largest in the world.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Central_Intelligence_Agency-1991-149)

Demographics
------------

[![Image 73](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Population_of_former_USSR.PNG/330px-Population_of_former_USSR.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_of_former_USSR.PNG)

Population of the Soviet Union (red) and the [post-Soviet states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states") (blue) from 1961 to 2009 as well as projection (dotted blue) from 2010 to 2100

Excess deaths throughout [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War") (including the [famine of 1921–1922](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%931922 "Russian famine of 1921–1922") that was triggered by Lenin's [war communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism "War communism") policies)[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-177) amounted to a combined total of 18 million,[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-178) some 10 million in the 1930s,[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-179) and more than 20 million in 1941–1945. The postwar [Soviet population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_the_Soviet_Union "Population of the Soviet Union") was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-180) According to [Catherine Merridale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Merridale "Catherine Merridale"), '...reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million.'[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-181)

The [birth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate "Birth rate") of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mainly due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The [mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate "Mortality rate") demonstrated a gradual decrease as well—from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post–World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-182) Soviet Europe moved towards [sub-replacement fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility "Sub-replacement fertility"), while [Soviet Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Central_Asia "Soviet Central Asia") continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-183)

The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-184) An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-185) The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-186) The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the [Soviet government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_government "Soviet government") stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed, and researchers could delve into the real causes.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-187)

Largest cities of the USSR according to the 1989 census

The Soviet Union imposed heavy controls on city growth, preventing some cities from reaching their full potential while promoting others.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-188)[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Stronski-2010-189)

For the entirety of the Soviet Union's existence, the most populous cities were [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") and [Leningrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad "Leningrad") (both in [Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_SFSR "Russian SFSR")), with the third far place taken by [Kiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev "Kiev") ([Ukrainian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_SSR "Ukrainian SSR")). At the USSR's inception, the fourth and fifth most populous cities were [Kharkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkov "Kharkov") (Ukrainian SSR) and [Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku "Baku") ([Azerbaijan SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_SSR "Azerbaijan SSR")), but, by the end of the century, [Tashkent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent "Tashkent") ([Uzbek SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_SSR "Uzbek SSR")), which had assumed the position of capital of Soviet Central Asia, had risen to fourth place. [Minsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk "Minsk") ([Byelorussian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byelorussian_SSR "Byelorussian SSR")) saw rapid growth during the 20th century, rising from the 32nd most populous in the union to the 7th.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Stronski-2010-189)[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-190)[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-191)

### Women and fertility

[![Image 75](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/RIAN_archive_16735_Cosmonaut_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg/250px-RIAN_archive_16735_Cosmonaut_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RIAN_archive_16735_Cosmonaut_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg)

[Valentina Tereshkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova "Valentina Tereshkova"), the first woman in space, visiting the [Lvov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lvov "Lvov") confectionery, Ukrainian SSR, 1967

Under Lenin, the state made explicit commitments to promote the equality of men and women. Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies. Beginning in October 1918, Lenin's government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality (re-criminalized in 1932), permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-192) However, without [birth control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control "Birth control"), the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-193) The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy. Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country's military power. By 1936, Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws, ushering in a [pronatalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalism "Natalism") era that lasted for decades.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-194)

By 1917, Russia became the first [great power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power") to grant women the right to vote.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-195) After heavy casualties in World Wars I and II, women outnumbered men in Russia by a 4:3 ratio;[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-196) this contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time.

### LGBT rights

The Soviet Union repressed [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality"). Even during the period when homosexuality was officially legal after the abolition of the Tsarist penal code criminalising it, Soviet courts attempted to repress non-traditional forms of sexuality, which were widely viewed by Russian revolutionaries as a form of capitalist decadence despite more liberal views on homosexuality from Soviet academic sexologists. After Stalin's consolidation of power, homosexuality became officially recriminalised in 1934.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-LauraEngelstein1995-197) The increased homophobia during this time interval was driven by the economic demands of the First Five-Year Plan, as well as the NKVD's view of homosexuals as "socially harmful elements", although even during this heightened period of repression, a clandestine homosexual subculture was able to persist.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-198) Homosexuality remained a criminal offence throughout the remainder of the Soviet Union's existence.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-LauraEngelstein1995-197)

### Education

[Anatoly Lunacharsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Lunacharsky "Anatoly Lunacharsky") became the first [People's Commissar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Commissar "People's Commissar") for Education of Soviet Russia. In the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the [elimination of illiteracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likbez "Likbez"). All left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-199)[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-200)[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-201)[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-202) Literate people were automatically hired as teachers. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated. Throughout the 1930s, [social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility "Social mobility") rose sharply, which has been attributed to reforms in education.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-203) In the aftermath of World War II, the country's educational system expanded dramatically, which had a tremendous effect. In the 1960s, nearly all children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas. [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev") tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also became important in giving rise to the [New Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soviet_man "New Soviet man").[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-204) Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free [vocational training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational-technical_school "Vocational-technical school").

The [education system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Soviet_Union "Education in the Soviet Union") was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with [affirmative action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action "Affirmative action") for applicants from nations associated with [cultural backwardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_backwardness "Cultural backwardness"). However, as part of a general [antisemitic policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Soviet_Union "Antisemitism in the Soviet Union"), an unofficial [Jewish quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_quota "Jewish quota") was applied[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-205)[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-206)[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-207)[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-208) The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local [Komsomol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komsomol "Komsomol") party secretary.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-209) According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-210)

### Nationalities and ethnic groups

The Soviet Union was an ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups. The total population of the country was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990 estimate, the majority of the population were [Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians "Russians") (50.78%), followed by [Ukrainians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians "Ukrainians") (15.45%) and [Uzbeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks") (5.84%).[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-211) Overall, in 1989 the ethnic demography of the country showed that 69.8% was [East Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs"), 17.5% was [Turkic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples "Turkic peoples"), 1.6% were [Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians "Armenians"), 1.6% were [Balts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balts "Balts"), 1.5% were [Uralic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_peoples "Uralic peoples"), 1.5% were [Tajik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajiks "Tajiks"), 1.4% were [Georgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgians "Georgians"), 1.2% were [Moldovan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldovans "Moldovans") and 4.1% were of other various ethnic groups.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-212)

All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie19812-213) If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the [Mingrelians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingrelians "Mingrelians") of [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic"), who were classified with the linguistically related [Georgians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgians "Georgians").[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-214) Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, [Belarusians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusians "Belarusians"), and Ukrainians, who were all East Slavic and Orthodox, shared close cultural, ethnic, and religious ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, [ethnic antagonisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflicts_in_the_Soviet_Union "Ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union") developed over the years.[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-215)[_[neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral\_point\_of\_view "Wikipedia:Neutral point of view") is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Soviet\_Union "Talk:Soviet Union")_]

Members of various ethnicities participated in legislative bodies. Organs of power like the Politburo, the Secretariat of the Central Committee etc., were formally ethnically neutral, but in reality, ethnic Russians were overrepresented, although there were also non-Russian leaders in the [Soviet leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_leaders_of_the_Soviet_Union "List of leaders of the Soviet Union"), such as [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), [Grigory Zinoviev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev "Grigory Zinoviev"), [Nikolai Podgorny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Podgorny "Nikolai Podgorny") or [Andrei Gromyko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Gromyko "Andrei Gromyko"). During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there. According to the last census in 1989, the Russian 'diaspora' in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-216)

### Health

[![Image 87](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/RussianAbortionPoster.jpg/250px-RussianAbortionPoster.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RussianAbortionPoster.jpg)

In 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries. As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-217) The Soviet health care system was conceived by the [People's Commissariat for Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Commissariat_for_Health "People's Commissariat for Health") in 1918. Under the [Semashko model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semashko_model "Semashko model"), health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time. Article 42 of the [1977 Soviet Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution "1977 Soviet Constitution") gave all citizens the [right to health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health "Right to health") protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before [Leonid Brezhnev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev "Leonid Brezhnev") became general secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev")'s tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-218)[Minister of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Soviet_Union) "Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)")[Yevgeniy Chazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeniy_Chazov "Yevgeniy Chazov"), during the [19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of [rubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_ruble "Soviet ruble") were squandered.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-219)

After the revolution, life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the [socialist system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production "Socialist mode of production") was superior to the [capitalist system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_system "Capitalist system"). These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of [alcohol abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_in_Russia "Alcohol consumption in Russia"). At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-220)

#### Dentistry

Soviet dental technology and dental health were considered notoriously bad. In 1991, the average 35-year-old had 12 to 14 cavities, fillings or missing teeth. Toothpaste was often not available, and toothbrushes did not conform to standards of modern dentistry.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-221)[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-222)

### Language

Under Lenin, the government gave small language groups their own writing systems.[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie19813%E2%80%934-223) The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same [multilingual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingual "Multilingual") situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed [dialectally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect "Dialect") greatly from each other.[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie19814-224) When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain 'official language' status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore, their speakers were forced to have a [second language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language "Second language").[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie198125-225) There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie198126-226) During World War II, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComrie198127-227)

As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union's many languages, Russian _de facto_ functioned as an official language, as the 'language of interethnic communication' (Russian: язык межнационального общения), but only assumed the _[de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_jure "De jure")_ status as the official national language in 1990.[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-228)

### Religion

[Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") and [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") had the highest number of adherents among the religious citizens.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Eaton,_Katherine_Bliss-2004-229)[Eastern Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Christianity "Eastern Christianity") predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional [Russian Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church") being the largest [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination "Christian denomination"). About 90% of the Soviet Union's Muslims were [Sunnis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni "Sunni"), with [Shias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shias "Shias") being concentrated in the [Azerbaijan SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_SSR "Azerbaijan SSR").[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Eaton,_Katherine_Bliss-2004-229) Smaller groups included [Roman Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics "Roman Catholics"), Jews, [Buddhists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhists "Buddhists"), and a variety of [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") denominations (especially [Baptists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists "Baptists") and [Lutherans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutherans "Lutherans")).[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Eaton,_Katherine_Bliss-2004-229)

Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-230) The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former [ruling classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_class "Ruling class").[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Simon_1974-231)

In Soviet law, the 'freedom to hold religious services' was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") spirit of [scientific materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_materialism "Scientific materialism").[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Simon_1974-231) In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact used a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Simon_1974-231)

The 1918 [Council of People's Commissars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_People%27s_Commissars "Council of People's Commissars") decree establishing the Russian SFSR as a secular state also decreed that 'the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately.'[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-232) Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929 included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized [Bible study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_study_(Christian) "Bible study (Christian)").[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Simon_1974-231) Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, as many as 90% of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed; the majority of them were demolished or re-purposed for state needs with little concern for their historic and cultural value.[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-233)

More than 85,000 Orthodox priests were shot in 1937 alone.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-234) Only a twelfth of the Russian Orthodox Church's priests were left functioning in their parishes by 1941.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-235) In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in Russia fell from 29,584 to less than 500 (1.7%).[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-236)

The Soviet Union was officially a [secular state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state "Secular state"),[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-237)[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-238) but a 'government-sponsored program of forced conversion to [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist-Leninist_atheism "Marxist-Leninist atheism")' was conducted under the doctrine of [state atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism "State atheism").[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-239)[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-240)[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-241) The government targeted religions based on state interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-242) In 1925, the government founded the [League of Militant Atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Militant_Atheists "League of Militant Atheists") to intensify the propaganda campaign.[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-243) Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious. While persecution accelerated following Stalin's rise to power, a revival of Orthodoxy was fostered by the government during World War II and the Soviet authorities sought to control the Russian Orthodox Church rather than liquidate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941, only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence before World War I.

Convinced that religious [anti-Sovietism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Sovietism "Anti-Sovietism") had become a thing of the past, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin administration began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s.[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Janz_1998-244) Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II. Amid other accommodations to religious faith after the German invasion, churches were reopened. [Radio Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Moscow "Radio Moscow") began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader [Patriarch Sergius of Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Sergius_of_Moscow "Patriarch Sergius of Moscow") was held in 1943. Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the USSR even through the late 1980s.[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Janz_1998-244) The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-245)

Under [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev"), the state leadership clashed with the churches in 1958–1964, a period when [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism") was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views.[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Janz_1998-244) During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Victor_Swoboda-1990-246) The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Victor_Swoboda-1990-246)

Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the [Brezhnev era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhnev_era "Brezhnev era").[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-247) Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch [Alexy I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexy_I "Alexy I") with the [Order of the Red Banner of Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Red_Banner_of_Labour "Order of the Red Banner of Labour").[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-248) A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20% of the Soviet population as 'active religious believers.'[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-249)

Culture

The 'Enthusiast's March', a 1930s song famous in the Soviet Union

[![Image 93](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Vladimir_Vysotsky.jpg/250px-Vladimir_Vysotsky.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Vysotsky.jpg)

Soviet singer-songwriter, poet and actor [Vladimir Vysotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vysotsky "Vladimir Vysotsky") in 1979

The culture of the Soviet Union evolved through several stages during its existence. During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as [Nikolay Gumilyov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Gumilyov "Nikolay Gumilyov") who was shot for alleged conspiracy against the Bolsheviks, and [Yevgeny Zamyatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin "Yevgeny Zamyatin").[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-250)

The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers [Maxim Gorky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky "Maxim Gorky") and [Vladimir Mayakovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Mayakovsky "Vladimir Mayakovsky") were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein "Sergei Eisenstein")'s best work dates from this period.

During Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of [socialist realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism "Socialist realism"), with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as [Mikhail Bulgakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov "Mikhail Bulgakov")'s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-251)

Following the [Khrushchev Thaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khrushchev_Thaw "Khrushchev Thaw"), censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The government loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author [Yury Trifonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Trifonov "Yury Trifonov") concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as _[samizdat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat "Samizdat")_, developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch. In music, in response to the increasing popularity of forms of popular music like [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") in the West, many jazz orchestras were permitted throughout the USSR, notably the Melodiya Ensemble, named after the principle record label in the USSR.

In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of _[perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika")_ and _[glasnost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost")_ significantly expanded [freedom of expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression "Freedom of expression") throughout the country in the media and the press.[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-252)

[Valeri Kharlamov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Kharlamov "Valeri Kharlamov") represented the Soviet Union at 11 [Ice Hockey World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships "Ice Hockey World Championships"), winning eight gold medals, two silvers and one bronze.

In summer of 1923 in Moscow was established the [Proletarian Sports Society "Dynamo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_Sports_Club "Dynamo Sports Club") as a sports organization of Soviet secret police [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka").

On 13 July 1925 the [Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Russian_Communist_Party_(Bolsheviks) "Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") adopted a statement "About the party's tasks in sphere of physical culture". In the statement was determined the role of physical culture in Soviet society and the party's tasks in political leadership of physical culture movement in the country.

The [Soviet Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Olympic_Committee "Soviet Olympic Committee") formed on 21 April 1951, and the [IOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC "IOC") recognized the new body in its [45th session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_meetings "List of IOC meetings"). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the [Olympic Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Movement "Olympic Movement"). The [1952 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Summer_Olympics "1952 Summer Olympics") in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. The Soviet Union was the biggest rival to the United States at the Summer Olympics, winning [six of its nine appearances at the games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics#Medals_by_Summer_Games "Soviet Union at the Olympics") and also topping the medal tally at the Winter Olympics six times. The Soviet Union's Olympics success has been attributed to its large investment in sports to demonstrate its superpower image and political influence on a global stage.[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Benson-253)

The [Soviet Union national ice hockey team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_national_ice_hockey_team "Soviet Union national ice hockey team") won nearly every [world championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships "Ice Hockey World Championships") and [Olympic tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_Olympic_Games "Ice hockey at the Olympic Games") between 1954 and 1991 and never failed to medal in any [International Ice Hockey Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ice_Hockey_Federation "International Ice Hockey Federation") (IIHF) tournament in which they competed.

The Soviet Olympic team was notorious for skirting the edge of amateur rules. All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-254)[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-255) Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the [1984 Winter games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics "1984 Winter Olympics"), after another Eastern bloc nation, the [GDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDR "GDR"). Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the [fall of the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_USSR "Fall of the USSR").[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Benson-253)[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-256)

According to British journalist [Andrew Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jennings "Andrew Jennings"), a [KGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB") colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [International Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") (IOC) to undermine [doping tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_test "Doping test") and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-257)[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-258) Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the [1984 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics "1984 Summer Olympics") in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-259)

Landscape near [Karabash, Chelyabinsk Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karabash,_Chelyabinsk_Oblast "Karabash, Chelyabinsk Oblast"), an area that was previously covered with forests until acid rainfall from a nearby copper smelter killed all vegetation

One of the many impacts of the approach to the environment in the USSR and post-Soviet states is the [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea "Aral Sea"). (See status in 1989 and 2014)[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-260)

Neighbouring countries were aware of the high levels of pollution in the Soviet Union[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-261)[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-262) but after the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") it was discovered that its environmental problems were greater than what the Soviet authorities admitted.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-263) The Soviet Union was the world's second largest producer of harmful emissions. In 1988, total emissions in the Soviet Union were about 79% of those in the United States. But since the Soviet [GNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNP "GNP") was only 54% of that of the United States, this means that the Soviet Union generated 1.5 times more pollution than the United States per unit of GNP.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-264)

The [Chernobyl disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster "Chernobyl disaster") in the Ukrainian SSR in 1986 was the first major accident at a civilian [nuclear power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant "Nuclear power plant").[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-265)[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-266)[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-267) Unparalleled in the world, it resulted in a large number of radioactive isotopes being released into the atmosphere. Radioactive doses were scattered relatively far.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-268) Although long-term effects of the accident were unknown, 4,000 new cases of thyroid cancer which resulted from the accident's contamination were reported at the time of the accident, but this led to a relatively low number of deaths (WHO data, 2005).[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-269) Another major radioactive accident was the [Kyshtym disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster "Kyshtym disaster").[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-270)

The [Kola Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula "Kola Peninsula") was one of the places with major problems.[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-271) Around the industrial cities of [Monchegorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monchegorsk "Monchegorsk") and [Norilsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk "Norilsk"), where [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel"), for example, is mined, all forests have been destroyed by contamination, while the northern and other parts of Russia have been affected by emissions.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-272) During the 1990s, people in the West were also interested in the radioactive hazards of nuclear facilities, decommissioned [nuclear submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_submarine "Nuclear submarine"), and the processing of [nuclear waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_waste "Nuclear waste") or [spent nuclear fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel "Spent nuclear fuel").[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-273)[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-274) It was also known in the early 1990s that the USSR had transported radioactive material to the [Barents Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barents_Sea "Barents Sea") and [Kara Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Sea "Kara Sea"), which was later confirmed by the Russian parliament. The crash of the [K-141 Kursk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-141_Kursk "K-141 Kursk") submarine in 2000 in the west further raised concerns.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-275) In the past, there were accidents involving submarines [K-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-19 "Soviet submarine K-19"), [K-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-8 "Soviet submarine K-8"), a [K-129](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-129 "K-129"), [K-27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-27 "Soviet submarine K-27"), [K-219](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-219 "Soviet submarine K-219") and [K-278 Komsomolets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-278_Komsomolets "K-278 Komsomolets").[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-276)[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-277)[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-278)[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-279)

Legacy
------

The legacy of the USSR remains a controversial topic. The socio-economic nature of [communist states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") such as the USSR, especially under Stalin, has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [bureaucratic collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism "Bureaucratic collectivism"), [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism "State capitalism"), [state socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism "State socialism"), or a totally unique [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production").[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-280) The USSR implemented a broad range of policies over a long period of time, with a large amount of conflicting policies being implemented by different leaders. Some have a positive view of it whilst others are critical towards the country, calling it a repressive [oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy").[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-281) The opinions on the USSR are complex and have changed over time, with different generations having different views on the matter as well as on Soviet policies corresponding to separate time periods during its history.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-282)

Western academicians published various analyses of the post-Soviet states' development, claiming that the dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in these countries,[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-283)[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-284) including a rapid increase in poverty,[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Scheidel-2017-285)[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-286)[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-287)[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-288) crime,[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-289) corruption,[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-290)[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-291) unemployment,[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-292)[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-293) homelessness,[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-294)[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-295) rates of disease,[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-296)[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-297)[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-298) infant mortality and domestic violence,[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-299) as well as demographic losses,[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-300) income inequality and the rise of an [oligarchical class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs "Russian oligarchs"),[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-301)[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Scheidel-2017-285) along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income.[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-302) Between 1988–1989 and 1993–1995, the [Gini ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_ratio "Gini ratio") (a measure of inequality) increased by an average of 9 percentage points for all former Soviet republics.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Scheidel-2017-285) According to Western analysis, the economic shocks that accompanied wholesale [privatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization "Privatization") were associated with sharp increases in mortality,[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-303) Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994,[[279]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-304)[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-305) and in the following decades, only five or six of the post-communist states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist West while most are falling behind, some to such an extent that it will take over fifty years to catch up to where they were before the fall of the Soviet Bloc.[[281]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-306)[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-307) As of 2011, the experience of the former Soviet republics was mixed, with some having recovered in terms of [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") and others not.[[283]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-308) There are large wealth disparities, and many post-soviet economies are described as oligarchic.[[284]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-309)

Since the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"), annual polling by the [Levada Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levada_Center "Levada Center") has shown that over 50% of Russia's population regretted this event, with the only exception to this being in 2012 when support for the Soviet Union dipped below 50 percent.[[285]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0-2018-310) A 2018 poll showed that 66% of [Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians "Russians") regretted the fall of the Soviet Union, setting a 15-year record, and the majority of these regretting opinions came from people older than 55.[[285]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0-2018-310)[[286]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-311) In 2020, polls conducted by the Levada Center found that 75% of Russians agreed that the Soviet era was the greatest era in their country's history.[[287]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-312)

According to the New Russia Barometer (NRB) polls by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy, 50% of Russian respondents reported a positive impression of the Soviet Union in 1991.[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Rose-2011-313) This increased to about 75% of NRB respondents in 2000, dropping slightly to 71% in 2009.[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Rose-2011-313) Throughout the 2000s, an average of 32% of NRB respondents supported the restoration of the Soviet Union.[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Rose-2011-313)

In a 2021 poll, a record 70% of Russians indicated they had a mostly/very favourable view of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin").[[289]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-314) In [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia "Armenia"), 12% of respondents said the USSR collapse did good, while 66% said it did harm. In [Kyrgyzstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan "Kyrgyzstan"), 16% of respondents said the collapse of the USSR did good, while 61% said it did harm.[[290]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-315) In a 2018 [Rating Sociological Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological_group_%22RATING%22 "Sociological group \"RATING\"") poll, 47% of [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians "Ukrainians") respondents had a positive opinion of Soviet leader [Leonid Brezhnev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev "Leonid Brezhnev"), who ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, while viewing [Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin "Lenin"), Stalin, and [Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorbachev "Gorbachev") very negatively.[[291]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-316) A 2021 poll conducted by the Levada Center found that 49% of Russians prefer the USSR's political system, while 18% prefer the current political system and 16% would prefer a [Western democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_democracy "Western democracy"). A further 62% of people polled preferred the Soviet system of central planning, while 24% prefer a market-based system.[[292]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-317) According to the Levada Center's polls, the primary reasons cited for Soviet nostalgia are the advantages of the shared economic union between the Soviet republics, including perceived financial stability.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-The_Washington_Post-2016-318) This was referenced by up to 53% of respondents in 2016.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-The_Washington_Post-2016-318) At least 43% also lamented the loss of the Soviet Union's global political superpower status.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-The_Washington_Post-2016-318) About 31% cited the loss of social trust and capital.[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-319) The remainder of the respondents cited a mix of reasons ranging from practical travel difficulties to a sense of national displacement.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-The_Washington_Post-2016-318)

The 1941–1945 period of World War II is still known in Russia as the '[Great Patriotic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War_(term) "Great Patriotic War (term)")'. The war became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts. As a result of the [massive losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union "World War II casualties of the Soviet Union") suffered by the military and civilians during the conflict, [Victory Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May) "Victory Day (9 May)") celebrated on 9 May is still one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia.[[295]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-320) Catherine Wanner asserts that Victory Day commemorations are a vehicle for Soviet nostalgia, as they "kept alive a mythology of Soviet grandeur, of solidarity among the _Sovietskii narod_, and of a sense of self as citizen of a superpower state".[[296]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-321)

Russian Victory Day parades are organized annually in most cities, with the central military parade taking place in [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow") (just as during the Soviet times).[[297]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-322)[[298]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-323) Additionally, the recently introduced [Immortal Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Regiment "Immortal Regiment") on 9 May sees millions of Russians carry the portraits of their relatives who fought in the war.[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-324) Russia also [retains other Soviet holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Russia "Public holidays in Russia"), such as the [Defender of the Fatherland Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_of_the_Fatherland_Day "Defender of the Fatherland Day") (23 February), [International Women's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day "International Women's Day") (8 March), and [International Workers' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day#Russia "International Workers' Day").[[300]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-325)

Protest against [Ukrainian decommunization policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decommunization_in_Ukraine "Decommunization in Ukraine") in Donetsk, 2014. The red banner reads, "Our homeland USSR".

In some post-Soviet republics, there is a more negative view of the USSR, although there is no unanimity on the matter.[[301]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-Budryte-326) In large part due to the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor "Holodomor"), ethnic [Ukrainians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians "Ukrainians") have a negative view of the Soviet Union.[[302]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-327)[Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language_in_Ukraine "Russian language in Ukraine")-speaking Ukrainians of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions have a more positive view of the USSR. In some countries with internal conflict, there is also nostalgia for the USSR, especially for [refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee "Refugee") of the [post-Soviet conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_conflicts "Post-Soviet conflicts") who have been forced to flee their homes and have been displaced. The many Russian enclaves in the former USSR republics such as [Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria "Transnistria") have in a general a positive remembrance of it.[[303]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-328)

### By the political left

The left's view of the USSR is complex. While some leftists regard the USSR as an example of state capitalism or that it was an oligarchical state, other leftists admire [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") and the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution").[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-329)[Council communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_communists "Council communists") generally view the USSR as failing to create [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness "Class consciousness"), turning into a corrupt state in which the elite controlled society.

[Trotskyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyists "Trotskyists") believe that the ascendancy of the Stalinist bureaucracy ensured a [degenerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerated_workers%27_state "Degenerated workers' state") or [deformed workers' state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformed_workers%27_state "Deformed workers' state"), where the capitalist elite have been replaced by an unaccountable bureaucratic elite and there is no true democracy or workers' control of industry.[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-330) In particular, American Trotskyist [David North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_North_(socialist) "David North (socialist)") noted that the generation of [bureaucrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura "Nomenklatura") that rose to power under Stalin's tutelage presided over the [stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_of_the_Soviet_Union "Stagnation of the Soviet Union") and [breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") of the Soviet Union.[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-331)

Many [anti-Stalinist leftists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Stalinist_left "Anti-Stalinist left") such as anarchists are extremely critical of Soviet authoritarianism and [repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabat#Decline "Nabat"). Much of the criticism it receives is centered around [massacres in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_the_Soviet_Union "List of massacres in the Soviet Union"), the centralized [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy") present in the USSR and mass [political repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression_in_the_Soviet_Union "Political repression in the Soviet Union") as well as violence towards government critics and [political dissidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_dissidents "Soviet dissidents") such as other leftists. Critics also point towards its failure to implement any substantial [worker cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperatives "Worker cooperatives") or implementing worker liberation, as well as corruption and the Soviet authoritarian nature.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Anarchists are also critical of the country, labeling the Soviet system as _[red fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red\_fascism "Red fascism")_. Factors contributing to the anarchist animosity towards the USSR included the Soviet destruction of the [Makhnovist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovist_movement "Makhnovist movement") after an initial alliance, the suppression of the anarchist [Kronstadt rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronstadt_rebellion "Kronstadt rebellion"), and the defeat of the rival anarchist factions by the Soviet-supported Communist faction during the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War").[[307]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-332)

[Maoists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoists "Maoists") also have a mixed opinion on the USSR, viewing it negatively during the [Sino-Soviet Split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Split "Sino-Soviet Split") and denouncing it as revisionist and reverted to capitalism. The Chinese government in 1963 articulated its criticism of the USSR's system and promoted China's ideological line as an alternative.[[308]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-333)[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-334)

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the [Japanese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Communist_Party "Japanese Communist Party") (JCP) released a press statement titled "We welcome the end of a party which embodied the historical evil of [great power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power")[chauvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism "Chauvinism") and [hegemonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonism "Hegemonism")".[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-335)

[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") called the collapse of the Soviet Union "a small victory for socialism, not only because of the fall of one of the most anti-socialist states in the world, where working people had fewer rights than in the West, but also because it freed the term 'socialism' from the burden of being associated in the propaganda systems of East and West with Soviet tyranny—for the East, in order to benefit from the aura of authentic socialism, for the West, in order to demonize the concept."[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-336) Some scholars on the left have posited that the end of the Soviet Union and [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism") as a global force allowed [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal "Neoliberal")[capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") to become a global system, which has resulted in rising [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality").[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-337)[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-338)[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-339)[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#cite_note-340)

"Stalinism in Post-Communist Perspective: New Evidence on Killings, Forced Labour and Economic Growth in the 1930s". _Europe-Asia Studies_. **48** (6): 956–987. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1080/09668139608412393](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F09668139608412393). [JSTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR_(identifier) "JSTOR (identifier)")[152635](https://www.jstor.org/stable/152635). The new evidence shows that administrative command planning and Stalin's forced industrialization strategies failed in the 1930s and beyond. The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact. It is the statistical artefact not of index number relativity (the Gerschenkron effect) but of misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure competitive value. The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalin's despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn & Zemskov's relatively favorable characterization of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism. The evidence demonstrates that the suppression of markets and the oppression of vast segments of the population were economically counterproductive and humanly calamitous, just as anyone conversant with classical economic theory should have expected.

As government cutbacks in education, healthcare and other basic social infrastructure threaten to undercut long-term development, young people are emigrating to better their lives rather than suffer in an economy without jobs. More than 12% of the overall population (and a much larger percentage of its labour force) now works abroad.

This was the moment when neoliberalism in the United States went from being a political movement to a political order.
