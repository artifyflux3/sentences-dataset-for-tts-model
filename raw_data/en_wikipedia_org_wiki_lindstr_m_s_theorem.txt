closure under classical negation ) having both the (countable) compactness property and the (downward) Löwenheim–Skolem property .

[ 2 ] Lindström's theorem is perhaps the best known result of what later became known as abstract model theory , [ 3 ] the basic notion of which is an abstract logic ; [ 4 ] the more general notion of an institution was later introduced, which advances from a set-theoretical notion of model to a category -theoretical one.

[ 5 ] Lindström had previously obtained a similar result in studying first-order logics extended with Lindström quantifiers .

[ 6 ] Lindström's theorem has been extended to various other systems of logic, in particular modal logics by Johan van Benthem and Sebastian Enqvist.
