"Particle collision" redirects here. For the meaning outside particle physics, see [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision "Collision").

In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), an **event** refers to the results just after a [fundamental interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction "Fundamental interaction") takes place between [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"), occurring in a very short time span, at a well-localized region of space. Because of the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), an event in particle physics does not have quite the same meaning as it does in the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), in which an "event" is a point in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") which can be known exactly, i.e., a spacetime coordinate.

In a typical particle physics event, the incoming particles are [scattered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering "Scattering") or destroyed, and up to hundreds of particles can be produced, although few are likely to be new particles not discovered before.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_collision#cite_note-1)

In the old [bubble chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber "Bubble chamber") and [cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber "Cloud chamber"), "events" could be seen by observing [charged particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") tracks emerging from the region of the event before they curl due to the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") through the chamber acting on the particles. At modern [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator"), events are the result of the interactions which occur from a [beam crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_crossing "Beam crossing") inside a [particle detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector "Particle detector").

[Physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") used to analyze events include the [differential cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cross_section "Differential cross section"), the [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") of the beams (which in turn depends on the [number density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_density "Number density") of the particles in the beam and their average [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")), and the [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(particle_physics) "Rate (particle physics)") and [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_(scattering_theory) "Luminosity (scattering theory)") of the experiment.[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") â€“ [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Event\_(particle\_physics)#Dubious "Talk:Event (particle physics)")_]

Individual particle physics events are modeled by [scattering theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_theory "Scattering theory") based on an underlying [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") of the particles and their interactions. The [S-matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix "S-matrix") is used to characterize the probability of various event outgoing particle states given the incoming particle states. For suitable quantum field theories, the S-matrix may be calculated by a [perturbative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics) "Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)") expansion in terms of [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram "Feynman diagram").

Events occur naturally in [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") and [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics"), such as subatomic [particle showers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_shower "Particle shower") produced from [cosmic ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") scattering events.
