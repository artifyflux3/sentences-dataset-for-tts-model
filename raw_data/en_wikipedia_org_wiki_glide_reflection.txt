A glide reflection is the composition of a reflection across a line and a translation parallel to the line.

This footprint trail has glide-reflection symmetry. Applying the glide reflection maps each left footprint into a right footprint and vice versa.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **glide reflection** or **transflection** is a [geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") that consists of a [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") across a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") and a [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") ("glide") in a direction [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") to that hyperplane, combined into a single transformation. Because the distances between [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") are not changed under glide reflection, it is a [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)") or [isometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry "Isometry"). When the context is the two-dimensional [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), the hyperplane of reflection is a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") called the _glide line_ or _glide axis_. When the context is [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"), the hyperplane of reflection is a plane called the _glide plane_. The [displacement vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_vector "Displacement vector") of the translation is called the _glide vector_.

When some geometrical object or configuration appears unchanged by a transformation, it is said to have [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(geometry) "Symmetry (geometry)"), and the transformation is called a [symmetry operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_operation "Symmetry operation"). _Glide-reflection symmetry_ is seen in [frieze groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze_group "Frieze group") (patterns which repeat in one dimension, often used in decorative borders), [wallpaper groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group "Wallpaper group") (regular [tessellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") of the plane), and [space groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group "Space group") (which describe e.g. [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") symmetries). Objects with glide-reflection symmetry are in general not [symmetrical under reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry "Reflection symmetry") alone, but two applications of the same glide reflection result in a double translation, so objects with glide-reflection symmetry always also have a simple [translational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry "Translational symmetry").

When a reflection is composed with a translation in a direction perpendicular to the hyperplane of reflection, the composition of the two transformations is a reflection in a parallel hyperplane. However, when a reflection is composed with a translation in any other direction, the composition of the two transformations is a glide reflection, which can be uniquely described as a reflection in a parallel hyperplane composed with a translation in a direction parallel to the hyperplane.

A single glide is represented as [frieze group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze_group "Frieze group") p11g. A glide reflection can be seen as a limiting [rotoreflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoreflection "Rotoreflection"), where the rotation becomes a translation. It can also be given a [Schoenflies notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoenflies_notation "Schoenflies notation") as S 2∞, [Coxeter notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_notation "Coxeter notation") as [∞+,2+], and [orbifold notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold_notation "Orbifold notation") as ∞×.

In the Euclidean plane, reflections and glide reflections are the only two kinds of indirect (orientation-reversing) [isometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group#Overview_of_isometries_in_up_to_three_dimensions "Euclidean group").

For example, there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the _x_-axis, followed by translation of one unit parallel to it. In coordinates, it takes

(_x_, _y_) → (_x_ + 1, −_y_).

This isometry maps the _x_-axis to itself; any other line which is parallel to the _x_-axis gets reflected in the _x_-axis, so this system of parallel lines is left invariant.

The [isometry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry_group "Isometry group") generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection#cite_note-1)

Combining two equal glide reflections gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.

In the case of glide-reflection symmetry, the [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") of an object contains a glide reflection, and hence the group generated by it. If that is all it contains, this type is [frieze group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze_group "Frieze group") p11g.

Example pattern with this symmetry group: [![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Frieze_example_p11g.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frieze_example_p11g.png)

A typical example of glide reflection in everyday life would be the track of footprints left in the sand by a person walking on a beach.

Frieze group nr. 6 (glide-reflections, translations and rotations) is generated by a glide reflection and a rotation about a point on the line of reflection. It is isomorphic to a [semi-direct product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-direct_product "Semi-direct product") of **Z** and _C_ 2.

Example pattern with this symmetry group: [![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Frieze_example_p2mg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frieze_example_p2mg.png)

For any symmetry group containing some glide-reflection symmetry, the translation vector of any glide reflection is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide reflection is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide-reflection symmetry reduces to a combination of [reflection symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry "Reflection symmetry") and [translational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry "Translational symmetry").

Glide-reflection symmetry with respect to two parallel lines with the same translation implies that there is also translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to these lines, with a translation distance which is twice the distance between glide reflection lines. This corresponds to [wallpaper group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group "Wallpaper group") pg; with additional symmetry it occurs also in pmg, pgg and p4g.

If there are also true reflection lines in the same direction then they are evenly spaced between the glide reflection lines. A glide reflection line parallel to a true reflection line already implies this situation. This corresponds to wallpaper group cm. The translational symmetry is given by oblique translation vectors from one point on a true reflection line to two points on the next, supporting a [rhombus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus "Rhombus") with the true reflection line as one of the diagonals. With additional symmetry it occurs also in cmm, p3m1, p31m, p4m and p6m.

In the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") 3 of 17 [wallpaper groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group "Wallpaper group") require glide reflection generators. p2gg has orthogonal glide reflections and 2-fold rotations. cm has parallel mirrors and glides, and pg has parallel glides. (Glide reflections are shown below as dashed lines)

Glide planes are noted in the [Hermann–Mauguin notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann%E2%80%93Mauguin_notation "Hermann–Mauguin notation") by _a_, _b_ or _c_, depending on which axis the glide is along. (The orientation of the plane is determined by the position of the symbol in the Hermann–Mauguin designation.) If the axis is not defined, then the glide plane may be noted by _g_. When the glide plane is parallel to the screen, these planes may be indicated by a bent arrow in which the arrowhead indicates the direction of the glide. When the glide plane is perpendicular to the screen, these planes can be represented either by dashed lines when the glide is parallel to the plane of the screen or dotted lines when the glide is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. Additionally, a centered lattice can cause a glide plane to exist in two directions at the same time. This type of glide plane may be indicated by a bent arrow with an arrowhead on both sides when the glide plan is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed and double-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. There is also the _n_ glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the _d_ glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the [unit cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cell "Unit cell") . The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. The _n_ glide plane may be indicated by diagonal arrow when it is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. A _d_ glide plane may be indicated by a diagonal half-arrow if the glide plane is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line with arrows if the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. If a _d_ glide plane is present in a crystal system, then that crystal must have a centered lattice.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection#cite_note-2)

In today's version of Hermann–Mauguin notation, the symbol _e_ is used in cases where there are two possible ways of designating the glide direction because both are true. For example if a crystal has a base-centered [Bravais lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice "Bravais lattice") centered on the C face, then a glide of half a cell unit in the _a_ direction gives the same result as a glide of half a cell unit in the _b_ direction.

The [isometry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry_group "Isometry group") generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group "Cyclic group"). Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.

In the case of glide-reflection symmetry, the [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") of an object contains a glide reflection and the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing a glide reflection, the glide vector is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of [reflection symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry "Reflection symmetry") and [translational symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry "Translational symmetry").

Examples and applications
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glide_reflection&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Examples and applications")]

Glide symmetry can be observed in nature among certain fossils of the [Ediacara biota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacara_biota "Ediacara biota"); the [machaeridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machaeridia_(annelid) "Machaeridia (annelid)"); and certain [palaeoscolecid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeoscolecid "Palaeoscolecid") worms.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection#cite_note-3) It can also be seen in many extant groups of [sea pens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_pen "Sea pen").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection#cite_note-4)

In [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Conway's Game of Life"), a commonly occurring pattern called the [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life) "Glider (Conway's Life)") is so named because it repeats its configuration of cells, shifted by a glide reflection, after two steps of the automaton. After four steps and two glide reflections, the pattern returns to its original orientation, shifted diagonally by one unit. Continuing in this way, it moves across the array of the game.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_reflection#cite_note-5)

In electrical engineering, if a signal that is periodic also has glide symmetries, it is said to be "half-wave symmetric". This extra symmetry causes the fourier series of the function to only contain odd terms. Examples include the [sine function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_function "Sine function"), [square waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave_(waveform) "Square wave (waveform)"), and [triangle waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave "Triangle wave").
