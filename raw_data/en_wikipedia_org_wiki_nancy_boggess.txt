Early life and education [ edit ] Boggess was born in 1925.

[ 1 ] She attended Wheaton College in Massachusetts where she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and music. She then earned her master's degree in mathematics from Wellesley College. Boggess completed her education at the University of Michigan with a PhD in astronomy.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Boggess went on to join NASA in 1968 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] after Nancy Roman heard Boggess speak at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society and offered Boggess a job.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] : 92 Boggess oversaw grant programs at NASA, [ 6 ] : 118–122 including serving as a NASA project scientist [ 7 ] for the development and launch of Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), which was able to map the entire night sky in the infrared spectrum.

[ 8 ] [ 6 ] : 125, 127, 174, 182 From 1983 until 1984 Boggess worked on the coordinating the development of the Spitzer Space Telescope .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Boggess was the project scientist [ 12 ] for the team that developed the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) [ 13 ] [ 6 ] : 200, 205, 234, 255, 269 which earned a Nobel Prize for John C. Mather and George Smoot in Physics in 2006.

[ 14 ] Under Boggess' guidance, COBE was a combination of multiple instruments that made precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation that was left over from the Big Bang.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] When Boggess retired, she spent time documenting the migration of birds.

[ 2 ] Boggess died in 2019.
