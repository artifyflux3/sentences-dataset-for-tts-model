10 of the most influential figures in the **history of quantum mechanics**. Left to right: [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck"), [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr"), [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie"), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac"), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli"), [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger"), [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman")

The history of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") is a fundamental part of the [history of modern physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics#20th_century:_birth_of_modern_physics "History of physics"). The major chapters of this history begin with the emergence of quantum ideas to explain individual phenomena—blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, solar emission spectra—an era called the Old or Older quantum theories.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1) Building on the technology [developed in classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_classical_mechanics "History of classical mechanics"), the invention of wave mechanics by [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") and expansion by many others triggers the "modern" era beginning around 1925. [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac")'s relativistic quantum theory work led him to explore quantum theories of radiation, culminating in [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), the first [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). The history of quantum mechanics continues in the [history of quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_field_theory "History of quantum field theory"). The history of [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry"), theoretical basis of [chemical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure "Chemical structure"), [reactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"), and [bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond"), interlaces with the events discussed in this article.

The phrase "quantum mechanics" was coined (in German, _Quantenmechanik_) by the group of physicists including [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), and [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli"), at the [University of Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen "University of Göttingen") in the early 1920s, and was first used in Born and P. Jordan's September 1925 paper _"Zur Quantenmechanik"_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-4)

The word _[quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum")_ comes from the [Latin word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language") for "how much" (as does _quantity_). Something that is _quantized_, as the energy of Planck's harmonic oscillators, can only take specific values. For example, in most countries, money is effectively quantized, with the _quantum of money_ being the lowest-value coin in circulation. Mechanics is the branch of science that deals with the action of forces on objects. So, quantum mechanics is the part of mechanics that deals with objects for which particular properties are quantized.

Triumph and trouble at the end of the classical era

The [discoveries of the 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics#19th_century "History of physics"), both the successes and failures, set the stage for the emergence of quantum mechanics.

### Wave theory of light

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Wave theory of light")]

Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") developed and championed his [corpuscular theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory "Corpuscular theory"), arguing that the perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light's particle nature, as at that time no wave theory demonstrated travel in straight lines.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 19  He explained refraction by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries [Robert Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke "Robert Hooke") and [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), and later [Augustin-Jean Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel "Augustin-Jean Fresnel"), mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media, refraction could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting [Huygens–Fresnel principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle "Huygens–Fresnel principle") was extremely successful at reproducing light's behaviour and was consistent with [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)")'s discovery of [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference "Wave interference") of light by his [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment "Double-slit experiment") in 1801.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-5) The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-6)

[James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") found that he could apply his previously discovered [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), along with a slight modification, to describe self-propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 272  This theory became a critical ingredient in the beginning of quantum mechanics.

### Emerging atomic theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Emerging atomic theory")]

During the early 19th century, [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") research by [John Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton "John Dalton") and [Amedeo Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro "Amedeo Avogadro") lent weight to the [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory") of matter, an idea that [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"), [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") and others built upon to establish the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"). The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Feynman-kinetic-theory-7) The existence of atoms was not universally accepted among physicists or chemists; [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach "Ernst Mach"), for example, was a staunch anti-atomist.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-8)

[![Image 2: Boltzmann's iodine molecule model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Boltzmanns-molecule.jpg/250px-Boltzmanns-molecule.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boltzmanns-molecule.jpg)

Ludwig Boltzmann's **diagram of the I 2 molecule** proposed in 1898 showing the atomic "sensitive region" (α, β) of overlap.

The earliest hints of problems in classical mechanics were raised in relation to the temperature dependence of the properties of gases.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-9)[Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann") suggested in 1877 that the energy levels of a physical system, such as a [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), could be discrete (rather than continuous). Boltzmann's rationale for the presence of discrete energy levels in molecules such as those of iodine gas had its origins in his [statistical thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_thermodynamics "Statistical thermodynamics") and [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") theories and was backed up by [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical "Mathematical") arguments, as would also be the case twenty years later with the first [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") put forward by [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck").

### Electrons and the nucleus

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Electrons and the nucleus")]

In the final days of the 1800s, [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson") established that [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") carry a negative charge opposite but the same as that of a hydrogen ion while having a mass over one thousand times less. Many such electrons were known to be associated with every atom.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 365  By 1904 Thomson proposed the first atomic model with subatomic constituents, using circulating electrons in a background of positive charge, the so-called [plum pudding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model "Plum pudding model").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Kragh2010-10) Thomson's concepts were supported by early [beta particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle "Beta particle") scattering experiments but by 1911 [Hans Geiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Geiger "Hans Geiger") and his student [Ernest Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Marsden "Ernest Marsden") demonstrated [backscattering of alpha particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_scattering_experiments "Rutherford scattering experiments") which [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford") interpreted as compelling evidence that the positive charge was concentrated in a small volume we now call the [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Heilbron1968-11)

[![Image 3: Blackbody radiation curve](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Black_body.svg/250px-Black_body.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg)

 With decreasing temperature, the peak of the **blackbody radiation** curve shifts to longer wavelengths and also has lower intensities. The blackbody radiation curves (1862) at left are also compared with the early, classical limit model of [Rayleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Strutt,_3rd_Baron_Rayleigh "John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh") and [Jeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jeans "James Jeans") (1900) shown at right. The short wavelength side of the curves was already approximated in 1896 by the [Wien distribution law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_approximation "Wien approximation").

Throughout the 1800s many studies investigated details in the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") of intensity versus frequency for light emitted by flames, by the Sun, or red-hot objects.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 367  The [Rydberg formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_formula "Rydberg formula") effectively summarized the dark lines seen in the spectrum, but Rydberg provided no physical model to explain them. The spectrum emitted by red-hot objects could be explained at high or low wavelengths but the two theories differed.

Quantum mechanics developed in two distinct phases. The first phase, known as the [old quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory "Old quantum theory"), began around 1900 with radically new approaches to explanations physical phenomena not understood by classical mechanics of the 1800s.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1)

### Planck introduces quanta to explain black-body radiation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Planck introduces quanta to explain black-body radiation")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Max_Planck_1878.GIF/250px-Max_Planck_1878.GIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Max_Planck_1878.GIF)

Hot metalwork. The yellow-orange glow is the visible part of the thermal radiation emitted due to the high temperature. Everything else in the picture is glowing with thermal radiation as well, but less brightly and at longer wavelengths than the human eye can detect. A far-infrared camera can observe this radiation.

[Thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an object due to the object's internal energy. If an object is heated sufficiently, it starts to emit light at the red end of the visible [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum"), as it becomes [red hot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:red-hot#English "wikt:en:red-hot").

Heating it further causes the color to change from red to yellow, white, and blue, as it emits light at increasingly shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies). A perfect emitter is also a perfect absorber: when it is cold, such an object looks perfectly black, because it absorbs all the light that falls on it and emits none. Consequently, an ideal thermal emitter is known as a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body"), and the radiation it emits is called [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation "Black-body radiation").

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/RWP-comparison.svg/250px-RWP-comparison.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RWP-comparison.svg)

Predictions of the amount of thermal radiation of different frequencies emitted by a body. Correct values predicted by Planck's law (green) contrasted against the classical values of [Rayleigh-Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law") (red) and [Wien approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_approximation "Wien approximation") (blue).

By the late 19th century, thermal radiation had been fairly well characterized experimentally. Several formulas had been created that could describe some of the experimental measurements of thermal radiation: how the wavelength at which the radiation is strongest changes with temperature is given by [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law "Wien's displacement law"), the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law "Stefan–Boltzmann law"). The best theoretical explanation of the experimental results was the [Rayleigh–Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law"), which agrees with experimental results well at large wavelengths (or, equivalently, low frequencies), but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (or high frequencies). In fact, at short wavelengths, classical physics predicted that energy will be emitted by a hot body at an infinite rate. This result, which is clearly wrong, is known as the [ultraviolet catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe "Ultraviolet catastrophe"). However, classical physics led to the Rayleigh–Jeans law, which, as shown in the figure, agrees with experimental results well at low frequencies, but strongly disagrees at high frequencies. Physicists searched for a single theory that explained all the experimental results.

Black-body radiation intensity vs color and temperature. The rainbow bar represents visible light; 5000K objects are "white hot" by mixing differing colors of visible light. To the right is the invisible infrared. Classical theory (black curve for 5000K) fails; the other curves are correctly predicted by Planck's law.

The first model that was able to explain the full spectrum of thermal radiation was put forward by [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck") in 1900.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-12) He proposed a mathematical model in which the thermal radiation was in equilibrium with a set of [harmonic oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator "Harmonic oscillator"). To reproduce the experimental results, he had to assume that each oscillator emitted an integer number of units of energy at its single characteristic frequency, rather than being able to emit any arbitrary amount of energy. In other words, the energy emitted by an oscillator was _quantized_. According to Planck, the quantum of energy E of a light quantum is proportional to its frequency [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency")ν. As an equation is it written: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle E=hv.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af45c44e1d558909c3a357079e74493144ab6be0) This is now known as the [Planck relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_relation "Planck relation") and the proportionality constant, _h_, as the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant").

Planck's law was the first quantum theory in physics, and Planck won the 1918 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-13) At the time, however, Planck's view was that quantization was purely a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") mathematical construct, rather than (as is now believed) a fundamental change in our understanding of the world.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Kragh-14)

### Einstein applies quanta to explain the photoelectric effect

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Einstein applies quanta to explain the photoelectric effect")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Photoelectric_effect_in_a_solid_-_diagram.svg/250px-Photoelectric_effect_in_a_solid_-_diagram.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Photoelectric_effect_in_a_solid_-_diagram.svg)

Light is shone upon the surface from the left. If the light frequency is high enough, i.e. if it delivers sufficient energy, negatively charged electrons are ejected from the metal.

In 1887, [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") observed that when light with sufficient frequency hits a metallic surface, the surface emits [cathode rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_rays "Cathode rays").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): I:362  Ten years later, J. J. Thomson showed that the many reports of cathode rays were actually "corpuscles" and they quickly came to be called [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons"). In 1902, [Philipp Lenard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Lenard "Philipp Lenard") discovered that the maximum possible energy of an ejected electron is unrelated to the [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics) "Intensity (physics)") of the monochromatic light.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-15) This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Hawking-16): 24

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Einstein_patentoffice.jpg/250px-Einstein_patentoffice.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein_patentoffice.jpg)

[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")c. 1905

In 1905, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") suggested that even though continuous models of light worked extremely well for time-averaged optical phenomena, for instantaneous transitions the energy in light may occur a finite number of energy quanta.

In the introduction section of his March 1905 paper "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Emission and Transformation of Light", Einstein states:

> According to the assumption to be contemplated here, when a light ray is spreading from a point, the energy is not distributed continuously over ever-increasing spaces, but consists of a finite number of "energy quanta" that are localized in points in space, move without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated only as a whole.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Eistein-photoelectric-17)

This has been called the most "revolutionary" sentence written by a twentieth century physicist, meaning that it proposed an idea altered mainstream thinking.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-18): 143 [The energy of a single quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_energy "Photon energy") of light of frequency ![Image 11: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) is given by the frequency multiplied by the Planck constant ![Image 12: {\displaystyle h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a):

![Image 13: {\displaystyle E=hf}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f39fac3593bb1e2dec0282c112c4dff7a99007f6)
Einstein assumed a light quanta transfers all of its energy to a single electron imparting at most an energy _hf_ to the electron. Therefore, only the light frequency determines the maximum energy that can be imparted to the electron; the intensity of the photoemission is proportional to the light beam intensity.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Eistein-photoelectric-17)

Einstein argued that it takes a certain amount of energy, called the _[work function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work\_function "Work function")_ and denoted by φ, to remove an electron from the metal.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-taylor_127-9-19) This amount of energy is different for each metal. If the energy of the light quanta is less than the work function, then it does not carry sufficient energy to remove the electron from the metal. The threshold frequency, _f_ 0, is the frequency of a light quanta whose energy is equal to the work function:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \varphi =hf_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c24d760b0e2b2331f681340863d6e7b74514fc81)
If _f_ is greater than _f_ 0, the energy _hf_ is enough to remove an electron. The ejected electron has a [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy"), _E_ k, which is, at most, equal to the light energy minus the energy needed to dislodge the electron from the metal:

![Image 15: {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}=hf-\varphi =h(f-f_{0}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c00ee4a568968d34d86f0a16cac56505712ce4fb)
Einstein's description of light as being composed of energy quanta extended Planck's notion of quantized energy, which is that a single quantum of a given frequency, _f_, delivers an invariant amount of energy, _hf_. Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-20) In nature, single quanta are rarely encountered. The Sun and emission sources available in the 19th century emit a vast amount of energy every second. The [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant"), _h_, is so tiny that the amount of energy in each quantum, _hf_ is very very small. Light we see includes many trillions of such quanta. [Arthur Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Compton "Arthur Compton")'s demonstration of the [scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering "Compton scattering") of light by electrons scattering convinced physicists of the reality of photons.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Compton1923-21) Compton won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-22) The term "[photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon")" was introduced in 1926 by [Gilbert N. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis "Gilbert N. Lewis").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-www.aps.org-23)

### Quantization of matter: the Bohr model of the atom

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Quantization of matter: the Bohr model of the atom")]

[Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford "Ernest Rutherford")'s discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911 did not immediately cause atomic models to be revised. Mechanical models with circulating electrons had been proposed for many years but they were known to be unstable.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Heilbron1968-11)

A second, related puzzle was the [emission spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum") of atoms. When a gas is heated, it gives off light only at discrete frequencies. For example, the visible light given off by [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") consists of four different colors, as shown in the picture below. The intensity of the light at different frequencies is also different. By contrast, white light consists of a continuous emission across the whole range of visible frequencies. By the end of the nineteenth century, a simple rule known as [Balmer's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series "Balmer series") showed how the frequencies of the different lines related to each other, though without explaining why this was, or making any prediction about the intensities. The formula also predicted some additional spectral lines in ultraviolet and infrared light that had not been observed at the time. These lines were later observed experimentally, raising confidence in the value of the formula.

 Niels Bohr's 1913 quantum model of the hydrogen atom.

In 1913, H. M. Hansen asked [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr "Niels Bohr") about Balmer's formula. Bohr recalled that "As soon as I saw Balmer's formula, the whole thing was immediately clear to me."[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-25) In "On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules", he proposed [a new model of the atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model "Bohr model") that included quantized electron orbits. In the Bohr model, the hydrogen atom is pictured as a heavy, positively charged nucleus orbited by a light, negatively charged electron. The electron can only exist in certain, discretely separated orbits, labeled by their [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"), which is restricted to be an integer multiple of the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant "Reduced Planck constant").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-26) The electron moves to a higher or lower orbital by absorbing or emitting a photon of corresponding frequency.

These orbits had fixed or quantized values of angular momentum, a concept proposed by [John William Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Nicholson "John William Nicholson") in a nuclear atom model and adopted by Bohr in his model.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-McCormmach1966-27): 169  When an atom emitted (or absorbed) energy, the electron did not move in a continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus to another, as might be expected classically. Instead, the electron would jump instantaneously from one orbit to another, giving off the emitted light in the form of a photon.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-WorldBook-28) The possible energies of photons given off by each element were determined by the differences in energy between the orbits, and so the emission spectrum for each element would contain a number of lines.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-29)

The model's key success lay in explaining the Rydberg formula for the spectral [emission lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series "Hydrogen spectral series") of atomic hydrogen by using the transitions of electrons between orbits.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Heilbron1969-30): 276  While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain the reasons for the structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for the fundamental physical constants that make up the formula's empirical results.

[![Image 18: Head and shoulders of a young man in a suit and tie](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Niels_Bohr_-_LOC_-_ggbain_-_35303.jpg/250px-Niels_Bohr_-_LOC_-_ggbain_-_35303.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niels_Bohr_-_LOC_-_ggbain_-_35303.jpg)

Niels Bohr as a young man

Starting from only one simple assumption about the rule that the orbits must obey, the Bohr model was able to relate the observed spectral lines in the emission spectrum of hydrogen to previously known constants. In Bohr's model, the electron was not allowed to emit energy continuously and crash into the nucleus: once it was in the closest permitted orbit, it was stable forever. Bohr's model did not explain why the orbits should be quantized in that way, nor was it able to make accurate predictions for atoms with more than one electron, or to explain why some spectral lines are brighter than others.

Some fundamental assumptions of the Bohr model were soon proven wrong—but the key result that the discrete lines in emission spectra are due to some property of the electrons in atoms being quantized is correct. The way that the electrons actually behave is strikingly different from Bohr's atom, and from what we see in the world of our everyday experience; this modern quantum mechanical model of the atom is discussed [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#Application_to_the_hydrogen_atom).

Moreover, the application of Planck's quantum theory to the electron allowed [Ștefan Procopiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%98tefan_Procopiu "Ștefan Procopiu") in 1911–1913, and subsequently Niels Bohr in 1913, to calculate the [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), which was later called the "[magneton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_magneton "Bohr magneton")"; similar quantum computations, but with numerically quite different values, were subsequently made possible for both the magnetic moments of the [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") that are three [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude "Order of magnitude") smaller than that of the electron.

These theories, though successful, were strictly [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenological_model "Phenomenological model"): during this time, there was no rigorous justification for [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics) "Quantization (physics)"), aside, perhaps, from [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré")'s discussion of Planck's theory in his 1912 paper _Sur la théorie des quanta_.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-McCormmach-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Irons-32) They are collectively known as the _[old quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old\_quantum\_theory "Old quantum theory")_. Bohr was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them".[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-33)

Quantum spin versus classical magnet in the [Stern–Gerlach experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment "Stern–Gerlach experiment")

Quantization of the orbital angular momentum of the electron combined with the magnetic moment of the electron suggested that atoms with a magnetic moment should show quantized behavior in a magnetic field. In 1922, [Otto Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Stern "Otto Stern") and [Walther Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Gerlach "Walther Gerlach") set out to test this theory. They heated silver in a vacuum tube equipped with a series of narrow aligned slits, creating a molecular beam of silver atoms. They shot this beam through an [inhomogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity "Homogeneity and heterogeneity")[magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"). Rather than a continuous pattern of silver atoms, they found two bunches.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-cigar-34)

Relative to its northern pole, pointing up, down, or somewhere in between, in classical mechanics, a magnet thrown through a magnetic field may be deflected a small or large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot through the magnetic field acted similarly. However, while the magnets could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a constant distance either up or down. This implied that the property of the atom that corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantized, taking one of two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any angle.

The choice of the orientation of the magnetic field used in the Stern–Gerlach experiment is arbitrary. In the animation shown here, the field is vertical and so the atoms are deflected either up or down. If the magnet is rotated a quarter turn, the atoms are deflected either left or right. Using a vertical field shows that the spin along the vertical axis is quantized, and using a horizontal field shows that the spin along the horizontal axis is quantized.

The results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment caused a sensation, most especially because leading scientists, including Einstein and [Paul Ehrenfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrenfest "Paul Ehrenfest") argued that the silver atoms should have random orientations in the conditions of the experiment: quantization should not have been observable.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-cigar-34) At least five years would elapse before this mystery was resolved: quantization was observed but it was not due to orbital angular momentum. Per [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli")'s [exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"), only two electrons can occupy the same quantum state at the same time, and their spins must be opposite. Pauli received the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle".[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-35)

In 1925, [Ralph Kronig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kronig "Ralph Kronig") proposed that electrons behave as if they self-rotate, or "spin", about an axis.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Baggott2013-36): 56  Spin would generate a tiny magnetic moment that would split the energy levels responsible for spectral lines, in agreement with existing measurements. Two electrons in the same orbital would occupy distinct [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") if they "spun" in opposite directions thus satisfying the exclusion principle. Unfortunately, the theory had two significant flaws: two values computed by Kronig were off by a factor of two. Kronig's senior colleagues discouraged his work and it was never published.

Ten months later, Dutch physicists [George Uhlenbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Uhlenbeck "George Uhlenbeck") and [Samuel Goudsmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goudsmit "Samuel Goudsmit") at [Leiden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_University "Leiden University") published their theory of electron self rotation.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-37) The model, like Kronig's was essentially classical but resulted in a quantum prediction.

### de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis")]

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Broglie_Big.jpg/250px-Broglie_Big.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Broglie_Big.jpg)

[Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") in 1929. De Broglie won the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") for his prediction that matter acts as a wave, made in his 1924 PhD thesis.

In 1924, [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") published a breakthrough hypothesis: [matter has wave properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_waves "Matter waves"). Building on Einstein's proposal that the photoelectric effect can be described using quantized energy transfers and by Einstein's separate proposal, from special relativity, that mass at rest is equivalent to energy via ![Image 20: {\displaystyle E=m_{0}c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e379c4379411852db6472d6414fbc31a14bc46d7), de Broglie proposed that matter in motion appears to have an associated wave with wavelength ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \lambda =h/p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53d90749442f4524695c449142b03c24d80ef986) where ![Image 22: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) is the matter momentum from the motion.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-39) Requiring his wavelength to encircle an atom, he explained quantization of Bohr's orbits.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 217  Simultaneously this showed that the wave behavior of light was essentially a quantum effect.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 216

De Broglie expanded Bohr's model of the atom by showing that an electron in orbit around a nucleus could be thought of as having wave-like properties. In particular, an electron is observed only in situations that permit a [standing wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave "Standing wave") around a [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). An example of a standing wave is a violin string, which is fixed at both ends and can be made to vibrate. The waves created by a stringed instrument appear to oscillate in place, moving from crest to trough in an up-and-down motion. The wavelength of a standing wave is related to the length of the vibrating object and the boundary conditions. For example, because the violin string is fixed at both ends, it can carry standing waves of wavelengths ![Image 23: {\textstyle {\frac {2l}{n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ede0b6c5ab5793229032c6efcf0a71cc4acf1a38), where _l_ is the length and _n_ is a positive integer. De Broglie suggested that the allowed electron orbits were those for which the circumference of the orbit would be an integer number of wavelengths. The electron's wavelength, therefore, determines that only Bohr orbits of certain distances from the nucleus are possible. In turn, at any distance from the nucleus smaller than a certain value, it would be impossible to establish an orbit. The minimum possible distance from the nucleus is called the Bohr radius.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-40) De Broglie's treatment of the Bohr atom was ultimately unsuccessful, but his hypothesis served as a starting point for Schrödinger's wave equation.

Matter behaving as a wave was first demonstrated experimentally: a beam of electrons can exhibit [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction"), just like a beam of light or a water wave. Three years after de Broglie published his hypothesis two different groups demonstrated electron diffraction. At the [University of Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen "University of Aberdeen"), [George Paget Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Paget_Thomson "George Paget Thomson") and Alexander Reid passed a beam of electrons through a thin celluloid film, then later metal films, and observed the predicted interference patterns. (Alexander Reid, who was Thomson's graduate student, performed the first experiments but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-41) and is rarely mentioned.) At [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs"), [Clinton Joseph Davisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Joseph_Davisson "Clinton Joseph Davisson") and [Lester Halbert Germer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Halbert_Germer "Lester Halbert Germer") reflected an electron beam from a nickel sample in their experiment, observing well-defined beams predicted by wave models returning from the crystal.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): II:218  De Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for his hypothesis;[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-42) Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their experimental work.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-43)

Development of modern quantum mechanics
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Development of modern quantum mechanics")]

The end of the first era of quantum mechanics was triggered by de Broglie's publication of his hypothesis of [matter waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 268  leading to not just one new quantum theory but two. Almost simultaneously, the German physicists [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), and [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan")[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Edwards79-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Edwards81-45) developed [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics") and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented [wave mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-46) Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent.

The first applications of quantum mechanics to physical systems were the algebraic determination of the hydrogen spectrum by [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli")[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-47) and the treatment of diatomic molecules by [Lucy Mensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mensing "Lucy Mensing").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-48) Accurate predictions of the absorption spectrum of hydrogen ensured wide acceptance of the new quantum theory.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-1): 275

In 1925, Werner Heisenberg attempted to solve one of the problems that the Bohr model left unanswered, explaining the intensities of the different lines in the hydrogen emission spectrum. Through a series of mathematical analogies, he wrote out the quantum-mechanical analog for the classical computation of intensities.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Heisenberg1925-49) Shortly afterward, Heisenberg's colleague Max Born realized that Heisenberg's method of calculating the probabilities for transitions between the different energy levels could best be expressed by using the mathematical concept of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)").

Heisenberg formulated an early version of the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle") in 1927, analyzing a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") where one attempts to [measure an electron's position and momentum simultaneously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg%27s_microscope "Heisenberg's microscope"). However, Heisenberg did not give precise mathematical definitions of what the "uncertainty" in these measurements meant, a step that would be taken soon after by [Earle Hesse Kennard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earle_Hesse_Kennard "Earle Hesse Kennard"), Wolfgang Pauli, and [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-51)

### Schrödinger and the wave mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Schrödinger and the wave mechanics")]

In the first half of 1926, building on de Broglie's hypothesis, Erwin Schrödinger developed the equation that describes the behavior of a quantum-mechanical wave.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-SchrBiog-52) The mathematical model, called the Schrödinger equation after its creator, is central to quantum mechanics, defines the permitted stationary states of a quantum system, and describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-EB-SchrEquation-53) The wave itself is described by a mathematical function known as a "[wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function")". Schrödinger said that the wave function provides the "means for predicting the probability of measurement results".[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-54)

Schrödinger was able to calculate the energy levels of hydrogen by treating a hydrogen atom's electron as a classical wave, moving in a well of the electrical potential created by the proton. This calculation accurately reproduced the energy levels of the Bohr model.

In May 1926, Schrödinger proved that Heisenberg's [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics") and his own wave mechanics made the same predictions about the properties and behavior of the electron; mathematically, the two theories had an underlying common form. Yet the two men disagreed on the interpretation of their mutual theory. For instance, Heisenberg accepted the theoretical prediction of jumps of electrons between orbitals in an atom,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-55) but Schrödinger hoped that a theory based on continuous wave-like properties could avoid what he called (as paraphrased by [Wilhelm Wien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wien "Wilhelm Wien")) "this nonsense about quantum jumps".[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-56) In the end, Heisenberg's approach won out, and quantum jumps were confirmed.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-nytimesQuantumJump-57)

### Application to the hydrogen atom

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Application to the hydrogen atom")]

Bohr's model of the atom was essentially a planetary one, with the electrons orbiting around the nuclear "sun". However, the uncertainty principle states that an electron cannot simultaneously have an exact location and velocity in the way that a planet does. Instead of classical orbits, electrons are said to inhabit _[atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic\_orbital "Atomic orbital")_. An orbital is the "cloud" of possible locations in which an electron might be found, a distribution of probabilities rather than a precise location.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Pauling-58) Each orbital is three dimensional, rather than the two-dimensional orbit, and is often depicted as a three-dimensional region within which there is a 95 percent probability of finding the electron.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-EB-orbital-59)

Schrödinger was able to calculate the energy levels of hydrogen by treating a hydrogen atom's electron as a wave, represented by the "[wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function")" _Ψ_, in an [electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential")[well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_well "Potential well"), _V_, created by the proton. The solutions to Schrödinger's equation [_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] are distributions of probabilities for electron positions and locations. Orbitals have a range of different shapes in three dimensions. The energies of the different orbitals can be calculated, and they accurately match the energy levels of the Bohr model.

Within Schrödinger's picture, each electron has four properties:

1.   An "orbital" designation, indicating whether the particle-wave is one that is closer to the nucleus with less energy or one that is farther from the nucleus with more energy;
2.   The "shape" of the orbital, spherical or otherwise;
3.   The "inclination" of the orbital, determining the magnetic moment of the orbital around the _z_-axis.
4.   The "spin" of the electron.

The collective name for these properties is the [quantum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") of the electron. The quantum state can be described by giving a number to each of these properties; these are known as the electron's [quantum numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_numbers "Quantum numbers"). The quantum state of the electron is described by its wave function. The Pauli exclusion principle demands that no two electrons within an atom may have the same values of all four numbers.

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Atomic_orbitals_spdf_m-eigenstates.png/500px-Atomic_orbitals_spdf_m-eigenstates.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic_orbitals_spdf_m-eigenstates.png)

The shapes of atomic orbitals. Rows: 1 _s_, 2 _p_, 3 _d_ and 4 _f_. From left to right ![Image 25: {\displaystyle m=-l,\ldots ,l}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d1eb098d37cfd28b0e2aed54e05dcae553bf023). The colors show the phase of the wave function.

The first property describing the orbital is the [principal quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_quantum_number "Principal quantum number"), _n_, which is the same as in the Bohr model. _n_ denotes the energy level of each orbital. The possible values for _n_ are integers:

![Image 26: {\displaystyle n=1,2,3\ldots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/758aab790b00c1fc1640d549c30f04c6a7472bbc)
The next quantum number, the [azimuthal quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_quantum_number "Azimuthal quantum number"), denoted _l_, describes the shape of the orbital. The shape is a consequence of the [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") of the orbital. The angular momentum represents the resistance of a spinning object to speeding up or slowing down under the influence of external force. The azimuthal quantum number represents the orbital angular momentum of an electron around its nucleus. The possible values for _l_ are integers from 0 to _n − 1_ (where _n_ is the principal quantum number of the electron):

![Image 27: {\displaystyle l=0,1,\ldots ,n-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70399991c59858af674a906796e312ef175d79ae)
The shape of each orbital is usually referred to by a letter, rather than by its azimuthal quantum number. The first shape (_l_=0) is denoted by the letter _s_ (a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") being "_s_ phere"). The next shape is denoted by the letter _p_ and has the form of a dumbbell. The other orbitals have more complicated shapes (see [atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital")), and are denoted by the letters _d_, _f_, _g_, etc.

The third quantum number, the [magnetic quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_quantum_number "Magnetic quantum number"), describes the magnetic moment of the electron, and is denoted by _m_ _l_ (or simply _m_). The possible values for _m_ _l_ are integers from −_l_ to _l_ (where _l_ is the azimuthal quantum number of the electron):

![Image 28: {\displaystyle m_{l}=-l,-(l-1),\ldots ,0,\ldots ,(l-1),l.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1ccf8064a6a41409697fd695ca710a048a659a6)
The magnetic quantum number measures the component of the angular momentum in a particular direction. The choice of direction is arbitrary; conventionally the z-direction is chosen.

The fourth quantum number, the [spin quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_quantum_number "Spin quantum number") (pertaining to the "orientation" of the electron's spin) is denoted _m s_, with values +1⁄2 or −1⁄2.

The chemist [Linus Pauling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling") wrote, by way of example:

> In the case of a [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium") atom with two electrons in the 1 _s_ orbital, the Pauli Exclusion Principle requires that the two electrons differ in the value of one quantum number. Their values of _n_, _l_, and _m l_ are the same. Accordingly they must differ in the value of _m s_, which can have the value of +1⁄2 for one electron and −1⁄2 for the other."[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Pauling-58)

It is the underlying structure and symmetry of atomic orbitals, and the way that electrons fill them, that leads to the organization of the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"). The way the atomic orbitals on different atoms combine to form [molecular orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital "Molecular orbital") determines the structure and strength of chemical bonds between atoms.

The field of [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry") was pioneered by physicists [Walter Heitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Heitler "Walter Heitler") and [Fritz London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_London "Fritz London"), who published a study of the [covalent bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond") of the [hydrogen molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_molecule "Hydrogen molecule") in 1927. Quantum chemistry was subsequently developed by a large number of workers, including the American theoretical chemist [Linus Pauling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling") at [Caltech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltech "Caltech"), and [John C. Slater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Slater "John C. Slater") into various theories such as Molecular Orbital Theory or Valence Theory.

### Dirac, relativity, and development of the formal methods

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Dirac, relativity, and development of the formal methods")]

Starting around 1927, Paul Dirac began the process of unifying quantum mechanics with [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") by proposing the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") for the electron. The Dirac equation achieves the relativistic description of the wavefunction of an electron that Schrödinger failed to obtain. It predicts electron spin and led Dirac to predict the existence of the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron"). He also pioneered the use of operator theory, including the influential [bra–ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation "Bra–ket notation"), as described in his famous 1930 textbook. During the same period, Hungarian polymath [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") formulated the rigorous mathematical basis for quantum mechanics as the theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces, as described in his [likewise famous 1932 textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics"). These, like many other works from the founding period, still stand, and remain widely used.

### Copenhagen interpretation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Copenhagen interpretation")]

[![Image 29: A block-shaped beige building with a sloped, red-tiled roof](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Niels_Bohr_Institute_1.jpg/250px-Niels_Bohr_Institute_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Niels_Bohr_Institute_1.jpg)

The [Niels Bohr Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr_Institute "Niels Bohr Institute") in Copenhagen, which was a focal point for researchers in quantum mechanics and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the world's best known theoretical physicists spent time there.

Bohr, Heisenberg, and others tried to explain what these experimental results and mathematical models really mean. The term _[Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen\_interpretation "Copenhagen interpretation")_ has been applied to their views in retrospect, glossing over differences among them.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Faye-Stanford-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-camilleri2015-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Mermin_2017-65) While no definitive statement of "the" Copenhagen interpretation exists, the following ideas are widely seen as characteristic of it.

1.   A system is completely described by a quantum state (Heisenberg)
2.   How the quantum state changes over time is given by a wave equation, the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") imparting wave characteristics to light and matter.
3.   Atomic interactions are discontinuous (Planck referred to a "[quantum of action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant")").
4.   The description of nature is essentially probabilistic. The probability of an event—for example, where on the screen a particle shows up in the double-slit experiment—is related to the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of its wave function. ([Born rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule "Born rule"), due to [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), which gives a physical meaning to the wave function in the Copenhagen interpretation: the [probability amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude "Probability amplitude"))
5.   The values of incompatible pairs of properties of the system cannot be known at the same time. (Heisenberg's [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"))
6.   Matter, like light, exhibits a wave-particle duality. An experiment can demonstrate the particle-like properties of matter, or its wave-like properties; but not both at the same time. ([Complementarity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_principle "Complementarity principle") due to Bohr[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Bohr1928English-66))
7.   Measuring devices are essentially classical devices and measure classical properties such as position and momentum.
8.   The quantum mechanical description of large systems should closely approximate the classical description. ([Correspondence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle "Correspondence principle") of Bohr and Heisenberg)

Quantum field theory
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Quantum field theory")]

Beginning in 1927, researchers attempted to apply quantum mechanics to fields instead of single particles, resulting in quantum field theories. Early workers in this area include Pauli, [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac"), [Victor Weisskopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Weisskopf "Victor Weisskopf"), and [Paul Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan"). This area of research culminated in the formulation of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson "Freeman Dyson"), [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger "Julian Schwinger"), and [Shin'ichiro Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga "Shin'ichirō Tomonaga") during the 1940s. Quantum electrodynamics describes a quantum theory of electrons, [positrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron"), and the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), and served as a model for subsequent [quantum field theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Edwards79-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Edwards81-45)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-67)

Feynman diagram of **[gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon")[radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation")** in [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics")

The theory of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") was formulated beginning in the early 1960s. The theory as we know it today was formulated by [Hugh David Politzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_David_Politzer "Hugh David Politzer"), [David Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross "David Gross") and [Frank Wilczek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek "Frank Wilczek") in 1975.

Building on pioneering work by Schwinger, [Peter Higgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs "Peter Higgs") and [Jeffrey Goldstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldstone "Jeffrey Goldstone"), the physicists [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow"), [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg "Steven Weinberg") and [Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam "Abdus Salam") independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single [electroweak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_force "Electroweak force"), for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Quantum information
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_quantum_mechanics&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Quantum information")]

[Quantum information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science "Quantum information science") developed in the latter decades of the 20th century, beginning with theoretical results like [Holevo's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo%27s_theorem "Holevo's theorem"), the concept of generalized measurements or [POVMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POVM "POVM"), the proposal of [quantum key distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution "Quantum key distribution") by [Bennett and Brassard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84 "BB84") in 1984, and [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm "Shor's algorithm") in 1994.

[T]here is no point in looking for _the_ Copenhagen interpretation as a unified and consistent logical structure. Terms such as "Copenhagen interpretation" or "Copenhagen school" are based on the history of the development of quantum mechanics; they form a simplified and often convenient way of referring to the ideas of a number of physicists who played an important role in the establishment of quantum mechanics, and who were collaborators of Bohr's at his Institute or took part in the discussions during the crucial years. On closer inspection, one sees quite easily that these ideas are divergent in detail and that in particular the views of Bohr, the spiritual leader of the school, form a separate entity which can now be understood only by a thorough study of as many as possible of the relevant publications by Bohr himself.
