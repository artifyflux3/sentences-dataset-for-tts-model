The site is well respected and has been used as a reference by professional paleontologists such as Michael J. Benton , the professor of vertebrate palaeontology in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.

[ 1 ] It is frequently cited in Science Online.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Palaeos.com was started by Toby White and Alan Kazlev; [ 5 ] the pair were later joined by Chris Taylor, Mikko Haaramo of the Department of Geology at the University of Helsinki, and Chris Clowes. It features professional-level, yet readable articles about: [ 6 ] Palaeontology , evolution and systematics Geochronology , earth systems and time scale Diversity of life and ecology The site's developers have started a wiki , Palaeos.org , which uses MediaWiki software to provide conventional voluntary membership.
