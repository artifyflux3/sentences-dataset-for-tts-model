Researchers in this field also study how elemental fluxes are exchanged through interactions between the atmosphere , the earth or soil (terrestrial interactions) and bodies of water (aquatic interactions).

Work in the field of aqueous geochemistry has also studied the prevalence of rare earth elements , [ 1 ] nuclear waste products, [ 2 ] and hydrocarbons .
