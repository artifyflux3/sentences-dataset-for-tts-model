List of minor planets visited by spacecraft [ edit ] A total of 19 minor planets ( asteroids , dwarf planets , and Kuiper belt objects) have been visited by space probes .

Moons (not directly orbiting the Sun) and planets are not minor planets and thus are not included in the table below.

[ 19 ] As of early 2014 it was calculated to pass as close as 0.00087 AU (130,000 km; 81,000 mi).

[ 19 ] This was so close that the event was deemed dangerous to spacecraft in orbit around Mars.

[ 20 ] Spacecraft that were active at that time included 2001 Mars Odyssey , Mars Express , MAVEN , Mars Orbiter Mission , and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in Mars orbit – and two on the surface – Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity .
