At 17,075,400 square kilometres (6,592,850 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world , covering more than a ninth of Earth 's landmass. In the times of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, the country's share in the world's landmass reached 1/6. Most of these territories were first discovered by Russian explorers (if indigenous peoples of inhabited territories are not counted). Contiguous exploration in Eurasia and the building of overseas colonies in Russian America were some of the primary factors in Russian territorial expansion.

Apart from their discoveries in Alaska , Central Asia , Siberia , and the northern areas surrounding the North Pole , Russian explorers have made significant contributions to the exploration of the Antarctic , Arctic , and the Pacific islands , as well as deep-sea and space explorations.

Having organised a major Second Kamchatka expedition , Bering and Aleksei Chirikov sailed from Okhotsk in 1740 aboard Sv. Piotr and Sv. Pavel , founded Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky , and headed together to North America in 1741, until separated by storm. Bering discovered the southern coast of Alaska , landed near Kayak Island and discovered the Aleutian Islands . Chirikov discovered the shores of America near Aleksander Archipelago and safely returned to Asia. Bering, however, became very ill and his ship was driven to an uninhabited follow-up Bering Island of the Commander group. Bering died there, along with part of his crew. The rest built a vessel out of the wreckage of Sv. Piotr and escaped to Petropavlovsk.

In 1912–14 he led an expedition on the brig St.Anna , which aimed to travel by the Northern Sea Route from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

St.Anna became icebound west of Yamal Peninsula and drifted to the North Pole in 1913. Brusilov became ill and many of the crew succumbed to scurvy. In 1914 a group led by lieutenant Valerian Albanov abandoned the ship and walked south over the drifting ice. Only Albanov and Alexander Konrad managed to reach Franz Joseph Land , where they were rescued by Georgy Sedov 's St. Foka . The efforts to find the St. Anna were unsuccessful.

He was the first to make a thorough geographical survey of the Nordenskiöld Archipelago , exploring it on dogsled and discovering and naming 40 of its islands. Subsequently, Toll and Matisen led Zarya across the Laptev Sea to the New Siberian Islands . The ship was trapped in fast ice, and Toll and three companions went in search of the elusive Sannikov Land on foot and kayaks, and were lost. When Zarya became able to set sail, Matisen made for the Lena River delta.

In 1843–45 he pioneered the scientific exploration of the Taimyr Peninsula and discovered the Putorana Plateau on Central Siberian Plateau . Then he traveled along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and entered the lower Amur River valley. He studied the ethnography of Siberian peoples, and the climate, animals and plants of Siberia. He was a founder of permafrost science and the Vice President of the Russian Geographical Society . He determined the southern border of the permafrost and explained the high sinuosity of the northern boundary of the taiga zone. In 1870 he accompanied Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich to Novaya Zemlya and discovered the North Cape sea current (a part of the Norwegian Current ). In 1870 he also explored the Baraba steppe , and in 1878 he travelled in Fergana Valley .

One of the earliest followers of Charles Darwin , he was among the first to refute the then prevailing view that the different ' races ' of mankind belonged to different species. He arrived in Sydney in 1878 and organised a zoological centre known as the Marine Biological Station , the first marine biological research institute in Australia. He married a daughter of the Premier of New South Wales , John Robertson , and returned to Russia. Being in poor health after the trip he died, and left his skull to the St. Petersburg Military and Medical Academy.

He wrote the first arithmetics textbook in the Russian language , Arithmologion . He led the Russian diplomatic mission to China in 1675–78, for the first time among Russian ambassadors travelling to Beijing through East Siberia rather than through Mongolia . After his assistant Ignatiy Milovanov (sent beforehand) Milescu was the first known European to cross the Amur River from the north and reach Beijing by that route. Milescu made the first detailed description of Lake Baikal and all the rivers feeding the lake, and he was the first to point out Baikal's unfathomable depth. His travel notes also contain valuable descriptions of major Siberian rivers and the first ever orographic scheme of East Siberia.

In 1639 Kopylov sent Moskvitin in command of 20 Tomsk Cossacks and 29 Krasnoyarsk Cossacks to look for silver ore to the east. Leading the party, Moskvitin became the first Russian to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the Sea of Okhotsk , building a winter camp on its shore at the Ulya River mouth. In 1640 the Cossacks apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea and probably reached the mouth of the Amur River . On their way back they discovered the Shantar Islands . Based on Moskvitin's account, Kurbat Ivanov draw the first Russian map of the Far East in 1642. Moskvitin, presumably a native of Moscow , personally brought the news of the discovery of the eastern ocean to his native city.

In 1733–43 he participated in the Academic Squad of the Great Northern Expedition and traveled extensively through Siberia , studying its geography and peoples. Müller is considered to be one of the fathers of ethnography . He collected vernacular stories and archival documents about Russian explorers of Siberia, including Pyanda , Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov . He was among the first to write a general account of Russian history based on extensive study of documentary sources. He put forth the Normanist theory , a controversial accentuation of the role of Scandinavians and Germans in the history of Russia .

He pursued the Russian exploration and settlement of the territories north of the Amur River . He assisted in the organisation of Gennady Nevelskoy 's expeditions, which led to the Russian presence near Amur estuary and on Sakhalin . In 1854 military troops sailed down the Amur, in 1855 the first settlers reached the river mouth, and in 1856 the city of Blagoveshchensk was founded. In 1858, Muravyov concluded the Treaty of Aigun with China, which recognised the Amur River as a border between the two countries and granted Russia easier access to the Pacific Ocean . The new territories acquired by Russia included Priamurye and most of the territories of modern Primorsky and Khabarovsk Krais . For this achievement Muravyov was granted the title of Count Amursky. The Treaty of Aigun was confirmed and expanded the Convention of Peking of 1860, which granted Russia the right to the Ussuri krai and the south of Primorsky Krai. To defend the new lands Muravyov created the Amur Cossacks corps.

He proved that the Tatar Strait was not a gulf, but indeed a strait, connected to the Amur River 's estuary by a narrow section later called Nevelskoy Strait . Not knowing about the efforts of Japanese navigator Mamiya Rinzo who explored the same area earlier, Nevelskoy's report was taken as the first proof that Sakhalin was indeed an island. In 1850 Nevelskoy founded Nikolayevsk-on-Amur , the first Russian settlement in the lower Amur region. He also founded several military posts on Sakhalin .

He traveled down the Volga River , reached Derbent , then Baku and later Persian Empire by crossing the Caspian Sea , where he lived for a year. In 1469 Nikitin arrived in Ormus and then, crossing the Arabian Sea , reached the sultanate of Bahmani , where he lived for 3 years. On his way back, Nikitin visited the African continent ( Somalia ), Muscat , Trabzon and in 1472 arrived at Feodosiya by crossing the Black Sea . Thus Nikitin became one of the first Europeans to travel to and to document his visit to India. He described his trip in a narrative known as A Journey Beyond the Three Seas , which is a valuable study of the 15th-century India, its social system, government, military (Nikitin witnessed war-games featuring war elephants ), its economy, religion and lifestyles.

In Central Asia he explored the Kara Kum Desert, the shores of the Amu Darya River, and the old riverbeds of the Uzbois . In 1892–94 Obruchev took part in Grigory Potanin 's expedition to Mongolia and North China . He explored the Transbaikal area, Dzhungaria and the Altai Mountains . Having spent half a century in exploring Siberia and Inner Asia, Obruchev summarized his findings in the extensive work The Geology of Siberia . He studied the origins of loess , the ice formation and permafrost , and the tectonics of Siberia. All together, he authored over a thousand scientific works. Obruchev is also known as the author of two popular science fiction novels, Plutonia (1915) and Sannikov Land (1924). These stories, imitating the pattern of Arthur Conan Doyle 's The Lost World , depict in vivid detail the discovery of an isolated world of prehistoric animals in hitherto unexplored large islands in the Arctic.

(?–after 1619) Siberian Cossack, diplomat Petlin was the first Russian to reach China on an official diplomatic mission in 1618–19. His expedition may have been the second European expedition to reach China from the west by an overland route (after that of Bento de Góis ) since the fall of the Yuan Dynasty . Together with Andrey Mundov and 10 other men, Petlin went south up the Ob River , crossed the Abakan Range , went south to Tuva and rounding Uvs Nuur reached the court of the Altan Khan of the Khotgoid . Then they passed through Mongolia to the Great Wall of China and Beijing . He was not allowed to see the Wanli Emperor because of not bringing proper tribute. He brought back a letter in Chinese inviting Russians to open trade, but no one in Russia was able to read it until 1675. An account of Petlin's expedition was translated into English and published in Samuel Purchas 's Pilgrims in 1625, and then translated into other European languages.

There he organized an expedition eastward, and brought in Semyon Dezhnev . In 1648 they sailed down to the Arctic and became the first to pass through the Bering Strait and to discover Chukchi Peninsula and the Bering Sea . All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the Anadyr River . In 1653–54, while fighting with Koryaks near Anadyrsk , Dezhnyov captured Popov's Yakut wife, who confirmed him dead. When Vladimir Atlasov came to conquer Kamchatka in 1697, he heard from the locals about a certain Fedotov , who had lived with his men near Kamchatka River and had married local women – so the Fedotov legend appeared.

G. F. Müller thought Fedotov was Fedot's son, while Stepan Krasheninnikov thought he was Fedot himself, thus deeming Popov to be the possible discoverer of Kamchatka .

Accompanied also by novelist Ivan Goncharov and inventor Alexander Mozhaisky , Posyet explored and mapped the northern coastline of the Sea of Japan , including the follow-up Possiet Bay . In 1856 he carried to Japan the news of the ratification of the Treaty of Shimoda . Possiet's journeys and published observations made him an expert on Japan in Russia. Having become Minister of Ways and Communications, he negotiated the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875) with Enomoto Takeaki , which brought the entire Sakhalin Island into the Russian fold. He prepared the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and was a leading advocate for the restoration of the white-blue-red flag of Russia in 1896.

In 1876 and 1879 Potanin led two expeditions into Mongolia. In 1884–86 Potanin explored Northern China and Tibet , returning to Russia through the Qilian Mountains and Mongolia. He encountered the Salar people and made other ethnographic and geographic discoveries, including the first account of the East and West Uighur languages . In 1989 Potanin became one of the founders of Tomsk University , the first university in Asian Russia . In 1892–93 he again explored Northern China and Sichuan accompanied by geologist Vladimir Obruchev . Before reaching Tibet, Potanin was forced to turn back because of the illness and death of his wife Alexandra, who was the first woman member of the Russian Geographical Society .

He reached the upper Zeya River in the country of the Daur people , who were paying tribute to the Manchu Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became  the first Russian to reach the Amur River . He descended to the Nivkh people country and discovered the mouth of the Amur River from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals they passed, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the Sea of Okhotsk coast to the Ulia River and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by explorer Ivan Moskvitin six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1870–73 he crossed the Gobi desert to Beijing , explored the upper Yangtze River , and crossed into Tibet, surveying over 18,000 km 2 and collecting some 5,000 plant species, 1,000 birds, 3,000 insects, 70 reptiles and the skins of 130 different mammals. In 1876–77, travelling through southern Xinjiang and the Tian Shan range , he visited Lake Lop Nor . In 1879–80 he traveled via Hami City and the Qaidam basin to Lake Koko Nor . Passing over Tian Shan into Tibet, he was 260 km from Lhasa before being turned back by Tibetan officials. In 1883–85 Przhevalsky traveled across Gobi to Alashan and Tian Shan, then back to Koko Nor, and westwards to Lake Issyk Kul . His journeys opened a new era for the study of the geography, fauna and flora of Central Asia. He was the first to report on the wild population of Bactrian camels , to describe the Przewalski's gazelle and the Przewalski's horse (the only extant wild horse ).

Starting his long journey from Turukhansk , in three and a half years from 1620 to 1624 Pyanda passed a total of 8000 km of hitherto unknown large Siberian rivers. He explored some 2300 km of Lower Tunguska (Nizhnyaya Tunguska in the Russian language) and, having reached the upper part of Tunguska, he discovered the great Siberian river Lena and explored some 2400 km of its length. When doing this, he became the first Russian to reach Yakutia and meet the Yakuts . He returned up Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and by land reached Angara . On his way, Pyanda became the first Russian to meet the Buryats . He built new boats and explored some 1400 km of the Angara, finally discovering that the Angara (a Buryat name) and the Upper Tunguska (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as known by Russians) are one and the same river.

(1874–1947) painter, philosopher, archeologist, writer, public figure, traveler Roerich emigrated to the U. S. after the Russian Revolution . By the sale of his paintings and writings, and the gains from the activity of his cultural and enlightener organizations, Roerich was able to collect the finance and lead a major expedition to Central Asia in 1924–28, in which his family, including his wife Helena Roerich , participated. The expedition went through Sikkim , Kashmir , Ladakh , Xinjiang , Siberia, Altai, Mongolia , Tibet , and unstudied areas of the Himalayas . Archeological and ethnographical investigations were conducted, dozens of new mountain peaks and passes were marked on maps, rare manuscripts were found, and some of the best series of Roerich's paintings were created. In 1934–35 Roerich conducted an expedition in Inner Mongolia , Manchuria and China, collecting nearly 300 species of xerophytes, herbs, manuscripts and archeological relics. Roerich was an author and initiator of an international pact for the protection of artistic and academic institutions and historical  sites ( Roerich’s Pact , 1935) and  a founder of an international movement for the defence of culture. He created about 7,000 paintings and founded a number of scientific and cultural institutions in the U. S., Europe and India.

They were summoned there by the Genghisid Khans who had conquered Rus' a few years before. Unlike their father Yaroslav II of Vladimir , who had come into Karakorum in 1245–46 and was poisoned by the Mongols, Alexander and Andrey were able to get back to Rus', confirmed in power by their new overlords. Russian princes were among the first known Europeans to travel so far into Asia, making their journey around the same time as the Italian monk Plano Carpini traveled to Mongolia.

Vladimir Rusanov ‡ (1875–1913?) geologist In 1909–11 Rusanov carried out explorations in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. In 1912 he commanded a government expedition to Svalbard to investigate its coal reserves. They sailed on the small ship Herkules under Captain Alexander Kuchin , Amundsen's South Pole expedition navigator. Concluding the work, part of the expedition returned to Russia, while the rest, without consultation with the authorities, set off with Rusanov in an incredibly rash attempt at reaching the Pacific via the Northern Sea Route , and disappeared in the Kara Sea . The relics of the expedition were found in 1937 in the Kolosovykh Islands . Soviet coal mining on Svalbard began in 1932.

[ 139 ] Named in honor: Vilkitsky Strait , Vilkitsky Island (Kara Sea) , Vilkitsky Island (East Siberian Sea) Severnaya Zemlya Vladimir Vize ‡ (1886–1954) oceanographer In 1912–14 Vize took part in Georgiy Sedov 's expedition to Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land . In 1924 he studied the drift of Georgy Brusilov 's ill-fated ship St. Anna , trapped on pack ice. As a result of this study he predicted the location of the yet unseen Vize Island , based on the analysis of ice movement in the Kara Sea . He took part in the first successful crossing of the Northern Sea Route in a single navigation on the icebreaker Sibiryakov in 1932. In 1938–40 he conducted scientific research on the ice-captured icebreaker Sedov , turned into a drifting ice station .

[ 3 ] Named in honor: Vize Island Vize Island in the Kara Sea Vladimir Voronin ‡ (1890–1952) Soviet Navy captain In 1932 Voronin commanded the expedition of the icebreaker Sibiryakov which made the first successful crossing of the Northern Sea Route in a single navigation without wintering, in 65 days from Archangelsk to Yokohama in Japan. In 1933–34 he commanded the Chelyuskin steamship with the scientific expedition of Otto Schmidt aboard. The ship became ice-bound in the Chukchi Sea , but almost all the crew was rescued by planes from their camp on the ice.

In 1820–24 Wrangel sailed north of the Kolyma River and established that there was an open sea, not dry land, as was previously thought. Together with Fyodor Matyushkin and P. Kuzmin, he described the Medvyezhi Islands and the Arctic coastline from the Indigirka River to the Kolyuchinskaya Bay . After noticing swarms of birds flying north and questioning the native population, he determined that there must be an undiscovered island in the Arctic Ocean . Even though his search for it was unsuccessful the island was later named Wrangel Island . Wrangel led the circumnavigation on the ship Krotky in 1825–27. He was the governor of Russian America in 1829–35, the president of the Russian-American Company in 1840–49 and the Minister of the Navy in 1855–57. In 1845 he became one of the founders of the Russian Geographic Society .

(1842–1894) public figure, archaeologist, turkologist In 1889 Yadrintsev located the remains of the medieval city Hara-Balgas and Genghis Khan 's capital Karakorum in Mongolia . In the valley of the Orkhon River he discovered the Orkhon script of the ancient Türks on two petroglyphic monuments with runiform writing, later decoded by the Danish scientist Vilhelm Thomsen . In 1891 Yadrintsev together with Vasily Radlov found more monuments of Türkic runiform writing.

[ 142 ] A stone turtle in Karakorum , Mongolia Yermak Timofeyevich * (1532/42–1585) Cossack ataman, folk hero Around 1577, the merchants Stroganovs , who were the main colonisers of the Urals , hired Yermak to protect their lands from attacks by the Siberian Khan Kuchum . The Russians planned to attack Kuchum in his own land, and in 1581 Yermak penetrated into Siberia. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's Cossacks defeated Kuchum's main forces on the Irtysh River in a 3-day Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582, forcing them to retreat to the steppes. Thus Yermak captured the Siberia Khanate , including its capital Qashliq near modern Tobolsk . Kuchum was still strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ( Irtysh 's tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own chain mail armor. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored the main river routes of West Siberian Plain , the Russians successfully recaptured all Yermak's conquests just a few years later.

He explored and mapped the Yukon , Kuskokwim , Innoko and Koyukuk Rivers , and researched the native peoples and nature of the region. He published the first detailed description of the inner areas of Alaska .

After 1840, during his service for the Russian-American Company in the Okhotsk Sea , Zavoyko explored the estuary of the Amur River . His reports led to further expeditions and ultimately the incorporation of Primorsky Krai into Russia. In 1854, at the time of Crimean War , Zavoyko led the successful defence of Kamchatka during the Siege of Petropavlovsk . He repelled the superior allied British-French forces and even captured the Union Jack . In 1855, making his way through the frozen seas and successfully avoiding the large enemy fleet, he supervised the transfer of the Russian Pacific Fleet from Petropavlovsk to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur .
