( March 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A bacterial lawn used in antibiotic resistance testing.

Bacterial lawn is a term used by microbiologists to describe the appearance of bacterial colonies when all the individual colonies on a Petri dish or agar plate merge to form a field or mat of bacteria. Bacterial lawns find use in screens for antibiotic resistance and bacteriophage titering.

Bacterial lawns (often of Serratia marcescens )  are also used extensively when as an assay method when using bacteriophage as tracers in studies of groundwater flow.

Although occasionally used as a synonym for biofilm , the term primarily applies to the simple, clonal, unstructured mats of organisms that typically only form on laboratory growth media. Biofilms—the aggregated form of microorganisms most commonly found in nature — are generally more complex and diverse and marked by larger quantities of extracellular structural matrix relative to the cellular biomass .

Techniques [ edit ] Bacterial lawns can be produced manually by evenly spreading a high amount of bacteria onto an agar plate using a sterile cotton swab or a Drigalski spatula . Alternatively an automated machine can be used such as a spiral plater where the plate is rotated and the sample is spread evenly using an automated dispenser.

They may also be produced using the "pour plate" technique [ 1 ] in which a concentrated inoculum of the appropriate bacteria are mixed with melted agar and spread evenly over the surface of a Petri dish.
