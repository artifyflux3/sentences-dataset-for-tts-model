For two lines AD and BC that intersect each other at P and for which A , B , C , D all lie on the same circle, the following equation holds: | P A | ⋅ ⋅ | P D | = | P B | ⋅ ⋅ | P C | {\displaystyle |PA|\cdot |PD|=|PB|\cdot |PC|} The theorem follows directly from the fact that the triangles △ PAC and △ PBD are similar . They share ∠ DPC and ∠ ADB = ∠ ACB as they are inscribed angles over AB . The similarity yields an equation for ratios which is equivalent to the equation of the theorem given above: P A P C = P B P D ⇔ ⇔ | P A | ⋅ ⋅ | P D | = | P B | ⋅ ⋅ | P C | {\displaystyle {\frac {PA}{PC}}={\frac {PB}{PD}}\Leftrightarrow |PA|\cdot |PD|=|PB|\cdot |PC|} Next to the intersecting chords theorem and the tangent-secant theorem , the intersecting secants theorem represents one of the three basic cases of a more general theorem about two intersecting lines and a circle - the power of point theorem .
