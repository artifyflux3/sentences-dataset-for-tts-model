For the [Korean language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"), South Korea mainly uses a combination of East Asian and European punctuation, while North Korea uses more of the East Asian punctuation style.

Traditional punctuation
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korean_punctuation&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Traditional punctuation")]

In the traditional Korean system of writing, which was largely based on the Chinese writing system, punctuation was primarily used to make corrections or to help with the understanding of [hanja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja "Hanja"), or Chinese characters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:0-1) Some of the corrective punctuation marks included ⟨◦⟩ called 끼움표 (_kki-umpyo_), which was used for inserting, and ⟨▯⟩ called 삭제부 (_sakjebu_) which was used for deleting.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:0-1) The traditional writing system known as [gugyeol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gugyeol "Gugyeol"), used punctuation to interpret Chinese characters in a way Korean speakers could understand.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-3) One of the marks used in [gugyeol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gugyeol "Gugyeol") was a dot ⟨•⟩ called 역독점 (_yeokdokjeom_), which was used to indicate reading order.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:0-1) The conclusion of an idea or thought was indicated by starting a new line of characters from the top, as opposed to the western style punctuation of periods and commas which had not been introduced yet.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:1-4)

The modern Korean punctuation system is largely based on European punctuation, with the use of periods (마침표, _machimpyo_), commas (쉼표, _swimpyo_), and question marks (물음표, _mul-eumpyo_).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:1-4)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:0-1) Modern Korean is typically written horizontally using European punctuation. However, when it is written vertically, Korean writing tends to follow East Asian punctuation which includes ⟨。⟩ (고리점, _goricheom_) as a period, ⟨、⟩ (모점, _mocheom_) as a comma, and ⟨_『...』_⟩ (겹낫표, _gyeomnatpyo_) as quotation marks.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-:0-1)

Differences from European punctuation
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korean_punctuation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Differences from European punctuation")]

*   Although commas are also used, especially in a digital environment due to the ease of typing, the [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") ⟨_·_⟩ is used for short in-line lists: "사과·배·복숭아·수박은 모두 과일이다." Translation: "Apples, [pears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashi_Pear "Nashi Pear"), peaches, and watermelons are all fruits."
*   Although the correct way to quote[_[according to whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] is to use double quotation marks in [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), and [guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemets "Guillemets") in [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), fullwidth quotes such as _『...』_ or _「...」_ are mostly used when it is written in vertical writing, for effective expression, or just to replace European quotation marks.
*   Many ancient Korean books contain thousands of words with no spaces between them, but when explicitly denoting a pause or break was necessary, _[judou](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8F%A5%E8%AE%80 "wikt:句讀")_ marks such as "_[。](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%80%82 "wikt:。")_" and "_[、](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%80%81 "wikt:、")_" were used.
*   Since Korean is [agglutinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language "Agglutinative language"), the rules regarding parentheses and spacing are different from European ones. For example, in the sentence "사과(沙果)는 과일이다", inserting a space in between other letters and the parentheses will be an error, as 는 marks 사과 (apple) as the topic and is not a separate word.
*   The [wave dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_dash "Wave dash") ⟨_~_⟩ is used to mark ranges in numbers: _1~10_ (일에서 십, one to ten). However, normal [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") is also permitted.
*   The tilde may also be used to indicate a long or drawn-out vowel (그렇구나~ or 랄랄라~), usually for comic or [cute effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyo "Aegyo").
*   Certain European punctuation marks, like the apostrophe, colon/semi-colon, and dash are not typically used in written Korean.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_punctuation#cite_note-5)

North-South differences
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korean_punctuation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: North-South differences")]

In the North, [guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet "Guillemet")_《_ and _》_ are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks are equivalent to the English ones. _『 』_ and _「 」_, are standard, although _“_, _”_, _“_, and _”_ are commonly used.
