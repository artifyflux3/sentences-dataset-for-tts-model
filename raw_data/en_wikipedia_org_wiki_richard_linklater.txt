Occupation(s) Film director, producer, screenwriter Years active 1985–present [ 1 ] Spouse Christina Harrison Children 3, including Lorelei Awards Full list Website detourfilm .com Richard Linklater ( / ˈ l ɪ n k l eɪ t ər / ; born July 30, 1960) is an American filmmaker. He is known for making films that deal thematically with suburban culture and the effects of the passage of time . In 2015, Linklater was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world .

[ 2 ] His films include the comedies Slacker (1990) and Dazed and Confused (1993); the romance films Before trilogy (1995–2013); the music-themed comedy School of Rock (2003); the adult animated films Waking Life (2001), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood (2022); the coming-of-age drama Boyhood (2014); the comedy film Everybody Wants Some!!

(2016); the action romantic comedy Hit Man (2023); the biographical film Blue Moon (2025); and the comedy-drama Nouvelle Vague (2025).

Many of Linklater's films are noted for their loosely structured narratives. The Before trilogy and Boyhood both feature the same actors filmed over an extended period of years. He has received five Academy Award nominations and won the Silver Bear for Best Director for Before Sunrise . He also won a Golden Globe Award for directing Boyhood .

Early life [ edit ] Linklater was born in Houston, Texas .

[ 3 ] He attended Huntsville High School in Huntsville, Texas , during grades 9–11, where he played football for Joe Clements as a backup quarterback for the #1 ranked team in the state. For his senior year, he moved to Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Texas , because he was better at baseball than football and Bellaire had a better baseball coach. As a teen he won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Linklater studied at Sam Houston State University (where he also played baseball), [ 6 ] until dropping out to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico .

He frequently read novels on the rig, and upon returning to land, developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory cinema in Houston. At this point, Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. He used his savings to buy a Super-8 camera, a projector, and editing equipment, and moved to Austin, Texas .

Find sources: "Richard Linklater" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 1985–1999: Early directing [ edit ] Linklater founded the Austin Film Society in 1985 with his college professor Chale Nafus, University of Texas professor Charles Ramirez-Berg, SXSW founder Louis Black , and his frequent collaborator Lee Daniel . One of the mentors for the Film Society was former New York City critic for the SoHo Weekly News George Morris, who had relocated to Austin and taught film there. For several years, Linklater made many short films that were exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature, It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (which is available in The Criterion Collection edition of his second feature, Slacker ), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit. Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (a homage to the 1945 low budget film noir by Edgar G. Ulmer ), and subsequently made Slacker for only $23,000. It went on to gross more than $1.25 million. The film shows an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.

While gaining a cult following in the independent film world, he made his third film, Dazed and Confused , based on his years at Huntsville High School and the people he encountered there. The film garnered critical praise and grossed $8 million in the United States while becoming a hit on VHS. This film was also responsible for the breakout of fellow Texas native Matthew McConaughey . In 1995, Linklater won the Silver Bear for Best Director for the film Before Sunrise at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival .

[ 8 ] His next feature, subUrbia , had mixed reviews critically, and did very poorly at the box office. In 1998, he took on his first Hollywood feature, The Newton Boys , which received mixed reviews while tanking at the box office.

2000–2013: Wider recognition [ edit ] With the rotoscope films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly , and his mainstream comedies, School of Rock and the remake of Bad News Bears , he gained wider recognition. In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot for HBO with Rodney Rothman called $5.15/hr , about several minimum wage restaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined in Fast Food Nation . The British television network Channel 4 produced a documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films.

St Richard of Austin was presented by Ben Lewis and directed by Irshad Ashraf and broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK.

Linklater was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his film Before Sunset .

Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly both used rotoscoping animation techniques. Working with Bob Sabiston and Sabiston's program Rotoshop to create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies completely as live-action features, then employed a team of artists to "trace over" individual frames. The result is a distinctive "semi-real" quality, praised by such critics as Roger Ebert (in the case of Waking Life ) as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.

Fast Food Nation (2006) is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was entered into the 2006 Cannes Film Festival [ 9 ] before being released in North America on November 17, 2006, and in Europe on March 23, 2007. The film received mixed reviews. Linklater fared better with the critics with A Scanner Darkly (released in the same year), Me and Orson Welles (2009), and Bernie (2011).

[ 10 ] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Before Midnight , the third film in the Before...

trilogy.

[ 11 ] 2014–present: Boyhood and other works [ edit ] In 2014 he released the film Boyhood , which had been 12 years in the making.

[ 12 ] Boyhood received overwhelming critical acclaim. Linklater won the Golden Globes , Critics' Choice Movie Awards , and BAFTAs for Best Director and Best Picture. He also received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director , along with nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture . For a while Linklater was attached to direct a remake of The Incredible Mr. Limpet for Warner Bros.

[ 13 ] However, he dropped the project in favor of working on a spiritual successor to Dazed and Confused , titled Everybody Wants Some!!

, [ 13 ] with backing from Annapurna Pictures and Paramount distributing the film in North America.

[ 14 ] The film was released in March 2016 and was well received by critics, but it failed to recoup its budget of 10 million dollars, grossing only 4.6 million.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In the second half of the 2010s, Linklater wrote and directed the drama film Last Flag Flying , starring Bryan Cranston , Laurence Fishburne , and Steve Carell . A sequel to Hal Ashby 's 1973 film The Last Detail , it began filming in November 2016, and was released on November 3, 2017.

[ 17 ] Linklater then directed Where'd You Go, Bernadette , based on the novel by Maria Semple and produced by Annapurna Pictures .

[ 18 ] Linklater was attached to direct an adaptation of Graeme Simsion 's novel The Rosie Project that would have starred Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role, but he dropped out of directing when Lawrence dropped out of the project.

[ 19 ] In 2019, it was announced that Linklater would be filming an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim 's musical Merrily We Roll Along . Like Boyhood , it will be filmed over the course of several years, but, like the musical and the play it is based on , will be presented in reverse chronology .

[ 20 ] In 2024, Linklater directed an episode of God Save Texas for HBO , focusing on the prison industrial complex in Huntsville, Texas .

[ 21 ] He directed the action romantic comedy Hit Man starring Glen Powell and Adria Arjona . The film premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival in 2023 where it received critical acclaim and was picked up for distribution by Netflix and released in 2024.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] The following year he directed the biographical film Blue Moon revolving around Lorenz Hart and the opening night of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's musical Oklahoma!

which starred Ethan Hawke , Andrew Scott , and Margaret Qualley .

[ 24 ] The film premiered at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival to positive reviews.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] That same year his film, Nouvelle Vague about the shooting of the French New Wave film Breathless directed by Jean-Luc Goddard , premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival .

[ 27 ] Style and influences [ edit ] Inspiration for Linklater's work was largely based on his experience viewing the film Raging Bull .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] It made me see movies as a potential outlet for what I was thinking about and hoping to express. At that point I was an unformed artist. At that moment, something was simmering in me, but Raging Bull brought it to a boil.

[ 30 ] He was also influenced by Robert Bresson , Yasujirō Ozu , Rainer Werner Fassbinder , Eric Rohmer , François Truffaut , Josef Von Sternberg , and Carl Theodor Dreyer .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Many of Linklater's films, including Slacker , Dazed and Confused , Tape , and all three installments of the Before Trilogy , take place in a single day. They are less plot-driven and more about human interactions.

[ 33 ] Personal life [ edit ] Linklater lives in Austin, Texas , and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time.

Linklater has been partnered with Christina Harrison since the 1990s.

[ 34 ] In 1994 they had a daughter, and twin girls in 2004. The oldest, Lorelei Linklater , co-starred in Boyhood as the sister of the main character.

Linklater has been a vegetarian since his early 20s.

[ 35 ] In 2015, he explained the dietary lifestyle in a Boyhood -style documentary for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
