The Z4 was replaced by ERMETH , a computer developed at the ETH in Switzerland from 1953 to 1956, one of the first electronic computers on the European continent.

Oct 1950 UK Turing Test – The British mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing published a paper describing the potential development of human and computer intelligence and communication. The paper would come later to be called the Turing Test.

1950 US TIME magazine cover story on the Harvard " Mark III : Can man build a superman?" includes a quote from Howard Aiken , commenting on "calculators" (computers) then under construction: "We'll have to think up bigger problems if we want to keep them busy." 30 Mar 1951 US The first commercially successful electronic computer, UNIVAC , was also the first general-purpose computer – designed to handle both numeric and textual information. Designed by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly , whose corporation subsequently passed to Remington Rand . The implementation of this machine marked the real beginning of the computer era. Remington Rand delivered the first UNIVAC machine to the U.S. Bureau of Census. This machine used magnetic tape for input.

21 Apr 1951 US Whirlwind , the first real-time computer was built at MIT by the team of Jay Forrester for the US Air Defense System, became operational.

This computer is the first to allow interactive computing , allowing users to interact with it using a keyboard and a cathode-ray tube. The Whirlwind design was later developed into SAGE , a comprehensive system of real-time computers used for early warning of air attacks.

17 Nov 1951 UK J. Lyons, a United Kingdom food company, famous for its tea, made history by running the first business application on an electronic computer. A payroll system was run on Lyons Electronic Office (LEO) a computer system designed by Maurice Wilkes who had previously worked on EDSAC .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] 1964 US Computers built between 1964 and 1972 are often regarded as third-generation computers; they are based on the first integrated circuits – creating even smaller machines. Typical of such machines were the HP 2116A and Data General Nova .

1964 US Programming language PL/I released by IBM.

1964 US Launch of IBM System/360 – the first series of compatible computers, reversing and stopping the evolution of separate "business" and "scientific" machine architectures; all models used the same basic instruction set architecture and register sizes, in theory allowing programs to be migrated to more or less powerful models as needs changed. The basic unit of memory, the "byte", was defined as 8 bits, with larger units such as "words" defined with sizes that were multiples of 8 bits, with many consequences. Many competing computers at the time used word sizes that were multiples of 6 bits. The marketing term "IBM Compatible" was often used, at this time, to indicate that the architecture used 8-bit bytes. Over 14,000 were shipped by 1968.

1964 US Project MAC begun at MIT by J.C.R. Licklider : several terminals all across campus will be connected to a central computer, using a timesharing mechanism.

Bulletin boards and email are popular applications.

1964 US Sabre launched.

[ 20 ] 1965 US DEC PDP-8 Mini Computer was released. It was the first minicomputer, built by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It cost US$18,500 (equivalent to about $184,600 in 2024).

It and its clones (such as Linux ) are still widely used on network servers and scientific workstations. Originally developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie .

7 Apr 1969 US The first Request for Comments , RFC 1 was published by Steve Crocker . The RFCs (network working group , Request For Comment) are a series of papers which are used to develop and define protocols for networking; originally the basis for ARPANET, there are now thousands of them applying to all aspects of the Internet . Collectively they document everything about the way the Internet and computers on it should behave, such as TCP/IP networking or how email headers should be written.

1969 ?

Introduction of the RS-232 (serial interface) standard by EIA ( Electronic Industries Association ), one of the oldest serial interfaces still (uncommonly) in use today.

1969 US Data General shipped a total of 50,000 Novas at US$8,000 each. The Nova was one of the first 16-bit minicomputers.

1972 ?

Computers built after 1972 are often called fourth-generation computers, based on LSI ( Large Scale Integration ) of circuits (such as microprocessors) – typically 500 or more components on a chip. Later developments include VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) of integrated circuits 5 years later – typically 10,000 components. The fourth generation is generally viewed as running right up until the present, [ when?

] since although computing power has increased the basic technology has remained virtually the same.

1972 US Programming language C developed at The Bell Laboratories in the US.

Dennis Ritchie, one of the inventors of the Unix operating system, simplifies BCPL into a language he calls B, then iterates B into C. It is a very popular language, especially for systems programming – as it is flexible and fast. C was considered a refreshing change in the computing field because it helped introduce structured programming . Inspired by C, C++ , was introduced in the 1980s, and in turn helped usher in the era of object-oriented programming .

1972 US Hewlett-Packard releases the HP-35 , the first handheld scientific calculator. This makes the engineer's slide rule obsolete.

1 Apr 1972 US The first commercial 8-bit microprocessor , the 8008 , is released by Intel.

SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL\1130.

[ 36 ] Because it was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single-user computer, PC Magazine in 1983 designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer".

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The prototype is in the Smithsonian Institution .

1 Apr 1974 US Introduction of the Intel 8080 . It ran at a clock frequency of 2 MHz and did 0.64 MIPS .

1974 US Motorola announces the MC 6800 8-bit microprocessor. It is easier to implement than the 8080 because it only needs a single power supply to operate and does not need support chips. Unlike the 8080 it is sold not as much as a general-purpose "number cruncher / computer" CPU but more as a control processor for industrial control and as a peripheral processor.

1974 US Engineers Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch leave Motorola after completing work on the 6800 CPU and join MOS Technology .

1975 Italy Olivetti released the personal computer Olivetti P6060 , the first with an integrated floppy disk drive. It was designed by Pier Giorgio Perotto .

9 Oct 1974 UK ICL launches its New Range of mainframes, the ICL 2900 Series .

1975 US The MITS Altair 8800 , the first commercially successful hobby computer, is released. An article in Popular Electronics (January 1975), described the computer and invited people to order kits. Despite the limited processing power, input/output system ( blinkenlights and toggle switches) and memory (256 bytes), around 200 were ordered on the first day. 10,000 units were eventually shipped at a kit price of US$397 each. Numerous companies produced clones based on the "S-100 bus" (the Altair's main bus).

1975 US First microcomputer implementation of BASIC by Bill Gates and Paul Allen . It was written for the MITS Altair. This led to the formation of Microsoft later in the year.

1975 US Formation of Microsoft by Bill Gates and Paul Allen .

1975 US MOS Technology releases their 6501 CPU. which is pin-compatible with Motorola's 6800 , who soon starts a lawsuit against them. The 6501 is quickly withdrawn from sale and replaced with the 6502 which has a "lawsuit-compatible" [ note 1 ] design, but is otherwise nearly identical to the 6501. The 6502 becomes one of the most popular CPUs for the next 10 years and is used in many computers and game consoles (most notably the Atari 2600 , Apple II , Commodore PET , VIC-20 , Commodore 64 , BBC Micro , and Nintendo Entertainment System ).

1976 US Z80 chip released by Zilog. It was a superset of the 8080 chip with additional registers and instructions, and using only one power supply voltage.

CP/M was originally written for the 8080, but many implementations used the Z80. The Z80 was the processor for home computers like the Tandy TRS-80 of 1977, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum of 1982 and many others.

1976 US MOS Technology introduces the KIM-1 microcomputer system as a demonstrator for its 6502 CPU.

1976 US Cray-1 supercomputer was invented by Seymour Cray . He left Control Data in 1972 to form his own company.

Then in June 1966, Davies wrote a second internal paper, "Proposal for a Digital Communication Network" In which he coined the word packet,- a small sub part of the message the user wants to send, and also introduced the concept of an "Interface computer" to sit between the user equipment and the packet network.

The set of algorithms, equations and arcane mathematics that make up public key cryptography are a crucial technology for preserving computer privacy in and making commerce possible on the Internet. Some hail its discovery as one of the most important accomplishments of 20th-century mathematics because it allows two people to set up a secure phone call without meeting beforehand. Without it, there would be no privacy in cyberspace.
