The **degree symbol** or **degree sign**, **°**, is a [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") or [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") that is used, among other things, to represent [degrees of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") (e.g. in [geographic coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system "Geographic coordinate system")), hours (in the medical field), [degrees of temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(temperature) "Degree (temperature)") or [alcohol proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof "Alcohol proof"). The symbol consists of a small [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript") circle.

The word [degree](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/degree "wikt:degree") is equivalent to Latin [gradus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gradus "wikt:gradus") which, since the medieval period, could refer to any stage in a graded system of ranks or steps. The number of the rank in question was indicated by [ordinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number"), in [abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigla "Sigla") with the [ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator "Ordinal indicator") (a superscript letter ⟨o⟩).

Use of "degree" specifically for the degrees of arc, used in conjunction with Arabic numerals, became common in the 16th century, but this was initially without the use of an ordinal marker or degree symbol: instead, various abbreviation of _gradus_ (e.g., Gra., Gr., gr., G.).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-1) The modern notation appears in print in the 1570s, with a borderline example by [Jacques Pelletier du Mans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Pelletier_du_Mans "Jacques Pelletier du Mans") in 1569, and was popularized by, among others, [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"), but didn't become universal.

Similarly, the introduction of the [temperature scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_scale "Temperature scale") with degrees in the 18th century was at first without such symbols, but with the word "gradus" spelled out. Use of the degree symbol was introduced for temperature in the later 18th century and became widespread in the early 19th century. [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") in his "Opuscules physiques et chymiques" (1774) used the [masculine ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine_ordinal_indicator "Masculine ordinal indicator") with Arabic numerals – for example, when he wrote in the introduction:

_... une suite d'Expériences [...] 1º. sur l'existence du même fluide élastique [...]_ ([p. vi](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Lavoisier_-_Opuscules_physiques_et_chimiques.djvu&page=14p.))(... a series of experiments [...] firstly, on the existence of that same elastic fluid [...])
The 1º. is to be read as _primo_ meaning "in the first place", followed by 2º. (_secundo_, "in the second place"), etc. In the same work, when Lavoisier gives a temperature, he spells out the word "degree" explicitly.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-2)

An early use of the degree symbol for temperature is that by [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish") in 1776 for degrees of the [Fahrenheit scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_scale "Fahrenheit scale").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-3)

The symbol is also declared as a notation for degrees of arc as early as 1831, in an American mathematics textbook for schools.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-4)

In the case of degrees of [angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle")[arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(geometry) "Arc (geometry)"), the degree symbol follows the number without any intervening [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)"), e.g. 30°. The addition of [minute and second of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc") follows the degree units, with intervening spaces (optionally, [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space")) between the sexagesimal [degree subdivisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#Subdivisions "Degree (angle)") but no spaces between the numbers and units, for example 30°12′5″.

In the case of degrees of [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), three scientific and engineering standards bodies (the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures"), the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") and the [U.S. Government Printing Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Government_Printing_Office "U.S. Government Printing Office")) prescribe printing temperatures with a space between the number and the degree symbol, e.g. 10°C.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-6) However, in many works with professional typesetting, including scientific works published by the [University of Chicago Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Press "University of Chicago Press") or [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press"), the degree symbol is printed with no spaces between the number, the symbol, and the Latin letters "C" or "F" representing [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius "Celsius") or [Fahrenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit "Fahrenheit"), respectively, e.g. 10°C.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-8) This is also the practice of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-9) Both [ASTM International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTM_International "ASTM International") and [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology"), the official US entities related to the standardization of the use of units, require a space between the numerical value and the unit designator,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol#cite_note-10) except when the degree symbol alone is used to denote an angular value.

Use of the degree symbol to refer to temperatures measured in [kelvins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") (symbol: K) was abolished in 1967 by the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures ([CGPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGPM "CGPM")). Therefore, the triple point of water, for instance, is written simply as 273.16 K. The name of the SI unit of temperature is now "kelvin", in lower case, and no longer "degrees Kelvin".

In [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography "Photography"), the symbol is used to denote [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale "Logarithmic scale")[film speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed "Film speed") grades. In this usage, it follows the number without spacing as in [21°DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21%C2%B0_DIN "21° DIN"), [5°ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5%C2%B0_ASA "5° ASA") or [ISO 100/21°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_100/21%C2%B0 "ISO 100/21°").

The degree symbol is included in Unicode as U+00B0°DEGREE SIGN (&deg;).

For use with [wide character fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms "Halfwidth and fullwidth forms"), there are also code points for U+2103℃DEGREE CELSIUS and U+2109℉DEGREE FAHRENHEIT.

The degree sign was not included in the basic 7-bit [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") set of 1963. In 1987, the [ISO/IEC 8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 "ISO/IEC 8859") standard introduced it at position 0xB0 (176 decimal) in all variants except Part 5 (Cyrillic), 6 (Arabic), 7 (Greek) and 11 (Thai). In 1991, the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") standard incorporated all of the ISO/IEC 8859 code points and thus included the degree sign (at U+00B0)..

The [Windows Code Page 1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 "Windows-1252") was an extension of [ISO/IEC 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1 "ISO/IEC 8859-1") (8859 Part 1 or "ISO Latin-1") standard, so it had the degree sign at the same code point, 0xB0. The code point in the older DOS [Code Page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP437 "CP437") was 0xF8 (248 decimal); therefore, the [Alt code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code "Alt code") used to enter the symbol directly from the keyboard is Alt+2 4 8.

Some computer keyboard layouts, such as the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") layout as used in Italy, the [QWERTZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTZ "QWERTZ") layout as used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the [AZERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY "AZERTY") layout as used in France and Belgium, have the degree symbol available directly on a key. But the common keyboard layouts in English-speaking countries do not include the degree sign, which then has to be input some other way. The method of inputting depends on the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") and [keyboard mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_mapping "Keyboard mapping") being used.
