[ 1 ] His work focuses on geometric and topological problems in dimension 3.

Biography [ edit ] Hass received his Ph.D.

from the University of California, Berkeley in 1981 under the supervision of Robion Kirby .

[ 2 ] He joined the Davis faculty in 1988.

[ 1 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 3 ] From 2010 to 2014 he served as the chair of the UC Davis mathematics department.

[ 4 ] Research contributions [ edit ] Hass is known for proving the equal-volume special case of the double bubble conjecture , [ 5 ] for proving that the unknotting problem is in NP , [ 6 ] and for giving an exponential bound on the number of Reidemeister moves needed to reduce the unknot to a circle.
