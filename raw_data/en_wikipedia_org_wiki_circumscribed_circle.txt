Such a circle is said to circumscribe the points or a polygon formed from them; such a polygon is said to be inscribed in the circle.

Circumcircle , the circumscribed circle of a triangle, which always exists for a given triangle.

Cyclic polygon , a general polygon that can be circumscribed by a circle. The vertices of this polygon are concyclic points . All triangles are cyclic polygons.

Cyclic quadrilateral , a special case of a cyclic polygon.

See also [ edit ] Smallest-circle problem , the related problem of finding the circle with minimal radius containing an arbitrary set of points, not necessarily passing through them.
