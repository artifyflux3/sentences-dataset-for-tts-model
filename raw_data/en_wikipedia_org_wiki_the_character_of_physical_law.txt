The Character of Physical Law First edition Author Richard Feynman Language English Subject Physics Genre Non-fiction Published 1965 ( BBC ) Publication place United States Pages 173 pp.

ISBN 0679601279 LC Class QC71 .F44 Website feynmanlectures .caltech .edu /messenger .html The Character of Physical Law is a series of seven lectures by physicist Richard Feynman concerning the nature of the laws of physics . Feynman delivered the lectures in 1964 at Cornell University , as part of the Messenger Lectures series. The BBC recorded the lectures, and published a book under the same title the following year; [ 1 ] Cornell published the BBC's recordings online in September 2015.

[ 2 ] In 2017 MIT Press published, with a new foreword by Frank Wilczek , a paperback reprint of the 1965 book.

[ 3 ] Topics [ edit ] The lectures covered the following topics: The law of gravitation , an example of physical law The relation of mathematics and physics The great conservation principles Symmetry in physical law The distinction of past and future Probability and uncertainty - the quantum mechanical view of nature Seeking new laws Reception [ edit ] Critical reception has been positive.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The journal The Physics Teacher , in recommending it to both scientists and non-scientists alike, gave The Character of Physical Law a favorable review, writing that although the book was initially intended to supplement the recordings, it was "complete in itself and will appeal to a far wider audience".

[ 6 ] Selections [ edit ] "In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. ...", – Feynman 1965 , p. 156 See also [ edit ] QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter The Feynman Lectures on Physics References [ edit ] ^ Feynman, Richard (1965).
