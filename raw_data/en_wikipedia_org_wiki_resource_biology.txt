Resources can be consumed by one organism and, as a result, become unavailable to another organism.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] For plants key resources are light , nutrients , water, and space to grow. For animals key resources are food, water, and territory .

Key resources for plants [ edit ] Terrestrial plants require particular resources for photosynthesis and to complete their life cycle of germination, growth, reproduction, and dispersal: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Carbon dioxide Microsite (ecology) Nutrients Pollination Seed dispersal Soil Water Key resources for animals [ edit ] Animals require particular resources for metabolism and to complete their life cycle of gestation, birth, growth, and reproduction: [ 6 ] Foraging Territory Water Resources and ecological processes [ edit ] Resource availability plays a central role in ecological processes: Carrying capacity Biological competition Liebig's law of the minimum Niche differentiation See also [ edit ] Abiotic component Biotic component Community ecology Ecology Population ecology Plant ecology size-asymmetric competition References [ edit ] ^ Miller, G.; Spoolman, Scott (2012).
