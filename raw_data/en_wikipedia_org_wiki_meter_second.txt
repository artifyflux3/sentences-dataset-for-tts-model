Integrals and derivatives of displacement, including absement, as well as integrals and derivatives of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), including [actergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actergy "Actergy"). (Janzen et al. 2014)

In [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), **absement** (or **absition**) is a measure of sustained [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") of an object from its initial [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)"), i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. The word _absement_ is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau "Portmanteau") of the words _absence_ and _displacement_. Similarly, its [synonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym "Synonym")_absition_ is a portmanteau of the words _absence_ and _position_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-mann2006-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-2)

Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-[integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") of the displacement[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-PWTMG-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-Jeltsema-4) (i.e. absement is the area under a displacement vs. time graph), so the displacement is the rate of change (first time-[derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative")) of the absement. The [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") of absement is [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") multiplied by [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics"). Its [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit") is **meter second** (m·s), which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1 meter for 1 second. This is not to be confused with a [meter per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second "Meter per second") (m/s), a unit of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), the time-derivative of position.

For example, opening the gate of a gate valve (of rectangular cross section) by 1 mm for 10 seconds yields the same absement of 10 mm·s as opening it by 5 mm for 2 seconds. The amount of water having flowed through it is linearly proportional to the absement of the gate, so it is also the same in both cases.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-5)

Occurrence in nature
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absement&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Occurrence in nature")]

Whenever the rate of change f′ of a quantity f is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity f is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel [flow rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate "Volumetric flow rate") is proportional to the position of the throttle lever, then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement.

The first published paper on the topic of absement introduced and motivated it as a way to study flow-based musical instruments, such as the [hydraulophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulophone "Hydraulophone"), to model empirical observations of some hydraulophones in which obstruction of a water jet for a longer period of time resulted in a buildup in [sound level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness "Loudness"), as water accumulates in a [sounding mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sounding_mechanism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sounding mechanism (page does not exist)") (reservoir), up to a certain maximum filling point beyond which the sound level reached a maximum, or fell off (along with a slow decay when a water jet was unblocked).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-mann2006-1) Absement has also been used to model artificial muscles,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-6) as well as for real muscle interaction in a physical fitness context.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-7) Absement has also been used to model human posture.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-8)

As the displacement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), the absement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling some types of memory elements.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-Jeltsema-4)

In addition to modeling fluid flow and for Lagrangian modeling of electric circuits,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-Jeltsema-4) absement is used in physical fitness and kinesiology to model muscle bandwidth, and as a new form of physical fitness training.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-Janzen2014GEM-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-MannGEM2014-10) In this context, it gives rise to a new quantity called _actergy_, which is to energy as energy is to power. Actergy has the same units as action (joule-seconds) but is the time-integral of total energy (time-integral of the Hamiltonian rather than time-integral of the Lagrangian). Just as displacement and its derivatives form kinematics, so do displacement and its integrals form "integral kinematics".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-Janzen2014GEM-9)

Relation to PID controllers
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absement&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Relation to PID controllers")]

[PID controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller "PID controller") are controllers that work on a signal that is proportional to a physical quantity (e.g. displacement, proportional to position) and its integral(s) and derivative(s), thusly defining PID in the context of integrals and derivatives of a position of a control element in the Bratland sense:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-bratland-2014-11)

> depending on the type of sensor inputs, PID controllers can contain gains proportional to position, velocity, acceleration or the time integral of position (absement)…

Example of PID controller:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-bratland-2014-11)

*   P, position;
*   I, absement;
*   D, velocity.

Strain absement is the time-integral of [strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(mechanics) "Strain (mechanics)"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-PWTMG-3) and is used extensively in mechanical systems and memsprings. As Pei et al. describe:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-PWTMG-3)

> ...[but] these newer models deserve deeper study, in part because of a little-studied quantity called absement which allows mem-spring models to display hysteretic response in great abundance.

Absement originally arose in situations involving valves and fluid flow, for which the opening of a valve was by a long, T-shaped handle, which actually varied in angle rather than position. The time-integral of angle is called "anglement" and it is approximately equal or proportional to absement for small angles, because the sine of an angle is approximately equal to the angle for small angles.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-12)

Building on the concept of anglement, Einstein's Lane Method could be used to describe the spatiotemporal trajectory of systems involving rotational motion or angular displacement. Einstein’s Lane Method provides a framework for analyzing the curved paths of rotating objects or systems under the influence of gravitational fields, similar to how general relativity describes the bending of spacetime. This method would use angular displacements (rather than linear positions) as key variables, integrating them over time, much like the time-integral of angle in anglement.

Phase space: Absement and momentement
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absement&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Phase space: Absement and momentement")]

In regard to a conjugate variable for absement, the time-integral of momentum, known as momentement, has been proposed.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-16)

This is consistent with Jeltsema's 2012 treatment with charge and flux as the base units rather than current and voltage.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_second#cite_note-y832-17)
