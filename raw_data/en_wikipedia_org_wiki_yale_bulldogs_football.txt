Yale's football program, founded in 1872, is one of the oldest in the world. Since their founding, the Bulldogs have won 27 national championships , two of the first three Heisman Trophy winners ( Larry Kelley in 1936 and Clint Frank in 1937), 100 consensus All-Americans, 28 College Football Hall of Fame inductees, including the "Father of American Football" Walter Camp , the first professional football player Pudge Heffelfinger , and coaching giants Amos Alonzo Stagg , Howard Jones , Tad Jones and Carmen Cozza . With over 900 wins, Yale ranks in the top ten for most wins in college football history.

History [ edit ] Early history [ edit ] See also: List of Yale Bulldogs football seasons Walter Camp , the "Father of American Football", as Yale's captain in 1878 The Bulldogs were the dominant team in the early days of intercollegiate football, winning 27 college football national championships , including 26 in 38 years between 1872 and 1909.

[ 3 ] Walter Camp , known as the "Father of Football", graduated from Hopkins Grammar School in 1876, and played college football at Yale College from 1876 to 1882.  He later served as the head football coach at Yale from 1888 to 1892.

[ 4 ] It was Camp who pioneered the fundamental transition of American football from rugby when in 1880, he succeeded in convincing the Intercollegiate Football Association to discontinue the rugby "scrum", and instead have players line up along a "line of scrimmage" for individual plays, which begin with the snap of the ball and conclude with the tackling of the ballcarrier.

[ 5 ] In 1916, against the advisement of coach Tad Jones, Yale quarterback Chester J. LaRoche (1918s) helped lead the Yale team in a win against Princeton by turning the momentum of the game with a fourth-down call in the huddle to go for first down rather than punt. The team made the down and went on to win the game in one of Yale's greatest victories in its history. LaRoche went on to spearhead the creation of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame.

[ 6 ] By the 1940s, however, Yale's success in football had waned at the national level. The famed sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote that Yale, along with Harvard and Princeton, was one of the top teams in the late 19th and early 20th century. However, "It was has been a different story in the later years when the far west, the midwest, the southwest, and the south have taken charge as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton fell behind." [ 7 ] Formation of the Ivy League [ edit ] When the Ivy League athletic conference was formed in 1955, conference rules prohibited post-season play in football.  While Yale had always abstained from post-season play, other member schools had participated in bowls before, and the new policy further insulated Yale and the Ivy League from the national spotlight.

NCAA Division I subdivision split [ edit ] The NCAA decided to split Division I into two subdivisions in 1978, then called I-A for larger schools, and I-AA for the smaller ones.  The NCAA had devised the split, in part, with the Ivy League in mind, but the conference did not move down for four seasons despite the fact that there were many indications that the ancient eight were on the wrong side of an increasing disparity between the big and small schools.  In 1982, the NCAA created a rule that stated a program's average attendance must be at least 15,000 to qualify for I-A membership.  This forced the conference's hand, as only some of the member schools met the attendance qualification.  Choosing to stay together rather than stand their ground separately in the increasingly competitive I-A subdivision, the Ivy League moved down into I-AA starting with the 1982 season.

[ 8 ] Conference affiliations [ edit ] Yale has been both an independent and affiliated with the Ivy League.

[ 9 ] Independent (1872–1955) Ivy League (1956–present) Championships [ edit ] National championships [ edit ] Yale has won 27 national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors.

The annual rivalry game between the two schools, known as " The Game ", is played in November at the end of the football season.  As of 2023, Yale leads the series 70-61-8.

[ 18 ] The Game is the second oldest continuing rivalry and also the third most-played rivalry game in college football history, after the Lehigh–Lafayette Rivalry (1884) and the Princeton –Yale game (1873).

Sports Illustrated On Campus rated the Harvard–Yale rivalry the sixth-best in college athletics in 2003.

Harvard had been unbeaten versus Yale from 2007 to 2015. The nine game winning streak was the longest during the rivalry. Yale's 21–14 victory over Harvard in Cambridge in 2016 ended the streak.

The Game is significant for historical reasons as the rules of The Game soon were adopted by other schools.  Football's rules, conventions, and equipment, as well as elements of "atmosphere" such as the mascot and fight song , include many elements pioneered or nurtured at Harvard and Yale.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Princeton [ edit ] Main article: Princeton–Yale football rivalry The series with Princeton dates to 1873.

Yale Bowl [ edit ] Main article: Yale Bowl Yale Bowl The Yale Bowl is Yale's football stadium in New Haven, Connecticut about 1-1/2 miles west of Yale's main campus. Completed in 1914, the stadium seats 61,446, reduced by renovations from the original capacity of 70,869.

[ 21 ] Ground was broken on the stadium in August 1913.  It was the first bowl-shaped stadium in the country, and provided inspiration for the design of such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , the Rose Bowl , and Michigan Stadium . Through its inspiration of the Rose Bowl stadium, its name is also the origin of college football's bowl games . It was the perfect setting for New Haven native Albie Booth, also known as "Little Boy Blue" to perform his heroics vs. Army in November 1929 and for the 47-yard "kick that made history" by Randall "Randy" C. Carter, '77, snapped by the stalwart center from Illinois, Ralph Bosch, '77 and surely placed by John "Nubes" Nubani, '78, in the last seconds of the 1975 Yale-Dartmouth game to win the game for Yale, 16–14. The victory lifted head coach Carm Cozza into a tie with the legendary Walter Camp for most victories by a Bulldog mentor.

[ 22 ] The current scoreboard (notable for the time clock being arranged vertically instead of horizontally) was added in 1958, and in 1986 the current press box was added.  Yale hosted Penn in the first night football game at the Bowl on October 21, 2016. Penn defeated Yale in the game, 42–7. The Bowl was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.
