Informal description [ edit ] The main advantage that the eikonal approximation offers is that the equations reduce to a differential equation in a single variable. This reduction into a single variable is the result of the straight line approximation or the eikonal approximation, which allows us to choose the straight line as a special direction.

Relation to the WKB approximation [ edit ] The early steps involved in the eikonal approximation in quantum mechanics are very closely related to the WKB approximation for one-dimensional waves. The WKB method, like the eikonal approximation, reduces the equations into a differential equation in a single variable. But the difficulty with the WKB approximation is that this variable is described by the trajectory of the particle which, in general, is complicated.

Formal description [ edit ] Making use of WKB approximation we can write the wave function of the scattered system in terms of action S : Ψ Ψ = e i S / ℏ ℏ {\displaystyle \Psi =e^{iS/{\hbar }}} Inserting the wavefunction Ψ in the Schrödinger equation without the presence of a magnetic field we obtain − − ℏ ℏ 2 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 Ψ Ψ = ( E − − V ) Ψ Ψ {\displaystyle -{\frac {{\hbar }^{2}}{2m}}{\nabla }^{2}\Psi =(E-V)\Psi } − − ℏ ℏ 2 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 e i S / ℏ ℏ = ( E − − V ) e i S / ℏ ℏ {\displaystyle -{\frac {{\hbar }^{2}}{2m}}{\nabla }^{2}{e^{iS/{\hbar }}}=(E-V)e^{iS/{\hbar }}} 1 2 m ( ∇ ∇ S ) 2 − − i ℏ ℏ 2 m ∇ ∇ 2 S = E − − V {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2m}}{(\nabla S)}^{2}-{\frac {i\hbar }{2m}}{\nabla }^{2}S=E-V} We write S as a power series in ħ S = S 0 + ℏ ℏ i S 1 + .
