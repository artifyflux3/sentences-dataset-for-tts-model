Under the identification of a circle with R / Z , or with the interval [0, 1] with the boundary points glued together, this map becomes a rotation of a circle by a proportion θ of a full revolution (i.e., an angle of 2 πθ radians). Since θ is irrational, the rotation has infinite order in the circle group and the map T θ has no periodic orbits .

Alternatively, we can use multiplicative notation for an irrational rotation by introducing the map T θ θ : S 1 → → S 1 , T θ θ ( x ) = x e 2 π π i θ θ {\displaystyle T_{\theta }:S^{1}\to S^{1},\quad \quad \quad T_{\theta }(x)=xe^{2\pi i\theta }} The relationship between the additive and multiplicative notations is the group isomorphism φ φ : ( [ 0 , 1 ] , + ) → → ( S 1 , ⋅ ⋅ ) φ φ ( x ) = x e 2 π π i θ θ {\displaystyle \varphi :([0,1],+)\to (S^{1},\cdot )\quad \varphi (x)=xe^{2\pi i\theta }} .

It can be shown that φ is an isometry .

There is a strong distinction in circle rotations that depends on whether θ is rational or irrational. Rational rotations are less interesting examples of dynamical systems because if θ θ = a b {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {a}{b}}} and gcd ( a , b ) = 1 {\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)=1} , then T θ θ b ( x ) = x {\displaystyle T_{\theta }^{b}(x)=x} when x ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle x\in [0,1]} .  It can also be shown that T θ θ i ( x ) ≠ ≠ x {\displaystyle T_{\theta }^{i}(x)\neq x} when 1 ≤ ≤ i < b {\displaystyle 1\leq i<b} .

Significance [ edit ] Irrational rotations form a fundamental example in the theory of dynamical systems . According to the Denjoy theorem , every orientation-preserving C 2 -diffeomorphism of the circle with an irrational rotation number θ is topologically conjugate to T θ . An irrational rotation is a measure-preserving ergodic transformation , but it is not mixing . The Poincaré map for the dynamical system associated with the Kronecker foliation on a torus with angle θ > is the irrational rotation by θ .

C*-algebras associated with irrational rotations, known as irrational rotation algebras , have been extensively studied.

Properties [ edit ] If θ is irrational, then the orbit of any element of [0, 1] under the rotation T θ is dense in [0, 1] . Therefore, irrational rotations are topologically transitive .

Irrational (and rational) rotations are not topologically mixing .

Irrational rotations are uniquely ergodic , with the Lebesgue measure serving as the unique invariant probability measure.

Suppose [ a , b ] ⊂ [0, 1] . Since T θ is ergodic, lim N → → ∞ ∞ 1 N ∑ ∑ n = 0 N − − 1 χ χ [ a , b ) ( T θ θ n ( t ) ) = b − − a {\displaystyle {\text{lim}}_{N\to \infty }{\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}\chi _{[a,b)}(T_{\theta }^{n}(t))=b-a} .

Generalizations [ edit ] Circle rotations are examples of group translations .

For a general orientation preserving homomorphism f of S 1 to itself we call a homeomorphism F : R → → R {\displaystyle F:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } a lift of f if π π ∘ ∘ F = f ∘ ∘ π π {\displaystyle \pi \circ F=f\circ \pi } where π π ( t ) = t mod 1 {\displaystyle \pi (t)=t{\bmod {1}}} .

[ 1 ] The circle rotation can be thought of as a subdivision of a circle into two parts, which are then exchanged with each other. A subdivision into more than two parts, which are then permuted with one-another, is called an interval exchange transformation .

Rigid rotations of compact groups effectively behave like circle rotations; the invariant measure is the Haar measure .

Applications [ edit ] Skew Products over Rotations of the Circle: In 1969 [ 2 ] William A. Veech constructed examples of minimal and not uniquely ergodic dynamical systems as follows: "Take two copies of the unit circle and mark off segment J of length 2 πα in the counterclockwise direction on each one with endpoint at 0. Now take θ irrational and consider the following dynamical system. Start with a point p , say in the first circle. Rotate counterclockwise by 2 πθ until the first time the orbit lands in J ; then switch to the corresponding point in the second circle, rotate by 2 πθ until the first time the point lands in J ; switch back to the first circle and so forth. Veech showed that if θ is irrational, then there exists irrational α for which this system is minimal and the Lebesgue measure is not uniquely ergodic."
