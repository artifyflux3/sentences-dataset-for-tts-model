Elliptic coordinate system In geometry , the elliptic coordinate system is a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system in which the coordinate lines are confocal ellipses and hyperbolae .  The two foci F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} are generally taken to be fixed at − − a {\displaystyle -a} and + a {\displaystyle +a} , respectively, on the x {\displaystyle x} -axis of the Cartesian coordinate system .

Basic definition [ edit ] The most common definition of elliptic coordinates ( μ μ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (\mu ,\nu )} is x = a cosh ⁡ ⁡ μ μ cos ⁡ ⁡ ν ν y = a sinh ⁡ ⁡ μ μ sin ⁡ ⁡ ν ν {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=a\ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \\y&=a\ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu \end{aligned}}} where μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a nonnegative real number and ν ν ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π π ] .

{\displaystyle \nu \in [0,2\pi ].} On the complex plane , an equivalent relationship is x + i y = a cosh ⁡ ⁡ ( μ μ + i ν ν ) {\displaystyle x+iy=a\ \cosh(\mu +i\nu )} These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae.  The trigonometric identity x 2 a 2 cosh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ + y 2 a 2 sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ = cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν = 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}\cosh ^{2}\mu }}+{\frac {y^{2}}{a^{2}\sinh ^{2}\mu }}=\cos ^{2}\nu +\sin ^{2}\nu =1} shows that curves of constant μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } form ellipses , whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity x 2 a 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν − − y 2 a 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν = cosh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ − − sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ = 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}\cos ^{2}\nu }}-{\frac {y^{2}}{a^{2}\sin ^{2}\nu }}=\cosh ^{2}\mu -\sinh ^{2}\mu =1} shows that curves of constant ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } form hyperbolae .

Scale factors [ edit ] In an orthogonal coordinate system the lengths of the basis vectors are known as scale factors. The scale factors for the elliptic coordinates ( μ μ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (\mu ,\nu )} are equal to h μ μ = h ν ν = a sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν = a cosh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ − − cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν .

{\displaystyle h_{\mu }=h_{\nu }=a{\sqrt {\sinh ^{2}\mu +\sin ^{2}\nu }}=a{\sqrt {\cosh ^{2}\mu -\cos ^{2}\nu }}.} Using the double argument identities for hyperbolic functions and trigonometric functions , the scale factors can be equivalently expressed as h μ μ = h ν ν = a 1 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ 2 μ μ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 ν ν ) .

{\displaystyle h_{\mu }=h_{\nu }=a{\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}(\cosh 2\mu -\cos 2\nu )}}.} Consequently, an infinitesimal element of area equals d A = h μ μ h ν ν d μ μ d ν ν = a 2 ( sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν ) d μ μ d ν ν = a 2 ( cosh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ − − cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν ) d μ μ d ν ν = a 2 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ 2 μ μ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 ν ν ) d μ μ d ν ν {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}dA&=h_{\mu }h_{\nu }d\mu d\nu \\&=a^{2}\left(\sinh ^{2}\mu +\sin ^{2}\nu \right)d\mu d\nu \\&=a^{2}\left(\cosh ^{2}\mu -\cos ^{2}\nu \right)d\mu d\nu \\&={\frac {a^{2}}{2}}\left(\cosh 2\mu -\cos 2\nu \right)d\mu d\nu \end{aligned}}} and the Laplacian reads ∇ ∇ 2 Φ Φ = 1 a 2 ( sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν ) ( ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ ν ν 2 ) = 1 a 2 ( cosh 2 ⁡ ⁡ μ μ − − cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ν ν ) ( ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ ν ν 2 ) = 2 a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ 2 μ μ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ 2 ν ν ) ( ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ μ μ 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ ν ν 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla ^{2}\Phi &={\frac {1}{a^{2}\left(\sinh ^{2}\mu +\sin ^{2}\nu \right)}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \mu ^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \nu ^{2}}}\right)\\&={\frac {1}{a^{2}\left(\cosh ^{2}\mu -\cos ^{2}\nu \right)}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \mu ^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \nu ^{2}}}\right)\\&={\frac {2}{a^{2}\left(\cosh 2\mu -\cos 2\nu \right)}}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \mu ^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \nu ^{2}}}\right)\end{aligned}}} Other differential operators such as ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ F {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} } and ∇ ∇ × × F {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} } can be expressed in the coordinates ( μ μ , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (\mu ,\nu )} by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates .

Alternative definition [ edit ] An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} are sometimes used, 
where σ σ = cosh ⁡ ⁡ μ μ {\displaystyle \sigma =\cosh \mu } and τ τ = cos ⁡ ⁡ ν ν {\displaystyle \tau =\cos \nu } .  Hence, the curves of constant σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } are hyperbolae.  The coordinate τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.

The coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} have a simple relation to the distances to the foci F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} .  For any point in the plane, the sum d 1 + d 2 {\displaystyle d_{1}+d_{2}} of its distances to the foci equals 2 a σ σ {\displaystyle 2a\sigma } , whereas their difference d 1 − − d 2 {\displaystyle d_{1}-d_{2}} equals 2 a τ τ {\displaystyle 2a\tau } .
Thus, the distance to F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} is a ( σ σ + τ τ ) {\displaystyle a(\sigma +\tau )} , whereas the distance to F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} is a ( σ σ − − τ τ ) {\displaystyle a(\sigma -\tau )} .  (Recall that F 1 {\displaystyle F_{1}} and F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} are located at x = − − a {\displaystyle x=-a} and x = + a {\displaystyle x=+a} , respectively.) A drawback of these coordinates is that the points with Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and (x,-y) have the same coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} , so the conversion to Cartesian coordinates is not a function, but a multifunction .

x = a σ σ τ τ {\displaystyle x=a\left.\sigma \right.\tau } y 2 = a 2 ( σ σ 2 − − 1 ) ( 1 − − τ τ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle y^{2}=a^{2}\left(\sigma ^{2}-1\right)\left(1-\tau ^{2}\right).} Alternative scale factors [ edit ] The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} are h σ σ = a σ σ 2 − − τ τ 2 σ σ 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle h_{\sigma }=a{\sqrt {\frac {\sigma ^{2}-\tau ^{2}}{\sigma ^{2}-1}}}} h τ τ = a σ σ 2 − − τ τ 2 1 − − τ τ 2 .

{\displaystyle h_{\tau }=a{\sqrt {\frac {\sigma ^{2}-\tau ^{2}}{1-\tau ^{2}}}}.} Hence, the infinitesimal area element becomes d A = a 2 σ σ 2 − − τ τ 2 ( σ σ 2 − − 1 ) ( 1 − − τ τ 2 ) d σ σ d τ τ {\displaystyle dA=a^{2}{\frac {\sigma ^{2}-\tau ^{2}}{\sqrt {\left(\sigma ^{2}-1\right)\left(1-\tau ^{2}\right)}}}d\sigma d\tau } and the Laplacian equals ∇ ∇ 2 Φ Φ = 1 a 2 ( σ σ 2 − − τ τ 2 ) [ σ σ 2 − − 1 ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ σ σ ( σ σ 2 − − 1 ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ σ σ ) + 1 − − τ τ 2 ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ τ τ ( 1 − − τ τ 2 ∂ ∂ Φ Φ ∂ ∂ τ τ ) ] .

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi ={\frac {1}{a^{2}\left(\sigma ^{2}-\tau ^{2}\right)}}\left[{\sqrt {\sigma ^{2}-1}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \sigma }}\left({\sqrt {\sigma ^{2}-1}}{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial \sigma }}\right)+{\sqrt {1-\tau ^{2}}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \tau }}\left({\sqrt {1-\tau ^{2}}}{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial \tau }}\right)\right].} Other differential operators such as ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ F {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} } and ∇ ∇ × × F {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} } can be expressed in the coordinates ( σ σ , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau )} by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in orthogonal coordinates .

Extrapolation to higher dimensions [ edit ] Elliptic coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates : The elliptic cylindrical coordinates are produced by projecting in the z {\displaystyle z} -direction.

The prolate spheroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the elliptic coordinates about the x {\displaystyle x} -axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci, whereas the oblate spheroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the elliptic coordinates about the y {\displaystyle y} -axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.

Ellipsoidal coordinates are a formal extension of elliptic coordinates into 3-dimensions, which is based on confocal ellipsoids, hyperboloids of one and two sheets.

Note that (ellipsoidal) Geographic coordinate system is a different concept from above.

Applications [ edit ] The classic applications of elliptic coordinates are in solving partial differential equations , 
e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation , for which elliptic coordinates are a natural description of a system thus allowing a separation of variables in the partial differential equations .  Some traditional examples are solving systems such as electrons orbiting a molecule or planetary orbits that have an elliptical shape.

The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful.  A typical example might involve 
an integration over all pairs of vectors p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } and q {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} } that sum to a fixed vector r = p + q {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {p} +\mathbf {q} } , where the integrand 
was a function of the vector lengths | p | {\displaystyle \left|\mathbf {p} \right|} and | q | {\displaystyle \left|\mathbf {q} \right|} .  (In such a case, one would position r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } between the two foci and aligned with the x {\displaystyle x} -axis, i.e., r = 2 a x ^ ^ {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =2a\mathbf {\hat {x}} } .)  For concreteness, r {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} } , p {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} } and q {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} } could represent the momenta of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).
