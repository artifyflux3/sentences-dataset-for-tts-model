[ 1 ] Depending on the type of government, the term socialism can be used to indicate an intermediate stage between capitalism and communism and may be the goal of the revolution, especially in Marxist–Leninist views.

[ 2 ] The idea that a proletarian revolution is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism ; [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the working class .

[ 5 ] Thus, in the Marxist view, proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world .

Theory [ edit ] Karl Marx saw revolution as a necessity for communism, where the revolution would be based on class struggle led by the organised proletariat to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie , followed by the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat .

[ 1 ] Leninism argues [ 6 ] [ 7 ] that a communist revolution must be led by a vanguard of "professional revolutionaries", men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who can then form the nucleus of the revolutionary movement .

[ 8 ] Thus meaning that under Lenin's framework a communist revolution is not necessarily a proletarian revolution.

[ 9 ] Some Marxists, such as Rosa Luxemburg , [ 10 ] [ 8 ] disagree with the idea of a vanguard as put forth by Lenin, especially left communists .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Another line of criticisms insist that the entire working class—or at least a large part of it—must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build massive communist parties with very large memberships.

Communist revolutions and coups throughout history [ edit ] This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items .

( February 2024 ) The following is a list of successful and unsuccessful communist revolutions and coups throughout history. Among the lesser-known revolutions, a number of borderline revolutions have been included which may or may not have been communist revolutions. The nature of unsuccessful revolutions is particularly contentious since one can only speculate as to the kinds of policies that would have been implemented by the revolutionaries had they achieved victory.

Further, it has co-ordinated the social development of the civilized countries to such an extent that, in all of them, bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes, and the struggle between them the great struggle of the day.

There was, therefore, little to hinder the assault mounted by the rebel 4th Armored Brigade, led by Major Mohammed Aslam Watanjar, who had also been prominent in Daoud's own coup five years before. Watanjar first secured the airport, where the other coup leader, Colonel Abdul Qadir, left by helicopter for the Bagram air base . There he took charge and organized air strikes on the royal palace, where Daoud and the presidential guard were conducting a desperate defense. Fighting continued the whole day and into the night, when the defenders were finally overwhelmed. Daoud and almost all of his family members, including women and children, died in the fighting. Altogether there were possibly as many as two thousand fatalities, both military and civilian.
