For other senses of this word, see [Continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(disambiguation) "Continuum (disambiguation)").

**Continuum** (pl.: **continua** or **continuums**) theories or models explain variation as involving gradual [quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement "Level of measurement") transitions without abrupt changes or discontinuities. In contrast, categorical theories or models explain variation using [qualitatively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_property "Qualitative property") different states.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)#cite_note-1)

In physics, for example, the [space-time continuum model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") describes space and time as part of the same continuum rather than as separate entities. A [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum") in physics, such as the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"), is often termed as either continuous (with energy at all wavelengths) or discrete (energy at only certain wavelengths).

In contrast, [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") uses [quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum"), certain defined amounts (i.e. categorical amounts) which are distinguished from continuous amounts.

In mathematics and philosophy

A good introduction to the philosophical issues involved is [John Lane Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lane_Bell "John Lane Bell")'s essay in the _[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford\_Encyclopedia\_of\_Philosophy "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)#cite_note-Bell2005-2) A significant divide is provided by the [law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle "Law of excluded middle"). It determines the divide between [intuitionistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism "Intuitionism") continua such as [Brouwer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer")'s and [Lawvere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawvere "Lawvere")'s, and classical ones such as [Stevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Stevin "Simon Stevin")'s and [Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson "Abraham Robinson")'s. Bell isolates two distinct historical conceptions of [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal"), one by [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") and one by [Nieuwentijdt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuwentijdt "Nieuwentijdt"), and argues that Leibniz's conception was implemented in Robinson's [hyperreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number") continuum, whereas Nieuwentijdt's, in Lawvere's [smooth infinitesimal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis "Smooth infinitesimal analysis"), characterized by the presence of nilsquare infinitesimals: "It may be said that Leibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of infinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice versa. It is of interest to note that Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in [nonstandard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_analysis "Nonstandard analysis"), and nilsquare infinitesimals in [smooth infinitesimal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis "Smooth infinitesimal analysis")".

In social sciences, psychology and psychiatry
---------------------------------------------

In [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science") in general, psychology and psychiatry included, data about differences between individuals, like any data, can be collected and measured using different [levels of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levels_of_measurement "Levels of measurement"). Those levels include dichotomous (a person either has a personality trait or not) and non-dichotomous approaches. While the non-dichotomous approach allows for understanding that everyone lies somewhere on a particular personality dimension, the dichotomous (nominal categorical and ordinal) approaches only seek to confirm that a particular person either has or does not have a particular mental disorder.

Expert witnesses particularly are trained to help courts in translating the data into the legal (e.g. 'guilty' vs. 'not guilty') [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy "Dichotomy"), which apply to [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") and [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics").

In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), the range of [dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect "Dialect") spoken over a geographical area that differ slightly between neighboring areas is known as a [dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum "Dialect continuum"). A language continuum is a similar description for the merging of neighboring languages without a clear defined boundary. Examples of dialect or language continuums include the varieties of Italian or German; and the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages"), [Arabic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_languages "Arabic languages"), or [Bantu languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages "Bantu languages").
