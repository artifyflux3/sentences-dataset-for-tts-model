[ 10 ] With 3.7 million inhabitants, [ 5 ] it has the highest population within its city limits of any city in the European Union . The city is also one of the states of Germany , being the third-smallest state in the country by area. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg , and Brandenburg's capital Potsdam is nearby. The urban area of Berlin has a population of over 4.6 million, making it the most populous in Germany.

[ 6 ] [ 11 ] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region, [ 5 ] as well as the fifth-biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.

[ 12 ] Berlin was built along the banks of the Spree river, which flows into the Havel in the western borough of Spandau . The city includes lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is Müggelsee . About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks and gardens , rivers, canals, and lakes.

[ 13 ] First documented in the 13th century [ 9 ] and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes , [ 14 ] Berlin was designated the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Berlin served as a scientific, artistic, and philosophical hub during the Age of Enlightenment , Neoclassicism , and the German revolutions of 1848–1849 . During the Gründerzeit , an industrialization-induced economic boom triggered a rapid population increase in Berlin.

1920s Berlin was the third-largest city in the world by population.

[ 15 ] After World War II and following Berlin's occupation, the city was split into West Berlin and East Berlin , divided by the Berlin Wall .

[ 16 ] East Berlin was declared the capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany. Due to its geographic location and history, Berlin has been called "the heart of Europe".

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Berlin is a global city of culture , politics , media and science.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Its economy is based on high tech and the service sector , encompassing a diverse range of creative industries , startup companies , research facilities, and media corporations.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a complex public transportation network .

Tourism in Berlin makes the city a popular global destination.

[ 26 ] Significant industries include information technology, the healthcare industry , biomedical engineering , biotechnology , the automotive industry , and electronics .

Berlin is home to several universities, such as the Humboldt University of Berlin , Technische Universität Berlin , the Berlin University of the Arts and the Free University of Berlin . The Berlin Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe.

Babelsberg Studio is the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, and there are many films set in Berlin .

[ 27 ] Berlin is home to three World Heritage Sites : Museum Island , the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin , and the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates .

[ 28 ] Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate , the Reichstag building , Potsdamer Platz , the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe , and the Berlin Wall Memorial . Berlin has numerous museums, galleries , and libraries.

The word Berlin also has its roots in the language of the West Slavs , and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- ("swamp").

[ 29 ] Of Berlin's twelve boroughs , five bear a Slavic-derived name— Pankow , Steglitz-Zehlendorf , Marzahn-Hellersdorf , Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau ; furthermore, across the city's 96 neighbourhoods, there are 22 which bear a Slavic-rooted name— Altglienicke , Alt-Treptow , Britz , Buch , Buckow , Gatow , Karow , Kladow , Köpenick , Lankwitz , Lübars , Malchow , Marzahn , Pankow , Prenzlauer Berg , Rudow , Schmöckwitz , Spandau , Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow , Steglitz , Tegel and Zehlendorf .

Prehistory of Berlin [ edit ] The area of what is now Berlin has been settled for millennia.

[ 30 ] A deer mask, dated to 9,000 BC, is attributed to the Maglemosian culture . Around 2,000 BC dense human settlements along the Spree and Havel rivers gave rise to the Lusatian culture .

[ 31 ] Starting around 500 BC Germanic tribes settled in a number of villages in the higher situated areas of today's Berlin. After the Semnones left around 200 AD, the Burgundians followed. In the 7th century Slavic tribes, the later known Hevelli and Sprevane , reached the region.

12th century to 16th century [ edit ] Map of Berlin in 1688 Berlin Cathedral (left) and Berlin Palace (right), 1900 In the 12th century the region came under German rule as part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg , founded by Albert the Bear in 1157. Early evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated 1270 to 1290, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte .

[ 32 ] The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century.

Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209.

[ 33 ] 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.

[ 34 ] The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes , one was known as Via Imperii , and the other trade route reached from Bruges to Novgorod .

[ 14 ] In 1307 the two towns formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.

[ 35 ] In 1326 the territory of Berlin was raided by pagan Lithuanians during the Raid on Brandenburg .

Members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia , and eventually as German emperors . In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" (German: Berliner Unwille ).

[ 36 ] Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power.

[ 37 ] Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic League city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran .

[ 38 ] 17th to 19th centuries [ edit ] The Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.

[ 39 ] Frederick William , known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.

[ 40 ] With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots .

[ 41 ] By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.

[ 42 ] Many other immigrants came from Bohemia , Poland , and Salzburg .

[ 43 ] Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia . In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia , as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg , crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia . Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom, [ 44 ] replacing Königsberg . This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".

[ 35 ] In 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to power.

[ 45 ] Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment , but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army.

[ 46 ] Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition , Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806 , but granted self-government to the city.

[ 47 ] In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg .

[ 48 ] The Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding , Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin.

[ 49 ] In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire .

[ 50 ] In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

[ 51 ] 20th to 21st centuries [ edit ] Further information: Greater Berlin Act , 1920s Berlin , West Berlin , and East Berlin Potsdamer Platz in the 1920s Berlin The controversial 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin under the Nazi rule In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement.

[ 52 ] In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of World War I in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building . In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km 2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era , Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties . The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries.

Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, [ 53 ] being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.

[ 54 ] In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power . Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in Vienna , and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through architecture . Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into World Capital Germania ; these were never implemented.

[ 55 ] NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp . Starting in early 1943, many were deported to ghettos like Łódź , and to concentration and extermination camps such as Auschwitz .

[ 56 ] Berlin hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics for which the Olympic stadium was built.

[ 57 ] View from Pariser Platz in June 1945, after the battle of Berlin Berlin in ruins after World War II ( Potsdamer Platz , 1945) During World War II , Berlin was the location of multiple Nazi prisons, forced labour camps, 17 subcamps of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for men and women, including teenagers, of various nationalities, including Polish, Jewish, French, Belgian, Czechoslovak, Russian, Ukrainian, Romani, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, Spanish, Luxembourgish, German, Austrian, Italian, Yugoslavian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, [ 58 ] a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see Romani Holocaust ), [ 59 ] and the Stalag III-D prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs of various nationalities.

During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin . The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.

[ 60 ] After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to Allied-occupied Germany the sectors of the Allies of World War II (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin , while the Soviet Union formed East Berlin .

[ 61 ] US and Soviet tanks face each other. Taken in 1961 at Checkpoint Charlie , during the construction of the Berlin Wall The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.

All four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed the Berlin Blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift , conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.

[ 62 ] In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist–Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany . West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The Berlin Wall bordered with East and West Berlin in 1983 The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989.

The German reunification on 3 October 1990 , with flags of all German states at the Reichstag building The founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn .

[ 63 ] In 1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie . West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

John F. Kennedy gave his " Ich bin ein Berliner " speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the Schöneberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.

[ 64 ] Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power Agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.

[ 65 ] In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city experienced significant urban development and still impacts urban planning decisions.

[ 66 ] Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim.

[ 67 ] City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.

[ 68 ] On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin [ 69 ] (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder .

[ 70 ] Berlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.

[ 71 ] In 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.

[ 72 ] Construction of the "Berlin Wall Trail" (Berliner Mauerweg) began in 2002 and was completed in 2006.

In a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL , a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church , leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] In 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of far-right politics in Germany .

[ 75 ] Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November.

[ 76 ] Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic , plans were announced to close BER's Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport , beginning in March 2021.

[ 77 ] The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station opened in 2021, which completed all new works on the U5.

[ 78 ] The 2006 FIFA World Cup final was held in Berlin Berlin Hauptbahnhof was opened in 2006 The rebuilt Berlin Palace in 2022 A partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed Berlin Palace , was postponed until March 2021.

[ 79 ] On 16 September 2022, the opening of the eastern wing, the last section of the Humboldt Forum museum, meant the Humboldt Forum museum was finally completed. It became Germany's currently most expensive cultural project.

[ 80 ] Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt [ edit ] Main article: Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg The coat of arms proposed in the state contract The legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the Basic Law stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law.

[ 81 ] However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.

[ 82 ] In 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg.

[ 83 ] Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225,000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches.

[ 84 ] Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West Berlin , Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.

[ 83 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Berlin Topography [ edit ] Satellite image of Berlin The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.

Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography , part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley ), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation . The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel , which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee . A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.

[ 85 ] Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf , Steglitz-Zehlendorf , Tempelhof-Schöneberg , and Neukölln lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.

[ 86 ] The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.

[ 87 ] Climate [ edit ] Berlin has an oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb ) [ 88 ] bordering on a humid continental climate ( Dfb ). This type of climate features mild to very warm summer temperatures and cold, though not very severe, winters. Annual precipitation is modest.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] Frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates .

The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by German history during the 20th century. 17% of Berlin's buildings are Gründerzeit or earlier and nearly 25% are of the 1920s and 1930s, when Berlin played a part in the origin of modern architecture .

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] Devastated by the bombing of Berlin in World War II many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. After the reunification, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed , including the Forum Fridericianum along with, the Berlin State Opera , Charlottenburg Palace , Gendarmenmarkt , Alte Kommandantur , as well as the City Palace .

The tallest buildings in Berlin are spread across the urban area, with clusters at Potsdamer Platz , City West , and Alexanderplatz .

Over one-third of the city's area consists of green and open-space, [ 13 ] with the Großer Tiergarten , one of the largest and most popular parks in Berlin, located in the centre of the city.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen , a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons , personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it. Nearby is the Nikolaiviertel , the reconstructed oldest settlement area in the city.

The Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Französischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom . The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

Charlottenburg Palace Hackesche Höfe The Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums ( James Simon Gallery ), as well as reconstruction of the Berlin Palace (Stadtschloss) were completed.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral , emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family.

St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

Breitscheidplatz with Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is the center of City West .

Unter den Linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the Berlin Palace, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there.

Friedrichstraße was Berlin's legendary street during the Golden Twenties . It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

Potsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down.

[ 103 ] To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gemäldegalerie , and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie . The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe , a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.

[ 104 ] The area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe , a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.

The Straße des 17. Juni , connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953 . Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegessäule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The Kurfürstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz . The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is KaDeWe , claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The Rathaus Schöneberg , where John F. Kennedy made his famous " Ich bin ein Berliner !" speech, is in Tempelhof-Schöneberg .

West of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President.

Charlottenburg Palace , which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The Oberbaumbrücke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg . It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents, [ 108 ] making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

[ 109 ] In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union . Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.

[ 120 ] Berlin has a vibrant expatriate community involving, among others, precarious immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore, Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and cultural capital in Berlin.

[ 121 ] Languages [ edit ] Main articles: German language and Berlinerisch dialect German is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union, [ 122 ] and one of the three working languages of the European Commission .

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area . It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more like a sociolect , largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life.

The most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.
