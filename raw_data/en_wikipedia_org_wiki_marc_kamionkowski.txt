Warner Prize (1998) E. O. Lawrence Award (2006) Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics (2015) Gruber Prize in Cosmology (2021) Scientific career Fields Physics , Astrophysics Institutions Institute for Advanced Study Columbia University California Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University Doctoral advisor Michael Turner Doctoral students Adrienne Erickcek Kris Sigurdson Marc Kamionkowski (born 1965) [ 1 ] is an American theoretical physicist and currently the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University . His research interests include particle physics , dark matter , inflation , the cosmic microwave background and gravitational waves .

Career [ edit ] Kamionkowski received a BA degree in 1987 from Washington University in St. Louis and a PhD in 1991 from the University of Chicago .  He did postdoctoral study at the Institute for Advanced Study and joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1994 as an assistant professor of physics. From 1999 to 2006, Kamionkowski was a professor at The California Institute of Technology, and from 2006 to 2011 the Robinson Professor of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics. He joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins as professor in 2011.

[ 2 ] He is known primarily for work on supersymmetric dark matter and the cosmic microwave background .  He was awarded the US Department of Energy's 2006 E. O. Lawrence Award in High Energy and Nuclear Physics for "his theoretical analyses demonstrating that precise observations of the cosmic microwave background can lead to deep understanding of the origin and evolution of the Universe, thereby motivating a series of increasingly precise cosmological experiments".
