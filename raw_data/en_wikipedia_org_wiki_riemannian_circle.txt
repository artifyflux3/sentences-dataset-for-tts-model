[ 1 ] The metric spaces that can be embedded into metric circles can be characterized by a four-point triangle equality .

Some authors have called metric circles Riemannian circles , especially in connection with the filling area conjecture in Riemannian geometry , [ 2 ] but this term has also been used for other concepts.

[ 3 ] A metric circle, defined in this way, is unrelated to and should be distinguished from a metric ball , the subset of a metric space within a given radius from a central point.

Characterization of subspaces [ edit ] A metric space is a subspace of a metric circle (or of an equivalently defined metric line, interpreted as a degenerate case of a metric circle) if every four of its points can be permuted and labeled as a , b , c , d {\displaystyle a,b,c,d} so that they obey the equalities of distances D ( a , b ) + D ( b , c ) = D ( a , c ) {\displaystyle D(a,b)+D(b,c)=D(a,c)} and D ( b , c ) + D ( c , d ) = D ( b , d ) {\displaystyle D(b,c)+D(c,d)=D(b,d)} . A space with this property has been called a circular metric space .

[ 1 ] Filling [ edit ] Main article: Filling area conjecture Arc distances on a great circle are the same as the distance between the same points on a sphere , and on the hemispheres into which the circle divides the sphere.

The Riemannian unit circle of length 2 π can be embedded, without any change of distance, into the metric of geodesics on a unit sphere , by mapping the circle to a great circle and its metric to great-circle distance . The same metric space would also be obtained from distances on a hemisphere . This differs from the boundary of a unit disk , for which opposite points on the unit disk would have distance 2, instead of their distance π on the Riemannian circle. This difference in internal metrics between the hemisphere and the disk led Mikhael Gromov to pose his filling area conjecture , according to which the unit hemisphere is the minimum-area surface having the Riemannian circle as its boundary.
