Background [ edit ] Latvia was one of the early post World War I nations which adopted some ideas from the 1919 Weimar Constitution . German liberal lawyer Hugo Preuß (Preuss) is often attributed as the author of the draft version of the constitution that was passed by the Weimar National Assembly , [ 1 ] which historian William L. Shirer in a book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich regards as "the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen ... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy." [ 2 ] In Latvia some early law experts such as Kārlis Dišlers, Fēlikss Cielēns and modern day jurists agree that Weimar Constitution was underlying the wording of the Constitution of Latvia ( Satversme ), and in some way is a synthesis between the Weimar Constitution and Westminster system used in the United Kingdom .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Liberalism in Latvia was a small but important force since 1922 in Latvia. The current regained position after the re-independence of 1990. The current major liberal party is the centre-right Unity , which is also a member of the alliance New Unity .
