[Phase portrait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait "Phase portrait") of the [Van der Pol oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator "Van der Pol oscillator"), a one-dimensional system. [Phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") was the original object of study in symplectic geometry.

**Symplectic geometry** is a branch of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology") that studies [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"); that is, [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") equipped with a [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_differential_form "Closed differential form"), [nondegenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondegenerate_form "Nondegenerate form")[2-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"). Symplectic geometry has its origins in the [Hamiltonian formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") where the [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a symplectic manifold.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-1)

The term "symplectic", as adopted into mathematics by [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-3) is a neo-Greek [calque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque "Calque") of "complex". Previously, the "[symplectic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group "Symplectic group")" had been called the "line complex group". "Complex" comes from the Latin _com-plexus_, meaning "braided together" (co- + plexus), while "symplectic" represents the corresponding Greek _sym-plektikos_ (συμπλεκτικός "twining or plaiting together, copulative"). In both cases, the stems come from the Indo-European root _[*pleḱ-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ple%E1%B8%B1-#Proto-Indo-European "wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/pleḱ-")_, expressing the concept of folding or weaving, and the prefixes suggest "togetherness". The name reflects the deep connections between complex and symplectic structures.

By [Darboux's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem "Darboux's theorem"), symplectic manifolds are locally isomorphic to the standard [symplectic vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_vector_space "Symplectic vector space"). Hence they have only global (topological) invariants. The term "symplectic topology" is often used interchangeably with "symplectic geometry".

> The name "complex group" formerly advocated by me in allusion to line complexes, as these are defined by the vanishing of antisymmetric bilinear forms, has become more and more embarrassing through collision with the word "complex" in the connotation of complex number. I therefore propose to replace it by the corresponding Greek adjective "symplectic". Dickson called the group the "Abelian linear group" in homage to Abel who first studied it.

[Weyl (1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#CITEREFWeyl1939), p.165)

A symplectic geometry is defined on a smooth even-dimensional space that is a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). On this space is defined a geometric object, the [symplectic 2-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold#Definition "Symplectic manifold"), that allows for the measurement of sizes of two-dimensional objects in the [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)"). The symplectic form in symplectic geometry plays a role analogous to that of the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") in [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"). Where the metric tensor measures lengths and angles, the symplectic form measures oriented areas.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-McDuff2010-4)

Symplectic geometry arose from the study of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and an example of a symplectic structure is the motion of an object in one dimension. To specify the trajectory of the object, one requires both the [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(geometry) "Position (geometry)")_q_ and the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")_p_, which form a point (_p_,_q_) in the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Two-dimensional Euclidean space")![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd). In this case, the symplectic [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") is

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \omega =dp\wedge dq}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb39e48be7b781ed503ec96cebb6d81c3bb28a90)
and is an [area form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form "Volume form") that measures the area _A_ of a region _S_ in the plane through [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#Integration "Differential form"):

![Image 4: {\displaystyle A=\int _{S}\omega .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10672d3fe232ce31fef7c6a67f378220fafd2a95)
The area is important because as [conservative dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_system "Conservative system") evolve in time, this area is invariant.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-McDuff2010-4)

Higher dimensional symplectic geometries are defined analogously. A 2 _n_-dimensional symplectic geometry is formed of pairs of directions

![Image 5: {\displaystyle ((x_{1},x_{2}),(x_{3},x_{4}),\ldots (x_{2n-1},x_{2n}))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/12238c61584f28d714b74e2ac05c730c63197ef7)
in a 2 _n_-dimensional manifold along with a symplectic form

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \omega =dx_{1}\wedge dx_{2}+dx_{3}\wedge dx_{4}+\cdots +dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7ce8695f0555a2fa9cbff9ad061f80a3b5e2bd7)
This symplectic form yields the size of a 2 _n_-dimensional region _V_ in the space as the sum of the areas of the projections of _V_ onto each of the planes formed by the pairs of directions[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-McDuff2010-4)

![Image 7: {\displaystyle A=\int _{V}\omega =\int _{V}dx_{1}\wedge dx_{2}+\int _{V}dx_{3}\wedge dx_{4}+\cdots +\int _{V}dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf3f40823c577ea8765d7c8c2b55afc829f25914)

Comparison with Riemannian geometry
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symplectic_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Comparison with Riemannian geometry")]

[Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") is the study of [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") equipped with nondegenerate, symmetric 2-tensors (called [metric tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")). Symplectic geometry has a number of similarities with and differences from Riemannian geometry.

Unlike in the Riemannian case, symplectic manifolds have no local invariants such as [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds "Curvature of Riemannian manifolds"). This is a consequence of [Darboux's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem "Darboux's theorem") which states that a neighborhood of any point of a 2 _n_-dimensional symplectic manifold is isomorphic to the standard symplectic structure on an open set of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47460f1a92774729807be11cf62b9178b5771b4a).

Another difference with Riemannian geometry is that not every differentiable manifold can admit a symplectic form; there are certain topological restrictions. For example, every symplectic manifold is even-dimensional and [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable "Orientable"). Additionally, if _M_ is a closed symplectic manifold, then the 2nd [de Rham cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology "De Rham cohomology")[group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)")_H_ 2(_M_) is nontrivial; this implies, for example, that the only [_n_-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") that admits a symplectic form is the [2-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere").

A parallel that one can draw between the two subjects is the analogy between [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics "Geodesics") in Riemannian geometry and [pseudoholomorphic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoholomorphic_curve "Pseudoholomorphic curve") in symplectic geometry. Geodesics are curves of shortest length (locally), while pseudoholomorphic curves are surfaces of minimal area. Both concepts play a fundamental role in their respective disciplines.

Examples and structures
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symplectic_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Examples and structures")]

Every [Kähler manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Kähler manifold") is also a symplectic manifold. Well into the 1970s, symplectic experts were unsure whether any compact non-Kähler symplectic manifolds existed, but since then many examples have been constructed (the first was due to [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston")); in particular, [Robert Gompf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gompf "Robert Gompf") has shown that every [finitely presented group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_presented_group "Finitely presented group") occurs as the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of some symplectic [4-manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold "4-manifold"), in marked contrast with the Kähler case.

Most symplectic manifolds, one can say, are not Kähler; and so do not have an integrable [complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complex_structure "Linear complex structure") compatible with the symplectic form. [Mikhail Gromov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gromov_(mathematician) "Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)"), however, made the important observation that symplectic manifolds do admit an abundance of compatible [almost complex structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_structure "Almost complex structure"), so that they satisfy all the axioms for a Kähler manifold _except_ the requirement that the [transition maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_map "Transition map") be [holomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function").

Gromov used the existence of almost complex structures on symplectic manifolds to develop a theory of [pseudoholomorphic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoholomorphic_curve "Pseudoholomorphic curve"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-5) which has led to a number of advancements in symplectic topology, including a class of symplectic invariants now known as [Gromov–Witten invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromov%E2%80%93Witten_invariant "Gromov–Witten invariant"). Later, using the pseudoholomorphic curve technique [Andreas Floer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Floer "Andreas Floer") invented another important tool in symplectic geometry known as the [Floer homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology "Floer homology").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry#cite_note-6)
