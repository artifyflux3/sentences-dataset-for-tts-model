A **lozenge** ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-1)[_LOZ-inj_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); symbol: ◊), often referred to as a **diamond**, is a form of [rhombus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus "Rhombus"). The definition of _lozenge_ is not strictly fixed, and the word is sometimes used simply as a synonym (from [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_language "Old French language")_\_[losenge](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/losenge#Old\\_French "wikt:losenge")\__) for _rhombus_. Most often, though, lozenge refers to a thin rhombus—a rhombus with two acute and two obtuse angles, especially one with acute angles of 45°.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-Mathworld-2) The lozenge shape is often used in [parquetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parquetry "Parquetry") (with acute angles that are 360°/_n_ with _n_ being an integer higher than 4, because they can be used to form a set of [tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile "Tile") of the same shape and size, reusable to cover the plane in various geometric patterns as the result of a tiling process called [tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation "Tessellation") in mathematics) and as [decoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_art "Decorative art") on [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramics_(art) "Ceramics (art)"), [silverware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_(household) "Silver (household)") and [textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile"). It also features in [heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry "Heraldry") and [playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards) "Suit (cards)").

The lozenge motif dates from the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") and [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_art "Paleolithic art") period in [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") and represents a [sown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sown "Sown")[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture) "Field (agriculture)") and female [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility "Fertility").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-3) The ancient lozenge pattern often shows up in [Diamond vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_vault "Diamond vault") architecture, in traditional dress patterns of [Slavic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples "Slavic peoples"), and in traditional [Ukrainian embroidery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_embroidery "Ukrainian embroidery"). The lozenge pattern also appears extensively in [Celtic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_art "Celtic art"), art from the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), and ancient [Phrygian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia "Phrygia") art.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-4)

The lozenge symbolism is one of the main symbols for women in [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") carpets.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-5) Common Berber jewelry from the [Aurès Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aur%C3%A8s_Mountains "Aurès Mountains") or [Kabylie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabylie "Kabylie") in Algeria also uses this pattern as a female fertility sign.

In 1658, the English philosopher [Sir Thomas Browne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Browne "Sir Thomas Browne") published _[The Garden of Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Garden\_of\_Cyrus "The Garden of Cyrus"),_ subtitled _The Quincunciall Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients,_ in which he outlined the [mystical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") interconnection of [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art"), [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature") and the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") via the [quincunx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx "Quincunx") pattern. He also suggested therein that ancient plantations were laid out in a lozenge pattern.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-6)

Lozenges appear as [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") in [ancient classic element systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element"), in [amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet "Amulet"), and in [religious symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_symbolism "Religious symbolism"). In [playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card "Playing card"), the symbol for the [suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards) "Suit (cards)") of _diamonds_ is a lozenge.

Lozenge (subtotal) key on a Walther Multa 32 calculator keyboard, c. 1970

On equipment, especially calculators, the lozenge is used to mark the subtotal key. It is standardized in ISO 7000[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-7) as symbol ISO-7000-0650 ("Subtotal"). In a similar fashion, the square lozenge (⌑), part of the [BCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCDIC "BCDIC") character set, was often used on tabulation listings to indicate second level totals in banking installations in the 1960s.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-8)

The [APL programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") uses the lozenge, called _diamond_, as [statement separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Statements "Comparison of programming languages (syntax)").

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Fokker_D_VII.jpg/250px-Fokker_D_VII.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fokker_D_VII.jpg)

A [Fokker D.VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_D.VII "Fokker D.VII") shows a four-color lozenge camouflage

During the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the [Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") developed [lozenge camouflage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_camouflage "Lozenge camouflage") (German: _Lozenge-Tarnung_).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-9) This camouflage was made up of colored [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") of four or five colors. The repeating patterns often used irregular four-, five- and six-sided polygons, but some contained regular rhombi or hexagons. Because painting such a pattern was very time-consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the pattern was printed on fabric. This pre-printed fabric was used from 1916 until the end of the war, in various forms and colours.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/120px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Brazil.svg)

[Flag of Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Brazil "Flag of Brazil")

Several [flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag "Flag") feature lozenges, including the [flag of Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Brazil "Flag of Brazil"), which contains a yellow lozenge at the center. One official [flag of Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bavaria "Flag of Bavaria") is entirely made of blue and white lozenges.

Several [emblems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emblem "Emblem") feature lozenges, including the [Emblem of Uttarakhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emblem_of_Uttarakhand "Emblem of Uttarakhand"), one of the twenty-eight states of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India").

The lozenge in [heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry "Heraldry") is a diamond-shaped [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(heraldry) "Charge (heraldry)"), usually somewhat narrower than it is tall. A **mascle** is a voided lozenge—that is, a lozenge with a lozenge-shaped hole in the middle—and the rarer **rustre** is a lozenge containing a circular hole. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as **lozengy**; a similar field of mascles is **masculy**.

In [axiomatic set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory "Axiomatic set theory"), the lozenge refers to the principles known collectively as the [diamond principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_principle "Diamond principle").

Cough tablets have taken the name lozenge, based on their original shape. According to the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ the first use of this sense was in 1530.

In Finland, the lozenge is associated with [salmiak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmiak "Salmiak"), through Apteekin Salmiakki. Thus, the lozenge is commonly called _salmiakkikuvio_ "salmiak shape". The pattern is often used even if the candy is not actually lozenge-shaped.

In the [Finnish military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_military_ranks "Finnish military ranks"), the lozenge symbol is used in the [insignia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insignia "Insignia") of conscripts undergoing officer training to signify their rank and progress. Conscript Officer Students, who are still in the early stages of their training, wear an insignia with one lozenge.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-10) As they advance in their training, they become Conscript Officer Candidates, identified by an insignia with two lozenges. This progression marks their nearing completion of officer training, with the lozenge serving as a clear visual indicator of their status.

WWII "[ruptured duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruptured_duck "Ruptured duck")" Honorable Discharge Emblem lozenge

To implement 10 U.S.C 773, the Secretary of the Navy has prescribed the following distinctive mark for wear by members of military societies which are composed entirely of honorably discharged officers and enlisted personnel, or by the instructors and members of duly organized cadet corps.

"The distinctive mark will be a diamond, 3+1⁄2 inches long by 2 inches wide, of any cloth material. A white distinctive mark will be worn on blue, green, or khaki clothing; and a blue distinctive mark will be worn on white clothing."[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

"The distinctive mark will be worn on all outer clothing on the right sleeve, at the point of the shoulder, the upper tip of the diamond to be 1⁄4 inch below the shoulder seam."[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The lozenge is used in the [Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army"), [Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps"), and [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") on the insignia of their respective [first sergeants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_sergeant "First sergeant"). It is also used in the cadet programs of [Army ROTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps "Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps"), [Army and Marine Corps Junior ROTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps_ranks "Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps ranks"), and the [Civil Air Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Patrol "Civil Air Patrol") as rank insignia of cadet officers corresponding to the military pay grades of O-4 to O-6 (Cadet Major, Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, and Cadet Colonel).

[_Girl Singing_ by Frans Hals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Singing_(Hals) "Girl Singing (Hals)"), from about 1628, is an example of a painting in lozenge format.

_Lozenge_ is the term used to identify the format of a two-dimensional work of art, typically a parallelogrammatic painting on a canvas, panel, or paper [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(art) "Support (art)"), that hangs as if from one of its corners. An example is _Girl Singing_ by Frans Hals.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-CHdG_1910-11)

In [modal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic "Modal logic"), the lozenge expresses that there is "possibility". For example, the expression ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \lozenge P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4fe98838fb941f9c5aed55bb0319eecef0b6064) expresses that it is possible that ![Image 7: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is true.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bicycle_lane_sign.svg/250px-Bicycle_lane_sign.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bicycle_lane_sign.svg)

[Bicycle lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_lane "Bicycle lane")

The lozenge (technically a mascle) can be used on public roadways in the United States and Canada to mark a specific lane for a particular use. The lane will usually be painted with a lozenge at a regular interval, and signage will be installed to indicate the restrictions on using the lane. This marking is most often used to denote [high-occupancy vehicle lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane "High-occupancy vehicle lane") or [bus lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_lane "Bus lane"), with accompanying signage reading "◊ HOV LANE" or "◊ BUS LANE" and giving the requirements for a vehicle to be accepted. Prior to 17 January 2006, lozenges could also be used to mark bicycle-only lanes, often in conjunction with a bicycle icon.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-12)

Starting in August 2023 on a four-years trial in France, a white lozenge on blue background reserves lanes to car-sharing vehicles (at least one passenger besides the driver).

In [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") and [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), a lozenge marked in white paint on the road indicates an upcoming uncontrolled pedestrian crossing. Similarly, in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand") a lozenge marked in white paint on the road may be placed to indicate an upcoming pedestrian crossing. [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-13)

In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), lozenges are used on tramway signs. For instance, speed limits are shown as a black lozenge on a white background, containing the speed limit in kilometres per hour.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-14)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Vienna_Convention_road_sign_B3-V1.svg/250px-Vienna_Convention_road_sign_B3-V1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vienna_Convention_road_sign_B3-V1.svg)

[This road has priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_to_the_right "Priority to the right")

In many parts of Europe, [traffic from the right has right of way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_to_the_right "Priority to the right") at all junctions, unless otherwise stipulated. A yellow lozenge is used (typically on major routes) to indicate that the rule does not apply to the current route.

A hollow lozenge is also used in the signage of waterways[_[where?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming\_conventions\_(geographic\_names) "Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)")_] to identify a hazard. A cross is placed in the lozenge, dividing it in four, to mark a restricted area.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-15)

Square lozenge (pillow symbol)
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lozenge_(shape)&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Square lozenge (pillow symbol)")]

A similar shape, **⌑**, with concavely curved edges instead of straight lines and oriented such that its edges lie up, down, left and right, is defined in the [Miscellaneous Technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Technical "Miscellaneous Technical") Unicode block as a **square lozenge**. It is used in [travel agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_agency "Travel agency"), where it appears on the specialist keyboards used with booking terminals, where it has the familiar name, the **pillow symbol**.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-16) In the 1960s, it was used in banking and for other purposes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lozenge_(shape)#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-8)

In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"), the lozenge is encoded in multiple variants:
