An example is the number line , each point of which is described by a single real number .

[ 1 ] Any straight line or smooth curve is a one-dimensional space, regardless of the dimension of the ambient space in which the line or curve is embedded. Examples include the circle on a plane, or a parametric space curve .
In physical space , a 1D subspace is called a "linear dimension " ( rectilinear or curvilinear ), with units of length (e.g., metre ).

In algebraic geometry there are several structures that are one-dimensional spaces but are usually referred to by more specific terms. Any field K {\displaystyle K} is a one-dimensional vector space over itself. The projective line over K , {\displaystyle K,} denoted P 1 ( K ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{1}(K),} is a one-dimensional space. In particular, if the field is the complex numbers C , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,} then the complex projective line P 1 ( C ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ^{1}(\mathbb {C} )} is one-dimensional with respect to C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } (but is sometimes called the Riemann sphere , as it is a model of the sphere , two-dimensional with respect to real-number coordinates).

For every eigenvector of a linear transformation T on a vector space V , there is a one-dimensional space A ⊂ V generated by the eigenvector such that T ( A ) = A , that is, A is an invariant set under the action of T .

[ 2 ] In Lie theory , a one-dimensional subspace of a Lie algebra is mapped to a one-parameter group under the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence .

[ 3 ] More generally, a ring is a length-one module over itself. Similarly, the projective line over a ring is a one-dimensional space over the ring. In case the ring is an algebra over a field , these spaces are one-dimensional with respect to the algebra, even if the algebra is of higher dimensionality.

Coordinate systems in one-dimensional space [ edit ] Main article: Coordinate system One dimensional coordinate systems include the number line .
