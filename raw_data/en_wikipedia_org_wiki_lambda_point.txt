The lambda point is the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) makes the transition to superfluid state ( helium II ). At pressure of 1 atmosphere , the transition occurs at approximately 2.17 K . The lowest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the vapor−He-I−He-II triple point at 2.1768 K (−270.9732 °C) and 5.0418 kPa (0.049759 atm), which is the "saturated vapor pressure " at that temperature (pure helium gas in thermal equilibrium over the liquid surface, in a hermetic container).

[ 1 ] The highest pressure at which He-I and He-II can coexist is the bcc −He-I−He-II triple point with a helium solid at 1.762 K (−271.388 °C), 29.725 atm (3,011.9 kPa).

[ 2 ] The point's name derives from the graph (pictured) that results from plotting the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature (for a given pressure in the above range, in the example shown, at 1 atmosphere), which resembles the Greek letter lambda λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } . The specific heat capacity has a sharp peak as the temperature approaches the lambda point. The tip of the peak is so sharp that a critical exponent characterizing the divergence of the heat capacity can be measured precisely only in zero gravity, to provide a uniform density over a substantial volume of fluid.  Hence, the heat capacity was measured within 2 nK below the transition in an experiment included in a Space Shuttle payload in 1992.

[ 3 ] Unsolved problem in physics Explain the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical determinations of the heat capacity critical exponent α for the superfluid transition in helium-4.

[ 4 ] More unsolved problems in physics Although the heat capacity has a peak, it does not tend towards infinity (contrary to what the graph may suggest), but has finite limiting values when approaching the transition from above and below.

[ 3 ] The behavior of the heat capacity near the peak is described by the formula C ≈ ≈ A ± ± t − − α α + B ± ± {\displaystyle C\approx A_{\pm }t^{-\alpha }+B_{\pm }} where t = | 1 − − T / T c | {\displaystyle t=|1-T/T_{c}|} is the reduced temperature, T c {\displaystyle T_{c}} is the Lambda point temperature, A ± ± , B ± ± {\displaystyle A_{\pm },B_{\pm }} are constants (different above and below the transition temperature), and α is the critical exponent : α α = − − 0.0127 ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \alpha =-0.0127(3)} .

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] Since this exponent is negative for the superfluid transition, specific heat remains finite.

[ 6 ] The quoted experimental value of α is in a significant disagreement [ 7 ] [ 4 ] with the most precise theoretical determinations [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] coming from high temperature expansion techniques, Monte Carlo methods and the conformal bootstrap .

^ For other phase transitions α α {\displaystyle \alpha } may be positive (e.g.

α α ≈ ≈ + 0.1 {\displaystyle \alpha \approx +0.1} for the liquid-vapor critical point which has Ising critical exponents ). For those phase transitions specific heat does tend to infinity.
