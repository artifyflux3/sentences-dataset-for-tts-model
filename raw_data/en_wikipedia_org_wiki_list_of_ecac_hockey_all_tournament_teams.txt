Currently the team is composed of three forwards , two defensemen and one goaltender with additional players named in the event of a tie. Voting for the honor is conducted by the head coaches of each member team once the tournament has completed and any player regardless of their team's finish is eligible.

[ 1 ] The All-Tournament Team was first awarded after the premier championship in 1962 as was a Second-Team.

[ 2 ] This format continued until 1972 after which the All-Tournament team was abolished until 1988 tournament when only one All-Tournament Team was named. Since then it has continued unchanged.
