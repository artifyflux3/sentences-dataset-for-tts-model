It is also known as the adlacrimal [ 1 ] or supraorbital , although the latter term may not be confused with the supraorbital in osteichthyan fishes .

[ 2 ] In ornithischians, the palpebral can form a prong that projects from the front upper corner of the orbit. It is large in heterodontosaurids , [ 3 ] basal ornithopods such as Thescelosaurus (as Bugenasaura ) and Dryosaurus , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and basal ceratopsians such as Archaeoceratops ; [ 5 ] in these animals, the prong is elongate and would have stuck out and over the eye like a bony eyebrow . As paleoartist Gregory S. Paul has noted, elongate palpebrals would have given their owners fierce-looking " eagle eyes".

[ 6 ] In such cases, the expanded palpebral may have functioned to shade the eye.
