This is in contrast to the widespread eight-hour day , or any other time arrangement. It has also been proposed as a better alternative to the four-day week , another proposed way to reduce working time.

[ 1 ] By country [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] In Australia, the six-hour day and four-day week is supported by the Australian Greens .

[ 2 ] Finland [ edit ] In 2020, the Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin advocated for a change towards implementing a six-hour working day.

[ 3 ] The result of a Finnish study showed positive effects.

[ 4 ] The Communist Party of Finland is advocating for six-hour working day too.

[ 5 ] Italy [ edit ] In Italy, the public sector used to have a schedule of 6 hours a day for 6 days a week, i.e.  since 8 a.m.  to 2 p.m. Monday to Saturday.  Public employees used to be paid less than their private colleagues, as they worked 36 hours per week instead of 40.

When, starting in the 1980s, pressure increased for a 'long week-end', meaning a free Saturday, in most sectors [ 6 ] the 6 hours of Saturdays were moved either by extending ending time at 3:12 p.m.  or, most often, to two working afternoons of 3 hours each.  This solution also prevents public employees to have a second job, that was previously considered acceptable.

Present-day Communist Party (Italy) advocates for a widespread six-hour workday.

[ 7 ] Their electoral result for last parliament elections , however, has been as low as 0.09%, [ 8 ] showing that this measure is not considered a priority by the electorate.

Norway [ edit ] The Red Party (Norway) has advocated for a six-hour workday.

[ 9 ] Sweden [ edit ] The 6 hour workday has been subject to reoccurring debate since the early 70's after the prominent sociologist and politician Alva Myrdal proposed to implement it to Sveriges socialdemokratiska kvinnoförbund .

[ 10 ] Today there are more than a few examples of companies which already have a 6 hour workday in Sweden, and the notion of a trend towards a six-hour workday has also been mentioned.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Since 2002 there is a workplace with a 6 hour workday in the small town of Mölndal .

[ 12 ] This led to higher profitability, implemented without any decrease in wages. One of the people who works at the company claimed that "You have more energy. You're more alert. More efficient. I promise: you perform 20-30% more in six hours than eight." ("Man orkar mera. Är piggare. Effektivare. Jag lovar: Man presterar 20–30 procent mer på sex timmar än på åtta.") [ citation needed ] Several small-scale implementations of the concept have been trialed in Sweden , including the private and public sectors.

[ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Gothenburg , an experiment with 70 nurses over 18 months found decreases in sick leave, better self-reported health as well as an increase in productivity, with a cost of 1,3 million USD.

[ 17 ] Two major parties support cutting the working hours in Sweden as of 2022. The party Vänsterpartiet (the left party) is advocating a 6 hour working day without decreased pay.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Miljöpartiet de gröna (The green party) has the goal of a 30 hour workweek.

[ 19 ] Other parties advocating for 6 hour working day are: the Communist Party of Sweden [ 20 ] and the Communist Party (sweden) .

[ 21 ] About half of Swedes would rather have to work fewer hours rather than getting paid more, with women being more positive towards more free time.

[ 22 ] The majority of Swedes are in favour of shorter working weeks, with the greatest support from women and people who are engaged in so called blue-collar jobs.

[ 23 ] Switzerland [ edit ] The Swiss Party of Labour advocates for the introduction of a reduced working day (even though they ask for 35 hours, not 30).
