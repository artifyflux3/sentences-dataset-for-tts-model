An **aircraft** (pl. aircraft) is a [vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") that is able to [fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight "Flight") by gaining support from the [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"). It counters the force of gravity by using either [static lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") or the [dynamic lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)") of an [airfoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil "Airfoil"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-1) or, in a few cases, direct [downward thrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_lift "Powered lift") from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include [airplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane"), [rotorcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorcraft "Rotorcraft") (including [helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter")), [airships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship") (including [blimps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blimp "Blimp")), [gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)"), [paramotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_paragliding "Powered paragliding"), and [hot air balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon "Hot air balloon").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-wingsoverkansas-2) Part 1[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-3) (Definitions and Abbreviations) of Subchapter A of Chapter I of Title 14 of the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations states that aircraft "means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air."

The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called _[aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation")_. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called _[aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics "Aeronautics")._[Crewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircrew "Aircrew") aircraft are flown by an onboard [pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot "Aircraft pilot"), whereas [unmanned aerial vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle "Unmanned aerial vehicle") may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"). Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, [aircraft propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_aircraft#Methods_of_propulsion "Powered aircraft") (if any), usage and others.

Aviation in 19th century

The history of aviation spans over two millennia, from the earliest innovations like [kites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite "Kite") and attempts at tower jumping to [supersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_speed "Supersonic speed") and [hypersonic flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_flight "Hypersonic flight") in powered, [heavier-than-air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavier-than-air_flight "Heavier-than-air flight")[jet aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft "Jet aircraft"). Kite flying in China, dating back several hundred years BC, is considered the earliest example of man-made flight.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-:4-4) In the 15th century, [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") created flying machine designs incorporating aeronautical concepts, but they were unworkable due to the limitations of contemporary knowledge.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-5)

In the late 18th century, the [Montgolfier brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers "Montgolfier brothers") invented the [hot-air balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon "Hot air balloon") which soon led to manned flights. At almost the same time, the discovery of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas led to the invention of the [hydrogen balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_balloon "Hydrogen balloon").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-wings-tom-6) Various theories in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") by physicists during the same period, such as [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics") and [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"), led to the development of modern [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics"); most notably by [Sir George Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Cayley "Sir George Cayley"). Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with France establishing balloon companies during the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-hallion-7)

In the 19th century, especially the second half, experiments with gliders provided the basis for learning the dynamics of winged aircraft; most notably by Cayley, [Otto Lilienthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lilienthal "Otto Lilienthal"), and [Octave Chanute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_Chanute "Octave Chanute"). By the early 20th century, advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered, manned heavier-than-air flight possible for the first time. In 1903, following their pioneering research and experiments with wing design and aircraft control, the [Wright brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers") successfully incorporated all of the required elements to create and fly the first airplane.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-8) In 1906 [Charles Frederick Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Page "Charles Frederick Page") was granted the first U.S. patent for an aircraft.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-9) The basic configuration with its characteristic [cruciform tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciform_tail "Cruciform tail") was established by 1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more powerful engines.

The first vessels of the air were the rigid steerable balloons pioneered by [Ferdinand von Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Zeppelin "Ferdinand von Zeppelin") that became synonymous with [airships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship") and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large [flying boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_boat "Flying boat") became popular for trans-oceanic routes. After [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the flying boats were in turn replaced by airplanes operating from land, made far more capable first by improved [propeller engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller_engine "Propeller engine"), then by [jet engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine"), which revolutionized both civilian air travel and [military aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aviation "Military aviation").

In the latter half of the 20th century, the development of [digital electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics "Digital electronics") led to major advances in flight instrumentation and "[fly-by-wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire "Fly-by-wire")" systems. The 21st century has seen the widespread use of [pilotless drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotless_drone "Pilotless drone") for military, commercial, and recreational purposes. With computerized controls, inherently unstable aircraft designs, such as [flying wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_wing "Flying wing"), have also become practical.

Lighter-than-air aircraft or _[aerostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat "Aerostat")_ use [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies, filled with a [lifting gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas "Lifting gas") such as [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") or [hot air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon "Hot air balloon"), which is less [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") than the surrounding air. Other gases lighter than air also theoretically work, however, such gases also needs to be same for human use (non-flammable, non-toxic).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-10)

Small hot-air balloons, called [sky lanterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_lantern "Sky lantern"), were first invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations, although they also had military purposes.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-11) They, along with [kites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite "Kite"), were two forms of [unmanned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle "Unmanned aerial vehicle") aircraft that originated from China.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-12) Kites were also used in the military, but unlike sky lanterns, their flight is caused by the differences of air pressure beneath and above the kite.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-13)

A [balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aeronautics) "Balloon (aeronautics)") was originally any aerostat, while the term [airship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship") was used for large, powered aircraft designs— usually fixed-wing.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-19) In 1919, [Frederick Handley Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Handley_Page "Frederick Handley Page") was reported as referring to "ships of the air," with smaller passenger types as "Air yachts."[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-20) In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the air" or "flying-ships".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-22)

Lighter-than-air aircraft don't typically require a pilot's license in the United States.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-23) In most countries in Europe, standards for flying Lighter-than-air aircraft tend to be stricter compared to the United States.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-24)

Heavier-than-air aircraft or _aerodynes_ are denser than air and thus must find some way to obtain enough [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(physics) "Lift (physics)") that can overcome the aircraft's weight. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust — [aerodynamic lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_lift "Aerodynamic lift") by having air flowing past an [aerofoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerofoil "Aerofoil") (such dynamic interaction of aerofoils with air is the origin of the term "aerodyne"), or [powered lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_lift "Powered lift") in the form of [reactional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_(physics) "Reaction (physics)") lift from downward engine [thrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust "Thrust").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-:0-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-26)

Aerodynamic lift involving [wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing "Wing") is the most common, and can be achieved via two methods. [Fixed-wing aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft "Fixed-wing aircraft") ([airplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane") and [gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)")) achieve airflow past the wings by having the entire aircraft moving forward through the air, while [rotorcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorcraft "Rotorcraft") ([helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter") and [autogyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro "Autogyro")) do so by having [mobile, elongated wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_wing "Rotor wing") spinning rapidly around a mast in an assembly known as the [rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_rotor "Helicopter rotor").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-27)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-:0-25)

#### Fixed-wing Aircraft

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Fixed-wing Aircraft")]

[Gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(sailplane) "Glider (sailplane)") were one of the first forms of a fixed wing aircraft. They are a special type of aircraft that doesn't require an engine.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-28) The first person to successfully build a human-carrying glider was [George Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cayley "George Cayley"), who also was the first to discover the four major aerodynamic forces.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-29) The first powered aircraft ([Airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane")) was invented by [Wilbur and Orville Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers "Wright brothers").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-30)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Mil_Mi-8P%2C_Baltic_Airlines_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Mil_Mi-8P%2C_Baltic_Airlines_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mil_Mi-8P,_Baltic_Airlines_(cropped).jpg)

The [Mil Mi-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-8 "Mil Mi-8") is the most produced rotorcraft.

A _rotary-wing aircraft_, _rotorwing aircraft_ or _rotorcraft_ is a heavier-than-air aircraft with [rotary wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_wing "Rotor wing") that spin around a vertical mast to generate [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)"). The assembly of several rotor blades mounted on a single mast is referred to as a [rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_rotor "Helicopter rotor"). The [International Civil Aviation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization "International Civil Aviation Organization") (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as "supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors".[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-31)

Rotorcraft generally include aircraft where one or more rotors provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as [helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter"), [gyroplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroplane "Gyroplane"), [autogyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyro "Autogyro"), and [gyrodynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrodyne "Gyrodyne") Compound rotorcraft augment the rotor with additional thrust engines, propellers, or static lifting surfaces. Some types, such as helicopters, are capable of [vertical takeoff and landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL "VTOL"). An aircraft which uses rotor lift for vertical flight but changes to solely fixed-wing lift in horizontal flight is not a rotorcraft but a [convertiplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertiplane "Convertiplane").

#### Other methods of lift

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Other methods of lift")]

*   A [lifting body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body "Lifting body") is an aircraft which produces lift through the shape of its body, rather than its wings or rotors, like conventional aircraft. Lifting bodies were first experimented by NASA in the 1960s-70s, but the idea was already conceived in the 1950s.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-32)
*   A [powered lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_lift "Powered lift") aircraft is one which has the capability of vertical [takeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff "Takeoff") and [landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing "Landing"). These aircraft must transition from vertical to lateral movement, which is considered the most dangerous phases of a flight.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-33) Classes of powered lift types include [VTOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL "VTOL") jet aircraft (such as the [Harrier jump jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_jump_jet "Harrier jump jet")) and [tiltrotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiltrotor "Tiltrotor"), such as the [Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey "Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey"), among others.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-35)
*   An [ornithopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopter "Ornithopter") is an aircraft that produces lift through the movement of its wings, akin to how a bird flies.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-36)

Size and speed extremes
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Size and speed extremes")]

The largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the 302 ft (92 m) long British [Airlander 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlander_10 "Airlander 10"), a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and fixed-wing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90 mph (140 km/h; 78 kn), and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 lb (10,000 kg).[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-telegraph-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-airlander_cbs-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-crash_cnn-39)

The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built, as of 2016, was the [Antonov An-225 _Mriya_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya "Antonov An-225 Mriya"). That Soviet-built ([Ukrainian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_SSR "Ukrainian SSR")) six-engine transport of the 1980s was 84 m (276 ft) long, with an 88 m (289 ft) wingspan. It holds the world payload record, after transporting 428,834 lb (194,516 kg) of goods, and has flown 100 t (220,000 lb) loads commercially. With a maximum loaded weight of 550–700 t (1,210,000–1,540,000 lb), it was also the heaviest aircraft built to date. It could cruise at 500 mph (800 km/h; 430 kn).[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-biggest_fox-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-biggest_chron-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-worlds_largest_might_lose_smithsonian_2015-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-largest_aero-44) The aircraft was destroyed during the [Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-45)

The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian [Antonov An-124 _Ruslan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-124_Ruslan "Antonov An-124 Ruslan") (world's second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport),[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-2nd_nasa-46) and American [Lockheed C-5 Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-5_Galaxy "Lockheed C-5 Galaxy") transport, weighing, loaded, over 380 t (840,000 lb).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-largest_aero-44)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-wide_nasa-47) The 8-engine, piston/propeller [Hughes H-4 _Hercules_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-4_Hercules "Hughes H-4 Hercules") "Spruce Goose"— an American [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") wooden flying boat transport with a greater wingspan (94m/260 ft) than any current aircraft and a tail height equal to the tallest (Airbus A380-800 at 24.1m/78 ft)— flew only one short hop in the late 1940s and never flew out of [ground effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics) "Ground effect (aerodynamics)").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-largest_aero-44)

The largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are the [Airbus Beluga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Beluga "Airbus Beluga") cargo transport derivative of the [Airbus A300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300 "Airbus A300") jet airliner, the [Boeing Dreamlifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Dreamlifter "Boeing Dreamlifter") cargo transport derivative of the [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") jet airliner/transport (the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with a maximum weight of over 400 t (880,000 lb)),[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-wide_nasa-47) and the double-decker [Airbus A380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380 "Airbus A380") "super-jumbo" jet airliner (the world's largest passenger airliner).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-largest_aero-44)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-airbus_times-48)

The fastest fixed-wing aircraft and fastest glider, is the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle"), which re-entered the atmosphere at nearly Mach 25 or 17,500 mph (28,200 km/h)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-regimes-49)

The fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air-breathing powered aircraft was of the [NASA X-43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43 "NASA X-43")A _Pegasus_, a [scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet "Scramjet")-powered, [hypersonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed "Hypersonic speed"), [lifting body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body "Lifting body") experimental research aircraft, at [Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number "Mach number") 9.68 or 6,755 mph (10,870 km/h) on 16 November 2004.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-50)

Prior to the X-43A, the fastest recorded powered airplane flight, and still the record for the fastest manned powered airplane, was the [North American X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15"), rocket-powered airplane at Mach 6.7 or 7,274 km/h (4,520 mph) on 3 October 1967.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-manned_guinness-51)

The fastest manned, air-breathing powered airplane is the [Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird "Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird"), a U.S. [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance "Reconnaissance") jet fixed-wing aircraft, having reached 3,530 km/h (2,193 mph) on 28 July 1976.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-52)

Propulsion and steering
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Propulsion and steering")]

The main feature of unpowered aircraft is the inability to directly provide thrust through its engines. This means that all unpowered aircraft rely on the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") for sustained flight. Gliders, for example, take advantage of their aerodynamic properties to enable them to travel long distances. Techniques such as thermal circling, where gliders fly into warm air which allows them to rise, prolongs flight time.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-53) Due to the lack of an engine, initial propulsion assistance is usually necessary to ensure flight. A common glider launching method is aerotowing, where another aircraft tows the glider to an altitude from which sustained flight is possible.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-54) Steering for a glider is also rudimentary, while more complex gliders like sailplanes usually have joysticks for steering, more basic aircraft like [hang gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_gliding "Hang gliding") rely on the pilot's physical coordination to change the centre of gravity.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-55)

A powered aircraft is an aircraft with a source of mechanical power, used to produce thrust. Such sources are generally [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine "Engine"), as is the case with airplanes, but can be human-powered in more extreme cases.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-57)

Propeller aircraft, as their name suggests, rely on propellers to produce thrust for the airplane.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Compared to engines using propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about 40,000 ft (12,000 m), greater efficiency.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-hist8-58)

Although some rotorcraft, such as [rotor kites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_kites "Rotor kites"), can be unpowered, most rotorcraft are powered by either [piston engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston_engines "Piston engines") or [turboprops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprops "Turboprops"). Some rotorcraft, including autogyros and [gyrodynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrodynes "Gyrodynes"), are propelled by a conventional propeller or jet engine, with the rotor unpowered, but most modern rotorcraft have a powered rotor, allowing them to hover in place. Autogyros and gyrodynes are steered using a [rudder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder "Rudder"), similarly to propeller and jet aircraft, and rotorcraft with powered rotors, such as helicopters, turn by adjusting the pitch of the rotor cylically, so that the rotors on one side produce more lift than the other.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FaaHelicopter-59) Rotorcraft with powered rotors typically need a [tail rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_rotor "Tail rotor") to counter the rotational thrust produced by the rotor, which can cause the helicopter to spin.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FaaHelicopter-59)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Design and construction")]

The key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:

*   The _structure_ ("[airframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe")"[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-websters_3rd_new_intl_dictionary-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-asa_dictionary_3rd_ed-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-far_amt_2012_faa-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-janes_dictionary_1980-63)) comprises the main load-bearing elements and associated equipment, as well as flight controls.
*   The _propulsion system_ ("[powerplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplant "Powerplant")"[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-websters_3rd_new_intl_dictionary-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-asa_dictionary_3rd_ed-61)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-phak_glossary_faa_gov-64)) (if it is powered) comprises the power source and associated equipment, as described above.
*   The _[avionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics "Avionics")_ comprise the electrical and electronic control, navigation and communication systems.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-websters_3rd_new_intl_dictionary-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-asa_dictionary_3rd_ed-61)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-janes_dictionary_1980-63)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-dictionary_of_aviation_1974_fell-65)

A modern aerostat used by the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Homeland_Security "U.S. Department of Homeland Security"), the [Tethered Aerostat Radar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_Aerostat_Radar_System "Tethered Aerostat Radar System") (TARS)

An _aerostat_ or _lighter-than-air aircraft_ relies on [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") to maintain [flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight "Flight"). Aerostats include unpowered [balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft) "Balloon (aircraft)") (free-flying or [tethered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moored_balloon "Moored balloon")) and [powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine "Aircraft engine")[airships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship "Airship"). The [relative density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_density "Relative density") of an aerostat as a whole is lower than that of the surrounding [atmospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric "Atmospheric")[air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") (hence the name "lighter-than-air"). Its main component is one or more gas capsules made of lightweight [skins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(aeronautics) "Skin (aeronautics)"), containing a [lifting gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas "Lifting gas") (hot air, or any gas with lower density than air, typically [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") or [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium")) that [displaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(fluid) "Displacement (fluid)") a large volume of air to generate enough buoyancy to overcome its own [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight "Weight"). [Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload "Payload") (passengers and cargo) can then be carried on attached components such as a [basket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket "Basket"), a [gondola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_(airship) "Gondola (airship)"), a [cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_(aircraft) "Cabin (aircraft)") or various [hardpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardpoint "Hardpoint").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-66)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-67) With airships, which need to be able to fly against wind, the lifting gas capsules are often protected by a more rigid outer envelope or an [airframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe"), with other gasbags such as [ballonets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballonet "Ballonet") to help modulate buoyancy.

Aerostats are so named because they use [aerostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostatic "Aerostatic") buoyant force that does not require any forward movement through the surrounding air mass, resulting in the inherent ability to [levitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitation_(physics) "Levitation (physics)") and perform [vertical takeoff and landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_takeoff_and_landing "Vertical takeoff and landing"). This contrasts with the heavier-than-air [aerodynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#Heavier-than-air) that primarily use [aerodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic "Aerodynamic")[lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)"), which must have consistent airflow over an [aerofoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerofoil "Aerofoil") ([wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing "Wing")) surface to stay airborne. The term has also been used in a narrower sense, to refer to the statically [tethered balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_balloon "Tethered balloon") in contrast to the free-flying airship.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-68) This article uses the term in its broader sense.

An _aerodyne_ is a heavier-than-air aircraft that relies on [aerodynamic lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_lift "Aerodynamic lift"), or upthrust produced by the airflow, to fly. Aerodynes include [rotorcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorcraft "Rotorcraft"), [airplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplanes "Airplanes"), [gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)"), and several other varieties of aircraft. Airplanes use wings, or airfoils, to direct the airflow to produce lift. Wings are usually constructed with a wooden or metal inner framework, and a [skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(aeronautics) "Skin (aeronautics)") stretched over it.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-69) Rotorcraft use a [rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_wing "Rotor wing") which acts like a rotating wing, allowing them to hover in place. When aerodynes carry a payload, it is usually carried inside the aircraft's fuselage, or central structure, but aerodynes can also carry loads attached outside the aircraft or inside the wing. Unlike aerostats, which control their altitude by changing their weight, aerodynes use control surfaces to control their altitude, or raise or lower the lift on their wing by adjusting their speed.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-70) As they typically travel at higher speeds than aerostats, most aerodynes have a rigid structure consisting of a frame covered by a skin.

The source of motive power for an aircraft is normally called the _[powerplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplant "Powerplant"),_ and includes [engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine "Engine") or [motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor "Motor"), [propeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller "Propeller") or [rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_rotor "Helicopter rotor"), (if any), [jet nozzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_nozzle "Jet nozzle") and [thrust reversers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_reverser "Thrust reverser") (if any), and accessories essential to the functioning of the engine or motor (e.g.: [starter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_motor "Starter motor"), [ignition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system "Ignition system"), [intake system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake "Intake"), [exhaust system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_system "Exhaust system"), [fuel system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_fuel_system "Aircraft fuel system"), [lubrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubrication "Lubrication") system, [engine cooling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_cooling_system "Engine cooling system"), and [engine controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engine_controls&action=edit&redlink=1 "Engine controls (page does not exist)")).[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-websters_3rd_new_intl_dictionary-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-asa_dictionary_3rd_ed-61)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-phak_glossary_faa_gov-64)

Powered aircraft are typically powered by [internal combustion engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "Internal combustion engine") ([piston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston_engine "Piston engine")[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-internal_combustion_engine_grc_nasa_gov-71) or [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine_engine "Gas turbine engine")[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-engines_grc_nasa_gov-72)) burning [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels "Fossil fuels")—typically [gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline "Gasoline") ([avgas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avgas "Avgas")) or [jet fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel"). A very few are powered by [rocket power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine "Rocket engine"), [ramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramjet "Ramjet") propulsion, or by [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motors "Electric motors"), or by internal combustion engines of other types, or using other fuels. A very few have been powered, for short flights, by [human muscle energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-powered_aircraft "Human-powered aircraft") (e.g.: [Gossamer Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossamer_Condor "Gossamer Condor")).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-natl_air_and_space_museum_bryan-73)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-janes_encyclopedia_of_aviation-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-electrified_aircraft_nasa_gov-75)

The avionics comprise any _electronic_[aircraft flight control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_flight_control_system "Aircraft flight control system") and related equipment, including electronic [cockpit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit") instrumentation, navigation, [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"), monitoring, and [communications systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_system "Communications system").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-websters_3rd_new_intl_dictionary-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-asa_dictionary_3rd_ed-61)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-janes_dictionary_1980-63)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-dictionary_of_aviation_1974_fell-65)

Flight characteristics
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Flight characteristics")]

The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms of [airspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed "Airspeed"), [load factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_factor_(aeronautics) "Load factor (aeronautics)") and altitude.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-76)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-77)

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Boeing_777-200LR_banking_over_mountain.jpg/250px-Boeing_777-200LR_banking_over_mountain.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_777-200LR_banking_over_mountain.jpg)

The [Boeing 777-200LR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777#777-200LR "Boeing 777") is one of the longest-range airliners, capable of flights of more than halfway around the world.

The maximal total _range_ is the maximum distance an aircraft can fly between [takeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff "Takeoff") and [landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing "Landing"). [Powered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_aircraft "Powered aircraft") range is limited by the [aviation fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_fuel "Aviation fuel") energy storage capacity (chemical or electrical) considering both weight and volume limits.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-78)[Unpowered aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpowered_aircraft "Unpowered aircraft") range depends on factors such as cross-country speed and environmental conditions. The range can be seen as the cross-country [ground speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_speed "Ground speed") multiplied by the maximum time in the air. The fuel time limit for powered aircraft is fixed by the available fuel (considering reserve fuel requirements) and rate of consumption. The [Airbus A350-900ULR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350#A350-900ULR "Airbus A350") is among the longest range airliners.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-ArBsigger-A000-79)

Some aircraft can gain energy while airborne through the environment (e.g. collecting solar energy or through rising air currents from mechanical or thermal lifting) or from in-flight refueling. These aircraft could theoretically have an infinite range.

_Ferry range_ means the maximum range that an aircraft engaged in [ferry flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry_flying "Ferry flying") can achieve. This usually means maximum [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") load, optionally with extra fuel tanks and minimum equipment. It refers to the transport of aircraft without any passengers or cargo. _[Combat radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat\_radius "Combat radius")_ is a related measure based on the maximum distance a warplane can travel from its base of operations, accomplish some objective, and return to its original airfield with minimal reserves.

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg/250px-Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_dynamics_with_text.svg)

Flight dynamics

_Flight dynamics_ is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [angles of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles_of_rotation "Angles of rotation") in three [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions "Dimensions") about the vehicle's [center of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_gravity "Center of gravity") (cg), known as _pitch_, _roll_ and _yaw_. These are collectively known as _aircraft attitude_, often principally relative to the atmospheric frame in normal flight, but also relative to terrain during takeoff or landing, or when operating at low elevation. The concept of attitude is not specific to fixed-wing aircraft, but also extends to [rotary aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_aircraft "Rotary aircraft") such as helicopters, and [dirigibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigibles "Dirigibles"), where the flight dynamics involved in establishing and controlling attitude are entirely different.

[Control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system") adjust the orientation of a vehicle about its cg. A control system includes control surfaces which, when deflected, generate a moment (or couple from ailerons) about the cg which rotates the aircraft in pitch, roll, and yaw. For example, a [pitching moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitching_moment "Pitching moment") comes from a force applied at a distance forward or aft of the cg, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

A [fixed-wing aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft "Fixed-wing aircraft") increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [angle of attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack "Angle of attack") (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)") making it advantageous to keep the [sideslip angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_(aerodynamics) "Slip (aerodynamics)") near zero, though an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" to increase drag and descent rate during landing, to keep aircraft heading same as runway heading during cross-wind landings and during flight with asymmetric power.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-80)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Aircraft_tail.JPG/250px-Aircraft_tail.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aircraft_tail.JPG)

The [empennage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empennage "Empennage") of a [Boeing 747-200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747")

A fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require [horizontal and vertical stabilisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_(aeronautics) "Stabilizer (aeronautics)"),[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-Crane-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-GroundUp-82) which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-83) These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the [flight dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics") of pitch and yaw.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-Crane-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-GroundUp-82)

In [fixed-wing aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft "Fixed-wing aircraft"), multiple [control surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_control_surfaces "Flight control surfaces") are used to adjust the aircraft's roll, pitch, and yaw. [Ailerons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailerons "Ailerons"), hinged surfaces normally located on the rear edge of the wing, can raise or lower the lift produced by one side of the wing, causing the aircraft to bank to one side. [Elevators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevators "Elevators"), usually located in the [horizontal stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_stabilizer "Horizontal stabilizer"), are used to increase or decrease the lift produced by the [tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_(aircraft) "Tail (aircraft)"), causing the aircraft to pitch upwards or downwards, which in turn affects the lift of the wing.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FAAcontrols-84) However, when the ailerons are used to turn an aircraft to the left, the right aileron must be tilted downwards, producing more [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_drag "Aerodynamic drag") than the left aileron and causing the aircraft to [yaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_(aviation) "Yaw (aviation)") right. To counteract this force, most fixed-wing aircraft have a [rudder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder "Rudder") mounted on the [vertical stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_stabilizer "Vertical stabilizer") which can deflect the airflow to the tail left or right to control the aircraft's yaw.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FAAcontrols-84) In rotorcraft, control is mainly accomplished through the cyclical tilting of the rotor's blades, increasing the [angle of attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack "Angle of attack") of the blades on one side and decreasing the angle of attack on the other.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FAArotor-85) Similarly to the rudder on fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft with powered rotors have a [tail rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_rotor "Tail rotor"), which counters the rotational thrust produced by the rotor and allows the aircraft to turn in forward flight.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-FAArotor-85) Rotorcraft with unpowered rotors, such as [autogyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogyros "Autogyros"), use a rudder for yaw.

Environmental impact

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Environmental impact")]

Aircraft engines produce gases, [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_noise "Aircraft noise"), and [particulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates "Particulates") from [fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") combustion, raising [environmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical) "Environment (biophysical)") concerns over their global effects and on local air quality.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-86)

[Jet airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliners "Jet airliners") contribute to [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") by emitting [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") (CO 2), the best understood [greenhouse gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas"), and, with less [scientific understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"), [nitrogen oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides "Nitrogen oxides"), [contrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_trails "Condensation trails") and particulates. Their [radiative forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing "Radiative forcing") is estimated at 1.4 that of CO 2 alone, excluding induced [cirrus cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_cloud "Cirrus cloud") with a very low level of scientific understanding. In 2018, global commercial operations generated 2.4% of CO 2 emissions.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-ICCTsep2019-87) Jet airliners have become more fuel efficient and CO 2 emissions per revenue [ton-kilometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton-kilometer "Ton-kilometer") (RTK) in 2018 were 47% of those in 1990. In 2018, CO 2 emissions averaged 88 grams of CO 2 per revenue passenger per km. While the [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation") industry is more [fuel efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficient "Fuel efficient"), overall emissions have risen as the volume of [air travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel "Air travel") has increased. By 2020, aviation emissions were 70% higher than in 2005 and they could grow by 300% by 2050.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-EC-aviation-88)

[Airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airports "Airports") can generate [water pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution "Water pollution") due to their extensive handling of [jet fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel "Jet fuel") and [deicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing "Deicing") chemicals if not [contained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spill_containment "Spill containment"), contaminating nearby water bodies. Aviation activities emit [ozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone "Ozone") and [ultrafine particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafine_particles "Ultrafine particles"), both of which are [health hazards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_hazard "Health hazard").

A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-gunston-89) Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:

*   Combat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy enemy equipment using its own armament.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-gunston-89) Combat aircraft are typically developed and procured only by military forces.
*   Non-combat aircraft, such as [transports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft "Military transport aircraft") and [tankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(aircraft) "Tanker (aircraft)"), are not designed for combat as their primary function but may carry weapons for self-defense. These mainly operate in support roles, and may be developed by either military forces or civilian organizations.

[Agusta A109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW109 "AgustaWestland AW109") helicopter of the [Swiss air rescue service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rega_(air_rescue) "Rega (air rescue)") in July 2009.

_Civil aviation_ is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state [aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation "Aviation"), which can be both private and commercial. Most countries in the world are members of the [International Civil Aviation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization "International Civil Aviation Organization") and work together to establish common [Standards and Recommended Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_and_Recommended_Practices "Standards and Recommended Practices") for civil aviation through that agency.

Civil aviation includes three major categories:

*   [Commercial air transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline "Airline"), including scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights
*   Aerial work, in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, photography, surveying, search and rescue, etc.
*   [General aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_aviation "General aviation") (GA), including all other civil flights, private or commercial[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-ICAO-90)

Although scheduled air transport is the larger operation in terms of passenger numbers, GA is larger in the number of flights (and flight hours, in the U.S.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-91)) In the U.S., GA carries 166 million passengers each year,[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-92) more than any individual airline, though less than all the airlines combined. Since 2004, the U.S. airlines combined have carried over 600 million passengers each year, and in 2014, they carried a combined 662,819,232 passengers.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-93)

Some countries also make a regulatory distinction based on whether aircraft are flown for hire, like:

*   [Commercial aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aviation "Commercial aviation") includes most or all flying done for hire, particularly scheduled service on [airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline "Airline"); and
*   [Private aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_aviation "Private aviation") includes pilots flying for their own purposes (recreation, business meetings, etc.) without receiving any kind of remuneration.

A [737-800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737 "Boeing 737") of [United Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines "United Airlines") landing at [San Diego International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_International_Airport "San Diego International Airport") in November 2010. This is an example of a commercial aviation service.

All scheduled air transport is commercial, but general aviation can be either commercial or private. Normally, the pilot, aircraft, and operator must all be authorized to perform commercial operations through separate commercial licensing, registration, and operation certificates.

A model aircraft, weighing six grams

An _experimental aircraft_ is an aircraft intended for testing new [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace "Aerospace") technologies and design concepts.

The term _research aircraft_ or _[testbed aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed\_aircraft "Testbed aircraft")_, by contrast, generally denotes aircraft modified to perform scientific studies, such as weather research or geophysical surveying, similar to a [research vessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel "Research vessel").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-94)

The term "experimental aircraft" also has specific legal meaning in Australia, the United States and some other countries; usually used to refer to aircraft flown with an [experimental certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airworthiness_certificate#Special_airworthiness_certificate "Airworthiness certificate").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-95) In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), this also includes most [homebuilt aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebuilt_aircraft "Homebuilt aircraft"), many of which are based on conventional designs and hence are experimental only in name because of certain restrictions in operation.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft#cite_note-96)

Model aircraft are typically small-scale replicas of flying aircraft, or new designs built smaller than most [passenger aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_aircraft "Passenger aircraft"). Static model aircraft, which cannot fly, are usually not considered to be aircraft, but they can be used to test aspects of a flying aircraft, such as its aerodynamics. Flying models are commonly propelled by [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motors "Electric motors"), [combustion engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_engines "Combustion engines"), or are [gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft) "Glider (aircraft)"), but there are many alternate methods of propulsion, such as wound rubber bands and small [jet engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engines "Jet engines"). Most flying model aircraft are either [radio-controlled aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_aircraft "Radio-controlled aircraft"), fly freely, or are controlled by wires held by the pilot.
