Abbreviation ISO 7001 Year started October 1980 ( 1980-10 ) First published October 1980 ; 44 years ago ( 1980-10 ) Latest version 4 2023 Organization International Organization for Standardization Committee ISO/TC 145/SC 1 Public information symbols Domain Public information symbol design Website www .iso .org /standard /77442 .html ISO 7001 ("public information symbols") is a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization that defines a set of pictograms and symbols for public information. The latest version, ISO 7001:2023, was published in February 2023.

[ 1 ] The set is the result of extensive testing in several countries and different cultures and have met the criteria for comprehensibility set up by the ISO.

[ 1 ] The design process and testing of ISO 7001 symbols is governed by ISO 22727:2007, Graphical symbols — Creation and design of public information symbols — Requirements .

[ 2 ] Common examples of public information symbols include those representing toilets, car parking, and information, and the International Symbol of Access .

History [ edit ] ISO 7001 was first released in October 1980, with a single amendment in 1985. The second edition was released in February 1990, with one amendment in 1993. The third edition, the latest edition was released in November 2007, and has received four amendments in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The use of the symbols of ISO 7001 is recommended by the European standard EN 17210.

[ 3 ] Implementation [ edit ] Example of the same sign using different contrasting colors.

ISO 7001 sets out some general guidelines for how symbols should be utilized, though large aspects are left up to the decision of the individual or entity designing signage for their facility. 
Symbols were created with the goal of being able to stand alone, without any accompanying text. However, text can be used to further aid in communicating the message, particularly in a situation where a custom symbol has been designed for a unique situation not covered by standard ISO 7001 symbols. Specific sizes for symbols are not provided in ISO 7001, though symbols are designed with the goal of being clearly understood regardless placed on something as small as a floor plan of a building or as a large as a giant sign hanging from a ceiling in a large open space.

[ 2 ] While symbols are intended and recommended to be reproduced as presented in ISO 7001, the ISO acknowledges that situations may exist where a symbol should be modified due to national or cultural needs of a particular situation. Though key elements and the intent of the original symbol design must be retained to ensure it will be effective.

[ 2 ] No colours are specified in ISO 7001, with the only guidance being to ensure clear contrast between the symbol and the sign background, as well as the environment the sign is in.
There is a clear recommendation against using colors specified in ISO 3864 , due to possible confusion with safety signage using those colors. Of explicit concern is green and white, due to the risk of confusing a green and white 'PI PF 030' direction arrow symbol, for an ISO 7010 evacuation route arrow.

[ 2 ] To avoid possible confusion with similar safety symbols of ISO 7010, symbols in ISO 7001 do not use the standard prohibition symbol consisting of a red circle with a red slash. Instead, either a red 'slash' or red 'cross' is used. A slash is used when an object is prohibited, and covers the entire symbol. A cross is used in situations where a behavior is prohibited, with the cross placed over the portion of the symbol depicting the behavior that is being prohibited rather than the entire symbol.

[ 2 ] Example of the 'slash' on its own, positioned according to ISO 22727:2007.

Example of the 'cross' on its own.

[ a ] Example of a 'slash' on BP 015: 'No headwear'. Note how the red slash is centered on the entire symbol.

Example of a 'cross' on BP 014: 'Do not smile'. Note how the red cross is specifically centered on the smile.

Example of a 'cross' on BP 019: 'Single person'. Note how the red cross is specifically centered on the two people in the background The slash and cross can be added to other symbols, such as a baggage cart to indicate 'no baggage carts'. ISO 7001 states that when symbols are designed, they should not have key elements that would be obstructed by the slash as positioned on the template provided in ISO 22727:2007. The slash or cross must be on top of the symbol, and should be red in color.

[ 2 ] Symbols [ edit ] The standard consists of 177 symbols, divided into seven categories: accessibility, public facilities, transport facilities, behaviour of the public, commercial facilities, tourism, cultural and heritage and sporting activities.
