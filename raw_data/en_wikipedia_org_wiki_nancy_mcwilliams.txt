Psychoanalytic Diagnosis [ edit ] McWilliams' 1994 book Psychoanalytic Diagnosis , published in a second edition in 2011, is considered by psychoanalysts and psychodynamic psychotherapists to be a classic text on the diagnosis of patients within these theoretical frameworks.

[ 7 ] It was described by Otto F. Kernberg as serving an "essential function" in educating about a psychoanalytic understanding of personality and personality disorders.

[ 8 ] The book criticizes the approach to diagnosis widely adopted in the United States following the publication of the DSM-III in 1980, [ 5 ] and instead attempts to develop an alternative approach that mixes elements of classical drive theory , object relations theory , ego psychology , neurobiology , attachment theory , and modern psychodynamic theory in general, often taking a relational perspective.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It relates these theoretical considerations to their implications for the practice of psychotherapy .

In contrast to the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual , Psychoanalytic Diagnosis is focused chiefly on personality , and in particular personality disorders . While the book takes an eclectic approach, [ 7 ] it does propose a specific diagnostic framework containing nine distinct "types of character organization", namely: [ 5 ] psychopathic personalities, which correspond to antisocial personality disorder in the DSM ; narcissistic personalities, which correspond to narcissistic personality disorder ; schizoid personalities, which encompass schizoid personality disorder , schizotypal personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder , and relates to schizotypy and the schizophrenia spectrum in general; paranoid personalities, which correspond to paranoid personality disorder ; depressive and manic personalities, which relate to various DSM diagnoses, including the former depressive personality disorder ; [ 5 ] : 235 masochistic or self-defeating personalities, which correspond to the unrecognized self-defeating personality disorder ; obsessive and compulsive personalities, which correspond to obsessive–compulsive personality disorder ; hysterical or histrionic personalities, which correspond to histrionic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder ; [ 9 ] and dissociative psychologies, which relate to various psychological phenomena, including derealization , depersonalization , the associated depersonalization–derealization disorder , and in extreme cases, dissociative identity disorder .

These personalities are described in terms of their underlying defense mechanisms , of which the book outlines ten "primary defensive processes" and another fifteen "secondary defensive processes".

[ 5 ] Additionally, the book identifies a spectrum of developmental levels of organization, which is partitioned into three sections, namely the neurotic , borderline and psychotic ranges of functioning.

[ 5 ] Here, "borderline" is used in the sense of Otto Kernberg's borderline personality organization [ 10 ] (BPO), which is distinct from what is now usually called borderline personality disorder (BPD).
