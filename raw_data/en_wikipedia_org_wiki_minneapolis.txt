[ 4 ] With a population of 429,954 as of the 2020 census , it is the state's most populous city .

[ 7 ] Located in the state's center near the eastern border, it occupies both banks of the Upper Mississippi River and adjoins Saint Paul , the state capital of Minnesota. Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and the surrounding area are collectively known as the Twin Cities , a metropolitan area with 3.69 million residents.

[ 14 ] Minneapolis is built on an artesian aquifer on flat terrain and is known for cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers. Nicknamed the "City of Lakes", [ 15 ] Minneapolis is abundant in water, with thirteen lakes , wetlands, the Mississippi River , creeks, and waterfalls. The city's public park system is connected by the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway .

Dakota people previously inhabited the site of today's Minneapolis.

European colonization and settlement began north of Fort Snelling along Saint Anthony Falls —the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River.

[ 16 ] Location near the fort and the falls' power—with its potential for industrial activity—fostered the city's early growth. For a time in the 19th century, Minneapolis was the lumber and flour milling capital of the world, and as home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , it has preserved its financial clout into the 21st century. A Minneapolis Depression-era labor strike brought about federal worker protections. Work in Minneapolis contributed to the computing industry, and the city is the birthplace of General Mills , the Pillsbury brand, Target Corporation , and Thermo King mobile refrigeration.

The city's major arts institutions include the Minneapolis Institute of Art , the Walker Art Center , and the Guthrie Theater . Four professional sports teams play downtown.

Prince is survived by his favorite venue, the First Avenue nightclub . Minneapolis is home to the University of Minnesota 's main campus. The city's public transport is provided by Metro Transit , and the international airport , serving the Twin Cities region, is located towards the south on the city limits.

Residents adhere to more than fifty religions. Despite its well-regarded quality of life, [ 17 ] Minneapolis has stark disparities among its residents—arguably the most critical issue confronting the city in the 21st century.

[ 18 ] Governed by a mayor-council system, Minneapolis has a political landscape dominated by the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), with Jacob Frey serving as mayor since 2018.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Minneapolis Dakota homeland [ edit ] Further information: Dakota people , Ojibwe , Bdóte , and US–Dakota War of 1862 Two Indigenous nations inhabited the area now called Minneapolis.

[ 19 ] Archaeologists have evidence that since 1000 A.D., [ 20 ] they were the Dakota (one half of the Sioux nation), [ 21 ] and, after the 1700s, [ 22 ] the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa, members of the Anishinaabe nations).

[ 23 ] Dakota people have different stories to explain their creation.

[ 24 ] One widely accepted story says the Dakota emerged from Bdóte , [ 24 ] the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers . Dakota are the only inhabitants of the Minneapolis area who claimed no other land; [ 25 ] they have no traditions of having immigrated.

[ 26 ] In 1680, cleric Louis Hennepin , who was probably the first European to see the Minneapolis waterfall the Dakota people call Owámniyomni , renamed it the Falls of St.

Anthony of Padua for his patron saint.

[ 27 ] Dakota non-combatants living in a concentration camp at Fort Snelling during the winter of 1862 [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In the space of sixty years, the US seized all of the Dakota land and forced them out of their homeland.

[ 30 ] Purchasing most of modern-day Minneapolis, Zebulon Pike made the 1805 Treaty of St. Peter with the Dakota.

[ b ] Pike bought a 9-square-mile (23 km 2 ) strip of land—coinciding with the sacred place of Dakota origin [ 24 ] —on the Mississippi south of Saint Anthony Falls, [ 34 ] with the agreement the US would build a military fort and trading post there and the Dakota would retain their usufructuary rights.

[ 35 ] In 1819, the US Army built Fort Snelling [ 36 ] to direct Native American trade away from British-Canadian traders and to deter war between the Dakota and Ojibwe in northern Minnesota.

[ 37 ] Under pressure from US officials [ 38 ] in a series of treaties, the Dakota ceded their land first to the east and then to the west of the Mississippi, the river that runs through Minneapolis.

[ 39 ] [ c ] Dakota leaders twice refused to sign the next treaty until they were paid for the previous one.

[ 51 ] In the decades following these treaty signings, the federal US government rarely honored their terms.

[ 52 ] At the beginning of the American Civil War, annuity payments owed in June 1862 to the Dakota by treaty were late, causing acute hunger among the Dakota.

[ 53 ] [ d ] Facing starvation [ 55 ] a faction of the Dakota declared war in August and killed settlers.

[ 56 ] Serving without any prior military experience, US commander Henry Sibley commanded raw recruits, [ 57 ] volunteer mounted troops from Minneapolis and Saint Paul with no military experience.

[ 58 ] The war went on for six weeks in the Minnesota River valley.

[ 59 ] After a kangaroo court , [ 60 ] [ e ] 38 Dakota men were hanged.

[ 59 ] [ f ] The army force-marched 1,700 non-hostile Dakota men, women, children, and elders 150 miles (240 km) to a concentration camp at Fort Snelling .

[ 28 ] [ 77 ] Minneapolitans reportedly threatened more than once to attack the camp.

[ 78 ] In 1863, the US "abrogated and annulled" all treaties with the Dakota.

[ 79 ] With Governor Alexander Ramsey calling for their extermination, [ 80 ] most Dakota were exiled from Minnesota.

[ 81 ] While the Dakota were being expelled, Franklin Steele laid claim to the east bank of Saint Anthony Falls , [ 82 ] and John H. Stevens built a home on the west bank.

[ 83 ] In the Dakota language , the city's name is Bde Óta Othúŋwe ('Many Lakes Town').

[ g ] Residents had divergent ideas on names for their community.

Charles Hoag proposed combining the Dakota word for 'water' ( mni [ h ] ) with the Greek word for 'city' ( polis ), yielding Minneapolis . In 1851, after a meeting of the Minnesota Territorial Legislature , leaders of east bank St. Anthony lost their bid to move the capital from Saint Paul, but they eventually won the state university.

[ 90 ] In 1856, the territorial legislature authorized Minneapolis as a town on the Mississippi's west bank.

[ 86 ] Minneapolis was incorporated as a city in 1867, and in 1872, it merged with St. Anthony.

[ 91 ] Industries develop [ edit ] Saint Anthony Falls c.

1850s Loading flour, Pillsbury , 1939 Minneapolis originated around a source of energy: Saint Anthony Falls, the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi.

[ 16 ] Each of the city's two founding industries—flour and lumber milling—developed in the 19th century nearly concurrently, and each came to prominence for about fifty years.

[ j ] In 1884, the value of Minneapolis flour milling was the world's highest.

[ 96 ] In 1899, Minneapolis outsold every other lumber market in the world.

[ 97 ] Through its expanding mill industries, Minneapolis earned the nickname "Mill City".

[ 98 ] Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six companies manufactured artificial limbs.

[ 99 ] Disasters struck in the late 19th century: the Eastman tunnel under the river leaked in 1869; twice, fire destroyed the entire row of sawmills on the east bank; [ 100 ] an explosion of flour dust at the Washburn A mill killed eighteen people [ 101 ] and demolished about half the city's milling capacity; [ 102 ] and in 1893, fire spread from Nicollet Island to Boom Island to northeast Minneapolis, destroyed twenty blocks, and killed two people.

[ 103 ] The lumber industry was built around forests in northern Minnesota, largely by lumbermen emigrating from Maine 's depleting forests.

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] The region's waterways were used to transport logs well after railroads developed; the Mississippi River carried logs to St. Louis until the early 20th century.

[ 106 ] In 1871, of the thirteen mills sawing lumber in St. Anthony, eight ran on water power, and five ran on steam power.

[ 107 ] Auxiliary businesses on the river's west bank included woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and wood-planing.

[ 108 ] Minneapolis supplied the materials for farmsteads and settlement of rapidly expanding cities on the prairies that lacked wood.

[ 109 ] White pine milled in Minneapolis built Miles City, Montana ; Bismarck, North Dakota ; Sioux Falls, South Dakota ; Omaha, Nebraska ; and Wichita, Kansas .

[ 110 ] Growing use of steam power freed lumbermen and their sawmills from dependence on the falls.

[ 111 ] Lumbering's decline began around the turn of the century, [ 112 ] and sawmills in the city including the Weyerhauser mill closed by 1919.

[ 113 ] After depleting Minnesota's white pine, [ 114 ] some lumbermen moved on to Douglas fir in the Pacific Northwest .

[ 115 ] Seymour Cray and colleagues began work on the CDC 6600 (pictured) in downtown Minneapolis and completed the project in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin , in 1963.

[ 116 ] In 1877, Cadwallader C. Washburn co-founded Washburn-Crosby, [ 117 ] the company that became General Mills .

[ 118 ] [ k ] Washburn and partner John Crosby [ 119 ] sent Austrian civil engineer William de la Barre to Hungary where he acquired innovations through industrial espionage .

[ 120 ] De la Barre calculated and managed the power at the falls and encouraged steam for auxiliary power.

[ 121 ] Charles Alfred Pillsbury and the C. A. Pillsbury Company across the river hired Washburn-Crosby employees and began using the new methods.

[ 120 ] The hard red spring wheat grown in Minnesota became valuable, and Minnesota "patent" flour was recognized at the time as the best bread flour in the world.

[ 120 ] In 1900, fourteen percent of America's grain was milled in Minneapolis [ 120 ] and about one third of that was shipped overseas.

[ 122 ] Overall production peaked at 18.5 million barrels in 1916.

[ 123 ] Decades of soil exhaustion , stem rust , and changes in freight tariffs combined to quash the city's flour industry.

[ 124 ] In the 1920s, Washburn-Crosby and Pillsbury developed new milling centers in Buffalo, New York , and Kansas City, Missouri , while maintaining their headquarters in Minneapolis.

[ 125 ] The falls became a national historic district , [ 126 ] and the upper St. Anthony lock and dam was permanently closed to traffic.

[ 127 ] The city announced that in accordance with a 2020 act of Congress, ownership of 5 acres (2.0 hectares) of federal land around the falls will transfer in 2026 to a Dakota-led nonprofit Owámniyomni Okhódayapi.

[ 128 ] Columnist Don Morrison says that after the milling era waned a "modern, major city" emerged.

[ 129 ] Around 1900, Minneapolis attracted skilled workers [ 130 ] who leveraged expertise from the University of Minnesota.

[ 131 ] In 1923, Munsingwear was the world's largest manufacturer of underwear.

[ 132 ] Frederick McKinley Jones invented mobile refrigeration in Minneapolis, and with his associate founded Thermo King in 1938.

[ 133 ] In 1949, Medtronic was founded in a Minneapolis garage.

[ 134 ] Minneapolis-Honeywell built a south Minneapolis campus where their experience regulating control systems earned them military contracts for the Norden bombsight and the C-1 autopilot .

[ 135 ] In 1957, Control Data began in downtown Minneapolis, [ 136 ] where in the CDC 1604 computer they replaced vacuum tubes with transistors .

[ 137 ] A highly successful business until disbanded in 1990, Control Data opened a facility in economically depressed north Minneapolis, bringing jobs and good publicity.

[ 136 ] A University of Minnesota computing group released Gopher in 1991; three years later, the World Wide Web superseded Gopher traffic.

Social tensions [ edit ] Further information: List of incidents of civil unrest in Minneapolis–Saint Paul and 2020–2023 Minneapolis–Saint Paul racial unrest Battle between striking teamsters and police , 1934. The May (pictured) and subsequent July battles killed four men, two on each side.

[ 139 ] In many ways, the 20th century in Minneapolis was a difficult time of bigotry and malfeasance, beginning with four decades of corruption.

[ 140 ] Known initially as a kindly physician, mayor Doc Ames made his brother police chief, ran the city into crime, and tried to leave town in 1902.

[ 141 ] The Ku Klux Klan was a force in the city from 1921 [ 142 ] until 1923.

[ 143 ] The gangster Kid Cann engaged in bribery and intimidation between the 1920s and the 1940s.

[ 144 ] After Minnesota passed a eugenics law in 1925, the proprietors of Eitel Hospital sterilized people at Faribault State Hospital .

[ 145 ] During the summer of 1934 and the financial downturn of the Great Depression, the Citizens' Alliance , an association of employers, refused to negotiate with teamsters . The truck drivers union executed strikes in May and July–August.

[ 146 ] Charles Rumford Walker said that Minneapolis teamsters succeeded in part due to the "military precision of the strike machine".

[ 147 ] The union victory ultimately led to 1935 and 1938 federal laws protecting workers' rights.

[ 148 ] From the end of World War I in 1918 until 1950, antisemitism was commonplace in Minneapolis— Carey McWilliams called the city the antisemitic capital of the US.

[ 149 ] Starting in 1936, a fascist hate group known as the Silver Shirts held meetings in the city.

[ 150 ] In the 1940s, mayor Hubert Humphrey worked to rescue the city's reputation [ 151 ] and helped the city establish the country's first municipal fair employment practices [ 152 ] and a human-relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities.

[ 153 ] However, the lives of Black people had not been improved.

[ 154 ] In 1966 and 1967—years of significant turmoil across the US —suppressed anger among the Black population was released in two disturbances on Plymouth Avenue.

[ 155 ] Historian Iric Nathanson says young Blacks confronted police, arson caused property damage, and "random gunshots" caused minor injuries in what was a "relatively minor incident" in Minneapolis compared to the loss of life and property in similar incidents in Detroit and Newark.

[ 156 ] A coalition reached a peaceful outcome but again failed to solve Black poverty and unemployment.

[ 157 ] In the wake of unrest and voter backlash, Charles Stenvig , a law-and-order candidate, became mayor in 1969, and governed for almost a decade.

[ 158 ] [ 159 ] The American Indian Movement 's Heart of the Earth Survival School in 1983 Disparate events defined the second half of the 20th century. Between 1958 and 1963, Minneapolis demolished " skid row ".

[ l ] Gone were 35 acres (10 ha) with more than 200 buildings, or roughly 40 percent of downtown, including the Gateway District and its significant architecture such as the Metropolitan Building .

[ 161 ] Opened in 1967, I-35W displaced Black and Mexican neighborhoods [ 162 ] in south Minneapolis.

[ 163 ] In 1968, relocated Native Americans founded the American Indian Movement (AIM) [ 164 ] in Minneapolis. Begun as an alternative to public and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools , AIM's Heart of the Earth Survival School taught Native American traditions to children for nearly twenty years.

[ 165 ] A same-sex Minneapolis couple appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court but their marriage license was denied.

[ 166 ] They managed to get a license and marry in 1971, [ 166 ] forty years before Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage .

[ 167 ] Immigration helped to curb the city's mid-20th century population decline. But because of a few radicalized persons, the city's large Somali population was targeted with discrimination after 9/11 , when its hawalas or banks were closed.

[ 168 ] In 2020, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier recorded the murder of George Floyd ; [ 169 ] Frazier's video contradicted the police department's initial statement.

[ 170 ] Floyd, a Black man, suffocated when Derek Chauvin , a White Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Reporting on the local reaction , The New York Times said that "over three nights, a five-mile stretch of Minneapolis sustained extraordinary damage" [ 171 ] —destruction included a police station that demonstrators overran and set on fire.

[ 172 ] Floyd's murder sparked international rebellions, mass protests, [ 173 ] and locally, years of ongoing unrest over racial injustice.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] As of 2024, protest continued daily at the intersection where Floyd died, now known as George Floyd Square , with the slogan "No justice, no street".

[ 175 ] Minneapolis gathered ideas for the square and through community engagement promised final proposals for the end of 2024, that could be implemented by 2026 or thereafter.

[ 176 ] Protesters continued to ask for twenty-four reforms—many now met; a sticking point was ending qualified immunity for police.

[ 175 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Minneapolis Further information: Climate of Minnesota , Climate of Minneapolis–Saint Paul , and Geology of Minnesota The city's largest lake, Bde Maka Ska [ 177 ] The history and economic growth of Minneapolis are linked to water, the city's defining physical characteristic.

Long periods of glaciation and interglacial melt carved several riverbeds through what is now Minneapolis.

[ 178 ] During the last glacial period , around 10,000 years ago, ice buried in these ancient river channels melted, resulting in basins that filled with water to become the lakes of Minneapolis .

[ 179 ] Meltwater from Lake Agassiz fed the Glacial River Warren , which created a large waterfall that eroded upriver past the confluence of the Mississippi River, where it left a 75-foot (23-meter) drop in the Mississippi.

[ 180 ] This site is located in what is now downtown Saint Paul. The new waterfall, later called Saint Anthony Falls, in turn, eroded up the Mississippi about eight miles (13 kilometers) to its present location, carving the Mississippi River gorge as it moved upstream.

Minnehaha Falls also developed during this period via similar processes.

[ 181 ] [ 180 ] Minneapolis is sited above an artesian aquifer [ 182 ] and on flat terrain. Its total area is 59 square miles (152.8 square kilometers) of which six percent is covered by water.

[ 183 ] The city has a 12-mile (19 km) segment of the Mississippi River, four streams, and 17 waterbodies—13 of them lakes, [ 184 ] with 24 miles (39 km) of lake shoreline.

[ 185 ] A 1959 report by the US Soil Conservation Service listed Minneapolis's elevation above mean sea level as 830 feet (250 meters).

[ 186 ] The city's lowest elevation of 687 feet (209 m) above sea level is near the confluence of Minnehaha Creek with the Mississippi River.

[ 187 ] Sources disagree on the exact location and elevation of the city's highest point, which is cited as being between 967 and 985 feet (295 and 300 m) above sea level.

[ m ] Cityscape [ edit ] The Minneapolis skyline seen from the Prospect Park Water Tower in 2014 Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: Neighborhoods of Minneapolis Cyclists on Midtown Greenway in Midtown Phillips , one of the 83 neighborhoods of Minneapolis Minneapolis has 83 neighborhoods and 70 neighborhood organizations.

[ 190 ] In some cases, two or more neighborhoods act together under one organization.

[ 191 ] Around 1990, the city set up the Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP), in which every one of the city's eighty-some neighborhoods participated.

[ 192 ] Funded for 20 years through 2011, with $400 million tax increment financing [ 192 ] ($559 million in 2024 ), [ 12 ] the program caught the eye of UN-Habitat , who considered it an example of best practices . Residents had a direct connection to government in NRP, whereby they proposed ideas appropriate for their area, and NRP reviewed the plans and provided implementation funds.

[ 192 ] [ 193 ] The city's Neighborhood and Community Relations department took NRP's place in 2011 [ 194 ] and is funded only by city revenue. In 2019, the city released the Neighborhoods 2020 program, which reworked neighborhood funding with an equity-focused lens.

[ 195 ] This reduced guaranteed funding, and several neighborhood organizations have since struggled with operations or merged with other neighborhoods due to decreased revenue.

[ 196 ] Base funding for every neighborhood organization increased in the 2024 city budget.

[ 197 ] In 2018, the Minneapolis City Council approved the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan, which resulted in a citywide end to single-family zoning .

[ 198 ] Slate reported that Minneapolis was the first major city in the US to make citywide such a revision in housing possibilities.

[ 199 ] At the time, 70 percent of residential land was zoned for detached, single-family homes, [ 200 ] though many of those areas had "nonconforming" buildings with more housing units.

[ 201 ] City leaders sought to increase the supply of housing so more neighborhoods would be affordable and to decrease the effects single-family zoning had caused on racial disparities and segregation.

[ 202 ] The Brookings Institution called it "a relatively rare example of success for the YIMBY agenda".

[ 203 ] From 2022 until 2024, [ 204 ] [ 205 ] the Minnesota Supreme Court , the US District Court , and the Minnesota Court of Appeals arrived at competing opinions, first shutting down the plan, and then securing its survival. Ultimately in 2024, the state legislature passed a bill approving the city's 2040 plan.

[ 206 ] Climate [ edit ] Further information: Climate of Minneapolis–Saint Paul Minneapolis experiences a hot-summer humid continental climate ( Dfa in the Köppen climate classification ) [ 207 ] that is typical of southern parts of the Upper Midwest ; it is situated in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a.

[ 208 ] [ 209 ] [ 210 ] The Minneapolis area experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The highest recorded temperature is 108 °F (42 °C) in July 1936 while the lowest is −41 °F (−41 °C) in January 1888.

[ 211 ] The snowiest winter on record was 1983–1984, when 98.6 in (250 cm) of snow fell.

[ 219 ] In the 1840s, [ 220 ] new settlers arrived from Maine , New Hampshire , and Massachusetts , while French-Canadians came around the same time.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Farmers from Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , and Pennsylvania followed in a secondary migration. Settlers from New England had an outsized influence on civic life.

[ 223 ] Mexican migrant workers began coming to Minnesota as early as 1860, although few stayed year-round.

[ 224 ] Latinos eventually settled in several neighborhoods in Minneapolis, including Phillips , Whittier , Longfellow and Northeast .

[ 248 ] By 1930, Minneapolis had one of the nation's highest literacy rates among Black residents.

[ 249 ] [ 250 ] [ 251 ] However, discrimination prevented them from obtaining higher-paying jobs.

[ 252 ] In 1935, Cecil Newman and the Minneapolis Spokesman led a year-long consumer boycott of four area breweries that refused to hire Blacks.

[ 253 ] Employment improved during World War II, but housing discrimination persisted.

[ 254 ] Between 1950 and 1970, the Black population in Minneapolis increased by 436 percent.

[ 274 ] Statewide by 2022, the gap between White and Black home ownership declined from 51.5 percent to 48 percent.

[ 275 ] Statewide, alongside this small improvement was a sharp increase in the Black-to-White comparative number of deaths of despair (e.g., alcohol, drugs, and suicide).

[ 275 ] The Minneapolis income gap in 2018 was one of the largest in the country, with Black families earning about 44 percent of what White families earned annually.

[ 281 ] Realtors adopted the practice, thousands of times preventing non-Whites from owning or leasing properties; [ 282 ] this practice continued for four decades until the city became more and more racially divided.

[ 283 ] Though such language was prohibited by state law in 1953 and by the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 , [ 284 ] restrictive covenants against minorities remained in many Minneapolis deeds as of the 2020s. In 2021, the city gave residents a means to discharge them.

[ 285 ] Minneapolis has a history of structural racism [ 286 ] and has racial disparities in nearly every aspect of society.

[ 287 ] As White settlers displaced the Indigenous population during the 19th century, they claimed the city's land, [ 288 ] and Kirsten Delegard of Mapping Prejudice explains that today's disparities evolved from control of the land.

[ 154 ] Discrimination increased when flour milling moved to the East Coast and the economy declined.

[ 289 ] The foundation laid by racial covenants on residential segregation, property value, homeownership, wealth, housing security, access to green spaces, and health equity shapes the lives of people in the 21st century.

[ 290 ] The city wrote in a decennial plan that racially discriminatory federal housing policies starting in the 1930s "prevented access to mortgages in areas with Jews, African-Americans and other minorities" and "left a lasting effect on the physical characteristics of the city and the financial well-being of its residents".

[ 291 ] Discussing a Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis report on how systemic racism compromises education in Minnesota, [ 292 ] Professor Keith Mayes says, "So the housing disparities created the educational disparities that we still live with today." [ 293 ] Professor Samuel Myers Jr.

says of redlining , "Policing policies evolved that substituted explicit racial profiling with scientific management of racially disparate arrests.

... racially discriminatory policies became institutionalized and 'baked in' to the fabric of Minnesota life." [ 294 ] [ p ] Government efforts to address these disparities included zoning changes passed in the 2040 plan, [ 296 ] and declaring racism a public health emergency in 2020.

[ 416 ] Parks and recreation [ edit ] Main article: Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board Minnehaha Falls in the summer Landscape architect Horace Cleveland 's masterpiece is the Minneapolis park system.

[ 417 ] In the 1880s, he preserved geographical landmarks and linked them with boulevards and parkways.

[ 418 ] In their introduction to a modern reprint of Cleveland's treatise on landscape architecture , professors Daniel Nadenicek and Lance Neckar add that "Cleveland was successful in Minneapolis in great measure because he operated with kindred spirits" like William Watts Folwell and Charles M. Loring .

[ 419 ] In his book The American City: What Works, What Doesn't , Alexander Garvin wrote Minneapolis built "the best-located, best-financed, best-designed, and best-maintained public open space in America".

[ 420 ] Cleveland lobbied for a park on the riverfront to include the city's other waterfall.

[ 421 ] In 1889, George A. Brackett arranged financing, and his associate Henry Brown paid the state to cover the condemnation of surrounding land.

[ 580 ] Notable people [ edit ] Main article: List of people from Minneapolis Sister cities [ edit ] Minneapolis's sister cities are: [ 581 ] Bosaso , Somalia (2014) Cuernavaca , Mexico (2008) Eldoret , Kenya (2000) Harbin , China (1992) Ibaraki , Japan (1980) Kuopio , Finland (1972) Najaf , Iraq (2009) Novosibirsk , Russia (1988) Santiago , Chile (1961) Tours , France (1991) Uppsala , Sweden (2000) Winnipeg , Canada (1973) See also [ edit ] Cities portal Geography portal Minnesota portal North America portal United States portal List of tallest buildings in Minneapolis National Register of Historic Places listings in Hennepin County, Minnesota USS Minneapolis , 4 ships (including 2 as Minneapolis–Saint Paul ) Notes [ edit ] ^ Pronounced / ˌ m ɪ n i ˈ æ p ə l ɪ s / ⓘ MIN -ee- AP -ə-liss ) [ 13 ] ^ Because President Thomas Jefferson had not authorized Pike's trip, which was made at the behest of James Wilkinson , the new governor of the Louisiana territory, Pike did not have the authority to make a treaty.

[ 31 ] Pike valued the land at $200,000 ($4.2 million in 2024 ) [ 12 ] in his journal but omitted the value in Article 2 of the treaty. Pike gave the chiefs 60 US gallons (230 L) of liquor and $200 ($4,200 in 2024 ) [ 12 ] in gifts at the signing.

[ 32 ] In 1808, the US Senate authorized one hundredth of Pike's estimate and added acreage, [ 32 ] paying $2,000 ($41,996 in 2024 ) [ 12 ] for the land in 1819.

[ 33 ] ^ In the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Treaty of Mendota , the US took all Dakota land west of the Mississippi, [ 40 ] about 24 million acres (97,000 km 2 ), [ 41 ] in exchange for a 10-mile (16 km) wide reservation on the Minnesota River [ 42 ] and about $3 million ($113 million in 2024 ).

[ 12 ] After expenses, the Dakota were promised fifty years of annuities in goods [ 43 ] and interest on $1,360,000 ($51.4 million in 2024 ) and $1,410,000 ($53.3 million in 2024 ); [ 12 ] the US kept the principal.

[ 44 ] The Dakota could not read English, and their interpreters worked for the US.

[ 39 ] In Mendota, negotiator Wakute said he feared signing a treaty because the prior treaty was changed from the one he had signed.

[ 45 ] Indeed, the US Congress ratified amendments after the fact, and refused to consider payment unless the Dakota agreed to their new terms—in 1852 Congress struck the reservation from the final treaty.

[ 46 ] Negotiators Luke Lea and Alexander Ramsey had promised the Dakota they would prosper, and they rushed the transaction.

[ 47 ] The chiefs were asked to sign a third paper in 1851—onlookers assumed it was a third copy of the treaty [ 48 ] —that Ramsey later declared was a "solemn acknowledgment" of the Dakota's debt to traders.

[ 49 ] Ramsey, as territorial governor, enforced the trader's paper, distributing the monies to himself, Henry Sibley , and their friends.

[ 50 ] ^ Part of the delay was a month's indecision in the US Treasury about appropriating gold or greenbacks and in Congress, which was preoccupied with Civil War finance. Gold arrived in the region just a few hours after settlers had been killed and war had begun.

[ 54 ] ^ General [ 61 ] Henry Sibley rushed to complete the trials before winter.

[ 62 ] Trials were held from late September [ 63 ] through early November 1862, in central Minnesota west of Minneapolis; [ 62 ] on each day up to forty-three men stood trial.

[ 62 ] The Dakota men were without counsel, rarely spoke English, in some cases trials proceeded without witnesses, and no time was made for cross-examination.

[ 64 ] Historian Gary Clayton Anderson says, "In 90 percent of the trials, the entire event lasted only a minute or two...".

[ 64 ] ^ Sibley appointed a commission of men thought later to be biased to hear the trials and planned to carry out executions immediately.

[ 65 ] Of 400 Dakota, 303 were sentenced to death, 20 were sentenced to prison, 69 were acquitted, and 8 were released.

[ 66 ] When his superior Major General John Pope reported the commission's findings to President Abraham Lincoln he had realized only the president can authorize executions. Historian Mary Lethert Wingerd writes that Lincoln and members of his cabinet were "taken aback" by the number of condemned and the irregular proceedings.

[ 67 ] Lincoln then ordered a stay of execution until he could review the trial transcripts.

[ 67 ] Minnesotans wanted revenge and many were outraged at the stay.

[ 68 ] Lincoln was under pressure from Minnesotans, [ 69 ] and wrote that he wished to avoid cruelty and to discourage another outbreak.

[ 70 ] He first decided that only rapists would be hanged, but only 2 Dakota met that condition. Then with the help of his lawyers, [ 71 ] Wingerd writes that Lincoln "reluctantly" [ 69 ] ordered that 39 men [ 72 ] would be hanged; these men had been convicted of murdering civilians. One received a last minute reprieve.

[ 70 ] Minnesotans participated in lynch mobs and vigilantism against the Dakota, both condemned and friendly—2 men died of injuries sustained during attacks on Sibley's wagon train that took them to Mankato . Command transferred to Colonel Stephen Miller who oversaw the executions—he declared martial law and banned alcohol for the 4,000 spectators.

[ 73 ] The Dakota were reportedly cheerful as they walked to their deaths; a journalist wrote, "No equal number ever approached the gallows with greater courage, and more perfect determination to prove how little death can be feared".

[ 74 ] After what was the largest mass execution in US history, [ 75 ] [ 74 ] Minnesota officials discovered that in their haste, they had hanged 2 innocent men.

[ 70 ] Nearly all the men's bodies were dug up from their graves within 24 hours, some for trophies but most by physicians who wanted cadavers to dissect.

[ 76 ] ^ The University of Minnesota Dakota Dictionary Online requires a Dakota font to read special characters.

[ 89 ] ^ "Minneapolis would be the nation's flour capital for 50 years." and "Begun in 1848, timber milling had lasted for almost 50 years." [ 94 ] ^ Soldiers from Fort Snelling built a sawmill in 1820, and a gristmill in 1823, on the west bank near the falls.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ i ] The city's first commercial sawmill was built in 1848, and the first commercial gristmill in 1849.

[ 95 ] ^ In 1928, Washburn-Crosby merged with other local millers and changed its name to General Mills to reflect a wider product base including convenience foods like Wheaties .

[ 118 ] ^ Minneapolis experienced the largest urban renewal plan undertaken in the US as of 2022 [update] .

[ 160 ] ^ In a 1975 article, reporter John Carman said the city's highest point is 967 feet (295 m) at Deming Heights Park in the Waite Park neighborhood.

[ 188 ] The US Geological Survey lists the highest elevation as 980 feet (300 m) but does not give a location.

[ 187 ] Geography professor John Tichy said the highest point is the site of Waite Park Elementary School at approximately 985 feet (300 m) above sea level.

[ 189 ] All of the cited sources that list locations say the highest point is within the Northeast section of the city.

^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e., the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at the said location from 1991 to 2020.

^ Official records for Minneapolis/Saint Paul were kept by the Saint Paul Signal Service in that city from January 1871 to December 1890, the Minneapolis Weather Bureau from January 1891 to April 8, 1938, and at Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport (KMSP) since April 9, 1938.

[ 214 ] ^ Separately, Myers describes how the Minneapolis police department's adoption of CODEFOR in 1998 increased policing in areas of Minneapolis that were disproportionately non-White, with dual results: "Minority residents are afforded improved safety and law enforcement services; minority offenders unsurprisingly may be disproportionately apprehended for relatively minor transgressions in order to achieve the higher levels of safety." [ 295 ] ^ The Minnesota Opera has offices in Minneapolis and performs in Saint Paul.

[ 349 ] ^ Minneapolis had planted more than 200,000 American elms on its streets and parks before Dutch elm disease was found in the city in 1963. By 1977, when the most were lost to the epidemic and the city began its control program, the Twin Cities had lost 192,000 elm trees to the disease, and more than 30,000 diseased trees were found in Minneapolis.

[ 428 ] ^ The Treaty of 1837 forced Dakota to make the largest land cession—all of their land east of the Mississippi.

[ 497 ] Then the Dakota ceded more of their land in the Treaty of 1851.

[ 498 ] ^ As of early 2024, the extension was nine years behind schedule and US$1.5 billion over budget.

[ 542 ] ^ A Sahan Journal investigation covering the state from 2019 to 2023 found that "Native Americans were at least 15 times", Somali Minnesotans were twice as likely, and "Latino Minnesotans were 1.5 times" as likely to die from opioid overdoses than White persons.

For a few years in the mid-'80s, not long after Athens and sometime before Seattle, the epicenter of American underground rock was Minneapolis....But genius can put any town on the map, which Prince accomplished for his home city with 1984 album and film Purple Rain, whose prominent concert footage was shot at a local club called First Avenue.

^ Corrigan & Sigelman 2018 , p. x, "At the dawn of the 1980s, the Twin Cities music scene was poised to explode.... Husker Du, the Replacements, Loud Fast Rules (later Soul Asylum) and others were fast building rabid local followings and would soon achieve national acclaim.... At the same time, a vibrant R&B, funk, and soul scene was maturing and forming what would be known as the "Minneapolis sound". The young guitar and songwriting virtuoso Prince was perfecting his innovative and infectious style...".

Hüsker Dü released another double LP in January...but broke up shortly after their manager David Savoy's suicide. On May 27, the Replacements played First Avenue for the last time. And in September, Prince opened Paisley Park Studios way out in Chanhassen....
