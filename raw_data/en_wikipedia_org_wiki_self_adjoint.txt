a = a ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle a=a^{*}} ).

Definition [ edit ] Let A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} be a *-algebra. An element a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}} is called self-adjoint if a = a ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle a=a^{*}} .

[ 1 ] The set of self-adjoint elements is referred to as A s a {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} .

A subset B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq {\mathcal {A}}} that is closed under the involution *, i.e.

B = B ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}={\mathcal {B}}^{*}} , is called self-adjoint.

[ 2 ] A special case of particular importance is the case where A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is a complete normed *-algebra , that satisfies the C*-identity ( ‖ a ∗ ∗ a ‖ = ‖ a ‖ 2 ∀ ∀ a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle \left\|a^{*}a\right\|=\left\|a\right\|^{2}\ \forall a\in {\mathcal {A}}} ), which is called a C*-algebra .

Especially in the older literature on *-algebras and C*-algebras, such elements are often called hermitian.

[ 1 ] Because of that the notations A h {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}_{h}} , A H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}_{H}} or H ( A ) {\displaystyle H({\mathcal {A}})} for the set of self-adjoint elements are also sometimes used, even in the more recent literature.

Examples [ edit ] Each positive element of a C*-algebra is self-adjoint.

[ 3 ] For each element a {\displaystyle a} of a *-algebra, the elements a a ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle aa^{*}} and a ∗ ∗ a {\displaystyle a^{*}a} are self-adjoint, since * is an involutive antiautomorphism .

[ 4 ] For each element a {\displaystyle a} of a *-algebra, the real and imaginary parts Re ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) = 1 2 ( a + a ∗ ∗ ) {\textstyle \operatorname {Re} (a)={\frac {1}{2}}(a+a^{*})} and Im ⁡ ⁡ ( a ) = 1 2 i ( a − − a ∗ ∗ ) {\textstyle \operatorname {Im} (a)={\frac {1}{2\mathrm {i} }}(a-a^{*})} are self-adjoint, where i {\displaystyle \mathrm {i} } denotes the imaginary unit .

[ 1 ] If a ∈ ∈ A N {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{N}} is a normal element of a C*-algebra A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} , then for every real-valued function f {\displaystyle f} , which is continuous on the spectrum of a {\displaystyle a} , the continuous functional calculus defines a self-adjoint element f ( a ) {\displaystyle f(a)} .

[ 5 ] Criteria [ edit ] Let A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} be a *-algebra. Then: Let a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}} , then a ∗ ∗ a {\displaystyle a^{*}a} is self-adjoint, since ( a ∗ ∗ a ) ∗ ∗ = a ∗ ∗ ( a ∗ ∗ ) ∗ ∗ = a ∗ ∗ a {\displaystyle (a^{*}a)^{*}=a^{*}(a^{*})^{*}=a^{*}a} . A similarly calculation yields that a a ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle aa^{*}} is also self-adjoint.

[ 6 ] Let a = a 1 a 2 {\displaystyle a=a_{1}a_{2}} be the product of two self-adjoint elements a 1 , a 2 ∈ ∈ A s a {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2}\in {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} .

Then a {\displaystyle a} is self-adjoint if a 1 {\displaystyle a_{1}} and a 2 {\displaystyle a_{2}} commutate , since ( a 1 a 2 ) ∗ ∗ = a 2 ∗ ∗ a 1 ∗ ∗ = a 2 a 1 {\displaystyle (a_{1}a_{2})^{*}=a_{2}^{*}a_{1}^{*}=a_{2}a_{1}} always holds.

[ 1 ] If A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is a C*-algebra, then a normal element a ∈ ∈ A N {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{N}} is self-adjoint if and only if its spectrum is real, i.e.

σ σ ( a ) ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle \sigma (a)\subseteq \mathbb {R} } .

[ 5 ] Properties [ edit ] In *-algebras [ edit ] Let A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} be a *-algebra. Then: Each element a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}} can be uniquely decomposed into real and imaginary parts, i.e. there are uniquely determined elements a 1 , a 2 ∈ ∈ A s a {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2}\in {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} , so that a = a 1 + i a 2 {\displaystyle a=a_{1}+\mathrm {i} a_{2}} holds. Where a 1 = 1 2 ( a + a ∗ ∗ ) {\textstyle a_{1}={\frac {1}{2}}(a+a^{*})} and a 2 = 1 2 i ( a − − a ∗ ∗ ) {\textstyle a_{2}={\frac {1}{2\mathrm {i} }}(a-a^{*})} .

[ 1 ] The set of self-adjoint elements A s a {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} is a real linear subspace of A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} .

From the previous property, it follows that A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is the direct sum of two real linear subspaces, i.e.

A = A s a ⊕ ⊕ i A s a {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}={\mathcal {A}}_{sa}\oplus \mathrm {i} {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} .

[ 7 ] If a ∈ ∈ A s a {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} is self-adjoint, then a {\displaystyle a} is normal.

[ 1 ] The *-algebra A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is called a hermitian *-algebra if every self-adjoint element a ∈ ∈ A s a {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} has a real spectrum σ σ ( a ) ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle \sigma (a)\subseteq \mathbb {R} } .

[ 8 ] In C*-algebras [ edit ] Let A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} be a C*-algebra and a ∈ ∈ A s a {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{sa}} . Then: For the spectrum ‖ a ‖ ∈ ∈ σ σ ( a ) {\displaystyle \left\|a\right\|\in \sigma (a)} or − − ‖ a ‖ ∈ ∈ σ σ ( a ) {\displaystyle -\left\|a\right\|\in \sigma (a)} holds, since σ σ ( a ) {\displaystyle \sigma (a)} is real and r ( a ) = ‖ a ‖ {\displaystyle r(a)=\left\|a\right\|} holds for the spectral radius , because a {\displaystyle a} is normal.

[ 9 ] According to the continuous functional calculus, there exist uniquely determined positive elements a + , a − − ∈ ∈ A + {\displaystyle a_{+},a_{-}\in {\mathcal {A}}_{+}} , such that a = a + − − a − − {\displaystyle a=a_{+}-a_{-}} with a + a − − = a − − a + = 0 {\displaystyle a_{+}a_{-}=a_{-}a_{+}=0} .

For the norm, ‖ a ‖ = max ( ‖ a + ‖ , ‖ a − − ‖ ) {\displaystyle \left\|a\right\|=\max(\left\|a_{+}\right\|,\left\|a_{-}\right\|)} holds.

[ 10 ] The elements a + {\displaystyle a_{+}} and a − − {\displaystyle a_{-}} are also referred to as the positive and negative parts . In addition, | a | = a + + a − − {\displaystyle |a|=a_{+}+a_{-}} holds for the absolute value defined for every element | a | = ( a ∗ ∗ a ) 1 2 {\textstyle |a|=(a^{*}a)^{\frac {1}{2}}} .

[ 11 ] For every a ∈ ∈ A + {\displaystyle a\in {\mathcal {A}}_{+}} and odd n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } , there exists a uniquely determined b ∈ ∈ A + {\displaystyle b\in {\mathcal {A}}_{+}} that satisfies b n = a {\displaystyle b^{n}=a} , i.e. a unique n {\displaystyle n} -th root , as can be shown with the continuous functional calculus.
