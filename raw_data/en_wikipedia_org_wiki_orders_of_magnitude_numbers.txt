^ From the third paragraph of the story: "Each book contains 410 pages; each page, 40 lines; each line, about 80 black letters." That makes 410 x 40 x 80 = 1,312,000 characters.  The fifth paragraph tells us that "there are 25 orthographic symbols" including spaces and punctuation.  The magnitude of the resulting number is found by taking logarithms. However, this calculation only gives a lower bound on the number of books as it does not take into account variations in the titles – the narrator does not specify a limit on the number of characters on the spine.  For further discussion of this, see Bloch, William Goldbloom.
