[ 4 ] Use [ edit ] Medium shots are favored in sequences where dialogues or a small group of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background, such as when the shot is 'cutting the person in half' [ 4 ] and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language.

[ 5 ] Medium shots are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters .

[ 2 ] It is also used in interviews.

[ 3 ] It is the most common shot in movies, [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.

[ 7 ] A normal lens that sees what the human eye sees [ 8 ] is usually used for medium shots.

[ 7 ] Definition [ edit ] A medium two-shot of Robin Roberts interviewing Barack Obama The medium shot shows equality between subjects and background. The dividing line between what constitutes a long shot and medium shot is not definite, nor is the line between medium shot and close-up .

[ 7 ] In some standard texts and professional references, a full-length view of a human subject is called a medium shot; [ 6 ] in this terminology, a shot of the person from the knees up or the waist up is a close-up shot. In other texts, these partial views are called medium shots.

[ 9 ] In principle, the medium shot is what can be seen with the human eye in a single quick glance and convey all the action taking place in that field of view .

[ 6 ] [ 2 ] Types [ edit ] Medium shots are divided into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the shoulders or two-shots (featuring two people).

[ 6 ] A medium wide shot, or American shot , shows a bit more of the background but is still close enough for facial expressions to be seen, although these facial expressions would be better seen in a waist-high shot.
