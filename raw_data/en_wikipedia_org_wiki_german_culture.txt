[ 4 ] Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch ). German is written using the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut , namely ä, ö, and ü, as well as the Eszett or scharfes S ( sharp s ) which is written "ß" (not used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein , where it is written ss instead). German orthography has gone through a series of reforms, the most recent in 1996 .

Spoken German in Goethe's Faust German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German .

[ 33 ] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat ; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law , are valid in perpetuity.

[ 34 ] The president , who has been Frank-Walter Steinmeier since 2017, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.

It is customary for Germans to have a very large lunch around noon. A typical lunch usually consists of some type of meat or fish, a heavy carb such as potato or German noodles , and a side of vegetables.

Also, most dinners eaten by Germans usually include some form of mustard and pickles.

[ 65 ] The habit of having a simple, light dinner has become less of an everyday routine for many Germans.

In the 2016 Summer Olympics , Germany finished fifth in the medal count, [ 79 ] while in the 2018 Winter Olympics they finished second.

[ 80 ] Germany has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in Berlin in 1936 and in Munich in 1972 . The Winter Olympic Games took place in Germany once in 1936 when they were staged in the Bavarian twin towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen .

Society [ edit ] See also: Demographics of Germany Cultural map of the world according to the World Values Survey , describing Germany as high in "Rational-Secular Values" and low in " Self Expression Values " Germany is a modern, advanced society, shaped by a plurality of lifestyles and regional identities.

[ 81 ] The country has established a high level of gender equality , promotes disability rights , and is legally and socially tolerant towards homosexuals. Gays and lesbians can legally adopt their partner's biological children, and same-sex marriage has been permitted since 2017.

[ 82 ] The former Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle and the former mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit , are openly gay.

[ 83 ] During the last decade of the twentieth century, Germany's attitude towards immigrants changed. Until the mid-1990s, the opinion was widespread that Germany was not a country of immigration, even though about 20% of the population were of non-German origin. Today the government and a majority of the German society are acknowledging that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds are part of German society and that controlled immigration should be initiated based on qualification standards.

[ 84 ] Since the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the internal and external evaluation of Germany's national image has changed.

[ 85 ] In the annual Nation Brands Index global survey, Germany became significantly and repeatedly more highly ranked after the tournament. People in 20 different states assessed the country's reputation in terms of culture, politics, exports, its people and its attractiveness to tourists, immigrants and investments. Germany has been named the world's second most valued nation among 50 countries in 2010.

[ 86 ] Another global opinion poll, for the BBC , revealed that Germany is recognised for the most positive influence in the world in 2010. A majority of 59% have a positive view of the country, while 14% have a negative view.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] With an expenditure of €67 billion on international travel in 2008, Germans spent more money on travel than any other country. The most visited destinations were Spain , Italy and Austria .

[ 89 ] Additionally, tourism analysts estimate that over 65 percent of Germans vacationed for 5 or more days in 2007.

[ 90 ] The large amount of travel that Germans partake in can also be attributed to the amount of vacation days they receive. In Germany, employees are given a minimum of 24 vacation days annually, but often employers will give between 25 and 30 paid vacation days.

[ 91 ] Germans also like packaged vacations which can be all-inclusive vacations or pre-booked excursions or reservations. In 2018, 43% of all German travel consisted of packaged vacations.

[ 92 ] Leisure [ edit ] Mecklenburg-Vorpommern with its beaches at the Baltic Sea has many seside resorts, like the pictured Grand Hotel Heiligendamm , built between 1793 and 1870 In Germany, leisure is considered a quintessential part of the culture. Researchers in Hamburg concluded that Germans over 14 years old have an average of 4 hours of leisure time per day. Regardless of many factors that differentiate Germans, across the board, the most popular leisure activity is watching television.

[ 93 ] Most Germans dedicate their Sundays to leisure activity because a majority of shops and restaurants are closed on Sundays.

Sports clubs are a large part of Germans' leisure time. Currently, around 26 million people in Germany make up the membership to the over 91,000 sports clubs in Germany. Sports clubs can aid children and adults in getting to know people in their community through a shared passion for sports.

[ 94 ] Another leisure activity that Germans like to partake in is exercise . Studies show that most Germans work out at least once a week in their free time.

[ 95 ] Additionally, Germany is notable for its longstanding tradition of Freikörperkultur (FKK), or free body culture, which advocates for the public health benefits of full-body exposure to natural elements—such as sunlight, fresh air, and outdoor exercise—as part of a holistic lifestyle.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] In practice, this is customarily expressed through non-sexual social nudity in outdoor spaces—whether formally designated or culturally accepted—by individuals and families at lakes, beaches, parks, and natural settings for naturist recreation.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Rooted in late 19th- and early 20th-century health reform movements, such as the Lebensreform , FKK promotes regular sun and air exposure—often coupled with outdoor exercise—and regards these practices as beneficial to physical and mental well-being, alongside values of naturalism and body positivity .

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Although distinct from FKK ideology, nudity is also customary in German sauna culture, where mixed-gender facilities require textile-free participation for reasons of wellness and hygiene.
