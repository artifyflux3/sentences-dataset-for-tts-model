The town of Hayti, Missouri was struck by the EF4 tornado in December 10 , 2021, being one of many towns that were hit by this long tracked tornado. The Hayti tornado was the 2nd strongest tornado of the tornado outbreak of December 10-11, 2021 .

A chart showing various EF4 tornadoes during the 2020s and percentages of towns they damaged or destroyed This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F4, EF4, IF4, or an equivalent rating during the 2020s decade. These scales – the Fujita scale , the Enhanced Fujita scale , the International Fujita scale , and the TORRO tornado intensity scale – attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado's path.

Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in North America and Europe.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] To assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale . The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F4 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 207 mph (333 km/h) and 260 mph (420 km/h) and are considered violent tornadoes, along with F5 tornadoes.

[ 3 ] [ nb 1 ] Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale .

[ 4 ] With building design and structural integrity taken more into account, winds in an EF4 tornado were estimated to between 166 mph (267 km/h) and 200 mph (320 km/h).

[ 5 ] The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F4/EF4 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T8 to T9 on the T-Scale. Tornadoes rated IF4 on the International Fujita scale are also included on this list. Violent tornadoes, those rated F4/EF4 and F5/EF5 are rare and only make up 2% of all recorded tornadoes.

[ 6 ] List [ edit ] Worldwide during the 2020s, 21 tornadoes have been rated F4/EF4/IF4. Nineteen of these tornadoes occurred in the United States, receiving EF4 ratings, one occurred in Canada, and one F4 / IF4 occurred in the Czech Republic.

[ note 1 ] These tornadoes have caused 136 fatalities and over 1,183 injuries. The most recent EF4 tornado occurred on May 16, 2025 in London, Kentucky .

Numerous fatalities occurred with at least 17 well-anchored block-foundation homes being leveled or swept away. In addition to vehicles being thrown and destroyed, many trees were denuded and partially debarked in this area, indicating EF4 damage with wind speeds rated at 175 miles per hour (282 km/h). Homes farther away from the center of the damage path lost their roofs and exterior walls.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] April 12 2020 United States Mississippi Hope , Sartinville , Bassfield 4 (3+ injuries) NWS 2020 Hope–Bassfield tornado — A house was completely swept away, leaving a bare foundation slab. This house was secured to its foundation with anchor bolts, which were found bent, though nearby trees did not sustain damage consistent with a tornado stronger than low-end EF4 strength. Trees were ripped out of the ground with numerous other structures damaged or destroyed along the path of this tornado as well. The tornado caused $2.75 million (2020 USD) in damage.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 8 ] April 12 2020 United States Mississippi Bassfield , Cantwell Mill , Seminary , Collins , Soso , Moss , Pachuta 8 (95+ injuries) NWS 2020 Bassfield–Soso tornado — In Cantwell Mill, a large, anchor-bolted cabin was completely swept away and reduced to a bare slab, with little debris recovered. While this structure was well-anchored, surveyors noted some minor structural defects including a lack of external sheathing and flawed stud-to-sill plate nailing, while trees in the immediate vicinity sustained only partial debarking. Due to these limiting factors, a high-end EF4 rating was applied. Many other structures were destroyed at EF4 intensity along the path of this tornado as well and entire groves of large trees were mowed down and completely stripped of their bark. The massive tornado reached a width of 2.25 miles (3.62 km), making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history and the third-widest on record in the United States.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 10 ] [ 8 ] April 13 2020 United States South Carolina Scotia , Estill , Nixville , Fechtig 5 (65 injuries) NWS 2020 Estill–Scotia–Nixville tornado — This large, multiple-vortex tornado damaged or destroyed numerous structures. EF4 damage was inflicted on a well-built two-story home that was leveled with only a pile of debris remaining, with some of the debris scattered into the yard. The wind speed estimate in this area was 175 mph (282 km/h). EF2-EF3 damage occurred in many other areas along the path as well.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 8 ] April 19 2020 United States Mississippi Hurricane Creek , Sandy Hook , Pine Burr , Purvis 1 (1 injury) NWS 2020 Sandy Hook–Purvis tornado – A well-built house in southwestern Marion County was leveled and partially swept away at low-end EF4 intensity by this long-tracked tornado, and numerous other homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed as well.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 8 ] July 8 2020 United States Minnesota Dalton 1 (3 injuries) NWS 2020 Ashby–Dalton tornado — One farmhouse was swept away at low-end EF4 intensity by this tornado. A machine shop was also swept away, leaving behind mangled vehicles and machinery, trees were snapped and debarked, and visible ground scouring was noted. The tornado, described by storm chasers as resembling a "drill bit" at times, killed one person.

[ 20 ] [ 8 ] A photograph of the tornado was also used in the cover for the 2021 disaster film 13 Minutes .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] March 25 [ note 3 ] 2021 United States Georgia Franklin , Newnan , Peachtree City 0 (1 indirect fatality) NWS 2021 Newnan–Peachtree City tornado — The peak damage from the tornado came in Newnan, where multiple large and newly built homes were leveled at low-end EF4 intensity, including some that were partially swept away. Many other areas of intense damage also occurred along the tornado's path as well. The tornado prompted the issuance of three tornado emergencies and caused $20 million (2021 USD) in damage.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 8 ] June 24 2021 Czech Republic South Moravian Region Hrušky , Moravská Nová Ves , Mikulčice , Lužice , Hodonín 6 (576 injuries) ESSL , CHMI , SHMÚ , Charles University , Tomáš Prouza 2021 South Moravia tornado – One-third of the buildings in Hrušky were destroyed and 85% were damaged, with the most severe damage occurring in the southern half of town. In Moravská Nová Ves and Mikulčice, hundreds of buildings were severely damaged or destroyed, including a few well-built brick and masonry homes that were completely leveled. The concrete exterior walls of structures that remained standing were scarred and impaled by flying projectiles. A few trees were completely stripped clean of all bark. In the town, three locations sustained IF4 damage. The first location was a row of newly built homes. Here, an IF4 rating was assigned to the damage of three well-built brick structures. One of the brick structures was completely destroyed, which would warrant an IF5 rating. However, a rather weak connection between the roof and the walls was found, which prevented the damage from being assigned an IF5 rating. Another structure that was completely destroyed was still under construction. Debris from the houses were carried over the following field along considerable distances." [ 28 ] In Lužice, multiple homes and apartment buildings were damaged or destroyed in the town, and metal-framed industrial buildings and factories were destroyed. In Hodonín, the tornado impacted a densely populated area in the northern part of town. Numerous buildings sustained major structural damage or were destroyed. In all, a total of 1,200 buildings were damaged or destroyed by the F4/IF4 [ note 1 ] tornado, which had an estimated peak windspeed of 380 km/h (236.1 mph) and 14 different locations sustained IF4 level damage.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 8 ] December 10 2021 United States Tennessee , Kentucky Woodland Mills (Tennessee), Cayce , Mayfield , Benton , Cambridge Shores, Princeton , Dawson Springs , Bremen (Kentucky) 57 (515 injuries) NWS 2021 Western Kentucky tornado — A long-tracked wedge and the ninth spawned by the Quad-State supercell, this tornado damaged, destroyed, or obliterated numerous structures along a path of 165.6 miles (266.5 km). Eight of the tornado warnings issued during the event by the NWS offices in Memphis, Tennessee , and Paducah, Kentucky were tornado emergency declarations, the most issued during the month of December. EF4 damage occurred in or near the communities of Cayce, Mayfield, Cambridge Shores, Princeton, Dawson Springs, and Bremen. Dual polarization radar imagery showed that the tornado lofted debris up to 30,000 feet (9,100 m) into the air as it impacted Mayfield. The tornado caused extreme ground scouring in Hickman County with grass and several inches of topsoil removed in multiple locations. In Bremen, a row of four homes was obliterated, with debris scattered and wind-rowed long distances through fields across the street. Concrete floor slabs were torn from the foundation of one home and shattered, while the paved driveway of another residence was cracked and scoured. Peak damage along the path was rated high-end EF4 with winds of 190 mph (310 km/h) based on the damage in Bremen. In 2022, meteorologist and structural and forensic engineer Timothy Marshall noted that "the tornado damage rating might have been higher had more wind resistant structures been encountered" and "the damage likely would have been more severe if the tornado were slower." [ 34 ] EF4 damage occurred in Kentucky; the maximum damage in Tennessee was rated EF0.
