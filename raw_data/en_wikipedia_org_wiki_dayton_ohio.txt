[ 5 ] [ 6 ] It is the sixth-most populous city in Ohio with a population of 137,644 at the 2020 census , while the Dayton metropolitan area has an estimated 822,000 residents and is the state's fourth-largest metropolitan area.

[ 7 ] Dayton is located within Ohio's Miami Valley region, 50 miles (80 km) north of Cincinnati and 60 miles (97 km) west-southwest of Columbus .

Dayton was founded in 1796 along the Great Miami River and named after Jonathan Dayton , a Founding Father who owned a significant amount of land in the area.

[ 8 ] It grew in the 19th century as a canal town and was home to many patents and inventors , most notably the Wright brothers , who developed the first successful motor-operated airplane .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] It later developed an industrialized economy and was home to the Dayton Project , a branch of the larger Manhattan Project , to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. With the decline of heavy manufacturing in the late 20th century, Dayton's businesses have diversified into a service economy .

Ohio's borders are within 500 miles (800 km) of roughly 60 percent of the country's population and manufacturing infrastructure, making Dayton a logistics hub.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The city is home to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , a significant contributor to research and development in the industrial, aeronautical , and astronautical engineering fields. Along with defense and aerospace, healthcare accounts for much of the Dayton area's economy.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Significant institutions in Dayton include the Air Force Institute of Technology , Carillon Historical Park , Dayton Art Institute , Dayton Performing Arts Alliance , National Museum of the United States Air Force , and University of Dayton .

History [ edit ] Dayton was founded on April 1, 1796, by 12 settlers known as the Thompson Party. They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans . Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve, [ 15 ] whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.

[ 16 ] The oldest surviving building is Newcom Tavern , which was used for various purposes, including housing Dayton's first church , which is still in existence.

[ 17 ] In 1797, Daniel C. Cooper laid out Mad River Road , the first overland connection between Cincinnati and Dayton, opening the "Mad River Country" to settlement. Ohio was admitted into the Union in 1803, and the village of Dayton was incorporated in 1805 and chartered as a city in 1841. The city was named after Jonathan Dayton , a captain in the American Revolutionary War who signed the U.S. Constitution and owned a significant amount of land in the area.

[ 8 ] In 1827, construction on the Dayton–Cincinnati canal began, which provided a better way to transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati and contributed significantly to Dayton's economic growth during the 1800s.

[ 8 ] Innovation [ edit ] Dayton in 1870 Innovation led to business growth in the region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and played a crucial role in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering , a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight.

[ 18 ] NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe , a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II .

[ 19 ] Dayton has been the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s.

[ 9 ] [ 20 ] According to the National Park Service , citing information from the U.S. Patent Office , Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870.

[ 21 ] The Wright brothers , inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering , world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton.

[ 22 ] The city was also home to James Ritty 's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan 's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering .

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Paul Laurence Dunbar , an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became an integral part of the city's history.

[ 25 ] Birthplace of aviation [ edit ] Powered aviation began in Dayton.

Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first to construct and demonstrate powered flight. Although the first flight was in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina , their Wright Flyer was built in and returned to Dayton for improvements and further flights at Huffman Field , a cow pasture eight miles (13 km) northeast of Dayton, near the current Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

When the government tried to move development to Langley Field in southern Virginia, six Dayton businessmen including Edward A. Deeds, formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company in Moraine and established a flying field. Deeds also opened a field to the north in the flood plain of the Great Miami River between the confluences of that river, the Stillwater River, and the Mad River (near downtown Dayton). Later named McCook Field for Alexander McDowell McCook, an American Civil War general, this became the Army Signal Corps' primary aviation research and training location. Wilbur Wright also purchased land near Huffman prairie to continue their research.

During World War I, the Army purchased 40 acres adjacent to Huffman Prairie for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot. As airplanes developed more capability, they needed more runway space than McCook could offer, and a new location was sought. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km 2 ) northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field. Wright Field was "formally dedicated" on October 12, 1927. After World War II, Wright Field and the adjacent Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and Clinton Army Air Field were merged as the Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base. On January 13, 1948, the facility was renamed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base .

Great Dayton Flood [ edit ] Main article: Great Dayton Flood Flooding on Ludlow Street in downtown Dayton during the Great Dayton Flood , 1913 A catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the Great Dayton Flood , led to the creation of the Miami Conservancy District , a series of dams as well as hydraulic pumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.

[ 26 ] Contribution in World War Two [ edit ] Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project , a branch of the larger Manhattan Project , to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs.

[ 27 ] The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high-demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.

[ 28 ] Alan Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He visited the National Cash Register (NCR) company in Dayton in December 1942. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes , so the initial order was scaled down to 96 machines to decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II.

[ 29 ] Post-war Dayton [ edit ] Between the 1940s and the 1970s, the city saw significant growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.

[ 30 ] During this time, the city was the site of several race riots, including one in 1955 following the murder of Emmett Till , the 1966 Dayton race riot , two in 1967 (following a speech by civil rights activist H. Rap Brown and another following the police killing of an African American man), and one in 1968 as part of the nationwide King assassination riots .

[ 31 ] Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's population has declined, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008.

[ 32 ] While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. By 2013, Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown.

[ 32 ] Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.

[ 33 ] Peace accords [ edit ] Main article: Dayton Agreement In 1995, the Dayton Agreement , a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia , was negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , near Fairborn, Ohio, from November 1 to 21. The agreement formally ended the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on December 14, 1995.

Richard Holbrooke wrote about these events in his memoirs: There was also a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as the birthplace of the Wright brothers . Its citizens energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington , which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us.

Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the airbase placed "candles of peace" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.

[ 34 ] 2000s initiatives [ edit ] Downtown expansion that began in the 2000s has helped revitalize the city and encourage growth.

Day Air Ballpark , home of the Dayton Dragons , was built in 2000. The highly successful minor league baseball team has been an integral part of Dayton's culture.

[ 35 ] In 2001, the city's public park system, Five Rivers MetroParks , built RiverScape MetroPark, an outdoor entertainment venue that attracts more than 400,000 visitors each year.

[ 36 ] A new performance arts theater, the Schuster Center , opened in 2003.

[ 37 ] A large health network in the region, Premier Health Partners , expanded its Miami Valley Hospital with a 12-story tower addition.

[ 38 ] In 2010, the Downtown Dayton Partnership, in cooperation with the City of Dayton and community leaders, introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan. It focuses on job creation and retention, infrastructure improvements, housing, recreation, and collaboration. The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020.

[ 39 ] Nicknames [ edit ] A photograph of the Miami and Erie Canal from Geography of Ohio , 1923 Dayton is known as the "Gem City". The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known racehorse named Gem hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the Cincinnati Daily Chronicle by an author known as T stated: In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns. It possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise, and a beautiful country, beautifully developed.

[ 40 ] In the late 1840s, Major William D. Bickham of the Dayton Journal began a campaign to nickname Dayton the "Gem City". The name was adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.

[ 40 ] Paul Laurence Dunbar referred to the nickname in his poem, "Toast to Dayton", as noted in the following excerpt: She shall ever claim our duty, For she shines—the brightest gem That has ever decked with beauty Dear Ohio's diadem.

[ 41 ] Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio, "Birthplace of Aviation". Dayton is the hometown of the Wright brothers , aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the first practical airplane in history. After their first manned flights in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina , which they had chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions, the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby Huffman Prairie .

[ 42 ] Additionally, Dayton is colloquially referred to as "Little Detroit".

[ 43 ] This nickname comes from Dayton's prominence as a Midwestern manufacturing center.

[ 44 ] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of Downtown Dayton (NE to SW) According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 56.50 square miles (146.33 km 2 ), of which 55.65 square miles (144.13 km 2 ) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.20 km 2 ) is water.

[ 45 ] Climate [ edit ] Dayton's climate features warm, muggy summers and cold, dry winters, and is classified as a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ). Unless otherwise noted, all normal figures quoted within the text below are from the official climatology station, Dayton International Airport, at an elevation of 1,000 ft (304.8 m) about 10 mi (16 km) to the north of downtown Dayton, which lies within the valley of the Miami River ; thus temperatures there are typically cooler than in downtown.

[ 46 ] At the airport, monthly mean temperatures range from 27.5 °F (−2.5 °C) in January to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in July. The highest temperature ever recorded in Dayton was 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 1901, and the coldest was −28 °F (−33 °C) on February 13 during the Great Blizzard of 1899 . On average, there are 14 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs and 4.5 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows annually. Snow is moderate, with a normal seasonal accumulation of 23.3 in (59 cm), [ a ] usually occurring from November to March, occasionally April, and rarely October. Precipitation averages 41.1 inches (1,040 mm) annually, with total rainfall peaking in May.

Dayton is subject to severe weather typical of the Midwestern United States .

Tornadoes are possible from the spring to the fall. Floods, blizzards, and severe thunderstorms can also occur.

On Memorial Day of 2019, Dayton suffered extensive property damage and one death during a tornado outbreak , in which a total of 15 tornadoes touched down in the Dayton area.

The Dayton chapter manages local activities contributing to the annual, hemisphere-wide Christmas Bird Count .

[ 55 ] The Chapter began participation in the National Count in 1924. The local Count was initially coordinated by Ben Blincoe, who was succeeded by Jim Hill in 1970. In the mid-1960s, the freezing of Lake Erie and associated marshlands led species of waterfowl to appear in the Dayton-area, where surface waters remained unfrozen. Nine varieties of birds have been observed every year in the Dayton area: downy woodpecker , Carolina chickadee , tufted titmouse , brown creeper , northern cardinal , dark-eyed junco , American tree sparrow , song sparrow and American crow .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Cityscape [ edit ] Panorama of Dayton Architecture [ edit ] See also: List of tallest buildings in Dayton and National Register of Historic Places listings in Dayton, Ohio Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets (generally two or three full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. Also, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.

The Old Montgomery County Courthouse , built in 1847, and the current courthouse behind it.

A courthouse building was built in downtown Dayton in 1888 to supplement Dayton's original Neoclassical courthouse, which still stands. This second, "new" courthouse has since been replaced with new facilities as well as a park. The Old Court House has been a favored political campaign stop. On September 17, 1859, Abraham Lincoln delivered an address on its steps. Eight other presidents have visited the courthouse, either as presidents or during presidential campaigns: Andrew Johnson , James Garfield , John F. Kennedy , Lyndon B. Johnson , Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford , Ronald Reagan , and Bill Clinton .

[ 58 ] The Dayton Arcade , which opened on March 3, 1904, was built in the hopes of replacing open-air markets throughout the city. Throughout the decades, the Arcade has gone through many transformations but has retained its charm. Some of its main features include a Flemish facade at the Third Street entrance, a glass dome above the Arcade rotunda, and a chateau roof line above the Third Street facade.

[ 59 ] The Dayton Arcade is currently under renovations with no official completion date set.

In 2009, the CareSource Management Group finished construction of a $55 million corporate headquarters in downtown Dayton. The 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m 2 ), 10-story building was downtown's first new office tower in more than a decade.

[ 60 ] Dayton's two tallest buildings are the Kettering Tower at 408 ft (124 m) and the KeyBank Tower at 385 ft (117 m).

[ 61 ] Kettering Tower was originally Winters Tower, the headquarters of Winters Bank. The building was renamed after Virginia Kettering when Winters was merged into Bank One . KeyBank Tower was known as the MeadWestvaco Tower before KeyBank gained naming rights to the building in 2008.

[ 62 ] Ted Rall said in 2015 that over the last five decades Dayton has been demolishing some of its architecturally significant buildings to reduce the city's rental vacancy rate and thus increase the occupancy rate.

[ 63 ] Neighborhoods [ edit ] The Central Avenue Historic District in Grafton Hill Dayton's ten historic neighborhoods— Oregon District , Wright Dunbar , Dayton View , Grafton Hill , McPherson Town , Webster Station , Huffman , Kenilworth , St. Anne's Hill , and South Park —feature mostly single-family houses and mansions in the Neoclassical, Jacobethan , Tudor Revival , English Gothic , Chateauesque , Craftsman , Queen Anne , Georgian Revival , Colonial Revival , Renaissance Revival Architecture, Shingle Style Architecture, Prairie , Mission Revival , Eastlake/Italianate , American Foursquare , and Federal styles.

[ 64 ] Downtown Dayton is also a large area that encompasses several neighborhoods itself and has seen a recent uplift and revival.

In the federal government's National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970 , funding was provided for thirteen "new towns" or planned cities throughout the country. One location was set to become a suburb of Dayton and was known variously as Brookwood or Newfields.

[ 65 ] The goal was to have an entirely new suburb that would eventually house about 35,000 residents. The new town was to be located between Trotwood and Brookville, and modeled on the ideas of Ian McHarg . The project was abandoned in 1978 and most of the land became Sycamore State Park .
