Find sources: "Kernel" set theory – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In set theory , the kernel of a function f {\displaystyle f} (or equivalence kernel [ 1 ] ) may be taken to be either the equivalence relation on the function's domain that roughly expresses the idea of "equivalent as far as the function f {\displaystyle f} can tell", [ 2 ] or the corresponding partition of the domain.

An unrelated notion is that of the kernel of a non-empty family of sets B , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}},} which by definition is the intersection of all its elements: ker ⁡ ⁡ B = ⋂ ⋂ B ∈ ∈ B B .

{\displaystyle \ker {\mathcal {B}}~=~\bigcap _{B\in {\mathcal {B}}}\,B.} This definition is used in the theory of filters to classify them as being free or principal .

Definition [ edit ] Kernel of a function For the formal definition, let f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} be a function between two sets .
Elements x 1 , x 2 ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2}\in X} are equivalent if f ( x 1 ) {\displaystyle f\left(x_{1}\right)} and f ( x 2 ) {\displaystyle f\left(x_{2}\right)} are equal , that is, are the same element of Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} The kernel of f {\displaystyle f} is the equivalence relation thus defined.

[ 2 ] Kernel of a family of sets The kernel of a family B ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\neq \varnothing } of sets is [ 3 ] ker ⁡ ⁡ B := ⋂ ⋂ B ∈ ∈ B B .

{\displaystyle \ker {\mathcal {B}}~:=~\bigcap _{B\in {\mathcal {B}}}B.} The kernel of B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} is also sometimes denoted by ∩ ∩ B .

{\displaystyle \cap {\mathcal {B}}.} The kernel of the empty set , ker ⁡ ⁡ ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle \ker \varnothing ,} is typically left undefined. 
A family is called fixed and is said to have non-empty intersection if its kernel is not empty.

[ 3 ] A family is said to be free if it is not fixed; that is, if its kernel is the empty set.

[ 3 ] Quotients [ edit ] Like any equivalence relation, the kernel can be modded out to form a quotient set , and the quotient set is the partition: { { w ∈ ∈ X : f ( x ) = f ( w ) } : x ∈ ∈ X } = { f − − 1 ( y ) : y ∈ ∈ f ( X ) } .

{\displaystyle \left\{\,\{w\in X:f(x)=f(w)\}~:~x\in X\,\right\}~=~\left\{f^{-1}(y)~:~y\in f(X)\right\}.} This quotient set X / = f {\displaystyle X/=_{f}} is called the coimage of the function f , {\displaystyle f,} and denoted coim ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {coim} f} (or a variation).
The coimage is naturally isomorphic (in the set-theoretic sense of a bijection ) to the image , im ⁡ ⁡ f ; {\displaystyle \operatorname {im} f;} specifically, the equivalence class of x {\displaystyle x} in X {\displaystyle X} (which is an element of coim ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {coim} f} ) corresponds to f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} in Y {\displaystyle Y} (which is an element of im ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \operatorname {im} f} ).

As a subset of the Cartesian product [ edit ] Like any binary relation , the kernel of a function may be thought of as a subset of the Cartesian product X × × X .

{\displaystyle X\times X.} In this guise, the kernel may be denoted ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \ker f} (or a variation) and may be defined symbolically as [ 2 ] ker ⁡ ⁡ f := { ( x , x ′ ) : f ( x ) = f ( x ′ ) } .

{\displaystyle \ker f:=\{(x,x'):f(x)=f(x')\}.} The study of the properties of this subset can shed light on f .

{\displaystyle f.} Algebraic structures [ edit ] See also: Kernel (algebra) If X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are algebraic structures of some fixed type (such as groups , rings , or vector spaces ), and if the function f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is a homomorphism , then ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \ker f} is a congruence relation (that is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the algebraic structure), and the coimage of f {\displaystyle f} is a quotient of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 2 ] The bijection between the coimage and the image of f {\displaystyle f} is an isomorphism in the algebraic sense; this is the most general form of the first isomorphism theorem .

In topology [ edit ] See also: Filters in topology If f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is a continuous function between two topological spaces then the topological properties of ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \ker f} can shed light on the spaces X {\displaystyle X} and Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} For example, if Y {\displaystyle Y} is a Hausdorff space then ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \ker f} must be a closed set .
Conversely, if X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff space and ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle \ker f} is a closed set, then the coimage of f , {\displaystyle f,} if given the quotient space topology, must also be a Hausdorff space.

A space is compact if and only if the kernel of every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property (FIP) is non-empty; [ 4 ] [ 5 ] said differently, a space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets with F.I.P. is fixed .
