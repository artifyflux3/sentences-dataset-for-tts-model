Among them, Wilma (third image from the right in the bottom row) was the most intense, with a minimum central pressure of 882 hPa.

During 2005, tropical cyclones formed within seven different tropical cyclone basins , located within various parts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. During the year, a total of 141 systems formed with 94 of these developing further and were named by the responsible warning centre. The strongest tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Wilma , which was estimated to have a minimum barometric pressure of 882 hPa (26.05 inHg ). 2005 was above-average in terms of the number of storms. The most active basin in the year was the North Atlantic , which documented 28 named systems. The Western Pacific had an near-average season with 23 named storms. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season experienced an above-average number of tropical storm intensity systems, numbering 15. Activity across the southern hemisphere's three basins – South-West Indian , Australian , and South Pacific – was fairly significant, with the regions recording 23 named storms altogether, with the most intense Southern Hemisphere cyclone of the year, Cyclone Percy from the South Pacific Ocean basin peaking at 145 mph (235 km/h) and 900 millibars. Throughout the year, 28 Category 3 tropical cyclones formed, including eight Category 5 tropical cyclones in the year. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2005 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University was 899.6 units.

The deadliest tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Stan in the North Atlantic Ocean, which killed more than 1,600 people in Central America.

Hurricane Katrina , also in the North Atlantic Ocean, was the costliest tropical cyclone of the season and all time (tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 ), causing more than $125 billion in damage after striking the United States, especially New Orleans and its surrounding areas.

Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions [ edit ] On the Eastern and Central Pacific, three simultaneous tropical cyclones existed on September 22.

( November 2021 ) The 2005 tropical cyclone season was marked by record-breaking activity, particularly in the North Atlantic, which saw 28 named storms, 15 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina . This was driven by unusually warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and favorable atmospheric pressure patterns. Globally, the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans experienced near-average activity, while the Eastern Pacific was slightly below average due to cooler waters. The season was shaped by neutral ENSO conditions, warm ocean temperatures, and high ocean heat content, contributing to cyclone intensity in several regions.

A strong La Niña existed throughout 2005.

Summary [ edit ] North Atlantic Ocean [ edit ] 2005 Atlantic hurricane season summary map Further information: 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The activity was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history at the time, shattering numerous records, with 31 tropical or subtropical cyclones recorded. The United States National Hurricane Center [ nb 1 ] named 27 storms, exhausting the annual pre-designated list and resulting in the usage of six Greek letter names. A record 15 storms attained hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h ); of those, a record seven became major hurricanes, which are a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale . The season's impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,468 deaths and approximately $171.7 billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until its record was surpassed 12 years later . It also produced the second-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the Atlantic basin, surpassed only by the 1933 season . The season officially began on June 1, 2005, and the first storm – Arlene – developed on June 8.

Hurricane Dennis in July inflicted heavy damage to Cuba.

Hurricane Stan in October was part of a broader weather system that killed 1,668 people and caused $3.96 billion in damage to eastern Mexico and Central America, with Guatemala hit the hardest. The final storm – Zeta – formed in late December and lasted until January 6, 2006.

Eastern Pacific Ocean [ edit ] 2005 Pacific hurricane season summary map Further information: 2005 Pacific hurricane season The activity continued the trend of generally below-average activity that began a decade prior. The season's first tropical cyclone, Adrian, developed on May 17 and reached its peak as a Category 1 hurricane . Named storms are infrequent in May, with one tropical storm every two years and a hurricane once every four years.

[ 2 ] At the time, Adrian was the fourth earliest tropical cyclone to form in the eastern Pacific since reliable record-keeping began in 1971. Activity throughout the remainder of the season was far less notable, with 16 tropical cyclones, 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The long-term 1971–2004 average suggests an average season to feature 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. October, in particular, was notably quiet, with the formation of only one tropical depression; only three other seasons, 1989, 1995, and 1996, ended the month without the designation of a named storm.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) 2005 Pacific typhoon season summary map Further information: 2005 Pacific typhoon season Although the season was quiet, some typhoons caused extensive damages in many places, especially in China where eight typhoons struck the country. First, Typhoon Haitang became the strongest storm in the basin this year and caused about $1.1 billion in damages in Taiwan and China in mid July. In August, Typhoon Matsa made landfall in Eastern China and caused about $2.23 billion in damages. Later that same month, two powerful typhoons made landfall, causing extreme damage and some casualties. Similar to Haitang, Typhoon Longwang made landfall in Taiwan and China at a strong intensity causing damages. The season also marked the first time the Atlantic hurricane season was more active than the Pacific typhoon season (the others being 2010 and 2020 ). However, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season featured record high activity while the Pacific typhoon season featured near average activity.

North Indian Ocean [ edit ] Further information: 2005 North Indian Ocean cyclone season 2005 North Indian Ocean cyclone season map There were a total of 12 depressions during the year, three less than normal, although the highest since 1992. The IMD named four cyclonic storms, a process they initiated in 2004, which was also below normal. No systems strengthened beyond cyclonic storm status. The season was the sixth in a row with below normal activity, based on the seasonal accumulated cyclone energy . Storms generally develop when the monsoon trough is located over tropical waters, with a peak from May to June and another peak in November.

[ 4 ] The monsoon developed 11 distinct low-pressure areas by the end of September, including five monsoon depressions, [ 5 ] and the monsoon season was more active than usual.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Cyclone Ingrid March was very inactive, featuring five tropical cyclones with all of them being named. The month started off with Cyclone Ingrid , which formed north of the Gulf of Carpentaria . Ingril was a erratic cyclone which effected much of Northern Australia as a Category 4 tropical storm. The storm made landfall on the town of Nhulunbuy as a Category 5 on the Australian scale. It then made a slow approach on Kimberley before dissipating. While, Ingril was a Category 5 cyclone, another storm named Cyclone Willy formed northwest of Australia . Willy only caused minor oil distruption in the Timor Sea but had no effect on land. The Western Pacific basin featured its second storm Tropical Storm Roke . Roke struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon killing 7 people. The South-West Indian Ocean featured two storms named Hennie and Isang . Hennie caused minor damage on Mauritius , and Réunion before accelerating towards the southeastern Indian Ocean. Isang on the other hand took a similar route with Hennie but had no effect on land.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Cyclone Adeline-Juliet April was average featuring eight tropical cyclones, of which three were named. The month started off with Cyclone Adeline-Juliet which became the strongest storm of the month. The storm was first noted near the Cocos Islands and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Adeline. It then entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin where the storm was renamed Juliet. It then intensified into an Intense Tropical Cyclone until the system weakened and became extratropical. Later 11U formed over the Arafura Sea and made landfall on Papua New Guinea . 11U was the last storm of the 2004–05 Australian region cyclone season . The second named storm was Cyclone Sheila which formed over Fiji . The storm then curved away from Fiji where the storm dissipated shortly after being named. The third named storm was Typhoon Sonca which formed in the Western Pacific. It then intensified into a Category 4 typhoon. Despite its strength, the typhoon stayed at sea and dissipated. The other unnamed storms were rather weak and short-lived as not much information is known.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Typhoon Nesat May was a very inactive season featuring only three tropical cyclones with two of them being named. The month's first storm started in the Western Pacific with the formation of a tropical depression named Crising which was named by the PAGASA . Crising formed east of the Philippine island of Mindanao however, the storm never organized into a tropical storm and did not receive an International name. It then dissipated east of the Philippines . The Eastern Pacific featured its first storm of the year, Hurricane Adrian .

Adrian formed very early shortly after the season started and took an unusually northeast route towards El Salvador making it the closest hurricane ever to approach the country. It then made landfall on Honduras before dissipating. The last storm of the month was Nesat which formed near Guam .

Nesat then intensified into a Category 4 typhoon before passing south of Japan before becoming extratropical southeast of Japan.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Typhoon Haitang July was average featuring fourteen tropical cyclones, with twelve of them being named. The East Pacific featured two tropical storms named Dora and Eugene . The two storms made a close approach to the Mexican coastline however, the damage was minimal. The Western Pacific saw the formation of Typhoons Haitang , Matsa and Tropical Storms Nalgae , Banyan , and Washi and Emong . Typhoon Haitang, which became the strongest storm of the month made landfall on China and Taiwan along with Typhoon Matsa which made landfall near Shanghai .

Washi made landfall in Vietnam while Banyan made a close approach to Japan but missed the country and became extratropical east of Japan. The Atlantic featured three hurricanes and two tropical storms. Some notable storms include Dennis and Hurricane Emily .

Dennis was an early-forming Category 4 hurricane that traveled across the Caribbean and eventually striking Alabama inflicting severe damage and killing at least 70 people. Dennis was then followed by Emily which also formed near Windward Islands . It then became the earliest-forming hurricane with a Category 5 strength. It was also the costliest Category 5 hurricane to not have its name retired. The North Indian Ocean featured the only non-named storm of the month classified as BOB 02 which was short lived.

( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Hurricane Rita September was very active featuring 22 tropical storms with 17 of them being named. The Eastern Pacific featured Hurricanes Jova , Kenneth , Max , and Otis and Tropical storms Lidia and Norma . Otis became a Category 2 hurricane and threatened the Baja California Peninsula , however, it dissipated before it could reach the peninsula. The other storms on the other hand stayed at sea. The Western Pacific featured some deadly storms mostly being Typhoons Khanun , Damrey , Vicente , and Longwang .

Khanun , Damrey , and Longwang all struck China killing more than 350 people.

Vincente on the other hand looped in The South China Sea before striking Vietnam killing at least 22 people. The Atlantic season continued with the formation of Hurricanes Maria , Nate , Ophelia , Philippe , and Rita , and a short lived depression .

Maria , affected parts of Norway causing 3 deaths.

Nate stayed at sea however it disturbed some Canadian Navy ships heading to the U.S to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina along with Ophelia which affected much of the Eastern United States as well as parts of Atlantic Canada .

Hurricane Rita on the other hand became the third Category 5 hurricane in the basin and became the most intense Atlantic Hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico by pressure. Rita then made landfall near the Texas - Louisiana border which was already devastated by Hurricane Katrina . Rita was the strongest storm in 2005 until it was then beaten by Hurricane Wilma the next month. In the North Indian Ocean, three short lived depressions as well as Cyclone Pyarr formed.

Pyarr , being the only named stormed of the month affected India and Bangladesh which resulted in severe damage and severe loss of life.
