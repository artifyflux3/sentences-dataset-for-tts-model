This ultraviolet picture was taken in 1972 with a camera operated by Apollo 16 astronauts on the Moon.

The geocorona is the luminous part of the outermost region of the Earth's atmosphere , the exosphere . It is seen primarily via far-ultraviolet light ( Lyman-alpha ) from the Sun that is scattered from neutral hydrogen .

[ 1 ] It extends to at minimum 15.5 Earth radii and probably up to about 100 Earth radii (for context, the Moon is approx. 60 Earth radii away).

[ 2 ] The geocorona has been studied from outer space by the Astrid satellites and the Galileo spacecraft (among others), using its ultraviolet spectrometer ( UVS ) during an Earth flyby .
