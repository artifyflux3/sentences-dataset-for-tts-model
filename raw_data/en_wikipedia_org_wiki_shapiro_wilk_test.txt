The Shapiro–Wilk test is a test of normality . It was published in 1965 by Samuel Sanford Shapiro and Martin Wilk .

[ 1 ] Theory [ edit ] The Shapiro–Wilk test tests the null hypothesis that a sample x 1 , ..., x n came from a normally distributed population. The test statistic is W = ( ∑ ∑ i = 1 n a i x ( i ) ) 2 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 , {\displaystyle W={\frac {{\left(\sum \limits _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}x_{(i)}\right)}^{2}}{\sum \limits _{i=1}^{n}{\left(x_{i}-{\overline {x}}\right)}^{2}}},} where x ( i ) {\displaystyle x_{(i)}} with parentheses enclosing the subscript index i is the i th order statistic , i.e., the i th-smallest number in the sample (not to be confused with x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} ).

x ¯ ¯ = ( x 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + x n ) / n {\displaystyle {\overline {x}}=\left(x_{1}+\cdots +x_{n}\right)/n} is the sample mean.

The coefficients a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} are given by: [ 1 ] ( a 1 , … … , a n ) = m T V − − 1 C , {\displaystyle (a_{1},\dots ,a_{n})={m^{\mathsf {T}}V^{-1} \over C},} where C is a vector norm : [ 2 ] C = ‖ V − − 1 m ‖ = ( m T V − − 1 V − − 1 m ) 1 / 2 {\displaystyle C=\left\|V^{-1}m\right\|={\left(m^{\mathsf {T}}V^{-1}V^{-1}m\right)}^{1/2}} and the vector m , m = ( m 1 , … … , m n ) T {\displaystyle m=(m_{1},\dots ,m_{n})^{\mathsf {T}}} is made of the expected values of the order statistics of independent and identically distributed random variables sampled from the standard normal distribution; finally, V {\displaystyle V} is the covariance matrix of those normal order statistics.

[ 3 ] There is no name for the distribution of W {\displaystyle W} . The cutoff values for the statistics are calculated through Monte Carlo simulations.

[ 2 ] Interpretation [ edit ] The null-hypothesis of this test is that the population is normally distributed. If the p value is less than the chosen alpha level , then the null hypothesis is rejected and there is evidence that the data tested are not normally distributed.

[ 4 ] Like most statistical significance tests , if the sample size is sufficiently large this test may detect even trivial departures from the null hypothesis (i.e., although there may be some statistically significant effect , it may be too small to be of any practical significance); thus, additional investigation of the effect size is typically advisable, e.g., a Q–Q plot in this case.

[ 5 ] Power analysis [ edit ] Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated in practically relevant settings that Shapiro–Wilk has the best power for a given significance , followed closely by Anderson–Darling when comparing the Shapiro–Wilk, Kolmogorov–Smirnov , and Lilliefors .

[ 6 ] [ unreliable source?

] Approximation [ edit ] Royston proposed an alternative method of calculating the coefficients vector by providing an algorithm for calculating values that extended the sample size from 50 to 2,000.

[ 7 ] This technique is used in several software packages including GraphPad Prism ,  Stata, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] SPSS and SAS.

[ 10 ] Rahman and Govidarajulu extended the sample size further up to 5,000.
