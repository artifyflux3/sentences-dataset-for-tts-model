1817 Author Carl Friedrich Gauss Construction 2 elements in 2 groups The Gauss lens is a compound achromatic lens that uses two uncemented elements ; in its most basic form, a positive meniscus lens on the object side and a negative meniscus lens on the image side. It was first proposed in 1817 by the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss for a refracting telescope design, but was seldom implemented and is better known as the basis for the Double-Gauss lens first proposed in 1888 by Alvan Graham Clark , which is a four-element, four-group compound lens that uses a symmetric pair of Gauss lenses.

Design [ edit ] The power of the positive element predominates, but the negative element corrects for chromatic aberration ; the positive element facing the object is made of crown glass , while the negative element facing the image is made of flint glass , separated by an air gap that takes the shape of a negative element.

[ 1 ] : 127 Gauss first described the arrangement in 1817.

Alvan Clark & Sons built a 9 + 1 ⁄ 2 in (240 mm) telescope for Princeton University in 1877 using a Gauss lens; [ 2 ] : 117 although Gauss had designed the optics to eliminate spherical aberration for different wavelengths, the Clarks "found these meniscus components difficult to make [and] disagreed that they gave a more complete achromatism and better definition". The telescope is now held by the National Museum of American History .

[ 3 ] : 27–28, 143 Alvan G. Clark, the son of the founder of the eponymous American optical company, designed a photographic lens using a symmetric arrangement of two Gauss lenses and patented it in 1888; [ 4 ] Paul Rudolph introduced the Zeiss Planar as an improved Double-Gauss using cemented doublets in the place of the inner negative meniscus elements, [ 2 ] : 121 and Horace William Lee of the Taylor, Taylor and Hobson Company completed the evolution by introducing asymmetry to the Double-Gauss design with the 1920 Opic .

[ 2 ] : 122 Derivatives of the Opic have dominated the design of high-speed (large aperture) photographic lenses since then.
