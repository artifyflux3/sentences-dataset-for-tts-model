[W]hen I first started writing about Benjamin Franklin , I thought of him as a writer, a humanities type, somebody interested in governance.  I did realize that he was probably the most important experimental scientist of his time.  Both with the electricity experiment and so many of his other inventions .  And I realize that a Benjamin Franklin or a Thomas Jefferson would have thought people philistines if they didn't appreciate the beauty of science.  And likewise, Albert Einstein , a great scientist would have thought people philistines if they were scientists and didn't appreciate the beauty of Goethe or Mozart, or all of the literature or music that he loved.
