[ 16 ] [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Du Sautoy was educated at Gillotts Comprehensive School [ 4 ] and King James's Sixth Form College (now Henley College) and Wadham College, Oxford , where he was awarded a first class honours degree in mathematics . In 1991 he completed a doctorate in mathematics on discrete groups , analytic groups and Poincaré series , supervised by Dan Segal .

[ 2 ] Career and research [ edit ] Marcus du Sautoy in 2007 Du Sautoy's research "uses classical tools from number theory to explore the mathematics of symmetry".

[ 1 ] Du Sautoy's academic work concerns mainly group theory and number theory .

[ 18 ] Du Sautoy is known for his work popularising mathematics , and has been named by The Independent on Sunday as one of the UK's leading scientists. He has also served on the advisory board of Mangahigh.com , an online maths game website. He is a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4's In Our Time programme and has written for The Times and The Guardian . He has written numerous academic articles and books on mathematics, the most recent being an exploration of the current state of creativity in artificial intelligence, The Creativity Code .

[ 19 ] He is co-director of PRiSM, the Centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music at the Royal Northern College of Music , which he co-founded with composer Emily Howard .

[ 20 ] In a 2006 article published in Seed magazine, du Sautoy discussed the Hilbert-Pólya conjecture , a way for advances in quantum physics to provide insight into the Riemann hypothesis .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Books [ edit ] His popular mathematics and popular science books include: The Music of the Primes [ 23 ] Finding Moonshine [ 24 ] Symmetry: A Journey into the Patterns of Nature [ 25 ] The Num8er My5teries: A Mathematical Odyssey Through Everyday Life [ 26 ] What We Cannot Know [ 27 ] The Great Unknown: Seven Journeys to the Frontiers of Science [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Thinking Better: The Art of the Shortcut [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Around the World in 80 Games: A mathematician unlocks the secrets of the greatest games [ 34 ] Blueprints: How mathematics shapes creativity [ 35 ] Television [ edit ] Among many other programmes, [ 36 ] Du Sautoy presented the BBC Four television programme Mind Games and co-hosted the TV series School of Hard Sums with Dara Ó Briain . On the latter show, he posed mathematical questions with real-world applications. Ó Briain and a guest then tried to solve the problems, using rigorous and experimental methods, respectively.

In December 2006, du Sautoy delivered the 2006 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures under the collective title The Num8er My5teries .

[ 37 ] This was only the third time the subject of the lectures had been mathematics – on the first occasion, in 1978, when the lecture was delivered by Erik Christopher Zeeman , du Sautoy had been a schoolboy in the audience. Other television work includes: [ citation needed ] Mindgames (BBC Four, 2004–5). Presented 20 episodes of puzzle gameshow with regular guests Kathy Sykes and Michael Rosen .

The Music of the Primes (BBC Four, 2005, BBC 2 2007). One-hour documentary based on his book.
