Early life [ edit ] Widener was born September 21, 1861 [ 1 ] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania .

[ 2 ] Her father was the wealthy businessman William Lukens Elkins. She attended Vassar College for one year but left to marry George Dunton Widener, the son of her father's business partner, Peter Arrell Browne Widener, on November 1, 1883.

[ 1 ] They lived in the 110-room mansion, Lynnewood Hall , in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

[ 3 ] Their children were Harry Elkins Widener, George Dunton Widener Jr.

, and Eleanor Widener Dixon .

[ 4 ] Titanic survival and memorials [ edit ] In March 1912, Widener traveled with her husband and son on the RMS Mauretania from New York to Liverpool, England.

[ 5 ] The trip to England was to ensure the safe arrival of 30 silver plates once owned by Nell Gwyn being donated to the London Museum . They subsequently traveled to Paris to purchase a wedding dress for the upcoming marriage of their daughter Eleanor [ 6 ] and to search for a chef for their new hotel, the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia.

[ 7 ] On April 10 they embarked at Cherbourg on the RMS Titanic for their return to the United States.

[ 8 ] She traveled with a pearl necklace valued at $750,000. On the night the ship sank, they hosted a dinner in the À la Carte Restaurant attended by the ship's captain, Edward Smith , Archibald Butt and John B. Thayer .

[ 1 ] George, Harry, and their valet died in the sinking, but Eleanor and her maid [ 9 ] survived in lifeboat #4 [ 10 ] along with first-class female passengers Madeleine Astor , Emily Ryerson , [ 11 ] and Marian Thayer . The lifeboat was rescued by the RMS Carpathia after about 2 hours.

[ 7 ] Eleanor donated $2 million dollars to Harvard University to build the Widener Library as a memorial to her son Harry Elkins Widener who died during the sinking of the Titanic She returned to Philadelphia to recover and renovated St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, as a memorial to her husband.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Widener and her second husband lived in the 30,000 square-foot Miramar mansion in Rhode Island She used her fortune to fund his field work [ 17 ] and accompanied him on several excursions in South America, Europe and India.

[ 12 ] Their wedding trip included a voyage aboard a boat outfitted for a 5,000-mile journey through South America. They returned several times in search of the source of the Orinoco River to dispel a myth that a tribe of White Indians ruled the area.

[ 1 ] On one trip, Widener became the first white woman to enter the Rio Negro country, where she caused a great sensation among the natives. She was kindly treated and showered with gifts. She made many friends with the women of the tribes by her gifts of beads, knives and other trinkets.

[ 21 ] She received approval from the Brazilian government to study the women of the region and built schools for the children.

[ 1 ] During a 1920 trip on the Amazon River , the party warded off an attack by "savages and killed two cannibals".

[ 22 ] Widener remained on the yacht during the attack.

[ 21 ] That particular trip was abandoned on the advice of their Indian guides, but the Rices ventured several more times into the jungles.

[ 22 ] Death and legacy [ edit ] She was interred in the Widener Family Mausoleum in Laurel Hill Cemetery On July 13, 1937, [ 23 ] Widener died of a heart attack [ 1 ] in a Paris store [ 9 ] [ 22 ] and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia [ 24 ] in the Widener family mausoleum. Her crypt makes no mention of her Titanic survival, however the cenotaphs to her husband and son in the same mausoleum mention the sinking.

[ 12 ] She left her fortune of $11 million, [ 25 ] with minor exceptions, to a trust for the benefit of Rice, to pass on his death to her surviving son George and daughter Eleanor.

[ 26 ] She gifted the furniture and contents of her Louis XVI drawing room from her New York City home on Fifth Avenue to the Pennsylvania Museum of Art .

[ 27 ] In 1938, an inscription was placed over the door to the Harry Widener Memorial Room in the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library in her honor.

[ 28 ] Her grandson, Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., requested that Penn Morton College in Chester, Pennsylvania, be renamed Widener College in honor of his grandmother.

[ 29 ] Portrayals [ edit ] Diana Kent (2012) Titanic ; TV series [ 30 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ a b [ 2 ] "The December 31, 1912 agreement between Widener and Harvard University, regarding her donation of Widener Library, and the family genealogy spell Mrs. Widener's given name with terminal 'e'; however, she appears to have dropped the 'e' for her personal use and consistently signed letters to Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell without the 'e'." [ 31 ] : 77n References [ edit ] Citations ^ a b c d e f g Geller, Judith B. (1998).
