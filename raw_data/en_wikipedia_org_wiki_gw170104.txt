Date 4 January 2017 Redshift 0.18 ±0.08 Total energy output ≈ 2 M ☉ × c 2 Other designations GW170104 Related media on Commons [ edit on Wikidata ] GW170104 was a gravitational wave signal detected by the LIGO observatory on 4 January 2017. On 1 June 2017, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced that they had reliably verified the signal, making it the third such signal announced , after GW150914 and GW151226 , and fourth overall.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Event detection [ edit ] The signal was detected by LIGO at 10:11:58.6 UTC , with the Hanford detector picking it up 3 milliseconds before the Livingston detector. Automated analyses did not initially identify this event as information about the state of the Hanford detector was not being correctly recorded.

[ 1 ] The event was found by a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics by visual inspection of triggers from the Livingston detector.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The gravitational wave frequency at peak GW strain was 160 to 199 Hz .

Astrophysical origin [ edit ] Analysis indicated the signal resulted from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes (BBH) with 31.2 +8.4 −6.0 and 19.4 +5.3 −5.9 times the mass of the Sun , at a distance of 880 +450 −390 megaparsecs ( 2.9 +1.5 −1.3 billion light years) from Earth. The resulting black hole had a mass of 48.7 +5.7 −4.6 solar masses, two solar masses having been radiated away as gravitational energy . The peak luminosity of GW170104 was 3.1 +0.7 −1.3 × 10 49 W .

[ 1 ] Implication for binary black hole formation [ edit ] The spin axes of the black holes were likely misaligned with the axis of the binary orbit . The probability that both spin axes were positively aligned with the orbit is less than 5%. This configuration suggests that the binary black hole system was formed dynamically in a dense star cluster such as a globular cluster , i.e., as a result of gravitational interaction between stars and binary stars , in which case randomly aligned spin axes are expected. The competing scenario, that the system was formed out of a binary star system consisting of two normal ( main sequence ) stars, is not ruled out but is disfavored as black holes formed in such a binary are more likely to have positively aligned spins.

[ 1 ] Graviton mass upper limit [ edit ] The analysis of GW170104 yielded a new upper bound on the mass of gravitons , if gravitons are massive at all . The graviton's Compton wavelength is at least 1.6 × 10 16 m , or about 1.6 light-years , corresponding to a graviton mass of no more than 7.7 × 10 −23 eV / c 2 .

[ 1 ] This Compton wavelength is about 9 × 10 9 times greater than the gravitational wavelength of the GW170104 event.
