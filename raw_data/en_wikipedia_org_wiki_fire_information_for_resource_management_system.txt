It displays active fire locations in near real-time overlaid on a map.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] While created to monitor wildfires , [ 1 ] it has also been used to report on fires due to military conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine [ 3 ] and the Tigray war .

[ 4 ] Specifications [ edit ] Satellites [ edit ] The data is collected via satellites in sun-synchronous orbit , making each satellite pass over the same location on Earth on the same time every day. Each satellite crosses the equator from North to South twelve times a day thus also from South to North twelve times a day.

Aqua 's ascending orbital path as of 2021 Aqua's descending orbital path as of 2021 NOAA-20 's descending orbital path Instruments [ edit ] The data is collected via MODIS (on board Terra and Aqua) and VIIRS (on board Suomi NPP ,  NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 ) satellite instruments.

[ 5 ] The spatial resolution of the MODIS instrument is 1 km × 1 km and 375 m × 375 m for VIIRS. This sets a lower limit on how accurately fires can be placed and whether a detection stems from a single larger or multiple smaller fires.

[ 4 ] Website [ edit ] The data collected by FIRMS are presented as a free web mapping service, with the active fire locations if any overlaid on a map.

[ 1 ] The detections are displayed on top of a static background layer and each visualized detection is clickable to display its data, such as detection time, coordinates, satellite and instrument. The default static background layer consists of higher resolution satellite imagery with terrain details called Blue Marble in reference to The Blue Marble .

[ 1 ] On 31 January 2023 NASA entered into a Space Act agreement with GIS software company Esri . The purpose of the agreement is to further improve global access to NASA's geospatial data via Esri's ArcGIS software and via Open Geospatial Consortium data-formats.
