American mathematician Lawrence C. Evans Lawrence Craig Evans in 2004 Born Lawrence Craig Evans ( 1949-11-01 ) November 1, 1949 (age 75) Atlanta , Georgia Title Class of 1961 Collegium Professor of Mathematics at UC Berkeley Awards National Academy of Sciences inductee, 2014 AMS Fellow, 2013 Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research, 2004 American Academy of Arts and Sciences inductee, 2003 Academic background Education Vanderbilt University (BA) Alma mater UCLA (PhD) Thesis Non linear evolution equations in an arbitrary Banach space (1975) Doctoral advisor Michael G. Crandall Academic work Discipline Mathematics Institutions UC Berkeley Doctoral students Tom Ilmanen Suzanne Lenhart Website https://math.berkeley.edu/~evans/ Lawrence Craig Evans (born November 1, 1949) is an American mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley .

His research is in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations , primarily elliptic equations . In 2004, he shared the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research with Nicolai V. Krylov for their proofs, found independently, that solutions of concave, fully nonlinear, uniformly elliptic equations are C 2 , α α {\displaystyle C^{2,\alpha }} . Evans also made significant contributions to the development of the theory of viscosity solutions of nonlinear equations, to the understanding of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation arising in stochastic optimal control theory, and to the theory of harmonic maps . He is also well known as the author of the textbook Partial Differential Equations, [ 1 ] which is considered as a standard introduction to the theory at the graduate level. His textbook Measure theory and fine properties of functions (coauthored with Ronald Gariepy), an exposition on Hausdorff measure, capacity, Sobolev functions, and sets of finite perimeter, is also widely cited.

Evans is an ISI highly cited researcher .
