Star Naming Notes Proxima Centauri Named for being the closest neighbouring star to Earth's Sun Lies within the Alpha Centauri star system [ 9 ] Barnard's Star Named after its discoverer, E. E. Barnard Second closest neighbouring star system to Earth, after α Cen. Also the star with the highest proper motion.

[ 14 ] van Biesbroeck's star Named for its discoverer, George van Biesbroeck Was once the least luminous, and, lowest mass, known star.

[ 15 ] Kapteyn's star Named for the astronomer who discovered it had gone missing, Jacobus Kapteyn Was once the star with the highest proper motion , thus making it move away from its recorded position in the sky and go "missing".

[ 14 ] Teegarden's Star Named after the lead investigator astrophysicist who discovered it, Bonnard J. Teegarden , through a datacrunching search of archived data.
