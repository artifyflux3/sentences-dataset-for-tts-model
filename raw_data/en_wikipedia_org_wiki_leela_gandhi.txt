[ 1 ] [ 2 ] She is currently the John Hawkes Professor of Humanities and English and director of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] She is the great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi .

Gandhi previously taught at the University of Chicago , La Trobe University , and the University of Delhi . She is a founding co-editor of the academic journal Postcolonial Studies , and she serves on the editorial board of the electronic journal Postcolonial Text .

[ 6 ] She is a Senior Fellow of the School of Criticism and Theory at Cornell University .

[ 7 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Gandhi was born in Mumbai and is the daughter of the late Indian philosopher Ramchandra Gandhi and the great-granddaughter of the Indian Independence movement leader Mahatma Gandhi .

[ 8 ] She has offered analysis that some of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophies (on nonviolence and vegetarianism, for example) and policies were influenced by transnational as well as indigenous sources.

[ 9 ] She received her undergraduate degree from Hindu College, Delhi and her doctorate was from Balliol College, Oxford .

[ 10 ] She is also the great-granddaughter of C. Rajagopalachari . Her paternal grandfather Devdas Gandhi was the youngest son of Mahatma Gandhi and her paternal grandmother Lakshmi was the daughter of C. Rajagopalachari .

[ citation needed ] Reviews and critiques [ edit ] With the publication of her first book Postcolonial Theory: A Critical Introduction in 1998, Gandhi was described as mapping "the field in terms of its wider philosophical and intellectual context, drawing important connections between postcolonial theory and poststructuralism , postmodernism , Marxism and feminism ." [ 11 ] Her next book, Affective Communities , was written to "[reveal] for the first time how those associated with marginalized lifestyles, subcultures, and traditions—including homosexuality , vegetarianism , animal rights , spiritualism , and aestheticism —united against imperialism and forged strong bonds with colonized subjects and cultures".

[ 12 ] Gandhi traces the social networks of activists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries connecting Edward Carpenter with M.K. Gandhi and Mirra Alfassa with Sri Aurobindo .

Through this work, Gandhi became noted for proposing a "conceptual model of postcolonial engagement" surrounding ethical premises of hospitality and " xenophilia ", and for bringing for the first time a queer perspective to postcolonial theory.

Gandhi's third book, The Common Cause , presents a transnational history of democracy in the first half of the twentieth century through the lens of ethics in the broad sense of disciplined self-fashioning.

[ 13 ] This book has been described as "an alternate history of democracy foregrounding events of errant relation," and "the most thoroughgoing defence of the value of infinite inclusivity to postcolonial studies." [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Leela Gandhi is also a published poet. Her first collection of poems, Measures of Home , was published by Ravi Dayal in 2000, and her subsequent poetry is included in several anthologies.
