[ 1 ] Life and career [ edit ] Ionescu Tulcea was born in October 1923 in Bucharest .

[ 2 ] He received his diploma from the University of Bucharest in 1946; there he was an assistant professor from 1946 to 1950, a lecturer from 1950 to 1951, and an associate professor from 1952 to 1957. Additionally, from 1949 to 1957 he was a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy . In 1957 he moved to the United States with his wife Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea ( née Bagdasar), who had been his student. From 1957 to 1961 he worked as a research associate and visiting lecturer at Yale University . He received his doctorate from Yale in 1959 under the supervision of Einar Hille with thesis Semi-groups of Operators .

[ 3 ] Cassius Ionescu Tulcea was from 1959 to 1961 a visiting professor at Yale University , from 1961 to 1964 an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania , and from 1964 to 1966 a full professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign . He became in 1966 a full professor at Northwestern University [ 1 ] and retired from there as professor emeritus.

His marriage to his former student Alexandra Bagdasar lasted from 1956 to 1969 when they divorced. During their marriage, the two mathematicians  wrote a number of papers together, as well as a well-regarded research monograph on lifting theory .

John von Neumann initiated lifting theory in functional analysis with applications in probability theory. The Ionescu-Tulcea theorem , an important existence theorem for time-discrete stochastic processes , is named after Cassius Ionescu Tulcea (1949). He also did research on mathematical game theory and mathematical economics. He co-authored a book on casino gambling and several textbooks on mathematics; he also wrote a 1981 book on casino dice games and gambling systems and a 1982 book on casino blackjack .

In 1957 he was awarded the Prize of the Romanian Academy of Sciences . His doctoral students include George Maltese and Robert Langlands .

He turned 90 in October 2013 [ 4 ] and died in Chicago, Illinois , in March 2021, at the age of 97.
