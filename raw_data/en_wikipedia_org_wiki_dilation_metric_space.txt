[ 1 ] In Euclidean space , such a dilation is a similarity of the space.

[ 2 ] Dilations change the size but not the shape of an object or figure.

Every dilation of a Euclidean space that is not a congruence has a unique fixed point [ 3 ] that is called the center of dilation .

[ 4 ] Some congruences have fixed points and others do not.
