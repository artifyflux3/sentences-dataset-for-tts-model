The Game Act 1831 [ a ] ( 1 & 2 Will. 4 . c. 32) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , which was passed to protect game birds by establishing a close season during which they could not be legally taken. The act also established the need for game licences and the appointing of gamekeepers . It has covered the protection of game birds to this day.

Game covered [ edit ] The act designated certain species as game birds and their open season, when they may be shot: Red grouse ( Moor Game ), 12 August – 10 December Black grouse ( Black Game ), 20 August – 10 December Pheasant , 1 October – 1 February Partridge , 1 September – 1 February As well as adhering to the seasons, game may not be taken on Sundays or Christmas Day.

The great bustard was protected under the act, with its open season decided as 1 September to 1 March. This protection was little use, however, as the great bustard became extinct in Great Britain in the 1830s. It is currently part of a reintroduction programme.

Capercaillie are not protected in the act, as they were extinct in Britain at the time. They were reintroduced to Scotland in 1837.

Brown hares are mentioned in the act but have no closed season. Two Hares Acts were passed in the 19th century. The first, in 1848, removed the requirement for a game certificate for occupiers to kill hares, regulated where hunting could take place, and the banned of baiting with poison.

[ 2 ] The second, in 1892, among other things, prohibited the sale of hare meat between March and July, which is the animals' breeding season.

[ 3 ] Game licences [ edit ] The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence. Also, it made an excise licence necessary to deal with game.

[ 4 ] The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales.

Game licences were abolished in England and Wales on 1 August 2007, as well as the need for game dealers licences, and the law changed to allow selling game, except hare, year round.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In Northern Ireland, game licences and game dealing licences were abolished on 13 June 2011.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In Scotland, game licences and game dealing licences were abolished on 29 June 2011.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Gamekeepers [ edit ] The act listed requirements on the appointment of gamekeepers and on the issuing of a gamekeepers licence on an estate.

Other birds [ edit ] Although it is not included in the act, a game licence was required to shoot woodcock and common snipe until 1 August 2007. Wildfowl are protected and their close seasons are stated in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 .

Subsequent developments [ edit ] Due to the limited territorial extent of the act to England and Wales , the acts repealed by this act were subsequently repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1861 ( 24 & 25 Vict.

c. 101), the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872 ( 35 & 36 Vict.

c. 98) and the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1978 .

Notes [ edit ] ^ a b The citation of this act by this short title was authorised by section 1 of, and the first schedule to, the Short Titles Act 1896 . Due to the repeal of those provisions it is now authorised by section 19(2) of the Interpretation Act 1978 .

^ Section 48.

^ The provisions of the act regarding game dealing licences were subsequently extended across the United Kingdom by section 13 of the Game Licences Act 1860 ( 23 & 24 Vict.

c. 90).
