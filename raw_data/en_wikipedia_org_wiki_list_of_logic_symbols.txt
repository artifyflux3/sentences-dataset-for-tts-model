Without proper rendering support , you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of logic symbols.

In logic , a set of symbols is commonly used to express logical representation. The following table lists many common symbols, together with their name, how they should be read out loud, and the related field of mathematics . Additionally, the subsequent columns contains an informal explanation, a short example, the Unicode location, the name for use in HTML documents, [ 1 ] and the LaTeX symbol.

Basic logic symbols [ edit ] Symbol Unicode value (hexadecimal) HTML codes LaTeX symbol Logic Name Read as Category Explanation Examples ⇒ → ⊃ U+21D2 U+2192 U+2283 &#8658; &#8594; &#8835; &rArr; &rarr; &sup; ⇒ ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } \Rightarrow ⟹ ⟹ {\displaystyle \implies } \implies → → {\displaystyle \to } \to or \rightarrow ⊃ ⊃ {\displaystyle \supset } \supset material conditional (material implication) implies, if P then Q, it is not the case that P and not Q propositional logic , Boolean algebra , Heyting algebra A ⇒ ⇒ B {\displaystyle A\Rightarrow B} is false when A is true and B is false but true otherwise.

→ → {\displaystyle \rightarrow } may mean the same as ⇒ ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } (the symbol may also indicate the domain and codomain of a function ; see table of mathematical symbols ).

⊃ ⊃ {\displaystyle \supset } may mean the same as ⇒ ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } (the symbol may also mean superset ).

x = 2 ⇒ ⇒ x 2 = 4 {\displaystyle x=2\Rightarrow x^{2}=4} is true, but x 2 = 4 ⇒ ⇒ x = 2 {\displaystyle x^{2}=4\Rightarrow x=2} is in general false (since x could be −2).

⇔ ↔ ≡ U+21D4 U+2194 U+2261 &#8660; &#8596; &#8801; &hArr; &LeftRightArrow; &equiv; ⇔ ⇔ {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow } \Leftrightarrow ⟺ ⟺ {\displaystyle \iff } \iff ↔ ↔ {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow } \leftrightarrow ≡ ≡ {\displaystyle \equiv } \equiv material biconditional (material equivalence) if and only if, iff, xnor propositional logic , Boolean algebra A ⇔ ⇔ B {\displaystyle A\Leftrightarrow B} is true only if both A and B are false, or both A and B are true. Whether a symbol means a material biconditional or a logical equivalence , depends on the author’s style.

x + 5 = y + 2 ⇔ ⇔ x + 3 = y {\displaystyle x+5=y+2\Leftrightarrow x+3=y} ¬ ~ !

′ U+00AC U+007E U+0021 U+2032 &#172; &#732; &#33; &#8242; &not; &tilde; &excl; &prime; ¬ ¬ {\displaystyle \neg } \lnot or \neg ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } \sim ′ {\displaystyle '} ' negation not propositional logic , Boolean algebra The statement ¬ ¬ A {\displaystyle \lnot A} is true if and only if A is false.

A slash placed through another operator is the same as ¬ ¬ {\displaystyle \neg } placed in front.

The prime symbol is placed after the negated thing, e.g.

p ′ {\displaystyle p'} [ 2 ] ¬ ¬ ( ¬ ¬ A ) ⇔ ⇔ A {\displaystyle \neg (\neg A)\Leftrightarrow A} x ≠ ≠ y ⇔ ⇔ ¬ ¬ ( x = y ) {\displaystyle x\neq y\Leftrightarrow \neg (x=y)} ∧ · & U+2227 U+00B7 U+0026 &#8743; &#183; &#38; &and; &middot; &amp; ∧ ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } \wedge or \land ⋅ ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } \cdot & & {\displaystyle \&} \& [ 3 ] logical conjunction and propositional logic , Boolean algebra The statement A ∧ B is true if A and B are both true; otherwise, it is false.

n < 4  ∧ n >2  ⇔ n = 3 when n is a natural number .

∨ + ∥ U+2228 U+002B U+2225 &#8744; &#43; &#8741; &or; &plus; &parallel; ∨ ∨ {\displaystyle \lor } \lor or \vee ∥ ∥ {\displaystyle \parallel } \parallel logical (inclusive) disjunction or propositional logic , Boolean algebra The statement A ∨ B is true if A or B (or both) are true; if both are false, the statement is false.

n ≥ 4  ∨ n ≤ 2  ⇔ n ≠ 3 when n is a natural number .

⊕ ⊻ ↮ ≢ U+2295 U+22BB U+21AE U+2262 &#8853; &#8891; &#8622; &#8802; &oplus; &veebar; — &nequiv; ⊕ ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus ⊻ ⊻ {\displaystyle \veebar } \veebar ≢ {\displaystyle \not \equiv } \not\equiv exclusive disjunction xor, either ... or ... (but not both) propositional logic , Boolean algebra The statement A ⊕ ⊕ B {\displaystyle A\oplus B} is true when either A or B , but not both, are true. This is equivalent to ¬( A ↔ B ), hence the symbols ↮ ↮ {\displaystyle \nleftrightarrow } and ≢ {\displaystyle \not \equiv } .

¬ ¬ A ⊕ ⊕ A {\displaystyle \lnot A\oplus A} is always true and A ⊕ ⊕ A {\displaystyle A\oplus A} is always false (if vacuous truth is excluded).

⊤ T 1 U+22A4 &#8868; &top; ⊤ ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } \top true (tautology) top, truth, tautology, verum, full clause propositional logic , Boolean algebra , first-order logic ⊤ ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } denotes a proposition that is always true.

The proposition ⊤ ⊤ ∨ ∨ P {\displaystyle \top \lor P} is always true since at least one of the two is unconditionally true.

The symbol ⊥ may also refer to perpendicular lines.

Whether a symbol means a material biconditional or a logical equivalence , depends on the author’s style.

This is a statement in the metalanguage, not the object language. The notation a ≡ ≡ b {\displaystyle a\equiv b} may occasionally be seen in physics, meaning the same as a := b {\displaystyle a:=b} .

cosh ⁡ ⁡ x := e x + e − − x 2 {\displaystyle \cosh x:={\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}}} Advanced or rarely used logical symbols [ edit ] The following symbols are either advanced and context-sensitive or very rarely used: Symbol Unicode value (hexadecimal) HTML value (decimal) HTML entity (named) LaTeX symbol Logic Name Read as Category Explanation ⥽ U+297D \strictif right fish tail Sometimes used for “relation”, also used for denoting various ad hoc relations (for example, for denoting “witnessing” in the context of Rosser's trick ). The fish tail is also used as strict implication by C.I.Lewis p {\displaystyle p} ⥽ q ≡ ≡ ◻ ◻ ( p → → q ) {\displaystyle q\equiv \Box (p\rightarrow q)} .

̅ U+0305 combining overline Used format for denoting Gödel numbers . Using HTML style “4̅” is an abbreviation for the standard numeral “SSSS0”.

It may also denote a negation (used primarily in electronics).

⌜ ⌝ U+231C U+231D \ulcorner \urcorner top left corner top right corner Corner quotes, also called “Quine quotes”; for quasi-quotation, i.e. quoting specific context of unspecified (“variable”) expressions; [ 4 ] also used for denoting Gödel number ; [ 5 ] for example “⌜G⌝” denotes the Gödel number of G. (Typographical note: although the quotes appears as a “pair” in unicode (231C and 231D), they are not symmetrical in some fonts. In some fonts (for example Arial) they are only symmetrical in certain sizes. Alternatively the quotes can be rendered as ⌈ and ⌉ (U+2308 and U+2309) or by using a negation symbol and a reversed negation symbol ⌐ ¬ in superscript mode.) ∄ U+2204 \nexists there does not exist Strike out existential quantifier. “¬∃” is recommended instead.
