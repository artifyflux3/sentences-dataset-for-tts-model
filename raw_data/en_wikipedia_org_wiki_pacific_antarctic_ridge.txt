Features associated with fracture zones (orange) are also shown (lighter orange). Click to expand map to obtain interactive fracture zone details.

[ 3 ] The Louisville Ridge stretches diagonally across this bathymetric map of the southwest Pacific Ocean towards the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge at right bottom The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR, Antarctic Pacific Ridge, South Pacific Rise, South Pacific Ridge) [ 4 ] is a divergent tectonic plate boundary located on the seafloor of the South Pacific Ocean , separating the Pacific plate from the Antarctic plate . It is regarded as the southern section of the East Pacific Rise in some usages, generally south of the Challenger fracture zone which is associated with a triple junction between the Juan Fernández microplate , the Pacific plate and the Antarctic plate. It stretches from there in a general southwesterly direction to the Macquarie Triple Junction south of New Zealand .

[ 5 ] Tectonics [ edit ] The divergence rate between the two plates along the ridge is believed to vary from about 5.4 centimetres per year (2.1 in/year) near 65°S to 7.4 centimetres per year (2.9 in/year) near the Udintsev fracture zone at 55°S.

[ 6 ] : 1281 This area of transition in sea floor spreading rate has been mapped by multiple techniques and occurs near the Heirtzler fracture zone .

[ 1 ] The ridge is related to the Late Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana . To the southeast the historic Bellingshausen plate separated the Pacific and Antarctic plates between about 84 to 61 million years ago.

[ 7 ] : Fig 9.

Until about 33 million years ago, the Proto-Antipodes fracture zone well to the south separated two independent spreading centers, now merged, being the Antarctic–Pacific Ridge and that of the Antarctic–Campbell Plateau.

[ 7 ] : 14 Fracture zones [ edit ] Fracture zones are generally areas of low gravity on the seafloor parallel to a spreading center .

[ 1 ] The named fracture zones going southwest along the rise, include: Challenger fracture zone Menard fracture zone Raitt fracture zone Heezen fracture zone – northern part of Eltanin fault system which appears continuous to the north with the Louisville Ridge Tharp fracture zone – southern part of Eltanin fault system George V fracture zone Udintsev fracture zone Le Géographe fracture zone Astronome fracture zone Antipodes fracture zone Le Petit Prince fracture zone Saint-Exupéry fracture zone Le Renard fracture zone La Rose fracture zone Heirtzler fracture zone Endeavour fracture zone (offset from Heirtzler fracture zone poorly defined more recently than about 43.5 Ma – Chron 20) [ 8 ] [ 2 ] Pahemo fracture zone (not defined more recently than about 43.5 Ma – Chron 20) [ 8 ] [ 2 ] Pitman fracture zone (initiated as an offset of Kohiku and Pahemo fracture zones around 62.5 Ma – Chron 27) [ 8 ] [ 2 ] Kohiku fracture zone (amalgamates with Pitman more recently than 31 Ma – Chron 12) [ 8 ] [ 2 ] Erebus fracture zone Terror fracture zone Emerald fracture zone Hjort fracture zone The Louisville Ridge [ edit ] Main article: Louisville Ridge Stretching for 4,300 km (2,700 mi) north-west from the Eltanin fault system which intersects the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to the Osbourn Seamount at Tonga and Kermadec Junction [ 9 ] is a long line of seamounts called the Louisville Ridge – the longest such chain in  the Pacific [ 10 ] – thought to have formed from the Pacific Plate sliding over a long-lived center of upwelling magma called the Louisville hotspot .
