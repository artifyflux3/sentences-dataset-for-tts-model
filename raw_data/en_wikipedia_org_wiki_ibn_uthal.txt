Ibn Uthal or Ibn Athal ( Arabic : ابن أثال ) was an Arab Christian from Damascus who was the personal physician of the caliph Mu'awiya I and was regarded as the most distinguished of the medical practitioners of the early Umayyad period.

[ 1 ] His medical knowledge can be considered a continuation of the tradition that existed in pre- Islamic Arabia. He was  skilled in toxicology and was reportedly killed in a revenge attack.
