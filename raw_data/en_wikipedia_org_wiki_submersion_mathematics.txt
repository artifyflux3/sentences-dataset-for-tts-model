For "regular point of an algebraic variety", see Singular point of an algebraic variety .

In mathematics , a submersion is a differentiable map between differentiable manifolds whose differential is everywhere surjective . It is a basic concept in differential topology , dual to that of an immersion .

Definition [ edit ] Let M and N be differentiable manifolds , and let f : : M → → N {\displaystyle f\colon M\to N} be a differentiable map between them. The map f is a submersion at a point p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} if its differential D f p : : T p M → → T f ( p ) N {\displaystyle Df_{p}\colon T_{p}M\to T_{f(p)}N} is a surjective linear map .

[ 1 ] In this case, p is called a regular point of the map f ; otherwise, p is a critical point . A point q ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle q\in N} is a regular value of f if all points p in the preimage f − − 1 ( q ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(q)} are regular points. A differentiable map f that is a submersion at each point p ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle p\in M} is called a submersion . Equivalently, f is a submersion if its differential D f p {\displaystyle Df_{p}} has constant rank equal to the dimension of N .

Some authors use the term critical point to describe a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix of f at p is not maximal.: [ 2 ] Indeed, this is the more useful notion in singularity theory . If the dimension of M is greater than or equal to the dimension of N , then these two notions of critical point coincide. However, if the dimension of M is less than the dimension of N , all points are critical according to the definition above (the differential cannot be surjective), but the rank of the Jacobian may still be maximal (if it is equal to dim M ). The definition given above is the more commonly used one, e.g., in the formulation of Sard's theorem .

Submersion theorem [ edit ] Given a submersion f : : M → → N {\displaystyle f\colon M\to N} between smooth manifolds of dimensions m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} , for each x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} there exist surjective charts ϕ ϕ : U → → R m {\displaystyle \phi :U\to \mathbb {R} ^{m}} of M {\displaystyle M} around x {\displaystyle x} , and ψ ψ : V → → R n {\displaystyle \psi :V\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} of N {\displaystyle N} around f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} , such that f {\displaystyle f} restricts to a submersion f : : U → → V {\displaystyle f\colon U\to V} which, when expressed in coordinates as ψ ψ ∘ ∘ f ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ − − 1 : R m → → R n {\displaystyle \psi \circ f\circ \phi ^{-1}:\mathbb {R} ^{m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , becomes an ordinary orthogonal projection . As an application, for each p ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle p\in N} the corresponding fiber of f {\displaystyle f} , denoted M p = f − − 1 ( p ) {\displaystyle M_{p}=f^{-1}({p})} can be equipped with the structure of a smooth submanifold of M {\displaystyle M} whose dimension equals the difference of the dimensions of N {\displaystyle N} and M {\displaystyle M} .

This theorem is a consequence of the inverse function theorem (see Inverse function theorem#Giving a manifold structure ).

For example, consider f : : R 3 → → R {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} } given by f ( x , y , z ) = x 4 + y 4 + z 4 .

{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}.} . The Jacobian matrix is [ ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ x ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ y ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ z ] = [ 4 x 3 4 y 3 4 z 3 ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}&{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}&{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}4x^{3}&4y^{3}&4z^{3}\end{bmatrix}}.} This has maximal rank at every point except for ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0,0)} . Also, the fibers f − − 1 ( { t } ) = { ( a , b , c ) ∈ ∈ R 3 : a 4 + b 4 + c 4 = t } {\displaystyle f^{-1}(\{t\})=\left\{(a,b,c)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}:a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}=t\right\}} are empty for t < 0 {\displaystyle t<0} , and equal to a point when t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} . Hence, we only have a smooth submersion f : : R 3 ∖ ∖ ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) → → R > 0 , {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{3}\setminus {(0,0,0)}\to \mathbb {R} _{>0},} and the subsets M t = { ( a , b , c ) ∈ ∈ R 3 : a 4 + b 4 + c 4 = t } {\displaystyle M_{t}=\left\{(a,b,c)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}:a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}=t\right\}} are two-dimensional smooth manifolds for t > 0 {\displaystyle t>0} .

Examples [ edit ] Any projection π π : : R m + n → → R n ⊂ ⊂ R m + n {\displaystyle \pi \colon \mathbb {R} ^{m+n}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{n}\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m+n}} Local diffeomorphisms Riemannian submersions The projection in a smooth vector bundle or a more general smooth fibration . The surjectivity of the differential is a necessary condition for the existence of a local trivialization .

Maps between spheres [ edit ] A large class of examples of submersions are submersions between spheres of higher dimension, such as f : S n + k → → S k {\displaystyle f:S^{n+k}\to S^{k}} whose fibers have dimension n {\displaystyle n} . This is because the fibers (inverse images of elements p ∈ ∈ S k {\displaystyle p\in S^{k}} ) are smooth manifolds of dimension n {\displaystyle n} . Then, if we take a path γ γ : I → → S k {\displaystyle \gamma :I\to S^{k}} and take the pullback M I → → S n + k ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ f I x → → γ γ S k {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}M_{I}&\to &S^{n+k}\\\downarrow &&\downarrow f\\I&x\rightarrow {\gamma }&S^{k}\end{matrix}}} we get an example of a special kind of bordism , called a framed bordism . In fact, the framed cobordism groups Ω Ω n f r {\displaystyle \Omega _{n}^{fr}} are intimately related to the stable homotopy groups .

Families of algebraic varieties [ edit ] Another large class of submersions is given by families of algebraic varieties π π : X → → S {\displaystyle \pi :{\mathfrak {X}}\to S} whose fibers are smooth algebraic varieties. If we consider the underlying manifolds of these varieties, we get smooth manifolds. For example, the Weierstrass family π π : W t o A 1 {\displaystyle \pi :{\mathcal {W}}to\mathbb {A} ^{1}} of elliptic curves is a widely studied submersion because it includes many technical complexities used to demonstrate more complex theory, such as intersection homology and perverse sheaves . This family is given by W = { ( t , x , y ) ∈ ∈ A 1 × × A 2 : y 2 = x ( x − − 1 ) ( x − − t ) } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}=\left\{(t,x,y)\in \mathbb {A} ^{1}\times \mathbb {A} ^{2}:y^{2}=x(x-1)(x-t)\right\}} where A 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} ^{1}} is the affine line and A 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {A} ^{2}} is the affine plane. Since we are considering complex varieties, these are equivalently the spaces C , C 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,\mathbb {C} ^{2}} of the complex line and the complex plane. Note that we should actually remove the points t = 0 , 1 {\displaystyle t=0,1} because there are singularities (since there is a double root).

Local normal form [ edit ] If f : M → N is a submersion at p and f ( p ) = q ∈ N , then there exists an open neighborhood U of p in M , an open neighborhood V of q in N , and local coordinates ( x 1 , …, x m ) at p and ( x 1 , …, x n ) at q such that f ( U ) = V , and the map f in these local coordinates is the standard projection f ( x 1 , … … , x n , x n + 1 , … … , x m ) = ( x 1 , … … , x n ) .

{\displaystyle f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n},x_{n+1},\ldots ,x_{m})=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}).} It follows that the full preimage f −1 ( q ) in M of a regular value q in N under a differentiable map f : M → N is either empty or a differentiable manifold of dimension dim M − dim N , possibly disconnected . This is the content of the regular value theorem (also known as the submersion theorem ). In particular, the conclusion holds for all q in N if the map f is a submersion.

Topological manifold submersions [ edit ] Submersions are also well-defined for general topological manifolds .

[ 3 ] A topological manifold submersion is a continuous surjection f : M → N such that for all p in M , for some continuous charts ψ at p and φ at f(p) , the map ψ −1 ∘ f ∘ φ is equal to the projection map from R m to R n , where m = dim( M ) ≥ n = dim( N ) .
