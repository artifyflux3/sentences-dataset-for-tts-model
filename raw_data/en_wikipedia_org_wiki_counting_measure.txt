[ 1 ] The counting measure can be defined on any measurable space (that is, any set X {\displaystyle X} along with a sigma-algebra)  but is mostly used on countable sets.

[ 1 ] In formal notation, we can turn any set X {\displaystyle X} into a measurable space by taking the power set of X {\displaystyle X} as the sigma-algebra Σ Σ ; {\displaystyle \Sigma ;} that is, all subsets of X {\displaystyle X} are measurable sets.  
Then the counting measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on this measurable space ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is the positive measure Σ Σ → → [ 0 , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \Sigma \to [0,+\infty ]} defined by μ μ ( A ) = { | A | if A is finite + ∞ ∞ if A is infinite {\displaystyle \mu (A)={\begin{cases}\vert A\vert &{\text{if }}A{\text{ is finite}}\\+\infty &{\text{if }}A{\text{ is infinite}}\end{cases}}} for all A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ , {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma ,} where | A | {\displaystyle \vert A\vert } denotes the cardinality of the set A .

{\displaystyle A.} [ 2 ] The counting measure on ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is σ-finite if and only if the space X {\displaystyle X} is countable .

[ 3 ] Integration on the set of natural numbers with counting measure [ edit ] Take the measure space ( N , 2 N , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ,2^{\mathbb {N} },\mu )} , where 2 N {\displaystyle 2^{\mathbb {N} }} is the set of all subsets of the naturals and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } the counting measure. Take any measurable f : N → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {N} \to [0,\infty ]} . As it is defined on N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , f {\displaystyle f} can be represented pointwise as f ( x ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ f ( n ) 1 { n } ( x ) = lim M → → ∞ ∞ ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) 1 { n } ( x ) ⏟ ⏟ ϕ ϕ M ( x ) = lim M → → ∞ ∞ ϕ ϕ M ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }f(n)1_{\{n\}}(x)=\lim _{M\to \infty }\underbrace {\ \sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)1_{\{n\}}(x)\ } _{\phi _{M}(x)}=\lim _{M\to \infty }\phi _{M}(x)} Each ϕ ϕ M {\displaystyle \phi _{M}} is measurable. Moreover ϕ ϕ M + 1 ( x ) = ϕ ϕ M ( x ) + f ( M + 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ 1 { M + 1 } ( x ) ≥ ≥ ϕ ϕ M ( x ) {\displaystyle \phi _{M+1}(x)=\phi _{M}(x)+f(M+1)\cdot 1_{\{M+1\}}(x)\geq \phi _{M}(x)} . Still further, as each ϕ ϕ M {\displaystyle \phi _{M}} is a simple function ∫ ∫ N ϕ ϕ M d μ μ = ∫ ∫ N ( ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) 1 { n } ( x ) ) d μ μ = ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) μ μ ( { n } ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) ⋅ ⋅ 1 = ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) {\displaystyle \int _{\mathbb {N} }\phi _{M}d\mu =\int _{\mathbb {N} }\left(\sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)1_{\{n\}}(x)\right)d\mu =\sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)\mu (\{n\})=\sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)\cdot 1=\sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)} Hence by the monotone convergence theorem ∫ ∫ N f d μ μ = lim M → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ N ϕ ϕ M d μ μ = lim M → → ∞ ∞ ∑ ∑ n = 1 M f ( n ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ f ( n ) {\displaystyle \int _{\mathbb {N} }fd\mu =\lim _{M\to \infty }\int _{\mathbb {N} }\phi _{M}d\mu =\lim _{M\to \infty }\sum _{n=1}^{M}f(n)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }f(n)} Discussion [ edit ] The counting measure is a special case of a more general construction.  With the notation as above, any function f : X → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle f:X\to [0,\infty )} defines a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} via μ μ ( A ) := ∑ ∑ a ∈ ∈ A f ( a ) for all A ⊆ ⊆ X , {\displaystyle \mu (A):=\sum _{a\in A}f(a)\quad {\text{ for all }}A\subseteq X,} where the possibly uncountable sum of real numbers is defined to be the supremum of the sums over all finite subsets, that is, ∑ ∑ y ∈ ∈ Y ⊆ ⊆ R y := sup F ⊆ ⊆ Y , | F | < ∞ ∞ { ∑ ∑ y ∈ ∈ F y } .

{\displaystyle \sum _{y\,\in \,Y\!\ \subseteq \,\mathbb {R} }y\ :=\ \sup _{F\subseteq Y,\,|F|<\infty }\left\{\sum _{y\in F}y\right\}.} Taking f ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=1} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} gives the counting measure.
