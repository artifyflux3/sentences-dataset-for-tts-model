Cultural areas of Mesoamerica

**Mesoamerica** is a [historical region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_region "Historical region") and [cultural area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_area "Cultural area") that begins in the southern part of North America and extends to the Pacific coast of Central America, thus comprising the lands of central and southern [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), all of [Belize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize "Belize"), [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador"), western [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), and the [Gran Nicoya](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Nicoya "es:Gran Nicoya") region of [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua") and [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-:0-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-The_Archaeology_of_Mesoamerica-4) As a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") cultures.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-5)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-:0-2)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-The_Archaeology_of_Mesoamerica-4)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-6)

In the [pre-Columbian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era "Pre-Columbian era"), many [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas") societies flourished in Mesoamerica for more than 3,000 years before the [Spanish colonization of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas "Spanish colonization of the Americas") began on [Hispaniola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola "Hispaniola") in 1493. In world history, Mesoamerica was the site of two historical transformations: (i) primary urban generation, and (ii) the formation of New World cultures from the mixtures of the indigenous Mesoamerican peoples with the European, African, and Asian peoples who were introduced by the Spanish colonization of the Americas.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarrasco2001-7) Mesoamerica is one of the six areas in the world where ancient [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") arose independently (see [cradle of civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization "Cradle of civilization")), and the second in the Americas, alongside the [Caral–Supe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral%E2%80%93Supe_civilization "Caral–Supe civilization") in present-day [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"). Mesoamerica is also one of only five regions of the world where writing is known to have independently developed (the others being ancient [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization "Indus Valley Civilization"), [Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer"), and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China "History of China")).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFagan1996762-8)

Beginning as early as 7000 BCE, the domestication of [cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate "Chocolate"), [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), [beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus "Phaseolus"), [tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"), [avocado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado "Avocado"), [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla "Vanilla"), [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(plant) "Squash (plant)") and [chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper "Chili pepper"), as well as the [turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meleagris_gallopavo "Meleagris gallopavo") and [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xoloitzcuintle "Xoloitzcuintle"), resulted in a transition from [paleo-Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians") hunter-gatherer tribal groupings to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex [mythological and religious tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_religion "Mesoamerican religion"), a [vigesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigesimal "Vigesimal") numeric system, a [complex calendric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_calendars "Mesoamerican calendars"), a [tradition of ball playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame "Mesoamerican ballgame"), and a distinct [architectural style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_architecture "Mesoamerican architecture"), were diffused through the area. Villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [chiefdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiefdom "Chiefdom"), and large ceremonial centers were built, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as [obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica"), [jade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade "Jade"), [cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean "Cocoa bean"), [cinnabar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnabar "Cinnabar"), _[Spondylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylus "Spondylus")_ shells, [hematite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite "Hematite"), and [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramics "Ceramics"). While Mesoamerican civilization knew of the [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel") and basic [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), neither of these became technologically relevant.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmackGascoGossen199655-9)

Among the earliest complex civilizations was the [Olmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec") culture, which inhabited the [Gulf Coast of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_Mexico "Gulf Coast of Mexico") and extended inland and southwards across the [Isthmus of Tehuantepec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec "Isthmus of Tehuantepec"). Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in [Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas "Chiapas"), [Oaxaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca"), and Guatemala laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. All this was facilitated by considerable [regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_communications_in_ancient_Mesoamerica "Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica"), especially along the Pacific coast.

In the subsequent [Preclassic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology "Mesoamerican chronology"), complex urban polities began to develop among the [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-11) with the rise of centers such as [Aguada Fénix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguada_F%C3%A9nix "Aguada Fénix") and [Calakmul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calakmul "Calakmul") in Mexico; [El Mirador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mirador "El Mirador"), and [Tikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal "Tikal") in Guatemala, and the [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization "Zapotec civilization") at [Monte Albán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alb%C3%A1n "Monte Albán"). During this period, the first true [Mesoamerican writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_writing_systems "Mesoamerican writing systems") were developed in the [Epi-Olmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epi-Olmec_culture "Epi-Olmec culture") and the Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [Maya logosyllabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script").

In Central Mexico, the city of [Teotihuacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan "Teotihuacan") ascended at the height of the Classic period; it formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and northward. Upon the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 CE, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico, such as [Xochicalco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochicalco "Xochicalco") and [Cholula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholula_(Mesoamerican_site) "Cholula (Mesoamerican site)"), ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period, the [Nahua peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahua_people "Nahua people") began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [Oto-Manguean languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oto-Manguean_languages "Oto-Manguean languages").

During the early post-Classic period, Central Mexico was dominated by the [Toltec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec "Toltec") culture, and Oaxaca by the [Mixtec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec"). The lowland Maya area had important centers at [Chichén Itzá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chich%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1 "Chichén Itzá") and [Mayapán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayap%C3%A1n "Mayapán"). Towards the end of the post-Classic period, the [Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs "Aztecs") of Central Mexico built a [tributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributary_state "Tributary state") empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmackGascoGossen199640%E2%80%9380-12)

The distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the [Spanish conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire "Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire") in the 16th century. Eurasian diseases such as [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") and [measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles"), which were endemic among the colonists but new to North America, caused the deaths of upwards of 90% of the indigenous people, resulting in great losses to their societies and cultures.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-14) Over the next centuries, Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica. Many continue to speak their ancestral languages and maintain many practices hearkening back to their Mesoamerican roots.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmackGascoGossen1996[[Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_page_number_citations_from_August_2023]]%3Csup_class=%22noprint_Inline-Template_%22_style=%22white-space:nowrap;%22%3E&#91;%3Ci%3E[[Wikipedia:Citing_sources|%3Cspan_title=%22This_citation_requires_a_reference_to_the_specific_page_or_range_of_pages_in_which_the_material_appears.&#32;(August_2023)%22%3Epage&nbsp;needed%3C/span%3E]]%3C/i%3E&#93;%3C/sup%3E-15)

The term _Mesoamerica_ literally means "middle America" in Greek. [Middle America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_America_(Americas) "Middle America (Americas)") often refers to a larger area in the Americas, but it has also previously been used more narrowly to refer to Mesoamerica. An example is the title of the 16 volumes of _The Handbook of Middle American Indians_. "Mesoamerica" is broadly defined as the area that is home to the Mesoamerican civilization, which comprises a group of peoples with close cultural and historical ties. The exact geographic extent of Mesoamerica has varied through time, as the civilization extended North and South from its heartland in southern Mexico.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Proto_Lencan_Statue.jpg/250px-Proto_Lencan_Statue.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Proto_Lencan_Statue.jpg)

Anthropomorphic figure from the Proto-[Lencan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenca "Lenca") culture found at [Los Naranjos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Naranjos,_Honduras "Los Naranjos, Honduras"), Honduras. An example of Mesomerican art during the preclassic Period.

The term was first used by the German [ethnologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnology "Ethnology")[Paul Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kirchhoff "Paul Kirchhoff"), who noted that similarities existed among the various [pre-Columbian cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era "Pre-Columbian era") within the region that included southern Mexico, [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), [Belize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize "Belize"), [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador"), western [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), and the Pacific lowlands of [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua") and northwestern [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica"). In the tradition of [cultural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-historical_archaeology "Culture-historical archaeology"), the prevalent [archaeological theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_theory "Archaeological theory") of the early to middle 20th century, Kirchhoff defined this zone as a cultural area based on a suite of interrelated cultural similarities brought about by millennia of inter- and intra-regional interaction (i.e., [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-cultural_diffusion "Trans-cultural diffusion")).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKirchhoff1943-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmackGascoGossen19965%E2%80%938-17) Mesoamerica is recognized as a near-prototypical cultural area. This term is now fully integrated into the standard terminology of precolumbian [anthropological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology "Cultural anthropology") studies. Conversely, the sister terms [Aridoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aridoamerica "Aridoamerica") and [Oasisamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasisamerica "Oasisamerica"), which refer to northern Mexico and the western United States, respectively, have not entered into widespread usage.

Some of the significant cultural traits defining the Mesoamerican cultural tradition are:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-18)

Landscape of the Mesoamerican highlands

Located on the [Middle American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_America_(Americas) "Middle America (Americas)")[isthmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus "Isthmus") joining North and South America between _ca._ 10° and 22° northern [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"), Mesoamerica possesses a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts. These different [niches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche") are classified into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level") and 1000 meters) and the _altiplanos_, or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoe1994-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarmackGascoGossen19969%E2%80%9311-21) In the low-lying regions, [sub-tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_climate "Subtropical climate") and [tropical climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") are most common, as is true for most of the coastline along the Pacific and [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") and the [Caribbean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea "Caribbean Sea"). The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold [mountainous climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_climate "Mountain climate"); the dominant climate is [temperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperateness "Temperateness") with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry [Oaxaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca") and north [Yucatán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n "Yucatán") to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.

Several distinct sub-regions within Mesoamerica are defined by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, can be divided into two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), southern [Campeche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeche "Campeche") and [Quintana Roo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintana_Roo "Quintana Roo") in Mexico, and [Belize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize "Belize"). The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the [Yucatán Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula "Yucatán Peninsula"). Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, [Oaxaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca"), the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras")).

There is extensive topographic variation in Mesoamerica, ranging from the high peaks circumscribing the [Valley of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Mexico "Valley of Mexico") and within the central [Sierra Madre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_de_Chiapas "Sierra Madre de Chiapas") mountains to the low flatlands of the northern Yucatán Peninsula. The tallest mountain in Mesoamerica is [Pico de Orizaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_de_Orizaba "Pico de Orizaba"), a [dormant volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormant_volcano "Dormant volcano") located on the border of [Puebla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla "Puebla") and [Veracruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz "Veracruz"). Its peak elevation is 5,636 m (18,490 ft).

The Sierra Madre mountains, which consist of several smaller ranges, run from northern Mesoamerica south through [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica"). The chain is historically [volcanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano"). In central and southern Mexico, a portion of the Sierra Madre chain is known as the [Eje Volcánico Transversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eje_Volc%C3%A1nico_Transversal "Eje Volcánico Transversal"), or the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. There are 83 inactive and active volcanoes within the Sierra Madre range, including 11 in Mexico, 37 in Guatemala, 23 in El Salvador, 25 in Nicaragua, and 3 in northwestern Costa Rica. According to the Michigan Technological University,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-22) 16 of these are still active. The tallest active volcano is [Popocatépetl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocat%C3%A9petl "Popocatépetl") at 5,452 m (17,887 ft). This volcano, which retains its [Nahuatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl "Nahuatl") name, is located 70 km (43 mi) southeast of Mexico City. Other volcanoes of note include Tacana on the Mexico–Guatemala border, [Tajumulco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_Tajumulco "Volcán Tajumulco") and [Santamaría](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santamar%C3%ADa_(volcano) "Santamaría (volcano)") in Guatemala, [Izalco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izalco_(volcano) "Izalco (volcano)") in El Salvador, [Arenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arenal_Volcano "Arenal Volcano") in Costa Rica, [Cerro Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Negro "Cerro Negro"), along with [Concepción](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepci%C3%B3n_(volcano) "Concepción (volcano)") and [Maderas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maderas "Maderas") on [Ometepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ometepe "Ometepe"), which is an island formed by both volcanoes rising out of [Lake Cocibolca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cocibolca "Lake Cocibolca") in Nicaragua.

One important topographic feature is the [Isthmus of Tehuantepec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec "Isthmus of Tehuantepec"), a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the [Sierra Madre del Sur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_del_Sur "Sierra Madre del Sur") to the north and the [Sierra Madre de Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_de_Chiapas "Sierra Madre de Chiapas") to the south. At its highest point, the [Isthmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus "Isthmus") is 224 m (735 ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") and the Pacific Ocean in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200 km (120 mi). The northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered in dense jungle—but the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.

Outside of the northern Maya lowlands, [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River "River") are common throughout Mesoamerica. Some of the more important ones served as loci of human occupation in the area. The longest river in Mesoamerica is the [Usumacinta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usumacinta "Usumacinta"), which forms in Guatemala at the convergence of the [Salinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinas_River_(Guatemala) "Salinas River (Guatemala)") or [Chixoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chixoy_River "Chixoy River") and La [Pasión River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasi%C3%B3n_River "Pasión River") and runs north for 970 km (600 mi)—480 km (300 mi) of which are navigable—eventually draining into the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico"). Other rivers of note include the [Río Grande de Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Grande_de_Santiago "Río Grande de Santiago"), the [Grijalva River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grijalva_River "Grijalva River"), the [Motagua River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motagua_River "Motagua River"), the [Ulúa River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ul%C3%BAa_River "Ulúa River"), and the [Hondo River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hondo_River_(Belize) "Hondo River (Belize)"). The northern Maya lowlands, especially the northern portion of the Yucatán peninsula, are notable for their nearly complete lack of rivers (largely due to the absolute lack of topographic variation). Additionally, no lakes exist in the northern peninsula. The main source of water in this area is [aquifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer "Aquifer") that are accessed through natural surface openings called [cenotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote "Cenote").

With an area of 8,264 km 2 (3,191 sq mi), [Lake Cocibolca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cocibolca "Lake Cocibolca") in Nicaragua is the largest lake in Mesoamerica, and second largest in all Latin America. [Lake Chapala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chapala "Lake Chapala") is Mexico's largest freshwater lake, but [Lake Texcoco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Texcoco "Lake Texcoco") is perhaps most well known as the location upon which [Tenochtitlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenochtitlan "Tenochtitlan"), capital of the [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec") Empire, was founded. [Lake Petén Itzá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pet%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1 "Lake Petén Itzá"), in northern Guatemala, is notable as where the last independent Maya city, [Tayasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayasal "Tayasal") (or Noh Petén), held out against the Spanish until 1697. Other large lakes include [Lake Atitlán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Atitl%C3%A1n "Lake Atitlán"), [Lake Izabal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Izabal "Lake Izabal"), [Lake Güija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_El_Salvador "Geography of El Salvador"), [Lemoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemoa "Lemoa") and [Lake Xolotlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Xolotlan "Lake Xolotlan").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-23)

Almost all [ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem") are present in Mesoamerica; the more well known are the [Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Barrier_Reef_System "Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System"), the second largest in the world, and [La Mosquitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Coast "Mosquito Coast") (consisting of the [Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Pl%C3%A1tano_Biosphere_Reserve "Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve"), Tawahka Asangni, [Patuca National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patuca_National_Park "Patuca National Park"), and [Bosawás Biosphere Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosaw%C3%A1s_Biosphere_Reserve "Bosawás Biosphere Reserve")) a [rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest "Rainforest") second in size in the Americas only to the [Amazonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest "Amazon rainforest").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-24) The highlands present [mixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests "Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests") and [coniferous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinophyta "Pinophyta") forest. The biodiversity is among the richest in the world, though the number of species in the red list of the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN "IUCN") grows every year.

[Tikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal "Tikal") is one of the largest archaeological sites, urban centers, and tourist attractions of the [pre-Columbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era "Pre-Columbian era")[Maya civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization"). It is located in the archaeological region of the [Petén Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C3%A9n_Basin "Petén Basin") in what is now northern [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala").

The history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided into stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the [Paleo-Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indian "Paleo-Indian"), the [Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology#Archaic_Era "Mesoamerican chronology"), the [Preclassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology#Preclassic_Era "Mesoamerican chronology") (or Formative), the [Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Period "Classic Period"), and the [Postclassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postclassic_period "Postclassic period"). The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is classified as the Colonial period.

The differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the [Late Preclassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology#Preclassic_Era "Mesoamerican chronology")) generally reflects [different configurations of socio-cultural organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution "Sociocultural evolution") that are characterized by [increasing socio-political complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgesellschaft "Urgesellschaft"), the adoption of new and different [subsistence strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_subsistence_techniques "List of subsistence techniques"), and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The [Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Period "Classic Period") period through the [Postclassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postclassic_period "Postclassic period") are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.

The Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic [hunting and gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous North America, was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian. These sites had [obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") blades and [Clovis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_point "Clovis point")-style fluted [projectile points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_point "Projectile point").

The Archaic period (8000–2000 BCE) is characterized by the rise of [incipient agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesoamerica "Agriculture in Mesoamerica") in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with [sedentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentism "Sedentism") and agricultural production by the close of the period. Transformations of natural environments have been a common feature at least since the mid Holocene.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-franco-25) Archaic sites include _[Sipacate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipacate "Sipacate")_ in [Escuintla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuintla "Escuintla"), Guatemala, where maize [pollen samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen_analysis "Pollen analysis") date to c. 3500 BCE.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-roush-26)

[Olmec Colossal Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec_colossal_heads "Olmec colossal heads") No. 3 1200–900 BCE

The first complex civilization to develop in Mesoamerica was that of the [Olmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec"), who inhabited the Gulf Coast region of [Veracruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz "Veracruz") throughout the Preclassic period. The main sites of the Olmec include [San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Lorenzo_Tenochtitl%C3%A1n "San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán"), [La Venta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Venta "La Venta"), and [Tres Zapotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tres_Zapotes "Tres Zapotes"). Specific dates vary, but these sites were occupied from roughly 1200 to 400 BCE. Remains of other early cultures interacting with the Olmec have been found at [Takalik Abaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takalik_Abaj "Takalik Abaj"), [Izapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa "Izapa"), and [Teopantecuanitlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teopantecuanitlan "Teopantecuanitlan"), and as far south as in [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDiehl2004248-27) Research in the Pacific Lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala suggest that [Izapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa "Izapa") and the [Monte Alto Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alto_culture "Monte Alto culture") may have preceded the Olmec. [Radiocarbon samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating "Radiocarbon dating") associated with various sculptures found at the Late Preclassic site of [Izapa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa "Izapa") suggest a date of between 1800 and 1500 BCE.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-28)

During the Middle and Late Preclassic period, the [Maya civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization") developed in the southern Maya highlands and lowlands, and at a few sites in the northern Maya lowlands. The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BCE, and include [Nakbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakbe "Nakbe"), [El Mirador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mirador "El Mirador"), and [Cerros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerros "Cerros"). Middle to Late [Preclassic Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preclassic_Maya "Preclassic Maya") sites include [Kaminaljuyú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaminaljuy%C3%BA "Kaminaljuyú"), [Cival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cival "Cival"), [Edzná](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzn%C3%A1 "Edzná"), [Cobá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob%C3%A1 "Cobá"), [Lamanai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanai "Lamanai"), [Komchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komchen "Komchen"), [Dzibilchaltun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzibilchaltun "Dzibilchaltun"), and [San Bartolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bartolo_(Maya_site) "San Bartolo (Maya site)"), among others.

The Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as [Tlapacoya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlapacoya_(Mesoamerican_site) "Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)"), [Tlatilco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlatilco "Tlatilco"), and [Cuicuilco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuicuilco "Cuicuilco"). These sites were eventually superseded by [Teotihuacán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuac%C3%A1n "Teotihuacán"), an important Classic-era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica. The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to the later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly 50 CE.

In the [Valley of Oaxaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Oaxaca "Valley of Oaxaca"), [San José Mogote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Mogote "San José Mogote") represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive [palisades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade "Palisade"), ceremonial structures, the use of [adobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe "Adobe"), and [hieroglyphic writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_writing "Zapotec writing"). Also of importance, the site was one of the first to demonstrate [inherited status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascribed_status "Ascribed status"), signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San José Mogote was eventually overtaken by [Monte Albán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alb%C3%A1n "Monte Albán"), the subsequent capital of the [Zapotec empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization "Zapotec civilization"), during the Late Preclassic.

The Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of [Nayarit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayarit "Nayarit"), [Jalisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco "Jalisco"), [Colima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colima "Colima"), and [Michoacán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n "Michoacán") also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood. This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the "[shaft tomb tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Mexico_shaft_tomb_tradition "Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition")".

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Piramide_de_la_Luna_072006.jpg/250px-Piramide_de_la_Luna_072006.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Piramide_de_la_Luna_072006.jpg)

[Pyramid of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_the_Moon "Pyramid of the Moon") viewed from atop of the [Pyramid of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_the_Sun "Pyramid of the Sun").

The Classic period is marked by the rise and dominance of several polities. The traditional distinction between the Early and Late Classic is marked by their changing fortune and their ability to maintain regional primacy. Of paramount importance are Teotihuacán in central Mexico and [Tikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal "Tikal") in Guatemala; the Early Classic's temporal limits generally correlate to the main periods of these sites. Monte Albán in Oaxaca is another Classic-period polity that expanded and flourished during this period, but the Zapotec capital exerted less interregional influence than the other two sites.

During the Early Classic, Teotihuacan participated in and perhaps dominated a far-reaching macro-regional interaction network. Architectural and artifact styles (talud-tablero, tripod slab-footed ceramic vessels) epitomized at Teotihuacan were mimicked and adopted at many distant settlements. [Pachuca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica#Sources "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica") obsidian, whose trade and distribution is argued to have been economically controlled by Teotihuacan, is found throughout Mesoamerica.

Tikal came to dominate much of the southern Maya lowlands politically, economically, and militarily during the Early Classic. An exchange network centered at Tikal distributed a variety of goods and commodities throughout southeast Mesoamerica, such as obsidian imported from central Mexico (e.g., Pachuca) and highland Guatemala (e.g., [El Chayal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica#Sources "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica"), which was predominantly used by the Maya during the Early Classic), and [jade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_use_in_Mesoamerica "Jade use in Mesoamerica") from the [Motagua valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motagua_River "Motagua River") in Guatemala. Tikal was often in conflict with other polities in the [Petén Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C3%A9n_Basin "Petén Basin"), as well as with others outside of it, including [Uaxactun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uaxactun "Uaxactun"), [Caracol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracol "Caracol"), [Dos Pilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dos_Pilas "Dos Pilas"), [Naranjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naranjo "Naranjo"), and [Calakmul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calakmul "Calakmul"). Towards the end of the Early Classic, this conflict lead to Tikal's military defeat at the hands of Caracol in 562, and a period commonly known as the [Tikal Hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal#Tikal_hiatus "Tikal").

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Xochicalco_Serpiente_Emplumada_GR.jpg/250px-Xochicalco_Serpiente_Emplumada_GR.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xochicalco_Serpiente_Emplumada_GR.jpg)

[Xochicalco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochicalco "Xochicalco"), Temple of the Feathered Serpent, 650–900 CE

The Late Classic period (beginning c. 600 CE until 909 CE) is characterized as a period of interregional competition and factionalization among the numerous regional polities in the Maya area. This largely resulted from the decrease in Tikal's socio-political and economic power at the beginning of the period. It was therefore during this time that other sites rose to regional prominence and were able to exert greater interregional influence, including Caracol, [Copán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop%C3%A1n "Copán"), [Palenque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palenque "Palenque"), and Calakmul (which was allied with Caracol and may have assisted in the defeat of Tikal), and [Dos Pilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dos_Pilas "Dos Pilas")[Aguateca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguateca "Aguateca") and [Cancuén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancu%C3%A9n "Cancuén") in the [Petexbatún](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petexbat%C3%BAn "Petexbatún") region of Guatemala. Around 710, Tikal arose again and started to build strong alliances and defeat its worst enemies. In the Maya area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called "[Maya collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_collapse "Maya collapse")", a transitional period coupling the general depopulation of the southern lowlands and development and florescence of centers in the northern lowlands.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/0077_Uxmal.JPG/250px-0077_Uxmal.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:0077_Uxmal.JPG)

Detail of the Nunnery Quadrangle at [Uxmal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uxmal "Uxmal"), 10th century

Generally applied to the Maya area, the Terminal Classic roughly spans the time between c. 800/850 and c. 1000 CE. Overall, it generally correlates with the rise to prominence of [Puuc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puuc "Puuc") settlements in the northern [Maya lowlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Lowlands "Maya Lowlands"), so named after the hills where they are mainly found. Puuc settlements are specifically associated with a unique architectural style (the "Puuc architectural style") that represents a technological departure from previous construction techniques. Major Puuc sites include [Uxmal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uxmal "Uxmal"), [Sayil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayil "Sayil"), [Labna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labna "Labna"), [Kabah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabah_(Maya_site) "Kabah (Maya site)"), and [Oxkintok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxkintok "Oxkintok"). While generally concentrated within the area in and around the [Puuc hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puuc_hills "Puuc hills"), the style has been documented as far away as at [Chichen Itza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza "Chichen Itza") to the east and [Edzna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzna "Edzna") to the south.

Chichén Itzá was originally thought to have been a Postclassic site in the northern Maya lowlands. Research over the past few decades has established that it was first settled during the Early/Late Classic transition but rose to prominence during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. During its apogee, this widely known site economically and politically dominated the northern lowlands. Its participation in the circum-peninsular exchange route, possible through its port site of [Isla Cerritos](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isla_Cerritos&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isla Cerritos (page does not exist)"), allowed Chichén Itzá to remain highly connected to areas such as central Mexico and Central America. The apparent "Mexicanization" of architecture at Chichén Itzá led past researchers to believe that Chichén Itzá existed under the control of a Toltec empire. Chronological data refutes this early interpretation, and it is now known that Chichén Itzá predated the Toltec; Mexican architectural styles are now used as an indicator of strong economic and ideological ties between the two regions.

The Postclassic (beginning 900–1000 CE, depending on area) is, like the Late Classic, characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities. The main Maya centers were located in the northern lowlands. Following Chichén Itzá, whose political structure collapsed during the Early Postclassic, [Mayapán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayap%C3%A1n "Mayapán") rose to prominence during the Middle Postclassic and dominated the north for c. 200 years. After Mayapán's fragmentation, the political structure in the northern lowlands revolved around large towns or city-states, such as [Oxkutzcab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxkutzcab "Oxkutzcab") and [Ti’ho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%27ho "Ti'ho") ([Mérida, Yucatán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Yucat%C3%A1n "Mérida, Yucatán")), that competed with one another.

In central Mexico, the early portion of the Postclassic correlates with the rise of the [Toltec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec "Toltec") and an empire based at their capital, [Tula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tula,_Hidalgo "Tula, Hidalgo") (also known as [Tollan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollan "Tollan")). [Cholula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholula_(Mesoamerican_site) "Cholula (Mesoamerican site)"), initially an important Early Classic center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, maintained its political structure (it did not collapse) and continued to function as a regionally important center during the Postclassic. The latter portion of the Postclassic is generally associated with the rise of the [Mexica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexica "Mexica") and the [Aztec Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire "Aztec Empire"). One of the more commonly known cultural groups in Mesoamerica, the Aztec politically dominated nearly all of central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, Mexico's southern Pacific Coast (Chiapas and into Guatemala), Oaxaca, and [Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero "Guerrero").

The [Tarascans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarascan_state "Tarascan state") (also known as the [Purépecha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha "Purépecha")) were located in [Michoacán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac%C3%A1n "Michoacán") and Guerrero. With their capital at [Tzintzuntzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzintzuntzan_(Mesoamerican_site) "Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)"), the Tarascan state was one of the few to actively and continuously resist Aztec domination during the Late Postclassic. Other important Postclassic cultures in Mesoamerica include the [Totonac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totonac "Totonac") along the eastern coast (in the modern-day states of [Veracruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz "Veracruz"), [Puebla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla "Puebla"), and [Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidalgo_(state) "Hidalgo (state)")). The [Huastec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huastec_people "Huastec people") resided north of the Totonac, mainly in the modern-day states of [Tamaulipas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas "Tamaulipas") and northern Veracruz. The [Mixtec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec "Mixtec") and Zapotec cultures, centered at [Mitla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitla "Mitla") and [Zaachila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaachila "Zaachila") respectively, inhabited Oaxaca.

The Postclassic ends with the [arrival of the Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Mexico "Spanish conquest of Mexico") and their subsequent conquest of the Aztecs between 1519 and 1521. Many other cultural groups did not acquiesce until later. For example, Maya groups in the Petén area, including the [Itza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itza_people "Itza people") at [Tayasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayasal "Tayasal") and the [Kowoj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowoj "Kowoj") at [Zacpeten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacpeten "Zacpeten"), remained independent until 1697.

Some Mesoamerican cultures never achieved dominant status or left impressive archaeological remains but are nevertheless noteworthy. These include the [Otomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otomi_people "Otomi people"), [Mixe–Zoque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixe%E2%80%93Zoquean_languages "Mixe–Zoquean languages") groups (which may or may not have been related to the Olmecs), the northern [Uto-Aztecan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uto-Aztecan_languages "Uto-Aztecan languages") groups, often referred to as the [Chichimeca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichimeca "Chichimeca"), that include the [Cora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cora_people "Cora people") and [Huichol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huichol_people "Huichol people"), the Chontales, the Huaves, and the Pipil, Xincan and Lencan peoples of Central America.

Other characteristics
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Other characteristics")]

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Zea_mays.jpg/250px-Zea_mays.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zea_mays.jpg)

Examples of the diversity of [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize")

By roughly 6000 BCE, [hunter-gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") living in the [highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(geography) "Highland (geography)") and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chili. The earliest example of [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") dates to c. 4000 BCE and comes from [Guilá Naquitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guil%C3%A1_Naquitz "Guilá Naquitz"), a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama "Panama"), c. 5500 BCE.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-30) Slightly thereafter, semi-[agrarian communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_community "Agrarian community") began to cultivate other crops throughout Mesoamerica.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Brien200525-31) Maize was the most common domesticate, but the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, [jicama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jicama "Jicama"), [tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato") and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BCE. At the same time, these communities exploited [cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton"), [yucca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca "Yucca"), and [agave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave "Agave") for fibers and [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile") materials.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDiamond1999126%E2%80%9327-32) By 2000 BCE, corn was the staple crop in the region, and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or [Breadnut tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brosimum_alicastrum "Brosimum alicastrum") (_[Brosimum alicastrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brosimum\_alicastrum "Brosimum alicastrum")_) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include [avocado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado "Avocado"), [papaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya "Papaya"), [guava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guava "Guava"), [mamey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamey_(disambiguation) "Mamey (disambiguation)"), [zapote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapote "Sapote"), and [annona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona "Annona").

Mesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large [ungulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate "Ungulate"). The lack of [draft animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_animals "Draft animals") for transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes. Other animals, including the [duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck "Duck"), [dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog "Dog"), and [turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_turkey "Wild turkey"), were [domesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication "Domestication"). Turkey was the first to be domesticated locally, around 3500 BCE.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDiamond1999100-33)[Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat "Dog meat") were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-34) and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.

Societies of this region did hunt certain wild species for food. These animals included deer, [rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), birds, and various types of insects. They also hunted for luxury items, such as feline fur and bird plumage.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDiamond1999-35)

Mesoamerican cultures that lived in the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures because there was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Brien200525-31) Fishing also was a major provider of food to lowland and coastal Mesoamericans creating a further disincentive to settle down in permanent communities.

### Political organization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Political organization")]

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg/250px-ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg)

[Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCinich_Kan_Bahlam_II "Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II"), the Classic period ruler of [Palenque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palenque "Palenque"), as depicted on a [stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele "Stele")

Ceremonial centers were the nuclei of Mesoamerican settlements. The temples provided spatial orientation, which was imparted to the surrounding town. The cities with their commercial and religious centers were always political entities, somewhat similar to the European [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state"), and each person could identify with the city where they lived.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Ceremonial centers were always built to be visible. Pyramids were meant to stand out from the rest of the city, to represent the gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of cities such as [Teotihuacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan "Teotihuacan"), as represented by the veneration of their gods.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-36)[Stelae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stela "Stela") were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica and served to commemorate notable successes, events, and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.

Given that Mesoamerica was broken into numerous and diverse ecological niches, none of the societies that inhabited the area were self-sufficient, although very long-distance trade was common only for very rare goods, or luxury materials.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-37) For this reason, from the last centuries of the [Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_period_in_the_Americas "Archaic period in the Americas") period (8000 BCE– 1000 BCE) onward, regions compensated for the environmental inadequacies by specializing in the extraction of certain abundant natural resources and then trading them for necessary unavailable resources through established commercial trade networks.

The following is a list of some of the specialized resources traded from the various Mesoamerican sub-regions and environmental contexts:

*   Pacific lowlands: [cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton "Cotton") and [cochineal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal "Cochineal")
*   Maya lowlands and the Gulf Coast: [cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean "Cocoa bean"), [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla "Vanilla"), [jaguar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar "Jaguar") skins, birds and bird feathers (especially [quetzal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzal "Quetzal") and [macaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaw "Macaw"))
*   Central Mexico: Obsidian ([Pachuca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca "Pachuca"))
*   Guatemalan highlands: Obsidian ([San Martin Jilotepeque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica#Sources "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica"), [El Chayal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica#Sources "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica"), and [Ixtepeque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica#Sources "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica")), [pyrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite "Pyrite"), and [jade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade "Jade") from the [Motagua River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motagua_River "Motagua River") valley
*   Coastal areas: [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt"), dry [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish"), [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton "Exoskeleton"), and [dyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye "Dye")

Mesoamerican architecture is the collective name given to urban, ceremonial and public structures built by [pre-Columbian civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pre-Columbian_cultures "List of pre-Columbian cultures") in Mesoamerica. Although very different in styles, all kinds of Mesoamerican architecture show some kind of interrelation, due to very significant cultural exchanges that occurred during thousands of years. Among the most well-known structures in Mesoamerica, the flat-top [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_pyramids "Mesoamerican pyramids") are a landmark feature of the most developed urban centers.

Two characteristics are most notable in Mesoamerican architecture. Firstly, the intimate connection between geography, astronomy, and architecture: very often, urban centers or even single buildings are aligned to cardinal directions and/or along particular constellations.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-38) Secondly, iconography was considered integral part of architecture, with buildings often being adorned with images of religious and cultural significance.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMillerTaube199330-39)

Agriculturally based people historically divide the year into four seasons. These included the two [solstices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstices "Solstices") and the two [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinoxes "Equinoxes"), which could be thought of as the four "directional pillars" that support the year. These four times of the year were, and still are, important as they indicate seasonal changes that directly impact the lives of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.

The Maya closely observed and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and [lunar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipses "Lunar eclipses"), the phases of the [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), the periods of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") and [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events. These tables are remarkably accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-40)

Among the many types of calendars the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the [synodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_period "Synodic period") period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies, and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-41)

The names given to the days, months, and years in the Mesoamerican calendar came, for the most part, from animals, flowers, heavenly bodies, and cultural concepts that held symbolic significance in Mesoamerican culture. This calendar was used throughout the history of Mesoamerican by nearly every culture. Even today, several Maya groups in Guatemala, including the [Kʼicheʼ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_people "Kʼicheʼ people"), [Qʼeqchiʼ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC "Qʼeqchiʼ"), [Kaqchikel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_people "Kaqchikel people"), and the [Mixe people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixe_people "Mixe people") of Oaxaca continue using modernized forms of the Mesoamerican calendar.

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/La_Mojarra_Estela_1_%28Escritura_superior%29.jpg/250px-La_Mojarra_Estela_1_%28Escritura_superior%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:La_Mojarra_Estela_1_(Escritura_superior).jpg)

One of the earliest examples of the [Mesoamerican writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_writing_systems "Mesoamerican writing systems"), the [Epi-Olmec script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epi-Olmec_script "Epi-Olmec script") on the [La Mojarra Stela 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mojarra_Stela_1 "La Mojarra Stela 1") dated to around 150 CE. Mesoamerica is one of the five places in the world where [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "Writing") has developed independently.

The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [logosyllabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logosyllabary "Logosyllabary") combining the use of [logograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logograms "Logograms") with a [syllabary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary"), and they are often called [hieroglyphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyph "Hieroglyph") scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica, but archaeological dating methods, and a certain degree of self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, is the classic [Maya script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script"). Others include the [Olmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec_hieroglyphs "Olmec hieroglyphs"), Zapotec, and [Epi-Olmec/Isthmian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epi-Olmec_script "Epi-Olmec script") writing systems. An extensive [Mesoamerican literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_literature "Mesoamerican literature") has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script").

The other [glyphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph_(archaeology) "Glyph (archaeology)") writing systems of Mesoamerica, and their interpretation, have been subject to much debate. One important ongoing discussion regards whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts can be considered examples of true writing or whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts are best understood as [pictographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictographic "Pictographic") conventions that express ideas, specifically religious ones, but don't represent the phonetics of spoken language.

Mesoamerican writing is found in several mediums, including large stone monuments such as [stelae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stelae "Stelae"), carved directly onto architecture, carved or painted over stucco (e.g., [murals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murals "Murals")), and on [pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery "Pottery"). No Precolumbian Mesoamerican society is known to have had widespread literacy, and literacy was probably restricted to particular social classes, including scribes, painters, merchants, and the nobility.

The Mesoamerican book was typically written with brush and colored inks on a paper prepared from the inner bark of the _Ficus amacus_. The book consisted of a long strip of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.

Following the Spanish conquests in the sixteenth century, Spanish friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in alphabetic texts. Many oral histories of the prehispanic period were subsequently recorded in alphabetic texts. The indigenous in central and southern Mexico continued to produce written texts in the colonial period, many with pictorial elements. An important scholarly reference work is the _[Handbook of Middle American Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook\_of\_Middle\_American\_Indians "Handbook of Middle American Indians"), Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources_. [Mesoamerican codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_codices "Mesoamerican codices") survive from the [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_codices "Aztec codices"), [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_codices "Maya codices"), [Mixtec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec_codices "Mixtec codices"), and [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization "Zapotec civilization") regions.

Mesoamerican [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") treated [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") as having both literal and symbolic value, the result of the [dualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualistic_cosmology "Dualistic cosmology") nature that characterized Mesoamerican ideology. As mentioned, the Mesoamerican numbering system was vigesimal (i.e., based on the number 20).

In representing numbers, a series of bars and dots were employed. Dots had a value of one, and bars had a value of five. This type of arithmetic was combined with symbolic numerology: '2' was related to origins, as all origins can be thought of as doubling; '3' was related to household fire; '4' was linked to the four corners of the universe; '5' expressed instability; '9' pertained to the underworld and the night; '13' was the number for light, '20' for abundance, and '400' for infinity. The [concept of zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)") was also used, and its representation at the Late Preclassic occupation of [Tres Zapotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tres_Zapotes "Tres Zapotes") is one of the earliest uses of zero in human history.

### Food, medicine, and science

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Food, medicine, and science")]

> Mesoamerica would deserve its place in the human [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(gods) "Pantheon (gods)") if its inhabitants had only created [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), in terms of harvest weight the world's most important crop. But the inhabitants of Mexico and northern Central America also developed [tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"), now basic to [Italian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine "Italian cuisine"); [peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_peppers "Bell peppers"), essential to [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_cuisine "Thai cuisine") and [Indian food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_food "Indian food"); all the world's [squashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(plant) "Squash (plant)") (except for a few domesticated in the United States); and many of the [beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beans "Beans") on dinner plates around the world. One writer estimated these indigenous tribes developed three-fifths of the crops now grown in cultivation, most of them in Mesoamerica. Having secured their food supply, the Mesoamerican societies turned to intellectual pursuits. In a millennium or less, a comparatively short time, they invented their own [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "Writing"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), including the [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-42)

Maize played an important role in [Mesoamerican feasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_feasts "Mesoamerican feasts") due to its symbolic meaning and abundance.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-43) Gods were praised and named after.

Companion planting was practiced in various forms by the indigenous peoples of the Americas. They domesticated [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_pepo "Cucurbita pepo") 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, then [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), then [common beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaseolus_vulgaris "Phaseolus vulgaris"), forming the [Three Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture) "Three Sisters (agriculture)") agricultural technique. The cornstalk served as a [trellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellis_(architecture) "Trellis (architecture)") for the beans to climb, and the beans [fixed nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation "Nitrogen fixation"), benefitting the maize.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-44)

Fray [Bernardino de Sahagún](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_de_Sahag%C3%BAn "Bernardino de Sahagún") collected extensive information on plants, animals, soil types, among other matters from native informants in Book 11, The Earthly Things, of the twelve-volume _General History of the Things of New Spain,_ known as the [Florentine Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Codex "Florentine Codex"), compiled in the third quarter of the sixteenth century. Bernardino de Sahagún reported the ritualistic use of [Psilocybe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybe "Psilocybe") mushrooms known to the [Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs "Aztecs") as _[teōnanācatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin\_mushroom "Psilocybin mushroom")_ (agglutinative form of _teōtl_ (god, sacred) and _nanācatl_ (mushroom) in [Náhuatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl_language "Nahuatl language")).[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-46) An earlier work, the [Badianus Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badianus_Manuscript "Badianus Manuscript") or [Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libellus_de_Medicinalibus_Indorum_Herbis "Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis") is another Aztec codex with written text and illustrations collected from the indigenous viewpoint. The [ancient Aztecs used a variety of entheogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_use_of_entheogens "Aztec use of entheogens") within their society.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-48)

Evidence shows that wild animals were captured and traded for symbolic and ritual purposes.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTESugiyamaFashFrance2018-49)

### Mythology and worldview

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Mythology and worldview")]

Shared traits in Mesoamerican mythology are characterized by their common basis as a religion that—though in many Mesoamerican groups developed into complex polytheistic religious systems—retained some shamanistic elements.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOrtiz_de_Montellano199067-71-50)

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Mexico.Xoloitzcuintle.01.jpg/250px-Mexico.Xoloitzcuintle.01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mexico.Xoloitzcuintle.01.jpg)

The [xoloitzcuintle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hairless_Dog "Mexican Hairless Dog") is one of the [naguales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagual "Nagual") of the god [Quetzalcoatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl "Quetzalcoatl"). In this form, it helps the dead cross the Chicnahuapan, a river that separates the world of the living from the dead.

The great breadth of the Mesoamerican [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(gods) "Pantheon (gods)") of [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities "Deities") is due to the incorporation of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-51) Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, [zoomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoomorphic "Zoomorphic"), and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-52) The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed over time and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc.

The typical Mesoamerican cosmology sees the world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world watched by the moon. More importantly, the three superposed levels of the world are united by a [Ceiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiba "Ceiba") tree (_Yaxche_ in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points. Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus mountains and tall trees connect the middle and upper worlds; caves connect the middle and nether worlds.

Generally, sacrifice can be divided into two types: [autosacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting_rituals_in_Maya_culture "Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture") and [human sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice "Human sacrifice").[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-53) The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, steles depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life. Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy. Ritual sacrifice was done in efforts to appease the gods, and was done with the purpose of protection of the population.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Human_sacrifice_%28Codex_Laud%2C_f.8%29.png/250px-Human_sacrifice_%28Codex_Laud%2C_f.8%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_sacrifice_(Codex_Laud,_f.8).png)

Ritual human sacrifice portrayed in [Codex Laud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Laud "Codex Laud")

Autosacrifice, also called [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting"), is the ritualized practice of drawing blood from oneself. It is commonly seen or represented through iconography as performed by ruling elites in highly ritualized ceremonies, but it was easily practiced in mundane sociocultural contexts (i.e., non-elites could perform autosacrifice). The act was typically performed with [obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian")[prismatic blades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prismatic_blade "Prismatic blade") or [stingray spines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_injury#Biological_structure_of_the_barb "Stingray injury"), and blood was drawn from piercing or cutting the [tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue "Tongue"), [earlobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earlobe "Earlobe"), and/or [genitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitals "Genitals") (among other locations). Another form of autosacrifice was conducted by pulling a rope with attached thorns through the tongue or earlobes. The blood produced was then collected on [amate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amate "Amate") held in a bowl.

Autosacrifice was not limited to male rulers, as their female counterparts often performed these ritualized activities. They are typically shown performing the rope and thorns technique. A recently discovered queen's tomb in the Classic Maya site of [Waka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Per%C3%BA_(Maya_site) "El Perú (Maya site)") (also known as El Perú) had a ceremonial stingray spine placed in her genital area, suggesting that women also performed bloodletting in their genitalia.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-54)

Sacrifice had great importance in the social and religious aspects of Mesoamerican culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFitzsimmons2009-55) Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, but it is not the end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life—divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict. The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice and gives the gods the energy to go about their daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and capturing prisoners became a method of social advancement and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests controlled the religious ideology, and the warriors supplied the sacrifices. Historically, it was also believed those sacrificed were chosen by the gods, this idea of being "chosen" was decided by the gods. This was then displayed by acts, such as being struck by lightning. If someone was struck by lightning and a sacrifice was needed they would often be chosen by their population, as they believed they were chosen by the gods.

The Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played for over 3000 years by nearly all pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, [ulama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama_(game) "Ulama (game)"), is still played in a few places.

Over 1300 [ballcourts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballcourt "Mesoamerican ballcourt") have been found throughout Mesoamerica.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-56) They vary considerably in size, but they all feature long narrow alleys with side walls to bounce the balls against.

The rules of the ballgame are not known, but it was probably similar to volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, though some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4 kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFilloy_Nadal200130-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeyenaar2001125%E2%80%9326-58)

While the game was played casually for simple recreation, including by children and perhaps even women, the game also had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice.

Mesoamerican [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") included a broad understanding of the cycles of planets and other celestial bodies. Special importance was given to the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") as the morning and evening star.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrofe20161-12-59)

Observatories were built at some sites, including the round observatory at [Ceibal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seibal "Seibal") and the "Observatorio" at [Xochicalco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochicalco "Xochicalco"). Often, the architectural organization of Mesoamerican sites was based on precise calculations derived from astronomical observations. Well-known examples of these include the [El Castillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Castillo,_Chichen_Itza "El Castillo, Chichen Itza") pyramid at Chichen Itza and the Observatorio at [Xochicalco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xochicalco "Xochicalco"). A unique and common architectural complex found among many Mesoamerican sites is the [E-Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Group "E-Group"); these are aligned to serve as astronomical observatories. The name of this complex is based on [Uaxactun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uaxactun "Uaxactun")'s "Group E", the first known observatory in the Maya area. Perhaps the earliest observatory documented in Mesoamerica is that of the [Monte Alto culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alto_culture "Monte Alto culture"). This complex consisted of three plain stelae and a temple oriented with respect to the [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades "Pleiades").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTE%C5%A0prajc201187-95-60)

#### Symbolism of space and time

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Symbolism of space and time")]

[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Mexico0047.jpg/250px-Mexico0047.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mexico0047.jpg)

The [Avenue of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan#Site_layout "Teotihuacan") in [Teotihuacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan "Teotihuacan"), an example of a Mesoamerican settlement planned according to concepts of directionality

It has been argued that among Mesoamerican societies the concepts of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") are associated with the four [cardinal compass points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_points "Cardinal points") and linked together by the [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDuverger1999-61) Dates or events were always tied to a compass direction, and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented according to directionality.

In Maya cosmology, each cardinal point was assigned a specific color and a specific jaguar deity ([Bacab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_mythology#Bacabs "Maya mythology")). They are as follows:

*   [Hobnil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacha-kyum "Hacha-kyum"), Bacab of the [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East "East"), associated with the color red and the _Kan_ years
*   [Can Tzicnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maya_gods_and_supernatural_beings#C "List of Maya gods and supernatural beings"), Bacab of the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North "North"), assigned the color white and the _Muluc_ years
*   [Zac Cimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maya_gods_and_supernatural_beings#Z "List of Maya gods and supernatural beings"), Bacab of the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West "West"), associated with the color black and the _Ix_ years
*   [Hozanek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacha-kyum "Hacha-kyum"), Bacab of the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South "South"), associated with the color yellow and the _Cauac_ years.

Later cultures such as the [Kaqchikel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_people "Kaqchikel people") and [Kʼicheʼ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_people "Kʼicheʼ people") maintain the association of cardinal directions with each color, but use different names.

Among the Aztecs, the name of each day was associated with a cardinal point (thus conferring symbolic significance), and each cardinal direction was associated with a group of symbols. Below are the symbols and concepts associated with each direction:

*   East: [croco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_crocodile "American crocodile")[dile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morelet%27s_crocodile "Morelet's crocodile"), the [serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism) "Serpent (symbolism)"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), cane, and movement. The East was linked to the world priests and associated with vegetative fertility, or, in other words, tropical exuberance.
*   North: wind, death, the dog, the jaguar, and [flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint "Flint") (or [chert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert "Chert")). The North contrasts with the East in that it is conceptualized as dry, cold, and oppressive. It is considered the nocturnal part of the universe and includes the dwellings of the dead. The dog ([xoloitzcuintle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xoloitzcuintle "Xoloitzcuintle")) has a very specific meaning, as it accompanies the deceased during the trip to the lands of the dead and helps them cross the river of death that leads to nothingness. (_See also_[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_Mesoamerican_folklore_and_myth "Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth")).
*   West: the house, the deer, the [monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_monkey "New World monkey"), the [eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle "Eagle"), and rain. The west was associated with the cycles of vegetation, specifically the temperate high plains that experience light rains and the change of seasons.
*   South: rabbit, the [lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard "Lizard"), dried herbs, the [buzzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_vulture "New World vulture"), and flowers. It is related on the one hand to the luminous Sun and the noon heat, and on the other to rain filled with alcohol. The rabbit, the principal symbol of the West, was associated with farmers and with [pulque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque "Pulque").

### Political and religious art

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesoamerica&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Political and religious art")]

[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Tzompantli_Tovar.jpeg/250px-Tzompantli_Tovar.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tzompantli_Tovar.jpeg)

Art with ideological and political meaning: depiction of an [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec")_[tzompantli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzompantli "Tzompantli")_ (skull-rack) from the [Ramirez Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramirez_Codex "Ramirez Codex")

Mesoamerican [artistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art") expression was conditioned by [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") and generally focused on themes of [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion") and/or sociopolitical [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(sociology) "Power (sociology)"). This is largely based on the fact that most works that survived the Spanish conquest were public monuments. These monuments were typically erected by rulers who sought to visually legitimize their sociocultural and political position; by doing so, they intertwined their lineage, personal attributes and achievements, and legacy with religious concepts. As such, these monuments were specifically designed for public display and took many forms, including [stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele "Stele"), [sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture "Sculpture"), architectural [reliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief "Relief"), and other types of architectural elements (e.g., roofcombs). Other themes expressed include tracking time, glorifying the city, and veneration of the gods—all of which were tied to explicitly aggrandizing the abilities and the reign of the ruler who commissioned the artwork.

The majority of artwork created during this historical time was about these topics, religion and politics. Rulers were drawn and sculpted. Historical tales and events were then translated into pieces of art, and art was used to relay religious and political messages.

Archaeological studies have never discovered any written music from the [pre-Columbian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era "Pre-Columbian era"), but musical instruments were found, as well as carvings and depictions, that clearly show how music played a central role in the [Mayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization") religious and societal structures, for example, as accompaniment to celebrations and funerals.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-62) Some Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Maya, commonly played various instruments such as drums, flutes and whistles.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica#cite_note-63) Although most of the original Mayan music disappeared following the [Spanish colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas "Spanish colonization of the Americas"), some of it mixed with the incoming Spanish music and exists to date.
