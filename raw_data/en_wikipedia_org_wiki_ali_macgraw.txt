[ 1 ] She has one brother, Dick, an artist.

[ 1 ] Her mother was Hungarian Jewish, the daughter of emigrants from Budapest , Hungary. MacGraw's mother chose not to disclose her ancestry to Ali's father, instead professing ignorance about it. "I think Daddy was bigoted," MacGraw has said.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Her mother was considered a "pioneer" as an artist, who had taught in Paris before settling in Greenwich Village . Her parents married when her mother was nearing 35: "My gorgeous father: a combination of Tyrone Power and a mystery, a brilliant artist and a brain beyond brains." [ 1 ] He was born in New Jersey with his childhood spent in an orphanage. He ran away to sea when he was 16 and studied art in Munich . MacGraw adds, "Daddy was frightened and really, really angry. He never forgave his real parents for giving him up." [ 1 ] As an adult, he constantly suppressed the rage he built up against his parents.

[ 1 ] She described her father as "violent".

[ 9 ] MacGraw attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Connecticut and graduated from Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1960.

[ 10 ] Film and television [ edit ] With Richard Benjamin in Goodbye, Columbus (1969) MacGraw began her acting career in television commercials, including one for the Polaroid Swinger camera.

[ 11 ] In one commercial for International Paper , she was on a beach in a bikini made of Confil and went for a swim underwater to prove its strength and durability. MacGraw gained widespread attention with Goodbye, Columbus (1969), her first leading role, but real stardom came when she starred opposite Ryan O'Neal in Love Story (1970), one of the highest-grossing films in U.S. history.

[ 12 ] The film, and MacGraw's performance in particular, received widespread critical acclaim, and earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama , in addition to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress . Following Love Story , MacGraw was celebrated on the cover of Time .
