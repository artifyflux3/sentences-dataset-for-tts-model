A stratigraphic section is a sequence of layers of rocks in the order they were deposited . It is based on the principle of original horizontality , which states that layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally under the action of gravity .

[ 1 ] Biostratigraphers estimate the age of stratigraphic sections by using the faunal assemblages contained within rock samples from outcrop and drill cores.

[ 2 ] Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.

[ 3 ] Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores . Other scientists perform stable-isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate.

[ 4 ] Stratigraphic sections can also be used to locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction , particularly petroleum and natural gas .

A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a stratigraphic section which defines the lower boundaries of stages on the geologic time scale.
