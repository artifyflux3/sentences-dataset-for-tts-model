Reflective caustic generated from a circle and parallel rays. On one side, each point is contained in three light rays; on the other side, each point is contained in one light ray.

In differential geometry , a caustic is the envelope of rays either reflected or refracted by a manifold . It is related to the concept of caustics in geometric optics . The ray's source may be a point (called the radiant) or parallel rays from a point at infinity, in which case a direction vector of the rays must be specified.

More generally, especially as applied to symplectic geometry and singularity theory , a  caustic is the critical value set of a Lagrangian mapping ( π ○ i ) : L ↪ M ↠ B ; where i : L ↪ M is a Lagrangian immersion of a Lagrangian submanifold L into a symplectic manifold M , and π : M ↠ B is a Lagrangian fibration of the symplectic manifold M . The caustic is a subset of the Lagrangian fibration 's base space B .

[ 1 ] Explanation [ edit ] The rays refracted by a non-flat surface form caustics where many of them cross.

Concentration of light, especially sunlight , can burn. The word caustic , in fact, comes from the Greek καυστός, burnt, via the Latin causticus , burning.

A common situation where caustics are visible is when light shines on a drinking glass. The glass casts a shadow, but also produces a curved region of bright light. In ideal circumstances (including perfectly parallel rays, as if from a point source at infinity), a nephroid -shaped patch of light can be produced.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Rippling caustics are commonly formed when light shines through waves on a body of water.

Another familiar caustic is the rainbow .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Scattering of light by raindrops causes different wavelengths of light to be refracted into arcs of differing radius, producing the bow.

Catacaustic [ edit ] A catacaustic is the reflective case.

With a radiant, it is the evolute of the orthotomic of the radiant.

The planar, parallel-source-rays case: suppose the direction vector is ( a , b ) {\displaystyle (a,b)} and the mirror curve is parametrised as ( u ( t ) , v ( t ) ) {\displaystyle (u(t),v(t))} . The normal vector at a point is ( − − v ′ ( t ) , u ′ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle (-v'(t),u'(t))} ; the reflection of the direction vector is (normal needs special normalization) 2 proj n d − − d = 2 n n ⋅ ⋅ n n ⋅ ⋅ d n ⋅ ⋅ n − − d = 2 n n ⋅ ⋅ d n ⋅ ⋅ n − − d = ( a v ′ 2 − − 2 b u ′ v ′ − − a u ′ 2 , b u ′ 2 − − 2 a u ′ v ′ − − b v ′ 2 ) v ′ 2 + u ′ 2 {\displaystyle 2{\mbox{proj}}_{n}d-d={\frac {2n}{\sqrt {n\cdot n}}}{\frac {n\cdot d}{\sqrt {n\cdot n}}}-d=2n{\frac {n\cdot d}{n\cdot n}}-d={\frac {(av'^{2}-2bu'v'-au'^{2},bu'^{2}-2au'v'-bv'^{2})}{v'^{2}+u'^{2}}}} Having components of found reflected vector treat it as a tangent ( x − − u ) ( b u ′ 2 − − 2 a u ′ v ′ − − b v ′ 2 ) = ( y − − v ) ( a v ′ 2 − − 2 b u ′ v ′ − − a u ′ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle (x-u)(bu'^{2}-2au'v'-bv'^{2})=(y-v)(av'^{2}-2bu'v'-au'^{2}).} Using the simplest envelope form F ( x , y , t ) = ( x − − u ) ( b u ′ 2 − − 2 a u ′ v ′ − − b v ′ 2 ) − − ( y − − v ) ( a v ′ 2 − − 2 b u ′ v ′ − − a u ′ 2 ) {\displaystyle F(x,y,t)=(x-u)(bu'^{2}-2au'v'-bv'^{2})-(y-v)(av'^{2}-2bu'v'-au'^{2})} = x ( b u ′ 2 − − 2 a u ′ v ′ − − b v ′ 2 ) − − y ( a v ′ 2 − − 2 b u ′ v ′ − − a u ′ 2 ) + b ( u v ′ 2 − − u u ′ 2 − − 2 v u ′ v ′ ) + a ( − − v u ′ 2 + v v ′ 2 + 2 u u ′ v ′ ) {\displaystyle =x(bu'^{2}-2au'v'-bv'^{2})-y(av'^{2}-2bu'v'-au'^{2})+b(uv'^{2}-uu'^{2}-2vu'v')+a(-vu'^{2}+vv'^{2}+2uu'v')} F t ( x , y , t ) = 2 x ( b u ′ u ″ − − a ( u ′ v ″ + u ″ v ′ ) − − b v ′ v ″ ) − − 2 y ( a v ′ v ″ − − b ( u ″ v ′ + u ′ v ″ ) − − a u ′ u ″ ) {\displaystyle F_{t}(x,y,t)=2x(bu'u''-a(u'v''+u''v')-bv'v'')-2y(av'v''-b(u''v'+u'v'')-au'u'')} + b ( u ′ v ′ 2 + 2 u v ′ v ″ − − u ′ 3 − − 2 u u ′ u ″ − − 2 u ′ v ′ 2 − − 2 u ″ v v ′ − − 2 u ′ v v ″ ) + a ( − − v ′ u ′ 2 − − 2 v u ′ u ″ + v ′ 3 + 2 v v ′ v ″ + 2 v ′ u ′ 2 + 2 v ″ u u ′ + 2 v ′ u u ″ ) {\displaystyle +b(u'v'^{2}+2uv'v''-u'^{3}-2uu'u''-2u'v'^{2}-2u''vv'-2u'vv'')+a(-v'u'^{2}-2vu'u''+v'^{3}+2vv'v''+2v'u'^{2}+2v''uu'+2v'uu'')} which may be unaesthetic, but F = F t = 0 {\displaystyle F=F_{t}=0} gives a linear system in ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} and so it is elementary to obtain a parametrisation of the catacaustic.

Cramer's rule would serve.

Example [ edit ] Let the direction vector be (0,1) and the mirror be ( t , t 2 ) .

{\displaystyle (t,t^{2}).} Then u ′ = 1 {\displaystyle u'=1} u ″ = 0 {\displaystyle u''=0} v ′ = 2 t {\displaystyle v'=2t} v ″ = 2 {\displaystyle v''=2} a = 0 {\displaystyle a=0} b = 1 {\displaystyle b=1} F ( x , y , t ) = ( x − − t ) ( 1 − − 4 t 2 ) + 4 t ( y − − t 2 ) = x ( 1 − − 4 t 2 ) + 4 t y − − t {\displaystyle F(x,y,t)=(x-t)(1-4t^{2})+4t(y-t^{2})=x(1-4t^{2})+4ty-t} F t ( x , y , t ) = − − 8 t x + 4 y − − 1 {\displaystyle F_{t}(x,y,t)=-8tx+4y-1} and F = F t = 0 {\displaystyle F=F_{t}=0} has solution ( 0 , 1 / 4 ) {\displaystyle (0,1/4)} ; i.e.

, light entering a parabolic mirror parallel to its axis is reflected through the focus.
