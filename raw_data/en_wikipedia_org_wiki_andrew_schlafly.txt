[ 17 ] He felt the need to start the project after reading a student's assignment written using Common Era dating notation, rather than the Anno Domini system that he preferred. Although he was "an early Wikipedia enthusiast", as reported by Shawn Zeller of Congressional Quarterly , Schlafly became concerned about perceived bias after Wikipedia editors repeatedly undid his edits to the article about the 2005 Kansas evolution hearings .

[ 18 ] Schlafly expressed hope that Conservapedia would become a general resource for American educators and a counterpoint to the liberal bias that he perceived in Wikipedia .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The site has been accused of spreading misinformation on scientific subjects , such as HIV/AIDS denialism , the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis , climate change denial , relativity denial, and vaccine/autism connections , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] and has advocated Young Earth creationism , [ 26 ] Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories [ 27 ] and conspiracy theories that the January 6 United States Capitol attack was staged. Additionally, it features extensive criticisms of atheism , feminism , homosexuality , and the Democratic Party .

In 2009, Schlafly appeared on The Colbert Report to discuss his Conservative Bible Project , a project hosted on Conservapedia that aims to rewrite English translations of the Bible in order to remove or alter terms advancing a "liberal bias".

[ 28 ] Dialogue with Richard Lenski [ edit ] Richard Lenski , an evolutionary biologist [ 29 ] known for his work on the E. coli long-term evolution experiment , was contacted by Schlafly in 2008 regarding a set of results that showed one population of E. coli evolved the novel trait of being able to metabolize citrate . Conservapedia supports creationism and objects to evolution, so Schlafly disputed that bacteria could evolve via beneficial mutations . The correspondence was commented on across the Internet. Schlafly was criticized by Lenski on Ars Technica , among other sites, for not reading Lenski's paper properly, for not understanding the experimental data he requested, and for not taking notice of people on Conservapedia itself who considered the paper well researched.

[ 30 ] Trademark lawsuit against Saint Louis Brewery [ edit ] In 2011, Schlafly led a lawsuit on behalf of the family of his activist mother, Phyllis, to block The Saint Louis Brewery from acquiring a trademark on the name "Schlafly". In 2018, the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of The Saint Louis Brewery.

[ 31 ] Personal life [ edit ] In 1984, Schlafly married Catherine Kosarek, a medical student and fellow Princeton alum.

[ 32 ] They live in Far Hills, New Jersey .
