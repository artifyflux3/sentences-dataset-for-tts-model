Alma mater Manhattanville College Fordham University Occupation(s) Philosopher, theologian, professor, author Employer Hunter College Spouse Dietrich von Hildebrand ​ ​ ( m.

1959; died 1977) ​ Alice Marie von Hildebrand , GCSG [ 1 ] ( née Jourdain ; 11 March 1923 – 14 January 2022) was a Belgian-born American Catholic philosopher, theologian, author, and professor.  She taught philosophy at Hunter College for 37 years.  She was also the second wife of Dietrich von Hildebrand .

Early life [ edit ] Von Hildebrand was born Alice Marie Jourdain to Henri and Marthe (van der Horst) Jourdain in Brussels , Belgium, on 11 March 1923.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Her first language was French.  She left her home country in 1940, shortly after it was invaded by Germany , and relocated to the United States as a refugee.

[ 4 ] She initially attended Manhattanville College , [ 4 ] before studying philosophy at Fordham University , [ 2 ] where she obtained a doctorate in 1949.

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Von Hildebrand struggled to find employment in academia.  She was rejected by Catholic colleges, who informed her that they did not employ women to teach philosophy.

[ 4 ] She eventually started teaching at Hunter College – a constituent college of the City University of New York – in 1947.

[ 1 ] She utilized her maiden name due to the hostility endured by her husband.  She only received academic tenure after 14 years of teaching.

[ 2 ] Despite being advised by the college president (and fellow Catholic) George N. Shuster that she would be more content teaching at a Catholic institution, she was of the opinion that it was essential for a Catholic to be present at a secular educational institution.  She ultimately remained at Hunter College for 37 years.  She attributed the conversion of many of her students to Catholicism with her teaching of objective truth .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Von Hildebrand retired early in 1984, [ 1 ] having grown weary of being issued a teaching schedule that concluded at 10 pm.

[ 2 ] She was subsequently conferred the Presidential Award for excellence in teaching by the college.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Von Hildebrand made more than 80 appearances on EWTN television programming.

[ 1 ] She launched the Dietrich von Hildebrand Legacy Project in 2004 with some of her husband's former students.

[ 1 ] Her works include The Soul of a Lion: The Life of Dietrich von Hildebrand (2000), a biography of her husband, [ 6 ] and her autobiography, Memoirs of a Happy Failure (2014), which recounts her escape from Nazi Europe and her teaching career at Hunter College.

[ 7 ] Views [ edit ] Von Hildebrand criticized what she considered to be the advance of relativism [ 7 ] and modernism in the Catholic Church , [ 2 ] particularly within its institutions of Catholic higher education and its Catholic schools .  Hildebrand held conservative Catholic views on homosexuality, saying that it "constitutes a grave offense to God and brings great moral harm to the persons engaging in it", and arguing that those with "homosexual tendencies" should practice celibacy.

[ 8 ] She was also an outspoken critic of feminism.

[ 9 ] Personal life [ edit ] Von Hildebrand married Catholic philosopher and theologian Dietrich von Hildebrand in 1959, two years after his first wife died.  They first met at Fordham University, where she was a student and he was a professor.  She later worked as his secretary and collaborated with him on authoring books, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] such as The Art of Living .

[ 4 ] They did not have children together, [ 4 ] and remained married until his death in 1977.

[ 10 ] Von Hildebrand was created a Dame of Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great , a papal order of knighthood, in October 2013.

[ 11 ] She died on 14 January 2022 at her home in New Rochelle , New York .  She was 98, and suffered a brief illness [ which?

] prior to her death.
