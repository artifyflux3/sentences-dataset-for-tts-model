[ 1 ] The project represented a colossal challenge, as Euler is one of the most prolific scientists in history.

[ 2 ] The edition of Euler's Collected Works is close to completion, with a total of 84 volumes comprising about 35,000 pages [ 3 ] planned for the entire collection. A total of 80 volumes have been published so far. By 2010, three of the last four volumes of series IV were in active preparation.

[ 4 ] The gigantic effort of editing and publishing Euler's Opera Omnia required the continuous contribution of internationally acclaimed scientists for over a century, as well as the financial support of the Swiss National Science Foundation , the Swiss Academy of Sciences and numerous donations from Swiss corporations.
