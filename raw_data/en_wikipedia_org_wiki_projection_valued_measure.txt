[ 1 ] A projection-valued measure (PVM) is formally similar to a real-valued measure , except that its values are self-adjoint projections rather than real numbers. As in the case of ordinary measures, it is possible to integrate complex-valued functions with respect to a PVM; the result of such an integration is a linear operator on the given Hilbert space.

Projection-valued measures are used to express results in spectral theory , such as the important spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators , in which case the PVM is sometimes referred to as the spectral measure . The Borel functional calculus for self-adjoint operators is constructed using integrals with respect to PVMs.  In quantum mechanics , PVMs are the mathematical description of projective measurements .

[ clarification needed ] They are generalized by positive operator valued measures (POVMs) in the same sense that a mixed state or density matrix generalizes the notion of a pure state .

Definition [ edit ] Let H {\displaystyle H} denote a separable complex Hilbert space and ( X , M ) {\displaystyle (X,M)} a measurable space consisting of a set X {\displaystyle X} and a Borel σ-algebra M {\displaystyle M} on X {\displaystyle X} . A projection-valued measure π π {\displaystyle \pi } is a map from M {\displaystyle M} to the set of bounded self-adjoint operators on H {\displaystyle H} satisfying the following properties: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] π π ( E ) {\displaystyle \pi (E)} is an orthogonal projection for all E ∈ ∈ M .

{\displaystyle E\in M.} π π ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \pi (\emptyset )=0} and π π ( X ) = I {\displaystyle \pi (X)=I} , where ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } is the empty set and I {\displaystyle I} the identity operator .

If E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , … … {\displaystyle E_{1},E_{2},E_{3},\dotsc } in M {\displaystyle M} are disjoint, then for all v ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle v\in H} , π π ( ⋃ ⋃ j = 1 ∞ ∞ E j ) v = ∑ ∑ j = 1 ∞ ∞ π π ( E j ) v .

{\displaystyle \pi \left(\bigcup _{j=1}^{\infty }E_{j}\right)v=\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }\pi (E_{j})v.} π π ( E 1 ∩ ∩ E 2 ) = π π ( E 1 ) π π ( E 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi (E_{1}\cap E_{2})=\pi (E_{1})\pi (E_{2})} for all E 1 , E 2 ∈ ∈ M .

{\displaystyle E_{1},E_{2}\in M.} The fourth property is a consequence of the first and third property.

[ 4 ] The second and fourth property show that if E 1 {\displaystyle E_{1}} and E 2 {\displaystyle E_{2}} are disjoint, i.e., E 1 ∩ ∩ E 2 = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle E_{1}\cap E_{2}=\emptyset } , the images π π ( E 1 ) {\displaystyle \pi (E_{1})} and π π ( E 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi (E_{2})} are orthogonal to each other.

Let V E = im ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ( E ) ) {\displaystyle V_{E}=\operatorname {im} (\pi (E))} and its orthogonal complement V E ⊥ ⊥ = ker ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ( E ) ) {\displaystyle V_{E}^{\perp }=\ker(\pi (E))} denote the image and kernel , respectively, of π π ( E ) {\displaystyle \pi (E)} . If V E {\displaystyle V_{E}} is a closed subspace of H {\displaystyle H} then H {\displaystyle H} can be wrtitten as the orthogonal decomposition H = V E ⊕ ⊕ V E ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle H=V_{E}\oplus V_{E}^{\perp }} and π π ( E ) = I E {\displaystyle \pi (E)=I_{E}} is the unique identity operator on V E {\displaystyle V_{E}} satisfying all four properties.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] For every ξ ξ , η η ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle \xi ,\eta \in H} and E ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle E\in M} the projection-valued measure forms a complex-valued measure on H {\displaystyle H} defined as μ μ ξ ξ , η η ( E ) := ⟨ ⟨ π π ( E ) ξ ξ ∣ ∣ η η ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \mu _{\xi ,\eta }(E):=\langle \pi (E)\xi \mid \eta \rangle } with total variation at most ‖ ‖ ξ ξ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ η η ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\xi \|\|\eta \|} .

[ 7 ] It reduces to a real-valued measure when μ μ ξ ξ ( E ) := ⟨ ⟨ π π ( E ) ξ ξ ∣ ∣ ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \mu _{\xi }(E):=\langle \pi (E)\xi \mid \xi \rangle } and a probability measure when ξ ξ {\displaystyle \xi } is a unit vector .

Example Let ( X , M , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,M,\mu )} be a σ -finite measure space and, for all E ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle E\in M} , let π π ( E ) : L 2 ( X ) → → L 2 ( X ) {\displaystyle \pi (E):L^{2}(X)\to L^{2}(X)} be defined as ψ ψ ↦ ↦ π π ( E ) ψ ψ = 1 E ψ ψ , {\displaystyle \psi \mapsto \pi (E)\psi =1_{E}\psi ,} i.e., as multiplication by the indicator function 1 E {\displaystyle 1_{E}} on L 2 ( X ) . Then π π ( E ) = 1 E {\displaystyle \pi (E)=1_{E}} defines a projection-valued measure.

[ 7 ] For example, if X = R {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} } , E = ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle E=(0,1)} , and φ φ , ψ ψ ∈ ∈ L 2 ( R ) {\displaystyle \varphi ,\psi \in L^{2}(\mathbb {R} )} there is then the associated complex measure μ μ φ φ , ψ ψ {\displaystyle \mu _{\varphi ,\psi }} which takes a measurable function f : R → → R {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } and gives the integral ∫ ∫ E f d μ μ φ φ , ψ ψ = ∫ ∫ 0 1 f ( x ) ψ ψ ( x ) φ φ ¯ ¯ ( x ) d x {\displaystyle \int _{E}f\,d\mu _{\varphi ,\psi }=\int _{0}^{1}f(x)\psi (x){\overline {\varphi }}(x)\,dx} Extensions of projection-valued measures [ edit ] If π is a projection-valued measure on a measurable space ( X , M ), then the map χ χ E ↦ ↦ π π ( E ) {\displaystyle \chi _{E}\mapsto \pi (E)} extends to a linear map on the vector space of step functions on X .  In fact, it is easy to check that this map is a ring homomorphism .  This map extends in a canonical way to all bounded complex-valued measurable functions on X , and we have the following.

Theorem — For any bounded Borel function f {\displaystyle f} on X {\displaystyle X} , there exists a unique bounded operator T : H → → H {\displaystyle T:H\to H} such that [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ⟨ ⟨ T ξ ξ ∣ ∣ ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ = ∫ ∫ X f ( λ λ ) d μ μ ξ ξ ( λ λ ) , ∀ ∀ ξ ξ ∈ ∈ H .

{\displaystyle \langle T\xi \mid \xi \rangle =\int _{X}f(\lambda )\,d\mu _{\xi }(\lambda ),\quad \forall \xi \in H.} where μ μ ξ ξ {\displaystyle \mu _{\xi }} is a finite Borel measure given by μ μ ξ ξ ( E ) := ⟨ ⟨ π π ( E ) ξ ξ ∣ ∣ ξ ξ ⟩ ⟩ , ∀ ∀ E ∈ ∈ M .

{\displaystyle \mu _{\xi }(E):=\langle \pi (E)\xi \mid \xi \rangle ,\quad \forall E\in M.} Hence, ( X , M , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,M,\mu )} is a finite measure space .

The theorem is also correct for unbounded measurable functions f {\displaystyle f} but then T {\displaystyle T} will be an unbounded linear operator on the Hilbert space H {\displaystyle H} .

Spectral theorem [ edit ] See also: Self-adjoint operator § Spectral theorem Let H {\displaystyle H} be a separable complex Hilbert space , A : H → → H {\displaystyle A:H\to H} be a bounded self-adjoint operator and σ σ ( A ) {\displaystyle \sigma (A)} the spectrum of A {\displaystyle A} . Then the spectral theorem says that there exists a unique projection-valued measure π π A {\displaystyle \pi ^{A}} , defined on a Borel subset E ⊂ ⊂ σ σ ( A ) {\displaystyle E\subset \sigma (A)} , such that [ 4 ] A = ∫ ∫ σ σ ( A ) λ λ d π π A ( λ λ ) , {\displaystyle A=\int _{\sigma (A)}\lambda \,d\pi ^{A}(\lambda ),} where the integral extends to an unbounded function λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } when the spectrum of A {\displaystyle A} is unbounded.

[ 10 ] The spectral theorem allows us to define the Borel functional calculus for any Borel measurable function g : R → → C {\displaystyle g:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {C} } by integrating with respect to the projection-valued measure π π A {\displaystyle \pi ^{A}} : g ( A ) := ∫ ∫ R g ( λ λ ) d π π A ( λ λ ) .

{\displaystyle g(A):=\int _{\mathbb {R} }g(\lambda )\,d\pi ^{A}(\lambda ).} A similar construction holds for normal operators and measurable functions g : C → → C {\displaystyle g:\mathbb {C} \to \mathbb {C} } .

Direct integrals [ edit ] First we provide a general example of projection-valued measure based on direct integrals . Suppose ( X , M , μ) is a measure space and let { H x } x ∈ X be a μ-measurable family of separable Hilbert spaces. For every E ∈ M , let π ( E ) be the operator of multiplication by 1 E on the Hilbert space ∫ ∫ X ⊕ ⊕ H x d μ μ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{X}^{\oplus }H_{x}\ d\mu (x).} Then π is a projection-valued measure on ( X , M ).

Suppose π , ρ  are projection-valued measures on  ( X , M ) with values in the projections of H , K .

π ,  ρ  are unitarily equivalent if and only if there is a unitary operator U : H → K such that π π ( E ) = U ∗ ∗ ρ ρ ( E ) U {\displaystyle \pi (E)=U^{*}\rho (E)U\quad } for every E ∈ M .

Theorem . If ( X , M ) is a standard Borel space , then for every projection-valued measure π on ( X , M ) taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space, there is a Borel measure μ and a μ-measurable family of Hilbert spaces { H x } x ∈ X , such that π is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by 1 E on the Hilbert space ∫ ∫ X ⊕ ⊕ H x d μ μ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{X}^{\oplus }H_{x}\ d\mu (x).} The measure class [ clarification needed ] of μ and the measure equivalence class of the multiplicity function x → dim H x completely characterize the projection-valued measure up to unitary equivalence.

A projection-valued measure π is homogeneous of multiplicity n if and only if the multiplicity function has constant value n .  Clearly, Theorem .  Any projection-valued measure π taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous projection-valued measures: π π = ⨁ ⨁ 1 ≤ ≤ n ≤ ≤ ω ω ( π π ∣ ∣ H n ) {\displaystyle \pi =\bigoplus _{1\leq n\leq \omega }(\pi \mid H_{n})} where H n = ∫ ∫ X n ⊕ ⊕ H x d ( μ μ ∣ ∣ X n ) ( x ) {\displaystyle H_{n}=\int _{X_{n}}^{\oplus }H_{x}\ d(\mu \mid X_{n})(x)} and X n = { x ∈ ∈ X : dim ⁡ ⁡ H x = n } .

{\displaystyle X_{n}=\{x\in X:\dim H_{x}=n\}.} Application in quantum mechanics [ edit ] See also: Expectation value (quantum mechanics) In quantum mechanics, given a projection-valued measure of a measurable space X {\displaystyle X} to the space of continuous endomorphisms upon a Hilbert space H {\displaystyle H} , the projective space P ( H ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (H)} of the Hilbert space H {\displaystyle H} is interpreted as the set of possible ( normalizable ) states φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } of a quantum system, [ 11 ] the measurable space X {\displaystyle X} is the value space for some quantum property of the system (an "observable"), the projection-valued measure π π {\displaystyle \pi } expresses the probability that the observable takes on various values.

A common choice for X {\displaystyle X} is the real line, but it may also be R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} (for position or momentum in three dimensions ), a discrete set (for angular momentum, energy of a bound state, etc.), the 2-point set "true" and "false" for the truth-value of an arbitrary proposition about φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } .

Let E {\displaystyle E} be a measurable subset of X {\displaystyle X} and φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } a normalized vector quantum state in H {\displaystyle H} , so that its Hilbert norm is unitary, ‖ ‖ φ φ ‖ ‖ = 1 {\displaystyle \|\varphi \|=1} . The probability that the observable takes its value in E {\displaystyle E} , given the system in state φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } , is P π π ( φ φ ) ( E ) = ⟨ ⟨ φ φ ∣ ∣ π π ( E ) ( φ φ ) ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ φ φ ∣ ∣ π π ( E ) ∣ ∣ φ φ ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle P_{\pi }(\varphi )(E)=\langle \varphi \mid \pi (E)(\varphi )\rangle =\langle \varphi \mid \pi (E)\mid \varphi \rangle .} We can parse this in two ways. First, for each fixed E {\displaystyle E} , the projection π π ( E ) {\displaystyle \pi (E)} is a self-adjoint operator on H {\displaystyle H} whose 1-eigenspace are the states φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } for which the value of the observable always lies in E {\displaystyle E} , and whose 0-eigenspace are the states φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } for which the value of the observable never lies in E {\displaystyle E} .

Second, for each fixed normalized vector state φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } , the association P π π ( φ φ ) : E ↦ ↦ ⟨ ⟨ φ φ ∣ ∣ π π ( E ) φ φ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle P_{\pi }(\varphi ):E\mapsto \langle \varphi \mid \pi (E)\varphi \rangle } is a probability measure on X {\displaystyle X} making the values of the observable into a random variable.

A measurement that can be performed by a projection-valued measure π π {\displaystyle \pi } is called a projective measurement .

If X {\displaystyle X} is the real number line, there exists, associated to π π {\displaystyle \pi } , a self-adjoint operator A {\displaystyle A} defined on H {\displaystyle H} by A ( φ φ ) = ∫ ∫ R λ λ d π π ( λ λ ) ( φ φ ) , {\displaystyle A(\varphi )=\int _{\mathbb {R} }\lambda \,d\pi (\lambda )(\varphi ),} which reduces to A ( φ φ ) = ∑ ∑ i λ λ i π π ( λ λ i ) ( φ φ ) {\displaystyle A(\varphi )=\sum _{i}\lambda _{i}\pi ({\lambda _{i}})(\varphi )} if the support of π π {\displaystyle \pi } is a discrete subset of X {\displaystyle X} .

The above operator A {\displaystyle A} is called the observable associated with the spectral measure.

Generalizations [ edit ] The idea of a projection-valued measure is generalized by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM), where the need for the orthogonality implied by projection operators is replaced by the idea of a set of operators that are a non-orthogonal "partition of unity", i.e. a set of positive semi-definite Hermitian operators that sum to the identity. This generalization is motivated by applications to quantum information theory .
