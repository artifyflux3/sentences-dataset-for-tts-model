[ 18 ] In 1997, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to Bollywood . He was a member of the 15th Lok Sabha of India , representing the Bikaner constituency in Rajasthan from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] His ancestral village is Dangon , near Pakhowal Tehsil Raikot , Ludhiana .

[ 24 ] [ 22 ] He spent his early life in the village of Sahnewal and studied at Government Senior Secondary School at Lalton Kalan , Ludhiana , where his father was the village school headmaster.

[ 25 ] He did his matriculation in Phagwara in 1952.

[ 26 ] In those days, schools of Punjab came under Panjab University, Chandigarh .

[ 27 ] He had two sons from this marriage, Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol , both successful film actors; and two daughters, Vijeta and Ajeeta.

After moving to Bombay and entering films, Dharmendra married Hema Malini , which caused controversy at the time since he was already married. Rumours began to circulate about Dharmendra and Hema Malini converting to Islam for this marriage.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 2004, during a political campaign, when the rumours began to circulate again, Dharmendra asserted that he remained a Hindu , [ 30 ] the family being Arya Samaji .

[ 31 ] He and Malini starred together in a number of movies in the early 1970s, including Sholay .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] The couple has two daughters, Esha Deol (an actress, born in 1981) and Ahana Deol (an assistant director, born in 1985). His grandson, Bobby Deol's son, is also named "Dharam", after him.

[ 34 ] Dharmendra has a farmhouse in Lonavala , where he now generally resides. His family resides in Juhu , Mumbai.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2023, Dharmendra expressed that Bollywood neglected his family and never appreciated Deol family's contribution to Indian cinema .

[ 38 ] Career 1960–1969: Early career and rise to prominence Dharmendra was the winner of Filmfare magazine's nationally organised new talent award and went to Mumbai from Punjab to work in the movie. However, it was never made. He later made his film debut in 1960 with Arjun Hingorani 's romantic drama Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere .

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] The film largely went unnoticed and as a result, did not perform that well at the box office.

[ 11 ] He saw his first commercial success in 1961 with Ramesh Saigal 's Shola Aur Shabnam and followed it with hits, such as Mohan Kumar 's Anpadh (1962) and Bimal Roy 's Bandini (1963), which won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi .

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] His breakthrough came in 1964 when he co-starred alongside Rajendra Kumar and Saira Banu in another of Mohan Kumar's directional venture Ayee Milan Ki Bela .

[ 44 ] It went on to become a superhit and despite playing the antagonist, Dharmendra was noticed by audience and received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] That same year, he played the lead role in Chetan Anand 's war-drama Haqeeqat .

[ 47 ] Based on the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the film proved to be a major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a superhit with one of its song " Ab Tumhare Hawaale Watan Saathiyon ", a solo by Mohammed Rafi becoming hugely popular among the masses.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] In 1965, he had another major success in Ram Maheshwari's romantic drama Kaajal .

[ 50 ] The film also had Meena Kumari , Raaj Kumar and Padmini in the lead.

[ 51 ] In 1966, Dharmendra reunited with Kumari for O. P. Ralhan 's Phool Aur Patthar . The film topped the box office chart in 1966, becoming a major blockbuster and making him a saleable star.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] He
received his first nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for the film.

[ 54 ] The success of Phool Aur Patthar was followed by hits in Mamta , Devar , Anupama and Aaye Din Bahar Ke , the same year.

[ 55 ] He was also given a souvenir at the 14th National Film Awards in recognition of his performance in Anupama .

[ 56 ] The next year, he worked in commercially unsuccessful, but critically acclaimed films like - Dulhan Ek Raat Ki opposite Nutan and Majhli Didi , Chandan Ka Palna , both opposite Kumari.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Dharmendra hit the big league in 1968 with Atma Ram 's mystery thriller Shikar and Ramanand Sagar 's spy thriller Ankhen .

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Both the films opened to positive audience response and proved to be blockbusters at the box office with the latter being the top–earning film that year.

[ 11 ] His other commercially successful releases of 1968 were – T. Prakash Rao 's drama film Izzat (in which he played a double role) and Amar Kumar's romantic drama Mere Hamdam Mere Dost .

[ 61 ] The following year, saw the emergence of superstar Rajesh Khanna , who stormed the nation with back-to-back blockbusters in Aradhana and Do Raaste .

[ 62 ] With his rise, a number of stars went through career decline.

[ 63 ] During this phase, Dharmendra and Dev Anand were the only actors who remained unaffected by Khanna's popularity.

[ 63 ] In 1969, he had a superhit in Aya Sawan Jhoom Ke , followed by three more successful films, which were - Yakeen , Pyar Hi Pyar and Aadmi Aur Insaan .

[ 64 ] Dharmendra also received immense acclaim for his portrayal of a righteous man in Hrishikesh Mukherjee 's social drama film Satyakam , which is widely considered to be his career-best performance by fans as well as critics and went on to win National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi .

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] 1970–1977: Superstardom In 1970, Dharmendra delivered four major successes and formed a hit pair with Hema Malini .

[ 39 ] His first release was Satyen Bose 's crime drama Jeevan Mrityu . An adaptation of Alexandre Dumas 's novel The Count of Monte Cristo , it proved to be major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a blockbuster and one of the top earners of 1970.

[ 67 ] His next two films, Bhappi Sonie 's Tum Haseen Main Jawan and Asit Sen 's Sharafat , both opposite Malini proved to be superhits at the box office.

[ 55 ] This was followed by a flop in Ishq Par Zor Nahin alongside Sadhana and a hit in Kab? Kyoon? Aur Kahan?

with Babita .

[ 55 ] His final release of that year was Raj Kapoor 's magnum opus Mera Naam Joker (in which he played a supporting role). Although the film was a disaster at the time of release, it attained cult status in later years, with many critics hailing it as one of the best Indian films of all time.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] In 1971, Dharmendra starred in Raj Khosla 's action drama Mera Gaon Mera Desh .

[ 70 ] The film went on to become an All Time Blockbuster and established his image of an action hero.

[ 71 ] The large success of this film also made the industry shift from romantic to action films.

[ 11 ] Dharmendra received his second nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for his performance in Mera Gaon Mera Desh .

[ 72 ] His success continued in the following year with another massive blockbuster in Seeta Aur Geeta , a superhit in Raja Jani and a hit film, Samadhi to go with the major grossers.

[ 73 ] The mass hysteria created by Mera Gaon Mera Desh in 1971, followed by back-to-back hits with Seeta Aur Geeta , Raja Jani and Samadhi in 1972 took Dharmendra to the number 1 position among his contemporaries, thus making him a "superstar".

[ 74 ] [ 53 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] 1973 was the best year of Dharmendra's career with many successes.

[ 11 ] His first release, which was A. Bhimsingh 's action crime film Loafer , emerged a superhit with its songs, including "Aaj Mausam Bada Be-Imaan", "Main Tere Ishq Mein", "Koi Shehri Babu" becoming immensely popular among the masses and making its soundtrack one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] This was followed by mystery thriller Jheel Ke Us Paar and action drama Jugnu . While Jheel Ke Us Paar was a hit, the latter proved to be a blockbuster in India as well as Soviet Union, eventually taking second spot at the box office in 1973.

[ 79 ] Owing to its huge success, Jugnu was also remade in Tamil and Telugu as Guru (1980).

[ 80 ] His next two releases were - Ravikant Nagaich 's spy thriller Keemat and Adurthi Subba Rao 's light-hearted drama film Jwaar Bhata .

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] Both the films received critical acclaim and emerged moderately successful.

[ 11 ] Towards the end of the year, Dharmendra appeared in Yaadon Ki Baaraat , Blackmail and Kahani Kismat Ki .

Yaadon Ki Baaraat , directed by Nasir Hussain and written by Salim-Javed is widely identified as the first masala film of Indian cinema and proved to be another blockbuster for the actor as well as the second best-selling Bollywood album of the 1970s.

[ 83 ] [ 11 ] [ 84 ] On the other hand, Vijay Anand 's romantic thriller Blackmail was an unsuccessful venture critically and commercially, but reception later improved, with many calling it one of Anand's most underrated works.

[ 85 ] The song "Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas" filmed on Dharmendra and Raakhee was a chartbuster and remains popular in modern culture.

[ 86 ] His final release of the year, Arjun Hingorani's actioner Kahani Kismat Ki continued his dream run and emerged a superhit at the box office.

[ 87 ] The following year, Dharmendra added one more blockbuster in his kitty with Dulal Guha 's social drama Dost co-starring Shatrughan Sinha and Hema Malini.

[ 88 ] The huge box office success of Dost was followed by moderate successes in Patthar Aur Payal and Resham Ki Dori . For his performance in the latter, Dharmendra received his fourth and final nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category.

[ 89 ] The 1975 Emergency had angered the public, and this helped films featuring the lead character revolting against corruption and establishment become successes. The shift from romantic and social movies to action-oriented multi-starrers changed the box office. The year saw the rise of another superstar, Amitabh Bachchan , but Dharmendra remained rock-steady and continued to deliver huge hits.

[ 90 ] In 1975, Dharmendra appeared alongside Bachchan in two films. The first was Mukherjee's light-hearted comedy Chupke Chupke .

[ 91 ] It received positive response from critics and went on to become a hit at the box office.

[ 92 ] The second was Ramesh Sippy 's actioner Sholay .

[ 93 ] It released on 15 August 1975, Indian Independence Day , in Bombay. Due to lackluster reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. However, from the third week onward, viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth .

[ 94 ] During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan's character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea.

[ 95 ] After additionally releasing a soundtrack containing dialogue snippets, [ 96 ] Sholay soon became an "overnight sensation".

[ 97 ] The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh , Bengal , and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975.

[ 98 ] It became the highest-grossing Hindi-language film of 1975, and film ranking website Box Office India has given the film a verdict of All Time Blockbuster .

[ 88 ] Sholay went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees [ a ] across India, [ 97 ] and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee [ b ] at over 100 theatres.

[ 97 ] It was shown continuously at Bombay's Minerva Theatre for over five years and in Kolkata's Jyoti Cinema for almost two years.

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] Sholay was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] Dharmendra and Bachchan starrer Sholay (1975) recorded an estimated ₹ 15-18 crore footfalls, making it the highest grossing Indian film in terms of audience attendance to date.

Before the end of year, he delivered another blockbuster in Pratiggya .

[ 103 ] The film along with its strong action scenes also had a significant comic track in the form of " slapstick " comedy which led to it being referred as a "masterpiece in comedy".

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] In 1976, Dharmendra reunited with Ramanand Sagar for the action thriller Charas . Set against the backdrop of the expulsion of Indian community from Uganda by its dictator Idi Amin in 1972, it opened to bumper response all over the nation and emerged a superhit at the box office.

[ 106 ] His other release of the year, M. A. Thirumugam 's family drama film Maa was thrashed by critics, but still went on to become a success.

[ 107 ] The year 1977 proved to be a big one for Dharmendra with a mega blockbuster in Manmohan Desai 's action drama Dharam Veer , a superhit in another of Desai's masala film Chacha Bhatija , followed by two more successful films in Arjun Hingorani's mystery thriller Khel Khilari Ka and Pramod Chakravorty's action comedy Dream Girl .

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] In the United Kingdom, Dharam Veer had 23 shows in 5 cities. Driven by the success of Rafi's songs, the film took a record initial of £50,000 in the UK, equivalent to ₹ 438,140 (US$50,001.71).

[ 110 ] In addition, the film sold 32 million tickets in the Soviet Union.

[ 111 ] 1978–1997: Continued success and occasional setbacks Post-1977, the quality of Dharmendra's films dropped and so the number of huge grossers, but his initial draw remained intact, owing to which the flow of successes continued till the 1990s.

[ 11 ] In 1978, he had four major releases which included Shalimar , Azaad , Dillagi and Phandebaaz . Out of these, Shalimar and Phandebaaz were critical and commercial failures while Azaad and Dillagi , both co-starring Malini emerged successful, especially the former which was a superhit as well as fourth highest-grossing film of the year .

[ 112 ] The following year, he added one more superhit in his kitty with Mohan Sehgal's Kartavya and a successful film with Dulal Guha's Dil Kaa Heera .

[ 113 ] Dharmendra began the 1980s with Ravi Chopra 's big-budget action thriller The Burning Train .

[ 114 ] The film co-starring Jeetendra , Vinod Khanna , Hema Malini and Parveen Babi didn't live up to the expectations and ended up as an average fare, however gained cult status in later years.

[ 115 ] His next two releases were - Alibaba Aur 40 Chor and Ram Balram . While the former was a moderate success, the latter in which he reunited with Bachchan proved to be a box office hit.

[ 116 ] In 1981, he had a superhit in Kaatilon Ke Kaatil , but other releases, such as Aas Paas and Krodhi failed to leave a mark while Brij Sadanah 's big-budget actioner Professor Pyarelal ended up as an average grosser.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] This changed in 1982 as five of his films emerged commercial successes, these were - Rajput , Badle Ki Aag , Ghazab , Baghavat and Samraat .

[ 119 ] In 1983, Dharmendra delivered a hit in Rajkumar Kohli 's comedy film Naukar Biwi Ka , followed by another success, Qayamat , but his most anticipated film of that year, Kamal Amrohi 's period biographical film Razia Sultan was a box office disaster .

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] The next year, he had seven releases, out of which Baazi , Jagir , Jeene Nahi Doonga and Dharm Aur Qanoon did reasonable business, but rest were critical and commercial failures.

[ 122 ] In 1985, Dharmendra starred in J. P. Dutta 's action drama film Ghulami which also had Mithun Chakraborty , Naseeruddin Shah , Reena Roy and Smita Patil in the lead. The film opened to positive reviews from critics and emerged a superhit as well as one of the top five highest-earners of that year.

[ 123 ] Its song, "Zeehale Muskin Makun ba-Ranjish", sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Shabbir Kumar was a chartbuster and was featured in the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala .

[ 124 ] The following year, he had another commercial success with Ambrish Sangal's Begaana (1986), co-starring Kumar Gaurav and Rati Agnihotri .

[ 125 ] Dharmendra returned to the big league in 1987 by delivering eight successful films in the year. His first two releases were - Rajkumar Kohli's and Raj N. Sippy 's actioners Insaniyat Ke Dushman and Loha , respectively, both of which proved to be box office hits.

[ 126 ] He then appeared in Dadagiri , Hukumat and Aag Hi Aag .

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] While Dadagiri was an average fare, the latter two went on to become superhits with Hukumat emerging as the highest-grossing film of the year .

[ 126 ] This was followed by T. Rama Rao 's hit venture Watan Ke Rakhwale and two more successful films, Insaaf Kaun Karega with Rajinikanth and Insaf Ki Pukar , co-starring Jeetendra.

[ 126 ] His other huge hits of the decade, include Khatron Ke Khiladi (1988) and Elaan-E-Jung (1989).

[ 129 ] [ 12 ] With the advent of the 1990s, Dharmendra's star power began to wane. From 1990 to 1992, his successful films included Naakabandi (1990), Veeru Dada (1990), Humse Na Takrana (1990), Kohraam (1991), Virodhi (1992) and Tahalka (1992), which also proved to be his final hit as a lead actor.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 12 ] In 1993, he appeared in J. P. Dutta's ensemble action film Kshatriya co-starring Sunil Dutt , Vinod Khanna , Rakhee Gulzar , Sanjay Dutt , Sunny Deol , Meenakshi Seshadri , Raveena Tandon and Divya Bharti .

[ 132 ] Kshatriya took a record opening, but collections dropped after it was pulled from theatres owing to Dutt's involvement in the 1993 Bombay bombings and it ended up as a flop.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] In the mid-1990s, he delivered average fares in Policewala Gunda (1995) and Mafia (1996), but his other releases, including biggies, such as Maidan-E-Jung (1995) and Return of Jewel Thief (1996) proved to be box office failures.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In 1997, Dharmendra received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award . While accepting the award from Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu , he became emotional and remarked that he had never won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor despite having worked in so many successful films and nearly a hundred popular films.

[ 139 ] Speaking on this occasion Dilip Kumar commented, "Whenever I get to meet with God Almighty, I will set before him my only complaint – why did you not make me as handsome as Dharmendra?".

[ 140 ] 1998–present: Shift to character roles Since the late-1990s, Dharmendra has appeared in character roles. His first film in such a role was Sohail Khan 's romantic comedy Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998), co-starring Salman Khan , Kajol and Arbaaz Khan .

[ 141 ] The film received positive reviews from critics and became a superhit at the box office.

[ 142 ] His first two major releases of the new decade were Kaise Kahoon Ke... Pyaar Hai (2003) and Kis Kis Ki Kismat (2004), both of which were box office failures.

[ 143 ] [ 144 ] After this, Dharmendra went on a hiatus for a brief period and returned with three films in 2007. These were - Anurag Basu 's drama film Life in a... Metro , Anil Sharma 's sports drama Apne and Sriram Raghavan 's neo-noir thriller Johnny Gaddaar .

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] Both, Life in a... Metro and Apne proved to be critical and commercial successes.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] On the other hand, Johnny Gaddaar , despite failing at the box office, received praise from critics and attained cult status in later years.

[ 16 ] [ 149 ] The same year, he made a guest appearance in the song "Deewangi Deewangi" from Farah Khan 's blockbuster reincarnation drama Om Shanti Om .

[ 150 ] In 2011, Dharmendra starred in Yamla Pagla Deewana and Tell Me O Kkhuda .

[ 151 ] [ 152 ] While the latter was a commercial disaster, Yamla Pagla Deewana performed very well and emerged a box office hit.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] He then appeared in sequels to Yamla Pagla Deewana , Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 (2013) and Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se (2018), but unlike the first film, both the sequels received poor audience response.

[ 155 ] In 2023, he appeared in Karan Johar 's ensemble family drama Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani . It opened to a polarising response from reviewers but grossed over ₹ 3.5 billion (US$41 million) worldwide and proved to be a hit as well as the tenth highest-grossing Indian film of the year.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] The following year, Dharmendra co-starred alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon in the romantic comedy Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya .

[ 158 ] The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but still did a lifetime business of ₹ 1.3 billion (US$15 million) worldwide to emerge a commercial success.

“ Even though this star had more hits than Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan , he was never called a ‘superstar’ for a rather academic reason. Dharmendra has the distinction of delivering the most hits as an actor in the Hindi film industry. The actor has a record 74 hits to his name in films where he was either the lead or had a substantial role. Dharmendra has appeared in over 240 films. Of these, 94 have been successful (recovering their investments), and 74 have had the distinction of being called hits. This includes 7 blockbusters, and 13 super hits, notably Sholay, the all-time highest-grosser of Indian cinema.
