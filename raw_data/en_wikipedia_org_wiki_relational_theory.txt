**Relationalism** is any theoretical position that gives importance to the [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(philosophy) "Relation (philosophy)") nature of things. For relationalism, things exist and function only as relational [entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity "Entity").

Relationalism (philosophical theory)
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relationalism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Relationalism (philosophical theory)")]

Relationalism, in the broadest sense, applies to any [system of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_thought "System of thought") that gives importance to the relational nature of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"). In its narrower and more philosophically restricted sense, as propounded by the Indian philosopher [Joseph Kaipayil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kaipayil "Joseph Kaipayil")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-3) and others, relationalism refers to the [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality") that interprets the [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"), nature, and meaning of things in terms of their relationality or relatedness. In the relationalist view, things are neither self-standing entities nor vague events but relational [particulars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulars "Particulars"). Particulars are inherently relational, as they are ontologically open to other particulars in their constitution and action. Relational particulars, in the relationalist view, are the ultimate constituents of reality.

Relationalism (theory of space and time)
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relationalism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Relationalism (theory of space and time)")]

In discussions about [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_time "Space and time"), the name relationalism (or relationism) refers to [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz")'s relationist notion of space and time as against [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s [substantivalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantivalist "Substantivalist") views.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-6) According to [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")’s substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, on the other hand, describes [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_time "Space and time") as systems of relations that exist between objects.

More generally, in physics and philosophy, a **relational theory** is a framework to understand [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality") or a [physical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system") in such a way that the positions and other properties of objects are only meaningful relative to other objects. In a relational [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") theory, space does not exist unless there are objects in it; nor does time exist without events. The relational view proposes that space is contained in objects and that an object represents within itself relationships to other objects. Space can be defined through the relations among the objects that it contains considering their variations through time. This is an alternative to an [absolute theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_theory "Absolute theory"), in which the space exists independently of any objects that can be immersed in it.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-SEP-7)

The relational point of view was advocated in physics by [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-SEP-7) and [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach "Ernst Mach") (in his [Mach's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle "Mach's principle")).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-SEP-7) It was rejected by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") in his successful description of [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"). Although [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") was impressed by Mach's principle, he did not fully incorporate it into his [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"). Several attempts have been made to formulate a full Machian theory, but most physicists think that none have so far succeeded. For example, see [Brans–Dicke theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brans%E2%80%93Dicke_theory "Brans–Dicke theory").

[Relational quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics "Relational quantum mechanics") and a relational approach to quantum physics have been independently developed, in analogy with Einstein's [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") of space and time. Relationist physicists such as [John Baez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Baez "John Baez") and [Carlo Rovelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli "Carlo Rovelli") have criticised the leading [unified theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_theory "Unified theory") of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), for retaining absolute space. Some prefer a developing theory of gravity, [loop quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity "Loop quantum gravity"), for its 'backgroundlessness'.

Relationalism (colour theory)
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relationalism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Relationalism (colour theory)")]

Relationalism in [colour theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_theory "Colour theory"), as defended by Jonathan Cohen and others,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-9) means the view that colours of an object are constituted partly in terms of relations with the perceiver. An anti-relationalist view about colour, on the other hand, would insist colours are object-dependent.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-10)

Relationalism (sociological theory)
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relationalism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Relationalism (sociological theory)")]

In [relational sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_sociology "Relational sociology"), relationalism is often contrasted with substantivalism. While substantivalism (also called substantialism) tends to view individuals as self-subsistent entities capable of social interaction, relationalism underscores the social human practices and the individual's transactional contexts and reciprocal relations.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_theory#cite_note-11)[Georg Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel#Dialectical_method "Georg Simmel") was methodologically a relationalist, because he was more interested in the interactions among individuals than the substantial qualities of the individual.
