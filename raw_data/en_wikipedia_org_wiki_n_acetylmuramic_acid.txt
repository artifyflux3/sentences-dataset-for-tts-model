N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound N -Acetylmuramic acid ( NAM or MurNAc ) is an organic compound with the chemical formula C 11 H 19 NO 8 . It is a monomer of peptidoglycan in most bacterial cell walls , which is built from alternating units of N -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N -acetylmuramic acid, cross-linked by oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc.

Formation of NAM [ edit ] NAM is an addition product of phosphoenolpyruvate and N -acetylglucosamine. This addition happens exclusively in the cell cytoplasm .

Clinical significance [ edit ] N -Acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) is part of the peptidoglycan polymer of bacterial cell walls. MurNAc is covalently linked to N -acetylglucosamine and may also be linked through the hydroxyl on carbon number 4 to the carbon of L-alanine . A pentapeptide composed of L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine is added to the MurNAc in the process of making the peptidoglycan strands of the cell wall.

Synthesis of NAM is inhibited by fosfomycin .

[ 1 ] NAG and NAM cross-linking can be inhibited by antibiotics to inhibit pathogens from growing within the body. Therefore, both NAG and NAM are valuable polymers in medicinal research.
