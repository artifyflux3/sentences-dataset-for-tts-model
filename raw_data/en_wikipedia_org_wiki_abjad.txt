For the traditional ordering of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, see [Abjad numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals "Abjad numerals").

An **abjad** ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-1) or **abgad**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-3)) is a [writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system "Writing system") in which only [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant") are represented, leaving the [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") sounds to be inferred by the reader. This contrasts with [alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabets "Alphabets"), which provide [graphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme") for both consonants and vowels. The term was introduced in 1990 by [Peter T. Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._Daniels "Peter T. Daniels").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-4) Other terms for the same concept include **partial phonemic script**, **segmentally linear defective phonographic script**, **consonantary**, **consonant writing**, and **consonantal alphabet**.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-5)

**Impure abjads** represent vowels with either optional [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic"), a limited number of distinct vowel glyphs, or both.

The name _abjad_ is based on the [Arabic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet")'s first (in its [original order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet#Alphabetical_order "Arabic alphabet")) four letters — corresponding to _a_, _b_, _j_, and _d_ — to replace the more common terms "consonantary" and "consonantal alphabet" in describing the family of scripts classified as "[West Semitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Semitic_languages "West Semitic languages")". It is similar to other Semitic languages such as [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet") and [Semitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_alphabet "Semitic alphabet") proto-alphabets: specifically, [aleph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph "Aleph"), [bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter) "Bet (letter)"), [gimel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel "Gimel"), [dalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalet "Dalet").

According to the formulations of [Peter T. Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._Daniels "Peter T. Daniels"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDanielsBright1996-6) abjads differ from [alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic [graphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme"). Abjads differ from [abugidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida "Abugida"), another category defined by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is _implied_ by [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology"), and where [vowel marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") exist for the system, such as [niqqud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud "Niqqud") for [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") and [ḥarakāt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harakat "Harakat") for [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark all vowels (other than the ["inherent" vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_vowel "Inherent vowel")) with a [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic"), a minor attachment to the letter, a standalone [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph"), or (in [Canadian Aboriginal syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics "Canadian Aboriginal syllabics")) by rotation of the letter. Some abugidas use a special symbol to _suppress_ the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a [syllabary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary"), a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.

The contrast of abjad versus alphabet has been rejected by other scholars because _abjad_ is also used as a term for the Arabic numeral system. Also, it may be taken as suggesting that consonantal alphabets, in contrast to e.g. the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"), were not yet true alphabets.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-FOOTNOTELehmann2011-7)[Florian Coulmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Coulmas "Florian Coulmas"), a critic of Daniels and of the abjad terminology, argues that this terminology can confuse alphabets with "transcription systems", and that there is no reason to relegate the Hebrew, Aramaic or Phoenician alphabets to second-class status as an "incomplete alphabet".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-8) However, Daniels's terminology has found acceptance in the linguistic community.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-omniglot-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-11)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Ba%60alat.jpg/330px-Ba%60alat.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ba%60alat.jpg)

A specimen of [Proto-Sinaitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic "Proto-Sinaitic") script containing a phrase which may mean 'to [Baalat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baalat "Baalat")'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads _mt l b c lt_.

The first abjad to gain widespread usage was the [Phoenician abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"). Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script "Cuneiform script") and [Egyptian hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs "Egyptian hieroglyphs"), the Phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and seafaring Phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then-known world.

The Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as _[man'yōgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana "Man'yōgana")_ ([kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji") used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") phonetically before the invention of [kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana "Kana").

Phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems, including the widely used [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet "Aramaic alphabet") abjad and the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"). The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") and [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic "Cyrillic"), while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.

Other sister scripts to Phoenician, that branched from [Proto-Sinaitic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script "Proto-Sinaitic script") are the [South Semitic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Semitic_scripts "South Semitic scripts") with its two main branches; the [Ancient North Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_North_Arabian "Ancient North Arabian") scripts that were used in north and central Arabia, until it was displaced by the [Arabic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-12) and [Ancient South Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_South_Arabian_script "Ancient South Arabian script"), which evolved later into the [Geʽez script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script "Geʽez script"), still being used in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

_Al-ʻArabiyya_, meaning "Arabic": an example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad

Impure abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDaniels2013-13) However, most modern abjads, such as [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet"), [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet "Aramaic alphabet"), and [Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_alphabet "Pahlavi alphabet"), are "impure" abjads– that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes, although the said non-diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants, particularly [approximants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant_consonant "Approximant consonant") that sound similar to long vowels. A "pure" abjad is exemplified (perhaps) by very early forms of ancient [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"), though at some point (at least by the 9th century BC) it and most of the contemporary Semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers, called _[matres lectionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater\_lectionis "Mater lectionis")_.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#cite_note-FOOTNOTELipi%C5%84ski1994-14) This practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times.

In the 9th century BC the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the [guttural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttural_consonant "Guttural consonant") sounds represented by _[aleph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph "Aleph")_, _[he](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He\_(letter) "He (letter)")_, _[heth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth\_(letter) "Heth (letter)")_ or _[ayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin "Ayin")_, so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters _[waw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waw\_(letter) "Waw (letter)")_ and _[yod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodh "Yodh")_ were also adapted into vowel signs; along with _he_, these were already used as _[matres lectionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater\_lectionis "Mater lectionis")_ in Phoenician. The major innovation of Greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants (as opposed to syllabaries such as [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B "Linear B") which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables).

[Abugidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida "Abugida") developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent "a" vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the [South Arabian abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Arabian_script "South Arabian script") evolved into the [Geʽez script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script "Geʽez script") of Ethiopia between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, the [Brāhmī abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C4%81hm%C4%AB_script "Brāhmī script") of the Indian subcontinent developed around the 3rd century BC (from the [Aramaic abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet "Aramaic alphabet"), it has been hypothesized).

Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages
---------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abjad&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages")]

The abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)") structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write. This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from [a root consisting of (usually) three consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triliteral "Triliteral"), the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms. For instance, according to [Classical Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Arabic "Classical Arabic") and [Modern Standard Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic "Modern Standard Arabic"), from the Arabic root ك‌ت‌ب _K-T-B_ (to write) can be derived the forms كَتَبَ_\_kataba\__ (he wrote), كَتَبْتَ_\_katabta\__ (you (masculine singular) wrote), يَكْتُبُ⁩_\_yaktubu\__ (he writes), and مَكْتَبَة⁩_\_maktabah\__ (library). In most cases, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots (especially in conjunction with [context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use) "Context (language use)") clues) and improving word recognition[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abjad#Dubious "Talk:Abjad")_] while reading for practiced readers.

Adaptation for use as true alphabets
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abjad&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Adaptation for use as true alphabets")]

The Arabic abjad have been adapted to perform as [true alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") when used to write several languages, including [Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_language "Kurdish language"), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_Ajami "Swahili Ajami"), [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawi_script "Jawi script"), and [Uyghur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_alphabets "Uyghur alphabets") and historically [Bosnian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arebica "Arebica"), [Mozarabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusi_Romance "Andalusi Romance"), [Aragonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonese_language "Aragonese language"), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language"), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language") and [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Afrikaans "Arabic Afrikaans"), with some letters or letter combinations being repurposed to represent vowels. The Hebrew abjad has also been adapted to write Jewish languages like Ladino and Yiddish.

[doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.2307/602899](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F602899). "We must recognize that the West Semitic scripts constitute a third fundamental type of script, the kind that denotes individual consonants only. It cannot be subsumed under either of the other terms. A suitable name for this type would be alephbeth, in honor of its Levantine origin, but this term seems too similar to alphabet to be practical; so I propose to call this type an "abjad," _[Footnote: I.e., the alif-ba-jim order familiar from earlier Semitic alphabets, from which the modern order alif-ba-ta-tha is derived by placing together the letters with similar shapes and differing numbers of dots. The abjad is the order in which numerical values are assigned to the letters (as in Hebrew).]_ from the Arabic word for the traditional order6 of its script, which (unvocalized) of course falls in this category... There is yet a fourth fundamental type of script, a type recognized over forty years ago by James- Germain Fevrier, called by him the "neosyllabary" (1948, 330), and again by Fred Householder thirty years ago, who called it "pseudo-alphabet" (1959, 382). These are the scripts of Ethiopia and "greater India" that use a basic form for the specific syllable consonant + a particular vowel (in practice always the unmarked a) and modify it to denote the syllables with other vowels or with no vowel. Were it not for this existing term, I would propose maintaining the pattern by calling this type an "abugida," from the Ethiopian word for the auxiliary order of consonants in the signary."

"Daniels (1990, 1996a) proposes the name abjad for these scripts, and this term has gained considerable popularity. Other terms include partial phonemic script (Hill, 1967), segmentally linear defective phonographic script (Faber, 1992), consonantary (Trigger, 2004), consonant writing (Coulmas, 1989) and consonantal alphabet (Gnanadesikan, 2009; Healey, 1990).
