_**The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality**_ (1984) is a [popular mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_mathematics "Popular mathematics") book by [Rudy Rucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Rucker "Rudy Rucker"), an American professor of mathematics and computer science. It provides a popular presentation of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") and [four dimensional geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") as well as some mystical implications. A foreword is provided by [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner "Martin Gardner"), and the 200+ illustrations are by David Povilaitis.

_The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality_ was reprinted in 1985 as the paperback _The Fourth Dimension: A Guided Tour of the Higher Universes_. It was again reprinted in paperback in 2014 by [Dover Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Publications "Dover Publications") with its original subtitle.

Like some of Rucker's other books, _The Fourth Dimension_ is dedicated to [Edwin Abbott Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Abbott_Abbott "Edwin Abbott Abbott"), author of the novella _[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland "Flatland")_.

Synopsis
--------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Fourth_Dimension_(book)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Synopsis")]

_The Fourth Dimension_ teaches readers about the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. Several analogies are made to _Flatland_; in particular, Rucker compares how a square in Flatland would react to a cube in Spaceland to how a cube in Spaceland would react to a [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube "Hypercube") from the fourth dimension.

The book also includes multiple puzzles.

Reception
---------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Fourth_Dimension_(book)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Reception")]

_[Kirkus Reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkus\_Reviews "Kirkus Reviews")_ called it "animated, often amusing", and a "rare treat", but noted that the book eventually leaves mathematical topics behind to focus instead on "mysticism of the all-is-one-one-is-all thinking of an [Ouspensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouspensky "Ouspensky")."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Dimension_(book)#cite_note-Kirkus-1) The _[Quarterly Review of Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterly\_Review\_of\_Biology "Quarterly Review of Biology")_ declared it to be "nice", and "at times (...) enchanting", comparing it to _[The Tao of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tao\_of\_Physics "The Tao of Physics")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Dimension_(book)#cite_note-QRoB-2)
