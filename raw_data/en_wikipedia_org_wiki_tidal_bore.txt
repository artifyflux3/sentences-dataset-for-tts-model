It is a strong tide that pushes up the river, against the current.

Description [ edit ] Bores occur in relatively few locations worldwide, usually in areas with a large tidal range (typically more than 6 meters (20 ft) between high and low tide) and where incoming tides are funneled into a shallow, narrowing river or lake via a broad bay.

[ 2 ] The funnel-like shape not only increases the tidal range, but it can also decrease the duration of the flood tide , down to a point where the flood appears as a sudden increase in the water level. A tidal bore takes place during the flood tide and never during the ebb tide .

Undular bore and whelps near the mouth of Araguari River in northeastern Brazil. The view is oblique towards the mouth from airplane at approximately 30 m (100 ft) altitude.

[ 3 ] A tidal bore may take on various forms, ranging from a single breaking wavefront with a roller — somewhat like a hydraulic jump [ 4 ] [ 5 ] ⁠— to undular bores , comprising a smooth wavefront followed by a train of secondary waves known as whelps .

[ 6 ] Large bores can be particularly unsafe for shipping but also present opportunities for river surfing .

[ 6 ] Two key features of a tidal bore are the intense turbulence and turbulent mixing generated during the bore propagation, as well as its rumbling noise. The visual observations of tidal bores highlight the turbulent nature of the surging waters. The tidal bore induces a strong turbulent mixing in the estuarine zone, and the effects may be felt along considerable distances. The velocity observations indicate a rapid deceleration of the flow associated with the passage of the bore as well as large velocity fluctuations.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] A tidal bore creates a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in the bore front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in the bore roller, sediment erosion beneath the bore front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles. The bore rumble is heard far away because its low frequencies can travel over long distances. The low-frequency sound is a characteristic feature of the advancing roller in which the air bubbles entrapped in the large-scale eddies are acoustically active and play the dominant role in the rumble-sound generation.

[ 9 ] Etymology [ edit ] The word bore derives through Old English from the Old Norse word bára , meaning "wave" or "swell." Effects [ edit ] Tidal bores can be dangerous. Certain rivers such as the Seine in France , the Petitcodiac River in Canada , and the Colorado River in Mexico to name a few, have had a sinister reputation in association with tidal bores. In China, despite warning signs erected along the banks of the Qiantang River , a number of fatalities occur each year by people who take too much risk with the bore.

[ 2 ] The tidal bores affect the shipping and navigation in the estuarine zone, for example, in Papua New Guinea (in the Fly and Bamu Rivers ), Malaysia (the Benak in the Batang Lupar ), and India (the Hooghly River bore).

On the other hand, tidal bore-affected estuaries are rich feeding zones and breeding grounds of several forms of wildlife.

[ 2 ] The estuarine zones are the spawning and breeding grounds of several native fish species, while the aeration induced by the tidal bore contributes to the abundant growth of many species of fish and shrimp (for example in the Rokan River , Indonesia ). The tidal bores also provide opportunity for recreational inland surfing , such as the Seven Ghosts bore on the Kampar River , Indonesia or the Severn Bore on the River Severn , England .

Scientific studies [ edit ] Scientific studies have been carried out at the River Dee [ 10 ] in Wales in the United Kingdom, the Garonne [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and Sélune [ 16 ] in France, the Daly River [ 17 ] in Australia, and the Qiantang River estuary [ 18 ] in China. The force of the tidal bore flow often poses a challenge to scientific measurements, as evidenced by a number of field work incidents in the River Dee, [ 10 ] Rio Mearim, Daly River, [ 17 ] and Sélune River.

[ 16 ] Rivers and bays with tidal bores [ edit ] Rivers and bays that have been known to exhibit bores include those listed below.

The tidal bore is locally known as benak .

[ 19 ] Seine had a significant bore until the 1960s, locally named la barre . Since then, it has been practically eliminated by dredging and river training .

Historically, the Colorado River had a tidal bore up to 6 feet, that extended 47 miles up river.

The Savannah River up to 10 miles (16 km) inland.

[ citation needed ] Small tidal bores, only a few inches in height, have been observed advancing up tidal bayous on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

The bay inlet of the Crissy Field Marsh, in San Francisco, California, can exhibit tidal bores near high tide.

Canada [ edit ] With the Bay of Fundy having the highest tidal range in the world, most rivers draining into the upper bay between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have significant tidal bores. They include: The Petitcodiac River formerly had the highest bore in North America at over 2 metres (6.6 ft) in height, but causeway construction between Moncton and Riverview in the 1960s led to subsequent extensive sedimentation which reduced the bore to little more than a ripple. After considerable political controversy, the causeway gates were opened on April 14, 2010, as part of the Petitcodiac River Restoration Project and the tidal bore began to grow again.

[ 24 ] The restoration of the bore has been sufficient that in July 2013, professional surfers rode a 1 metre (3.3 ft)-high wave 29 kilometres (18.0 mi) up the Petitcodiac River from Belliveau Village to Moncton to establish a new North American record for continuous surfing.

[ 25 ] The Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. When the tidal bore approaches, completely drained riverbeds are filled. It has caused the deaths of several tourists who were in the riverbeds when the bore came in.

[ citation needed ] Tour boat operators offer rafting excursions in the summer.

The bore is fastest and highest on some of the smaller rivers that connect to the bay including the River Hebert and Maccan River on the Cumberland Basin , the St. Croix and Kennetcook rivers in the Minas Basin , and the Salmon River in Truro.

[ 26 ] Mexico [ edit ] Historically, there was a tidal bore on the Gulf of California in Mexico at the mouth of the Colorado River . It formed in the estuary about Montague Island and propagated upstream. It was once very strong, but diversions of the river for irrigation have weakened the flow of the river to the point the tidal bore has nearly disappeared.

South America [ edit ] Brazil [ edit ] Amazon River in Brazil , up to 4 meters (13 ft) high, running at up to 13 mph (21 km/h). It is known locally as the pororoca .

[ 27 ] Mearim River in Brazil Araguari River in Brazil. Very strong in the past, it is considered lost since 2015, due to buffaloes farming, irrigation, and dam construction along the river, leading to substantial loss of water flow.

Venezuela [ edit ] Orinoco River in Venezuela Chile [ edit ] Southern Channels, ex. Canal de Castro, Chiloé Island (fjord of Castro) in Chile Lakes with tidal bores [ edit ] Lakes with an ocean inlet can also exhibit tidal bores.

[ citation needed ] North America [ edit ] Nitinat Lake on Vancouver Island has a sometimes dangerous tidal bore at Nitinat Narrows where the lake meets the Pacific Ocean. The lake is popular with windsurfers due to its consistent winds.

The Qiantang River tidal bore was recorded at two different geographical locations. Characteristic flow patterns were derived and analysed, including temporal changes over a relatively large-scale area. The experimental results showed that the radar-derived celerity and calculated height of the tidal bore were consistent with visual observations in this estuarine zone.
