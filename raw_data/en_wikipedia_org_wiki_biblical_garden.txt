Biblical gardens are cultivated collections of plants that are named in the Bible . They are a type of theme garden that botanical gardens, public parks, and private gardeners maintain.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] They are grown in many parts of the world, with many examples far from the Levant , including the Seinan Gakuin University Biblical Botanical Garden in Fukoka , Japan, and the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis , Missouri, in the United States .

[ 5 ] A list of plants in the Bible includes species of plants mentioned in the Jewish and Christian scriptures . There is considerable uncertainty regarding the identity of some plants mentioned in the Bible, so some Biblical gardens may display more than one candidate species. Other plants with associations to the themes and subjects of the Bible are sometimes also included, especially in areas with different climates. Additionally, some gardens exhibit objects to illustrate Biblical stories or to demonstrate how people lived in Biblical times.
