Hypothetical "loud" aliens expand their sphere of influence rapidly in a highly detectable way; hypothetical "quiet" aliens are hard or impossible to detect.

[ 1 ] A special type of loud alien civilizations are " grabby aliens " who also inhibit the development of other technological civilizations in their sphere of influence.
