Distances between vertices of a double unit cube are square roots of the first six natural numbers due to the Pythagorean theorem (√7 is not possible due to Legendre's three-square theorem) The first numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares (i.e. numbers that can be expressed as n = 4 a ( 8 b + 7 ) {\displaystyle n=4^{a}(8b+7)} ) are 7, 15, 23, 28, 31, 39, 47, 55, 60, 63, 71 ... (sequence A004215 in the OEIS ).

[ 1 ] N. Beguelin noticed in 1774 [ 2 ] that every positive integer which is neither of the form 8 n + 7, nor of the form 4 n , is the sum of three squares, but did not provide a satisfactory proof.

[ 3 ] In 1796 Gauss proved his Eureka theorem that every positive integer n is the sum of 3 triangular numbers ; this is equivalent to the fact that 8 n + 3 is a sum of three squares. In 1797 or 1798 A.-M. Legendre obtained the first proof of his 3 square theorem.

[ 4 ] In 1813, A. L. Cauchy noted [ 5 ] that Legendre's theorem is equivalent to the statement in the introduction above. Previously, in 1801, Gauss had obtained a more general result, [ 6 ] containing Legendre's theorem of 1797–8 as a corollary. In particular, Gauss counted the number of solutions of the expression of an integer as a sum of three squares, and this is a generalisation of  yet another result of Legendre, [ 7 ] whose proof is incomplete. This last fact appears to be the reason for later incorrect claims according to which Legendre's proof of the three-square theorem was defective and had to be completed by Gauss.

[ 8 ] With Lagrange's four-square theorem and the two-square theorem of Girard, Fermat and Euler, the Waring's problem for k = 2 is entirely solved.

Proofs [ edit ] The "only if" of the theorem  is simply because modulo 8, every square is congruent to 0, 1 or 4. There are several proofs of the converse (besides Legendre's proof). One of them is due to Dirichlet (in 1850), and has become classical.

[ 9 ] It requires three main lemmas: the quadratic reciprocity law, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions , and the equivalence class of the trivial ternary quadratic form .

Relationship to the four-square theorem [ edit ] This theorem can be used to prove Lagrange's four-square theorem , which states that all natural numbers can be written as a sum of four squares. Gauss [ 10 ] pointed out that the four squares theorem follows easily from the fact that any positive integer that is 1 or 2 mod 4 is a sum of 3 squares, because any positive integer not divisible by 4 can be reduced to this form by subtracting 0 or 1 from it.
However, proving the three-square theorem is considerably more difficult than a direct proof of the four-square theorem that does not use the three-square theorem. Indeed, the four-square theorem was proved earlier, in 1770.
