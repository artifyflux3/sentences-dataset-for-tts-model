Weeks is a 1999 MacArthur Fellow .

Biography [ edit ] Weeks received his BA from Dartmouth College in 1978, and his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1985, under the supervision of William Thurston .  Since then he has taught at Stockton State College , Ithaca College , and Middlebury College , but has spent much of his time as a free-lance mathematician.

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] Weeks' research contributions have mainly been in the field of 3-manifolds and physical cosmology .

The Weeks manifold , discovered in 1985 by Weeks, is the hyperbolic 3-manifold with the minimum possible volume. Weeks has written various computer programs to assist in mathematical research and mathematical visualization . His SnapPea program is used to study hyperbolic 3-manifolds , while he has also developed interactive software to introduce these ideas to middle-school, high-school, and college students.

Weeks is particularly interested in using topology to understand the spatial universe.

[ 2 ] His book The Shape of Space: How to Visualize Surfaces and Three-dimensional Manifolds (Marcel Dekker, 1985, ISBN 0-8247-7437-X ) explores the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The second edition (2002, ISBN 0-8247-0709-5 ) explains some of his work in applying the material to cosmology.

[ 5 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Weeks became a MacArthur Fellow in 1999.

[ 6 ] In 2007, he won the Levi L. Conant Prize for his expository paper, "The Poincaré Dodecahedral Space and the Mystery of the Missing Fluctuations" ( Notices of the AMS 2004), [ 7 ] and in 2008 he gave the first Levi Conant Lecture at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute , [ 1 ] where Conant was head of the Mathematics Department from 1908 until his untimely death.
