It publishes journals , organizes conferences and exhibitions , and carries out charitable activities.

History [ edit ] Optica was founded in 1916 as the Optical Society of America, under the leadership of Perley G. Nutting , [ 3 ] with 30 optical scientists and instrument makers based in Rochester, New York . It soon published its first journal of research results and established an annual meeting.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The group's Journal of the Optical Society of America was created in 1918.

[ 5 ] The first series of joint meetings with the American Physical Society took place in 1918.

[ 5 ] In 2008, it changed its name to the Optical Society.

[ 6 ] In September 2021, the organization's name changed to Optica, in reference to the organization's journal by the same name and geographic neutrality to reflect the society's global membership.

[ 7 ] In 2024, following an employee whistleblower complaint, Bloomberg News reported that the Optica Foundation Challenge was funded entirely by Huawei .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In response, the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology launched a probe and Optica announced that it would no longer accept money from Huawei, remove the company's representation on a panel of judges, return donations made by Huawei from 2022 onward, and remove Elizabeth A. Rogan as CEO.
