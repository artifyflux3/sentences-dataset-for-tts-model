The name comes from Edward Charles Pickering [ 1 ] and Alfred Fowler .

[ 2 ] The lines are produced by transitions from a higher energy level of an electron to a level with principal quantum number n = 4. The lines have wavelengths: 10124 Å ( n = 5 to n = 4) (infrared) 6560 Å ( n = 6 to n = 4) 5412 Å ( n = 7 to n = 4) 4859 Å ( n = 8 to n = 4) 4541 Å ( n = 9 to n = 4) 4339 Å ( n = 10 to n = 4) 3645.56 Å ( n = ∞ to n = 4, theoretical limit, ultraviolet) The transitions from the even-n states overlap with hydrogen lines and are therefore masked in typical absorption stellar spectra.  However, they are seen in emission in the spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars, as these stars have little or no hydrogen.

In 1896, Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star Zeta Puppis .

[ 3 ] Pickering attributed the observation to a new form of hydrogen with half-integer transition levels.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Fowler managed to produce similar lines from a hydrogen–helium mixture in 1912, and supported Pickering's conclusion as to their origin.

[ 6 ] Niels Bohr , however, included an analysis of the series in his 'trilogy' [ 7 ] [ 8 ] on atomic structure [ 9 ] and concluded that Pickering and Fowler were wrong and that the spectral lines arise instead from singly ionised helium , He + .

[ 10 ] Fowler was initially skeptical [ 11 ] but was ultimately convinced [ 12 ] that Bohr was correct, [ 7 ] and by 1915 "spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium." [ 1 ] [ 13 ] Bohr's theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for "a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories" and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.

[ 1 ] Wavelength formula [ edit ] Main article: Rydberg formula The energy differences between levels in the Bohr model, and hence the wavelengths of emitted or absorbed photons, is given by the Rydberg formula: [ 14 ] 1 λ λ = Z 2 R M ( 1 n 1 2 − − 1 n 2 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\lambda }}=Z^{2}R_{M}\left({\frac {1}{{n_{1}}^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{{n_{2}}^{2}}}\right)} where Z {\displaystyle Z} is the atomic number , n 1 {\displaystyle n_{1}} is the principal quantum number of the lower energy level, n 2 {\displaystyle n_{2}} is the principal quantum number of the upper energy level, and R M {\displaystyle R_{M}} is the Rydberg constant for a nucleus of mass M {\displaystyle M} . It follows R M = μ μ m e R ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle R_{M}={\frac {\mu }{m_{e}}}R_{\infty }} with μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } the reduced mass of the nucleus and R ∞ ∞ = m e q e 4 64 π π 3 ε ε 0 2 ℏ ℏ 3 c {\displaystyle R_{\infty }={\frac {m_{e}{q_{e}}^{4}}{64\pi ^{3}{\varepsilon _{0}}^{2}\hbar ^{3}c}}} is Rydberg constant .

For helium, Z = 2 {\displaystyle Z=2} , the Pickering-Fowler series is for n 1 = 4 {\displaystyle n_{1}=4} and the reduced mass for 2 4 He + {\displaystyle {}_{2}^{4}{\text{He}}^{+}} is μ μ = 1 1 m e + 1 2 m p + 2 m n {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {1}{{\frac {1}{m_{e}}}+{\frac {1}{2m_{p}+2m_{n}}}}}} thus μ μ m e = 1 1 + m e 2 m p + 2 m n ≈ ≈ 0.99986396 {\displaystyle {\frac {\mu }{m_{e}}}={\frac {1}{1+{\frac {m_{e}}{2m_{p}+2m_{n}}}}}\approx 0.99986396} , which is usually approximated as 1 {\displaystyle 1} (in fact, although this number changes for each isotope of helium , it is approximately constant). A more accurate description may be used with the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom.

The theoretical limit for the wavelength in the Pickering-Fowler is given by: λ λ ∞ ∞ PF = 4 R ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \lambda _{\infty }^{\text{PF}}={\frac {4}{R_{\infty }}}} , which is approximatedly 364.556 nm, which is the same limit as in the Balmer series ( hydrogen spectral series for n 2 = 2 {\displaystyle n_{2}=2} ). Notice how the transitions in the Pickering-Fowler series for n=6,8,10 (6560Å ,4859Å and 4339Å respectively), are nearly identical to the transitions in the Balmer series for n=3,4,5 (6563Å ,4861Å and 4340Å respectively). The fact that the Pickering-Fowler series has entries inbetween those values, led scientist to believe it was due to hydrogen with half transitions ("half-hydrogen"). However, Niels Bohr showed, using his model, it was due to the singly ionised helium 2 He + {\displaystyle {}_{2}{\text{He}}^{+}} , a hydrogen-like atom . This also shows the predictability of Bohr model.
