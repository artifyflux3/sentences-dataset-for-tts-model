A one-dimensional GRF is also called a Gaussian process .  An important special case of a GRF is the Gaussian free field .

With regard to applications of GRFs, the initial conditions of physical cosmology generated by quantum mechanical fluctuations during cosmic inflation are thought to be a GRF with a nearly scale invariant spectrum.

[ 1 ] Construction [ edit ] One way of constructing a GRF is by assuming that the field is the sum of a large number of plane, cylindrical or spherical waves with uniformly distributed random phase.  Where applicable, the central limit theorem dictates that at any point, the sum of these individual plane-wave contributions will exhibit a Gaussian distribution.  This type of GRF is completely described by its power spectral density , and hence, through the Wiener–Khinchin theorem , by its two-point autocorrelation function , which is related to the power spectral density through a Fourier transformation.

Suppose f ( x ) is the value of a GRF at a point x in some D -dimensional space. If we make a vector of the values of f at N points, x 1 , ..., x N , in the D -dimensional space, then the vector ( f ( x 1 ), ..., f ( x N )) will always be distributed as  a multivariate Gaussian.
