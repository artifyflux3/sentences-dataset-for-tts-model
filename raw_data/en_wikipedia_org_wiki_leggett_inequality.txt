(As published by Leggett, the inequalities were exemplified in terms of relative angles of elliptical and linear polarizations .) Inequalities [ edit ] They are fulfilled by a large class of physical theories based on particular non-local and realistic assumptions, that may be considered to be plausible or intuitive according to common physical reasoning .

The Leggett inequalities are violated by quantum mechanical theory . The results of experimental tests in 2007 and 2010 have shown agreement with quantum mechanics rather than the Leggett inequalities.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Given that experimental tests of Bell's inequalities have ruled out local realism in quantum mechanics, the violation of Leggett's inequalities is considered to have falsified realism in quantum mechanics.

[ 4 ] In quantum mechanics "realism" means "notion that physical systems possess complete sets of definite values for various parameters prior to, and independent of, measurement".
