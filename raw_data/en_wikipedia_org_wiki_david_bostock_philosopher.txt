[ 3 ] Having read Literae Humaniores at St John's College, Oxford , and after stipendiary posts at Leicester University (1963), the Australian National University at Canberra (1964) and Harvard University (1967), Bostock served as a Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at Merton College, Oxford between 1968 and his retirement in 2004.

[ 6 ] Reputation [ edit ] Following Bostock's death, a contemporary philosopher wrote of him: His philosophical breadth was great, and his work was always characterised by clarity and precision. It was presented in a way that compelled the reader's interest – very often the reader's consent as well … he continued to think about philosophical issues until perhaps a year before he died. Then he decided that he had not read enough literature, and undertook a programme of reading all the books on his bookshelves, in the order in which they happened to have been placed.
