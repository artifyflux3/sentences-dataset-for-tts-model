He studied meteorology at the University of California, Los Angeles and wrote his Master thesis An investigation of the inversion-cloud regime over the subtropical waters west of California in 1966. In 1973 he developed the Dvorak technique to analyze tropical cyclones from satellite imagery .

[ 1 ] He worked with the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service . He lived in Ojai, California , until his death on September 19, 2022.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Dvorak's most influential work was the creation of the Dvorak technique , a method of estimating tropical cyclone intensity using infrared satellite. The Dvorak technique is credited as "fundamentally [enhancing] the ability to monitor tropical cyclones on a global scale." [ 7 ] The method provides an invaluable tool in monitoring these systems given the limitations of direct measurements on such a vast scale.

[ 7 ] Dvorak married Joanne Foyola Schafroth in Los Angeles in January 1958.

[ 5 ] He died on September 19, 2022, at the age of 93.
