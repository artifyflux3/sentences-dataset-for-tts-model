The Riemann curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry can be considered as a special case.

Definition [ edit ] Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , and P → B be a principal G -bundle .  Let ω be an Ehresmann connection on P (which is a g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued one-form on P ).

Then the curvature form is the g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} -valued 2-form on P defined by Ω Ω = d ω ω + 1 2 [ ω ω ∧ ∧ ω ω ] = D ω ω .

{\displaystyle \Omega =d\omega +{1 \over 2}[\omega \wedge \omega ]=D\omega .} (In another convention, 1/2 does not appear.) Here d {\displaystyle d} stands for exterior derivative , [ ⋅ ⋅ ∧ ∧ ⋅ ⋅ ] {\displaystyle [\cdot \wedge \cdot ]} is defined in the article " Lie algebra-valued form " and D denotes the exterior covariant derivative . In other terms, [ 1 ] Ω Ω ( X , Y ) = d ω ω ( X , Y ) + 1 2 [ ω ω ( X ) , ω ω ( Y ) ] {\displaystyle \,\Omega (X,Y)=d\omega (X,Y)+{1 \over 2}[\omega (X),\omega (Y)]} where X , Y are tangent vectors to P .

There is also another expression for Ω: if X , Y are horizontal vector fields on P , then [ 2 ] σ σ Ω Ω ( X , Y ) = − − ω ω ( [ X , Y ] ) = − − [ X , Y ] + h [ X , Y ] {\displaystyle \sigma \Omega (X,Y)=-\omega ([X,Y])=-[X,Y]+h[X,Y]} where hZ means the horizontal component of Z , on the right we identified a vertical vector field and a Lie algebra element generating it ( fundamental vector field ), and σ σ ∈ ∈ { 1 , 2 } {\displaystyle \sigma \in \{1,2\}} is the inverse of the normalization factor used by convention in the formula for the exterior derivative .

A connection is said to be flat if its curvature vanishes: Ω = 0. Equivalently, a connection is flat if the structure group can be reduced to the same underlying group but with the discrete topology.

Curvature form in a vector bundle [ edit ] If E → B is a vector bundle, then one can also think of ω as a matrix of 1-forms and the above formula becomes the structure equation of E. Cartan: Ω Ω = d ω ω + ω ω ∧ ∧ ω ω , {\displaystyle \,\Omega =d\omega +\omega \wedge \omega ,} where ∧ ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } is the wedge product . More precisely, if ω ω i j {\displaystyle {\omega ^{i}}_{j}} and Ω Ω i j {\displaystyle {\Omega ^{i}}_{j}} denote components of ω and Ω correspondingly, (so each ω ω i j {\displaystyle {\omega ^{i}}_{j}} is a usual 1-form and each Ω Ω i j {\displaystyle {\Omega ^{i}}_{j}} is a usual 2-form) then Ω Ω j i = d ω ω i j + ∑ ∑ k ω ω i k ∧ ∧ ω ω k j .

{\displaystyle \Omega _{j}^{i}=d{\omega ^{i}}_{j}+\sum _{k}{\omega ^{i}}_{k}\wedge {\omega ^{k}}_{j}.} For example, for the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold , the structure group is O( n ) and Ω is a 2-form with values in the Lie algebra of O( n ), i.e. the antisymmetric matrices . In this case the form Ω is an alternative description of the curvature tensor , i.e.

R ( X , Y ) = Ω Ω ( X , Y ) , {\displaystyle \,R(X,Y)=\Omega (X,Y),} using the standard notation for the Riemannian curvature tensor.

Bianchi identities [ edit ] See also: Contracted Bianchi identities See also: Riemann curvature tensor § Symmetries and identities If θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the canonical vector-valued 1-form on the frame bundle , the torsion Θ Θ {\displaystyle \Theta } of the connection form ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the vector-valued 2-form defined by the structure equation Θ Θ = d θ θ + ω ω ∧ ∧ θ θ = D θ θ , {\displaystyle \Theta =d\theta +\omega \wedge \theta =D\theta ,} where as above D denotes the exterior covariant derivative .

The first Bianchi identity takes the form D Θ Θ = Ω Ω ∧ ∧ θ θ .

{\displaystyle D\Theta =\Omega \wedge \theta .} The second Bianchi identity takes the form D Ω Ω = 0 {\displaystyle \,D\Omega =0} and is valid more generally for any connection in a principal bundle .

The Bianchi identities can be written in tensor notation as: R a b m n ; ℓ ℓ + R a b ℓ ℓ m ; n + R a b n ℓ ℓ ; m = 0.

{\displaystyle R_{abmn;\ell }+R_{ab\ell m;n}+R_{abn\ell ;m}=0.} The contracted Bianchi identities are used to derive the Einstein tensor in the Einstein field equations , a key component in the general theory of relativity .

[ clarification needed ] Notes [ edit ] ^ since [ ω ω ∧ ∧ ω ω ] ( X , Y ) = 1 2 ( [ ω ω ( X ) , ω ω ( Y ) ] − − [ ω ω ( Y ) , ω ω ( X ) ] ) {\displaystyle [\omega \wedge \omega ](X,Y)={\frac {1}{2}}([\omega (X),\omega (Y)]-[\omega (Y),\omega (X)])} . Here we use also the σ σ = 2 {\displaystyle \sigma =2} Kobayashi convention  for the exterior derivative of a one form which is then d ω ω ( X , Y ) = 1 2 ( X ω ω ( Y ) − − Y ω ω ( X ) − − ω ω ( [ X , Y ] ) ) {\displaystyle d\omega (X,Y)={\frac {1}{2}}(X\omega (Y)-Y\omega (X)-\omega ([X,Y]))} ^ Proof: σ σ Ω Ω ( X , Y ) = σ σ d ω ω ( X , Y ) = X ω ω ( Y ) − − Y ω ω ( X ) − − ω ω ( [ X , Y ] ) = − − ω ω ( [ X , Y ] ) .

{\displaystyle \sigma \Omega (X,Y)=\sigma d\omega (X,Y)=X\omega (Y)-Y\omega (X)-\omega ([X,Y])=-\omega ([X,Y]).} References [ edit ] Shoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu (1963) Foundations of Differential Geometry , Vol.I, Chapter 2.5 Curvature form and structure equation, p 75, Wiley Interscience .
