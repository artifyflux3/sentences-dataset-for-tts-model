It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had representation in parliament.

Terminology [ edit ] In New Zealand, the term " liberalism " has been used by a large variety of groups and organisations, but usually refers to a support for individual liberties and limited government. The term is generally used only with a reference to a particular policy area, e.g. "market liberalism" or "social liberalism". In its extreme form it can be known as " libertarianism ", although this term is used less in New Zealand than in some other countries. Some historians claim that liberalism was a dominant force in New Zealand until around 1936, citing the strong position of the Liberal Party . However, there is (and always was) debate as to whether the Liberal Party was actually liberal—according to some observers, it would be better described as " socialist ", although this was a common accusation made against early 20th century liberals , around the world.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Today, there is no party which is universally recognised as "the party of liberalism", although there are parties which attempt to claim this title— ACT New Zealand , for example, has labelled itself as "the Liberal Party".

[ 4 ] However, both major parties in New Zealand, the Labour Party and the National Party , have incorporated aspects of liberalism into their current agenda, with the former embracing social liberalism and the latter economic liberalism .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Timeline [ edit ] Liberal Party / United Party [ edit ] 1891: John Ballance , upon becoming Prime Minister , founds the Liberal Party .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It is later led by Richard Seddon and Joseph Ward , among others, although some historians contend that none of the later leaders had the same ideological commitment to liberalism as Ballance and his allies.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] 1927: Remnants of the party absorb the United New Zealand Political Organisation, adopting the name " United Party ". The new party is led by George Forbes .

[ 11 ] 1936: The party merges with the conservative Reform Party to form the National Party .

[ 12 ] Democrat Party [ edit ] 1934: Prominent " anti-socialist " political organiser Albert Davy founds the Democrat Party , with a strong focus on economic liberalism.

[ 13 ] 1935: The Democrats capture eight percent of the vote, but no seats.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] New Zealand Party [ edit ] 1983: Bob Jones , a wealthy property tycoon, founds the New Zealand Party to promote both economic and social liberalism. Some consider the party to be mildly libertarian.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] 1984: The New Zealand Party captures twelve percent of the vote, but no seats.
