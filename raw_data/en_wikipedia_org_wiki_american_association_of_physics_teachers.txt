Find sources: "American Association of Physics Teachers" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The American Association of Physics Teachers ( AAPT ) was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics , particularly by way of teaching ." [ 1 ] There are more than 10,000 members in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two peer-reviewed journals , the American Journal of Physics and The Physics Teacher . The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators , including the Richtmyer Memorial Award [ 2 ] and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in College Park, Maryland .

History [ edit ] The American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint APS -AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.

The AAPT became a founding member of the American Institute of Physics after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.

Contests [ edit ] The AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The Physics Bowl , Six Flags ' roller coaster contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long "boot camp". Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the International Physics Olympiad (IPHO).
