[ 1 ] It is available online as a free resource. An earlier version of the encyclopedia appeared as a two-volume book.

[ 2 ] As of March 2024 [update] , the online version of the encyclopedia contains 1043 articles.

Since 2012, the encyclopedia is closely interlinked with the RP Photonics Buyer's Guide , a large directory of photonics product suppliers.

[ 3 ] For the majority of products, there is a one-to-one correspondence between an encyclopedia article and a listing of suppliers for that product.

Other resources linked with the RP Photonics Encyclopedia are a blog named The Photonics Spotlight , [ 4 ] a glossary of photonics terms and acronyms, [ 5 ] various tutorials and case studies, [ 6 ] and a photonics quiz.

[ 7 ] The author is Dr. Rüdiger Paschotta, founder and managing director of RP Photonics AG in Frauenfeld, Switzerland.
