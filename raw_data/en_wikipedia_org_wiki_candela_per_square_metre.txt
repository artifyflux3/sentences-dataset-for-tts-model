For the unit of information entropy, see Nat (unit) .

Candela per square metre Unit system SI Unit of luminance Symbol cd/m 2 In SI base units : cd · m −2 The candela per square metre (symbol: cd/m 2 ) is the unit of luminance in the International System of Units (SI). The unit is based on the candela , the SI unit of luminous intensity , and the square metre , the SI unit of area .

The nit (symbol: nt ) is a deprecated non-SI name also used for this unit (1 nt = 1 cd/m 2 ).

[ 1 ] The term nit is believed to come from the Latin word nitēre , "to shine".

[ 2 ] As a measure of light emitted per unit area, this unit is frequently used to specify the brightness of a display device . The sRGB spec for monitors targets 80 cd/m 2 .

[ 3 ] Typically, monitors calibrated for SDR broadcast or studio color grading should have a brightness of 100 cd/m 2 .

[ 4 ] Most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 cd/m 2 .

[ 5 ] HDR displays range from around 400 to 2500 cd/m 2 .

^ Standards organizations recommend that photometric quantities be denoted with a subscript "v" (for "visual") to avoid confusion with radiometric or photon quantities. For example: USA Standard Letter Symbols for Illuminating Engineering USAS Z7.1-1967, Y10.18-1967 ^ a b c Alternative symbols sometimes seen: W for luminous energy, P or F for luminous flux, and ρ for luminous efficacy of a source.
