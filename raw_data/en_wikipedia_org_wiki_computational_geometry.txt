From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Computational geometry** is a branch of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") devoted to the study of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that can be stated in terms of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"). Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with a history stretching back to antiquity.

[Computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms "Analysis of algorithms") is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between _O_(_n_ 2) and _O_(_n_ log _n_) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") and computer-aided design and manufacturing ([CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design")/[CAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing "Computer-aided manufacturing")), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from [mathematical visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_visualization "Mathematical visualization").

Other important applications of computational geometry include [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics") ([motion planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning "Motion planning") and visibility problems), [geographic information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system "Geographic information system") (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") design (IC geometry design and verification), [computer-aided engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering "Computer-aided engineering") (CAE) (mesh generation), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") ([3D reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction "3D reconstruction")).

The main branches of computational geometry are:

*   _Combinatorial computational geometry_, also called _algorithmic geometry_, which deals with geometric objects as [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics") entities. A groundlaying book in the subject by [Preparata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_P._Preparata "Franco P. Preparata") and [Shamos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ian_Shamos "Michael Ian Shamos") dates the first use of the term "computational geometry" in this sense by 1975.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry#cite_note-PS-1)
*   _Numerical computational geometry_, also called _machine geometry_, _[computer-aided geometric design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided\_geometric\_design "Computer-aided geometric design")_ (CAGD), or _[geometric modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\_modeling "Geometric modeling")_, which deals primarily with representing real-world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in CAD/CAM systems. This branch may be seen as a further development of [descriptive geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_geometry "Descriptive geometry") and is often considered a branch of computer graphics or CAD. The term "computational geometry" in this meaning has been in use since 1971.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry#cite_note-2)

Although most algorithms of computational geometry have been developed (and are being developed) for electronic computers, some algorithms were developed for unconventional computers (e.g. optical computers [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry#cite_note-YK-3))

Combinatorial computational geometry
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computational_geometry&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Combinatorial computational geometry")]

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") and [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon"), [polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"), etc.

Some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"). Consider, for example, the _[closest pair problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest\_pair\_problem "Closest pair problem")_:

*   Given _n_ points in the plane, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.

One could compute the distances between all the pairs of points, of which there are _n_(_n_ − 1)/2, then pick the pair with the smallest distance. This [brute-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search "Brute-force search") algorithm takes [_O_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")(_n_ 2) time; i.e. its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points. A classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes _O_(_n_ log _n_). [Randomized algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm "Randomized algorithm") that take _O_(_n_) expected time,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry#cite_note-4) as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes _O_(_n_ log log _n_) time,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry#cite_note-5) have also been discovered.

The core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways, according to various criteria. The following general classes may be distinguished.

In the problems of this category, some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found. Some fundamental problems of this type are:

*   [Convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull "Convex hull"): Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points.
*   [Line segment intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment_intersection "Line segment intersection"): Find the intersections between a given set of line segments.
*   [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation "Delaunay triangulation")
*   [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram "Voronoi diagram"): Given a set of points, partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points.
*   [Linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming "Linear programming")
*   [Closest pair of points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points "Closest pair of points"): Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.
*   Farthest pair of points
*   [Largest empty circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_empty_circle "Largest empty circle"): Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them.
*   [Euclidean shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_shortest_path "Euclidean shortest path"): Connect two points in a Euclidean space (with polyhedral obstacles) by a shortest path.
*   [Polygon triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_triangulation "Polygon triangulation"): Given a polygon, partition its interior into triangles
*   [Mesh generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_generation "Mesh generation")
*   [Boolean operations on polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operations_on_polygons "Boolean operations on polygons")

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space (computer memory) required to solve a given problem instance.

#### Geometric query problems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computational_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Geometric query problems")]

In _geometric query problems_, commonly known as _geometric search problems_, the input consists of two parts: the search space part and the [query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_(complexity) "Query (complexity)") part, which varies over the problem instances. The search space typically needs to be [preprocessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pre-processing "Data pre-processing"), in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently.

Some fundamental geometric query problems are:

*   [Range searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_searching "Range searching"): Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region.
*   [Point location problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_location_problem "Point location problem"): Given a partitioning of the space into cells, produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located.
*   [Nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_search "Nearest neighbour search"): Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently find which point is closest to a query point.
*   [Ray tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics) "Ray tracing (graphics)"): Given a set of objects in space, produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first.

If the search space is fixed, the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by:

*   the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*   the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer queries.

For the case when the search space is allowed to vary, see _[§Dynamic problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational\_geometry#Dynamic\_problems)_.

Yet another major class is the [dynamic problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_problem_(algorithms) "Dynamic problem (algorithms)"), in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve [dynamic data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_data_structures "Dynamic data structures"). Any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one, at the cost of increased processing time. For example, the [range searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_searching "Range searching") problem may be converted into the [dynamic range searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_range_searching&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dynamic range searching (page does not exist)") problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points. The [dynamic convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_convex_hull "Dynamic convex hull") problem is to keep track of the convex hull, e.g., for the dynamically changing set of points, i.e., while the input points are inserted or deleted.

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by:

*   the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*   the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space
*   the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer a query.

Some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem.

*   [Point in polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon "Point in polygon"): Decide whether a point is inside or outside a given polygon.

In many applications this problem is treated as a single-shot one, i.e., belonging to the first class. For example, in many applications of [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(graphical_user_interfaces) "Pointer (graphical user interfaces)"). However, in some applications, the polygon in question is invariant, while the point represents a query. For example, the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft, and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border. Finally, in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics, in [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design") applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures, which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries.

In some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries, which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates. For example, in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of _N_ queries, rather than for a single query.
