For any cardinal number κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } , the κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } -hedgehog space is formed by taking the disjoint union of κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } real unit intervals identified at the origin (though its topology is not the quotient topology , but that defined by the metric below). Each unit interval is referred to as one of the hedgehog's spines.

A κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } -hedgehog space is sometimes called a hedgehog space of spininess κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } .

The hedgehog space is a metric space , when endowed with the hedgehog metric d ( x , y ) = | x − − y | {\displaystyle d(x,y)=\left|x-y\right|} if x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} lie in the same spine, and by d ( x , y ) = | x | + | y | {\displaystyle d(x,y)=\left|x\right|+\left|y\right|} if x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} lie in different spines. Although their disjoint union makes the origins of the intervals distinct, the metric makes them equivalent by assigning them 0 distance.

Hedgehog spaces are examples of real trees .

[ 1 ] Paris metric [ edit ] The metric on the plane in which the distance between any two points is their Euclidean distance when the two points belong to a ray through the origin, and is otherwise the sum of the distances of the two points from the origin, is sometimes called the Paris metric [ 1 ] because navigation in this metric resembles that in the radial street plan of Paris : for almost all pairs of points, the shortest path passes through the center. The Paris metric, restricted to the unit disk , is a hedgehog space where K is the cardinality of the continuum .

Kowalsky's theorem [ edit ] Kowalsky's theorem, named after Hans-Joachim Kowalsky, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] states that any metrizable space of weight κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } can be represented as a topological subspace of the product of countably many κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } -hedgehog spaces.
