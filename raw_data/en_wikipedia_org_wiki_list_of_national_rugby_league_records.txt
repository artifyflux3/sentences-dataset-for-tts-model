Cumberland are listed as the official holders of the wooden spoon by the NRL, [ 1 ] but a commonly held view is that they received an extra bye due to missing the first round, which would place Western Suburbs last on the ladder.

Due to salary cap breaches Canterbury were deducted 37 competition points and relegated to the bottom of the ladder for the 2002 season. South Sydney won the fewest games that season.

Due to salary cap breaches Melbourne weren't able to receive any points in the 2010 season, guaranteeing them the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the fewest games that season.
