Macedonian Language codes ISO 639-3 xmk Linguist List xmk Glottolog None Ancient Macedonian was the language of the ancient Macedonians which was either a dialect of Ancient Greek or a separate Hellenic language . It was spoken in the kingdom of Macedonia during the 1st millennium BC and belonged to the Indo-European language family . It gradually fell out of use during the 4th century BC, marginalized by the use of Attic Greek by the Macedonian aristocracy, the Ancient Greek dialect that became the basis of Koine Greek , the lingua franca of the Hellenistic period .

[ 6 ] It became extinct during either the Hellenistic or Roman imperial period, and was entirely replaced by Koine Greek.

[ 7 ] While the bulk of surviving public and private inscriptions found in ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek (and later in Koine Greek), [ 8 ] [ 9 ] fragmentary documentation of a vernacular local variety comes from onomastic evidence , ancient glossaries and recent epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia , such as the Pella curse tablet .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] This local variety is usually classified by scholars as a dialect of Northwest Doric Greek , and occasionally as an Aeolic Greek dialect or a distinct sister language of Greek .

Classification [ edit ] Due to the fragmentary attestation of this dialect or language, various interpretations are possible.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Suggested classifications of ancient Macedonian include: [ 15 ] [ 16 ] A Greek dialect, part of the Northwest Doric group of dialects; pioneered by Friedrich Wilhelm Sturz [ de ] (1808), [ 17 ] and subsequently supported by Olivier Masson (1996), [ 18 ] Michael Meier-Brügger (2003), [ 19 ] Johannes Engels (2010), [ 20 ] J. Méndez Dosuna (2012), [ 21 ] Georgios Babiniotis (2014), [ 22 ] Joachim Matzinger (2016), [ 23 ] Emilio Crespo (2017), [ 11 ] Claude Brixhe (2018), [ 24 ] and M. B. Hatzopoulos (2020).

[ 17 ] A Greek dialect related to, or a version of, Aeolic Greek ; suggested by August Fick (1874), [ 18 ] Otto Hoffmann (1906), [ 18 ] N. G. L. Hammond (1997) [ 25 ] and Ian Worthington (2012).

[ 26 ] A sister language of Greek, according to a scheme in which Macedonian and Greek are the two branches of a Greco-Macedonian subgroup (sometimes called " Hellenic "); [ 13 ] suggested by Georgiev (1966), [ 27 ] Joseph (2001) [ 13 ] and Hamp (2013).

[ 28 ] Properties [ edit ] Because of the fragmentary sources of Ancient Macedonian, only a little is understood about the special features of the language. A notable sound-law is that the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirates (/bʰ, dʰ, gʰ/) sometimes appear as voiced stops /b, d, g/, (written β, δ, γ ), whereas they were generally unvoiced as /pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/ ( φ, θ, χ ) elsewhere in Ancient Greek.

[ 29 ] Macedonian δάνος dánοs (' death ', from PIE * d h enh₂- 'to leave'), compared to Attic θάνατος thánatos Macedonian ἀβροῦτες abroûtes or ἀβροῦϝες abroûwes , compared to Attic ὀφρῦς ophrûs for 'eyebrows' Macedonian Βερενίκη Bereníkē , compared to Attic Φερενίκη Phereníkē , 'bearing victory' (Personal name) Macedonian ἄδραια adraia ('bright weather'), compared to Attic αἰθρία aithría , from PIE * h₂aid h - Macedonian βάσκιοι báskioi (' fasces '), compared to Attic φάσκωλος pháskōlos 'leather sack', from PIE * b h asko According to Herodotus 7.73 ( c.

440 BC ), the Macedonians claimed that the Phryges were called Bryges before they migrated from Thrace to Anatolia (around 8th–7th century BC).

According to Plutarch , Moralia [ 30 ] Macedonians use 'b' instead of 'ph', while Delphians use 'b' in the place of 'p'.

Macedonian μάγειρος mágeiros ('butcher') was a loan from Doric into Attic . Vittore Pisani has suggested an ultimately Macedonian origin for the word, which could then be cognate to μάχαιρα mákhaira ('knife', < PIE * mag h - , 'to fight') [ 31 ] If γοτάν gotán ('pig') is related to the Proto-Hellenic noun *gʷous , and hence to the PIE noun *gʷṓws ('cattle'), this would indicate that the labiovelars were either intact, or merged with the velars, unlike the usual Greek treatment (Attic βοῦς boûs ). Such deviations, however, are not unknown in Greek dialects; compare Laconian Doric (the dialect of Sparta) γλεπ- glep- for common Greek βλεπ- blep- , as well as Doric γλάχων gláchōn and Ionic γλήχων glēchōn for common Greek βλήχων blēchōn .

[ 32 ] A number of examples suggest that voiced velar stops were devoiced, especially word-initially: κάναδοι kánadoi , 'jaws' (< PIE * genu- ); κόμβους kómbous , 'molars' (< PIE * gombh- ); within words: ἀρκόν arkón (Attic ἀργός argós ); the Macedonian toponym Akesamenai , from the Pierian name Akesamenos (if Akesa- is cognate to Greek agassomai , agamai , "to astonish"; cf. the Thracian name Agassamenos ).

In Aristophanes ' The Birds , the form κεβλήπυρις keblēpyris ('red head', the name of a bird, perhaps the goldfinch or redpoll ) is found, [ 33 ] showing a Macedonian-style voiced stop in place of a standard Greek unvoiced aspirate: κεβ(α)λή keb(a)lē versus κεφαλή kephalē ('head'). Emilio Crespo, a researcher at the Autonomous University of Madrid , wrote that "the voicing of voiceless stops and the development of aspirates into voiced fricatives turns out to be the outcome of an internal development of Macedonian as a dialect of Greek" without excluding "the presence of interference from other languages or of any linguistic substrate or adstrate", as also argued by M. Hatzopoulos.

[ 34 ] A number of the Macedonian words, particularly in Hesychius of Alexandria 's lexicon, are disputed (i.e., some do not consider them actual Macedonian words) and some may have been corrupted in the transmission. Thus abroutes may be read as abrouwes ( αβρουϝες ), with tau ( Τ ) replacing a digamma .

[ 35 ] If so, this word would perhaps be encompassable within a Greek dialect; however, others (e.g.

A. Meillet ) see the dental as authentic and think that this specific word would perhaps belong to an Indo-European language different from Greek.

[ citation needed ] A. Panayotou summarizes some features generally identified through ancient texts and epigraphy: [ 36 ] Phonology [ edit ] Occasional development of voiced aspirates (*b h , *d h , *g h ) into voiced stops (b, d, g) (e.g. Βερενίκα, Attic Φερενίκη) Retention of */aː/ (e.g. Μαχάτας), also present in Epirotic [ 37 ] [aː] as a result of contraction between [aː] and [ɔː] Apocope of short vowels in prepositions in synthesis ( παρκαττίθεμαι , Attic παρακατατίθεμαι ) Syncope (hyphairesis) and diphthongization are used to avoid hiatus (e.g.

Θετίμα , Attic Θεοτίμη ; compare with Epirotic Λαγέτα , Doric Λαογἐτα ).

[ 37 ] Occasional retention of the pronunciation [u] of /u(ː)/ in local cult epithets or nicknames ( Κουναγίδας = Κυναγίδας ) Raising of /ɔː/ to /uː/ in proximity to nasal (e.g.

Κάνουν , Attic Κανών ) Simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /iːn/ (γίνομαι, Attic γίγνομαι ) Loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /st h / (> /st/) ( γενέσται , Attic γενέσθαι ) Morphology [ edit ] Ancient Macedonian morphology is shared with ancient Epirus , including some of the oldest inscriptions from Dodona .

[ 38 ] The morphology of the first declension nouns with an -ας ending is also shared with Thessalian (e.g. Epitaph for Pyrrhiadas, Kierion [ 39 ] ).

First-declension masculine and feminine in -ας and -α respectively (e.g.

Πευκέστας , Λαομάγα ) First-declension masculine genitive singular in -α (e.g.

Μαχάτα ) First-declension genitive plural in -ᾶν First person personal pronoun dative singular ἐμίν Temporal conjunction ὁπόκα Possibly, a non-sigmatic nominative masculine singular in the first declension ( ἱππότα , Attic ἱππότης ) Onomastics [ edit ] Anthroponymy [ edit ] M. Hatzopoulos and Johannes Engels summarize the Macedonian anthroponymy (that is names borne by people from Macedonia before the expansion beyond the Axios or people undoubtedly hailing from this area after the expansion) as follows: [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Epichoric (local) Greek names that either differ from the phonology of the introduced Attic or that remained almost confined to Macedonians throughout antiquity Panhellenic (common) Greek names Identifiable non-Greek (Thracian and Illyrian) names Names without a clear Greek etymology that can't however be ascribed to any identifiable non-Greek linguistic group.

Common in the creation of ethnics is the use of -έστης, -εστός especially when derived from sigmatic nouns (ὄρος > Ὀρέστης but also Δῖον > Διασταί).

[ 36 ] Per Engels, the above material supports that Macedonian anthroponymy was predominantly Greek in character.

[ 41 ] Toponymy [ edit ] The toponyms of Macedonia proper are generally Greek, though some of them show a particular phonology and a few others are non-Greek.

Calendar [ edit ] Further information: Ancient Macedonian calendar The Macedonian calendar's origins go back to Greek prehistory . The names of the Macedonian months, just like most of the names of Greek months, are derived from feasts and related celebrations in honor of the Greek gods .

[ 42 ] Most of them combine a Macedonian dialectal form with a clear Greek etymology (e.g Δῐός from Zeus ; Περίτιος from Heracles Peritas (“Guardian”) ; Ξανδικός/Ξανθικός from Xanthos, “the blond” (probably a reference to Heracles); Άρτεμίσιος from Artemis etc.) with the possible exception of one, which is attested in other Greek calendars as well.

[ 42 ] According to Martin P. Nilsson , the Macedonian calendar is formed like a regular Greek one and the names of the months attest the Greek nationality of the Macedonians.

[ 42 ] Epigraphy [ edit ] Macedonian onomastics: the earliest epigraphical documents attesting substantial numbers of Macedonian proper names are the second Athenian alliance decree with Perdiccas II (~417–413 BC), the decree of Kalindoia (~335–300 BC) and seven curse tablets of the 4th century BC bearing mostly names.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Octadrachm of Alexander I of Macedon , early 5th century B.C.

Stater of Perdiccas II of Macedon , mid to late 5th century B.C.

The Pella curse tablet , 4th century B.C.

Binding spell, 4th century B.C., Oraiokastro [ 45 ] Funerary stele, with an epigram on the top, mid 4th century B.C., Vergina About 99% of the roughly 6,300 inscriptions discovered by archaeologists within the confines of ancient Macedonia were written in the Greek language, using the Greek alphabet .

[ 46 ] The legends in all currently discovered coins also in Greek.

[ 46 ] The Pella curse tablet , a text written in a distinct Doric Greek dialect, found in 1986 and dated to between mid to early 4th century BC, has been forwarded as an argument that the ancient Macedonian language was a dialect of North-Western Greek, part of the Doric dialect group.

( April 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A body of idiomatic words has been assembled from ancient sources, mainly from coin inscriptions, and from the 5th century lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria , amounting to about 150 words and 200 proper names, though the number of considered words sometimes differs from scholar to scholar. The majority of these words can be confidently assigned to Greek albeit some words would appear to reflect a dialectal form of Greek. There are, however, a number of words that are not easily identifiable as Greek and reveal, for example, voiced stops where Greek shows voiceless aspirates.

[ 48 ] If abagnon is the proper name for rhodon rose, then it is cognate to Persian باغ bāġ , 'garden', Gothic 𐌱𐌰𐌲𐌼𐍃 bagms 'tree' and Greek bakanon 'cabbage-seed'. Finally, a Phrygian borrowing is highly possible if we think of the famous Gardens of Midas , where roses grow of themselves (see Herodotus 8.138.2, Athenaeus 15.683) ἀβαρκνᾷ abarknai κομᾷ † τὲ Μακεδόνες ( komai ?

Macedonian in Classical sources [ edit ] Further information: Greek historiography Among the references that have been discussed as possibly bearing some witness to the linguistic situation in Macedonia, there is a sentence from a fragmentary dialogue, apparently between an Athenian and a Macedonian, in an extant fragment of the 5th century BC comedy 'Macedonians' by the Athenian poet Strattis (fr. 28), where a stranger is portrayed as speaking in a rural Greek dialect. His language contains expressions such as ὕμμες ὡττικοί for ὑμεὶς ἀττικοί "you Athenians", ὕμμες being also attested in Homer , Sappho ( Lesbian ) and Theocritus ( Doric ), while ὡττικοί appears only in "funny country bumpkin" contexts of Attic comedy.

[ 71 ] Another text that has been quoted as evidence is a passage from Livy (lived 59 BC-14 AD) in his Ab urbe condita (31.29). Describing political negotiations between Macedonians and Aetolians in the late 3rd century BC, Livy has a Macedonian ambassador argue that Aetolians, Acarnanians and Macedonians were "men of the same language".

[ 72 ] This has been interpreted as referring to a shared North-West Greek speech (as opposed to Attic Koiné).

[ 73 ] In another passage, Livy states that an announcement was translated from Latin to Greek for Macedonians to understand.

[ 74 ] Quintus Curtius Rufus , Philotas 's trial [ 75 ] and the statement that the Greek-speaking Branchidae had common language with the Macedonians.

[ 76 ] Over time, "Macedonian" (μακεδονικός), when referring to language (and related expressions such as μακεδονίζειν ; to speak in the Macedonian fashion) acquired the meaning of Koine Greek .

[ 77 ] Contributions to the Koine [ edit ] Further information: Ancient Macedonians As a consequence of the Macedonians' role in the formation of the Koine, Macedonian contributed considerable elements, unsurprisingly including some military terminology (διμοιρίτης, ταξίαρχος, ὑπασπισταί, etc.). Among the many contributions were the general use of the first declension grammar for male and female nouns with an -as ending, attested in the genitive of Macedonian coinage from the early 4th century BC of Amyntas III (ΑΜΥΝΤΑ in the genitive; the Attic form that fell into disuse would be ΑΜΥΝΤΟΥ). There were changes in verb conjugation such as in the Imperative δέξα attested in Macedonian sling stones found in Asiatic battlefields, that became adopted in place of the Attic forms. Koine Greek established a spirantisation of beta, gamma and delta, which has been attributed to the Macedonian influence.

One can only speculate that that [Ancient Macedonian] dialect declined with the rise in use of standard koinē Greek. The main language of formal discourse and official communication became Greek by the fourth century [BC]. Whether the dialect(s) were eventually replaced by standard Greek, or were preserved as part of a two–tiered system of speech—one for official use, the other idiomatic for traditional ceremonies, rituals, or rough soldiers' talk—is problematic and requires more evidence and further study.

However, with respect to the discussion in this chapter it seems to be quite clear that (a) ancient Macedonian at some date during the Hellenistic or Roman imperial era was completely replaced by koine Greek and died out, and (b) that ancient Macedonian has no relationship with modern Macedonian which together with Bulgarian belongs to the eastern branch of southern Slavonic languages.

Family: Ancient Greek is generally taken to be the only representative (though note the existence of different dialects) of the Greek or Hellenic branch of Indo-European. There is some dispute as to whether Ancient Macedonian (the native language of Philip and Alexander), if it has any special affinity to Greek at all, is a dialect within Greek (...) or a sibling language to all of the known Ancient Greek dialects. If the latter view is correct, then Macedonian and Greek would be the two subbranches of a group within Indo-European which could more properly be called Hellenic. Related Languages: As noted above, Ancient Macedonian might be the language most closely related to Greek, perhaps even a dialect of Greek. The slender evidence is open to different interpretations, so that no definitive answer is really possible; but most likely, Ancient Macedonian was not simply an Ancient Greek dialect on a par with Attic or Aeolic (...).
