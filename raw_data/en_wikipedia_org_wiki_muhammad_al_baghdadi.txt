He was the author of a commentary on the tenth book of Euclid 's Elements, which was translated by Gerard of Cremona as Liber judei super decimum Euclidis .

[ 3 ] The work was popular in Europe with several Latin manuscripts still extant.

Other works include: [ 4 ] Jadawil al-Jayb al-Mahlul al-Daqiqa (detailed tables of sines for each minute), Risala fi Taqrib Usul al-Hisab fi' al-Jabr wa-‘l-Muqabala (Treatise on approximation of principles of arithmetic) Kitab al-Tabaqat fi Sharh al-Misaha (book on measurements) Machometus Bagdedinus [ edit ] Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd al-Bāqī has been identified by modern scholars with the Latin name, Machometus Bagdedinus , [ 1 ] although this identification is sometimes disputed.
Machometus Bagdedinus, was an Arab author whose translated work, De superficierum divisionibus liber , contains the only trace of Euclid 's work "On Divisions of Figures" in the Latin tradition. The work was later printed in 1570, edited by John Dee and Federico Commandino .
