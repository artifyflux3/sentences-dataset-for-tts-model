[ 1 ] It lies north of Franz Josef Glacier , and the out-flowing Ōkārito River drains it into the Ōkārito Lagoon .

[ 1 ] It is the 3rd 
largest of the West Coast lakes , a glacier formation from the last ice age .

[ 2 ] Since the water from glacial melts no longer drains into the lake, it is filled with fresh rain water which runs through the surrounding forest floor, collecting tannins , giving it its dark colour.

[ 1 ] As the winds of the region sweep high above the mountains of the Southern Alps , the water is left unruffled and quite reflective of the forest on the lake fringes.
