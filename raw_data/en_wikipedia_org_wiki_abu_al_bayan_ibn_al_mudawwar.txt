He served as court physician to the last Egyptian Fatimid caliphs and later to Saladin , who pensioned him when he was sixty-three years old. He was replaced in his former position by, among others, Maimonides .

During the twenty years of his retirement his house was crowded with pupils; but he refused to see patients at their homes unless they were his friends. One day he was sent for by the emir Izz ad-Din abu-l-'Asakir Sultan ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh (uncle of the historian Usamah ibn Munqidh ), who, on his arrival in Egypt, had fallen sick; ibn al-Mudawwar refused to go until requested to do so by al-Qadi al-Fadil , the private secretary of Saladin.

According to ibn Abi Usaibi'a , ibn al-Mudawwar left works on medical subjects, but they are no longer extant.
