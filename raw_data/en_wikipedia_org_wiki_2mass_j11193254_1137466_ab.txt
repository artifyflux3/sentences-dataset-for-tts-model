The components of 2MASS J1119‚Äì1137 are each roughly four Jupiter masses . The planetary-mass objects are probably a part of the TW Hydrae association which has an age of approximately 10 million years.

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] The planetary-mass objects are candidate rogue planets .

Overview [ edit ] The object was found by a team of scientists from Canada, the United States and Chile during a search for unusually red brown dwarfs (such color indicates some notable properties of their atmospheres, e.g. dustiness). The search used data of 3 surveys: SDSS (visible light data), 2MASS (near-infrared) and WISE (mid-wave infrared).

2MASS J1119‚Äì1137 was one of the reddest and, according to the authors, the most interesting object found. Results of the work were published in December 2015.

[ 6 ] In April 2016, the first detailed study of the object was published. The investigators conducted its infrared spectroscopy on the telescope Gemini South .

Radial velocity and proper motion were also calculated. The astronomers determined low surface gravity and moderate age of 2MASS J1119‚Äì1137 .

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] In November 2016 and March 2017, 2MASS J1119‚Äì1137 was imaged by the telescope Keck II with adaptive optics technique, which revealed its binarity. The angular separation of components is 0.13788 ¬± 0.00034 arcseconds (which corresponds to linear projected separation 3.6 ¬± 0.9 AU ). Their stellar magnitudes are roughly equal. Total mass of the system is estimated as 7.4 +2.5 ‚àí1.9 Jupiter masses . Their total bolometric luminosity is approximately 0.00004 solar units . The estimated orbital period is 90 +80 ‚àí50 years.

[ 3 ] One of the components [ which?

] of the binary is rotating rapidly, having a period of 3.02 +0.04 ‚àí0.03 hours while the typical rotation period for young brown dwarfs is 10 hours.

[ 8 ] Candidate exomoon [ edit ] In August 2021, researchers reported signs of a 1.7 R üú® exomoon (a moon orbiting a planetary-mass object outside the Solar System ) transiting one of the components in 2MASS J1119‚Äì1137 . A possible single transit of the moon candidate was detected in archival Spitzer Space Telescope data. The study determined that the detected event might have been caused by variability (clouds/weather) in the host planet's atmosphere, but that an exomoon was a better fit to the observed data suggesting that the detection was most likely caused by an exomoon transit.
