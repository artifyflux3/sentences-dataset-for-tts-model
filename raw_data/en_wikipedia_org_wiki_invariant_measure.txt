The function may be a geometric transformation . For examples, circular angle is invariant under rotation, hyperbolic angle is  invariant under squeeze mapping , and a difference of slopes is invariant under shear mapping .

[ 1 ] Ergodic theory is the study of invariant measures in dynamical systems . The Krylov‚ÄìBogolyubov theorem proves the existence of invariant measures under certain conditions on the function and space under consideration.

Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} be a measurable space and let f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí X {\displaystyle f:X\to X} be a measurable function from X {\displaystyle X} to itself. A measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } on ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is said to be invariant under f {\displaystyle f} if, for every measurable set A {\displaystyle A} in Œ£ Œ£ , {\displaystyle \Sigma ,} Œº Œº ( f ‚àí ‚àí 1 ( A ) ) = Œº Œº ( A ) .

{\displaystyle \mu \left(f^{-1}(A)\right)=\mu (A).} In terms of the pushforward measure , this states that f ‚àó ‚àó ( Œº Œº ) = Œº Œº .

{\displaystyle f_{*}(\mu )=\mu .} The collection of measures (usually probability measures ) on X {\displaystyle X} that are invariant under f {\displaystyle f} is sometimes denoted M f ( X ) .

{\displaystyle M_{f}(X).} The collection of ergodic measures , E f ( X ) , {\displaystyle E_{f}(X),} is a subset of M f ( X ) .

{\displaystyle M_{f}(X).} Moreover, any convex combination of two invariant measures is also invariant, so M f ( X ) {\displaystyle M_{f}(X)} is a convex set ; E f ( X ) {\displaystyle E_{f}(X)} consists precisely of the extreme points of M f ( X ) .

{\displaystyle M_{f}(X).} In the case of a dynamical system ( X , T , œÜ œÜ ) , {\displaystyle (X,T,\varphi ),} where ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is a measurable space as before, T {\displaystyle T} is a monoid and œÜ œÜ : T √ó √ó X ‚Üí ‚Üí X {\displaystyle \varphi :T\times X\to X} is the flow map, a measure Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } on ( X , Œ£ Œ£ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is said to be an invariant measure if it is an invariant measure for each map œÜ œÜ t : X ‚Üí ‚Üí X .

{\displaystyle \varphi _{t}:X\to X.} Explicitly, Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } is invariant if and only if Œº Œº ( œÜ œÜ t ‚àí ‚àí 1 ( A ) ) = Œº Œº ( A ) for all t ‚àà ‚àà T , A ‚àà ‚àà Œ£ Œ£ .

{\displaystyle \mu \left(\varphi _{t}^{-1}(A)\right)=\mu (A)\qquad {\text{ for all }}t\in T,A\in \Sigma .} Put another way, Œº Œº {\displaystyle \mu } is an invariant measure for a sequence of random variables ( Z t ) t ‚â• ‚â• 0 {\displaystyle \left(Z_{t}\right)_{t\geq 0}} (perhaps a Markov chain or the solution to a stochastic differential equation ) if, whenever the initial condition Z 0 {\displaystyle Z_{0}} is distributed according to Œº Œº , {\displaystyle \mu ,} so is Z t {\displaystyle Z_{t}} for any later time t .

{\displaystyle t.} When the dynamical system can be described by a transfer operator , then the invariant measure is an eigenvector of the operator, corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1 , {\displaystyle 1,} this being the largest eigenvalue as given by the Frobenius‚ÄìPerron theorem .

Examples [ edit ] Squeeze mapping leaves hyperbolic angle invariant as it moves a hyperbolic sector (purple) to one of the same area. Blue and green rectangles also keep the same area Consider the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with its usual Borel œÉ-algebra ; fix a ‚àà ‚àà R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } and consider the translation map T a : R ‚Üí ‚Üí R {\displaystyle T_{a}:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } given by: T a ( x ) = x + a .

{\displaystyle T_{a}(x)=x+a.} Then one-dimensional Lebesgue measure Œª Œª {\displaystyle \lambda } is an invariant measure for T a .

{\displaystyle T_{a}.} More generally, on n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} with its usual Borel œÉ-algebra, n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Lebesgue measure Œª Œª n {\displaystyle \lambda ^{n}} is an invariant measure for any isometry of Euclidean space, that is, a map T : R n ‚Üí ‚Üí R n {\displaystyle T:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} that can be written as T ( x ) = A x + b {\displaystyle T(x)=Ax+b} for some n √ó √ó n {\displaystyle n\times n} orthogonal matrix A ‚àà ‚àà O ( n ) {\displaystyle A\in O(n)} and a vector b ‚àà ‚àà R n .

{\displaystyle b\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} The invariant measure in the first example is unique up to trivial renormalization with a constant factor. This does not have to be necessarily the case: Consider a set consisting of just two points S = { A , B } {\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\{A,B\}} and the identity map T = Id {\displaystyle T=\operatorname {Id} } which leaves each point fixed. Then any probability measure Œº Œº : S ‚Üí ‚Üí R {\displaystyle \mu :\mathbf {S} \to \mathbb {R} } is invariant. Note that S {\displaystyle \mathbf {S} } trivially has a decomposition into T {\displaystyle T} -invariant components { A } {\displaystyle \{A\}} and { B } .

{\displaystyle \{B\}.} Area measure in the Euclidean plane is invariant under the special linear group SL ‚Å° ‚Å° ( 2 , R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {SL} (2,\mathbb {R} )} of the 2 √ó √ó 2 {\displaystyle 2\times 2} real matrices of determinant 1.

{\displaystyle 1.} Every locally compact group has a Haar measure that is invariant under the group action ( translation ).
