Mimoplastic art (also known as attitudes ) is a performance art genre depicting works of art by use of mime , especially gestures and draping. Mimoplastic "attitude" is differentiated from the tableau vivant by its imitation of classical sculpture.

[ 1 ] The genre depicted works of art, particularly classical subjects.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] It was popularized by Emma, Lady Hamilton .

[ 3 ] Hamilton's art form may have developed after modelling for the painter, George Romney .

Goethe wrote in 1787, "with a few shawls (she) gives so much variety to her poses, gestures, expressions etc., that the spectator can hardly believe his eyes... This much is certain: as a performance it is like nothing you ever saw before in your life".

[ 4 ] The art form trended among upperclass European women between 1770 and 1815. They created mimoplastic art in their homes.

[ 5 ] Ida Brun 's attitudes included background music and narratives.

[ 6 ] The literary scholar Henning Fenger (1921-1985), stated that Brun's "mimoplastic art captivated Europe".

[ 7 ] Other notable performers included Henriette Hendel-Schütz [ 8 ] and the only male performer of attitudes, Gustav Anton von Seckendorff .
