A member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Bernstein is best known for his reformist challenge to Marxism known as evolutionary socialism or revisionism , in which he questioned the revolutionary predictions of Karl Marx and advocated for a gradual, parliamentary path to socialism . His political and theoretical work played a significant role in the development of modern social democracy and reformist socialism.

Born into a lower-middle-class Jewish family in Berlin , Bernstein became active in socialist politics in his early twenties. He spent years in exile in Switzerland and London during the period of the Anti-Socialist Laws in Germany, where he became a close associate of Friedrich Engels . During his time in London, his interactions with the reformist Fabian Society and his observation of the stability of late Victorian capitalism led him to question key tenets of orthodox Marxism .

After Engels's death in 1895, Bernstein began to publicly articulate his revisionist views. In his most influential work, The Preconditions of Socialism (1899, also known as Evolutionary Socialism ), he rejected the Hegelian dialectical method and disputed the Marxist predictions of the inevitable collapse of capitalism, the disappearance of the middle class , and the increasing immiseration of the proletariat . Instead, he argued that socialists should work for gradual social and political reforms through democratic institutions. His famous aphorism, "The movement means everything to me and what is usually called 'the final aim of Socialism' is nothing," encapsulated his focus on practical, democratic progress over revolutionary goals.

Although his views were officially condemned by the SPD, which maintained its orthodox Marxist Erfurt Program , the party's practical policies were largely reformist, reflecting the reality Bernstein described. His work sparked major debates within the international socialist movement, pitting him and his supporters against orthodox Marxists like Karl Kautsky and radicals like Rosa Luxemburg . During World War I , Bernstein's principles led him to break with the SPD's pro-war majority and co-found the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), though he rejoined the SPD after the war. He served in the Reichstag during the Weimar Republic , where he continued to advocate for democracy and peace. He died in Berlin in late 1932, weeks before the Nazi seizure of power.

Early life and political beginnings [ edit ] Eduard Bernstein was born in Schöneberg (now part of Berlin ) on 6 January 1850, a time of political reaction in Germany following the failure of the Revolutions of 1848 .

[ 1 ] He was the seventh of fifteen children born to Jakob Bernstein, a railway engineer, and his wife, Johanne.

[ 2 ] His family was of Polish-Jewish origin, though they had been secular for two generations; they celebrated Christmas as a German rather than a religious holiday.

[ 2 ] This environment fostered in Bernstein a skeptical worldview from a young age.

[ 3 ] The family's income was modest, placing them in the "genteel poverty" of the lower middle class, or petty bourgeoisie .

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] His uncle, Aaron Bernstein , was a prominent liberal journalist and the author of popular science books.

[ 5 ] At sixteen, Bernstein left school without finishing Gymnasium due to his family's financial situation and began an apprenticeship at a Berlin bank.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] He worked as a bank clerk from 1869 until 1878, a profession that provided a livelihood but did not capture his primary interests.

[ 6 ] His real education was self-directed, and he developed intellectual pursuits in theatre, poetry, and philosophy.

[ 6 ] Bernstein's political awakening occurred during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. Initially a patriot, he became sympathetic to the anti-war stance of socialist leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht after they were accused of treason.

[ 8 ] In February 1872, after reading works by Ferdinand Lassalle and being particularly impressed by a speech from the socialist agitator Friedrich Fritzsche , Bernstein and his friends joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party , known as the "Eisenachers" for the town where they were founded.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He quickly became a skilled public speaker and an active party member, undertaking grueling speaking tours and engaging in debates with the rival Lassallean socialist party.

[ 11 ] The two most influential books on the young Bernstein were Karl Marx 's The Civil War in France , an exaltation of the Paris Commune , and Eugen Dühring 's Cursus der National- und Sozialökonomie .

[ 12 ] His enthusiasm for Dühring's work proved contagious, and he was instrumental in popularizing Dühring's ideas within the socialist movement, even introducing them to Bebel.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] This early attachment to Dühring's thought, a blend of positivism and idealism , would later be exorcised by Friedrich Engels 's sharp critique, Anti-Dühring .

[ 11 ] Amidst government harassment and internal divisions, the Eisenachers and the Lassalleans recognized the need for unity.

[ 15 ] In 1875, the two factions merged at a congress in Gotha . The twenty-five-year-old Bernstein was a delegate to the preliminary conference and participated in the creation of the unified party, which would become the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The resulting Gotha Program was a compromise between Marxist and Lassallean ideas, which drew a sharp critique from Marx himself.

[ 18 ] Bernstein later acknowledged that the Eisenachers, himself included, had an inadequate grasp of Marxist theory at the time.

[ 19 ] Exile (1878–1901) [ edit ] Bernstein in 1878 In 1878, following two assassination attempts on Emperor Wilhelm I , Chancellor Otto von Bismarck enacted the Anti-Socialist Laws , which banned socialist organizations, meetings, and publications.

[ 20 ] Just before the law took effect, Bernstein accepted an offer to become the private secretary to Karl Höchberg , a wealthy socialist sympathizer, and moved to Zurich , Switzerland, in October 1878. What he expected to be a temporary stay became an exile of over twenty years.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Zurich [ edit ] In Zurich, Bernstein worked with Höchberg on various publishing projects. Their first enterprise, a reprint of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause 's Quintessence of Socialism , aimed to convert the intelligentsia to socialism, a tactic of "permeation" that Marx disdained.

[ 23 ] During this period, Bernstein encountered Engels's Anti-Dühring , a book which he recalled "converted me to Marxism".

[ 23 ] In 1879, Bernstein became embroiled in a controversy that caused serious friction with Marx and Engels, whom he had never met. He had a minor role in the publication of an anonymous article in a new Yearbook for Social Science , financed by Höchberg.

[ 24 ] The article, written by Karl Flesch and revised by Höchberg, criticized the SPD for its proletarian focus and its "hatred of the bourgeoisie".

[ 25 ] Marx and Engels were furious, believing the article represented a bourgeois takeover of the party's organ.

[ 26 ] Engels accused Bernstein of being a key figure in this "trio of Zurichers" and demanded that Höchberg be expelled from the party.

[ 27 ] Despite this incident, the SPD established its official, albeit illegal, newspaper, Der Sozialdemokrat , in Zurich in September 1879.

[ 26 ] Bernstein was active with the paper from the start. Anxious to clear his name with Marx and Engels, he and Bebel traveled to London in December 1880. The visit was a success; Bernstein won the full confidence of the "Londoners", and his relationship with Engels grew into a close friendship and a lifelong correspondence.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] In January 1881, Bernstein was appointed editor of Der Sozialdemokrat .

[ 30 ] Under his leadership, and with Engels as a frequent adviser, the paper became, in Engels's words, "unquestionably the best newspaper this party has ever had." [ 31 ] During his Zurich years, Bernstein became one of the key members of the SPD, and his circle of friends included future socialist luminaries like Karl Kautsky .

[ 31 ] [ 29 ] London [ edit ] Bernstein in 1895 In 1888, under pressure from Bismarck, the Swiss government expelled the staff of Der Sozialdemokrat . Bernstein and his colleagues relocated to London, which became his home for the next thirteen years.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] He continued to edit the paper until the Anti-Socialist Laws lapsed in 1890. With the SPD now able to operate legally in Germany, the exiled paper was no longer needed, and Bernstein, still under indictment in Germany, found himself without his editorial post. He began making a living as a freelance writer and London correspondent for the SPD's new official newspaper, Vorwärts , and Kautsky's theoretical journal, Die Neue Zeit .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] The 1890s were a crucial decade for Bernstein's intellectual development. He spent much of his time in the reading room of the British Museum , the same place Marx had worked for so long.

[ 36 ] He was responsible for the tactical sections of the SPD's new Erfurt Program of 1891, which was largely Marxist in its theoretical sections drafted by Kautsky.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] He also undertook a major historical work, Sozialismus und Demokratie in der grossen englischen Revolution (Socialism and Democracy in the Great English Revolution), published in 1895 as the final volume of The History of Socialism . A pioneering study of the English Civil War from a social and economic perspective, the book was an original contribution to scholarship, particularly for his "discovery" of the communist thinker Gerrard Winstanley .

[ 39 ] His other major work of this period was a highly critical political biography of Ferdinand Lassalle , which aimed to dismantle the "Lassalle Legend" within the German labour movement.

[ 35 ] Throughout his early years in London, Bernstein remained in the shadow of Engels, who was the preeminent authority on Marxism.

[ 40 ] When Engels died in August 1895, he named Bernstein as one of his literary executors, a sign of complete confidence.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] It was only after Engels's death that Bernstein felt free to publicly question the orthodox Marxism he had inherited.

[ 41 ] His time in England had a profound impact on his thinking. He observed a stable, prosperous capitalist society with strong democratic traditions and a reformist, rather than revolutionary, labour movement.

[ 43 ] He also established close relations with English socialists, most notably the Fabian Society , whose leaders included George Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb . While Bernstein later denied that Fabianism was the direct source of his new views, and even criticised their "visionless pragmatism", the Fabians' gradualist, empirical, and ethical approach to socialism undoubtedly reinforced the direction of his own thought.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] Evolutionary socialism [ edit ] Cover of Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (1899), 1906 edition Bernstein's evolutionary socialism, a form of revisionist Marxism , developed from a series of articles he wrote for the SPD's theoretical journal, Die Neue Zeit , between 1896 and 1898, under the title Probleme des Sozialismus ("Problems of Socialism").

[ 46 ] These culminated in his landmark book, Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (1899), translated into English as The Preconditions of Socialism or Evolutionary Socialism . The book created an immediate storm of controversy within the international socialist movement.

[ 47 ] Bernstein's critique of Marxism was comprehensive, targeting its philosophy, economic predictions, and political strategy. His central argument was that the reality of late 19th-century capitalism had diverged significantly from Marx's forecasts. This "moulting", as he called it, required socialists to reconcile their theories with the facts.

[ 48 ] Philosophy [ edit ] Bernstein rejected the Hegelian dialectic that formed the philosophical core of Marxism, viewing it as a "snare" and a "treacherous element" that led to dogmatic and inaccurate predictions.

[ 49 ] He argued that the dialectical method, with its emphasis on contradiction and violent transformation, was a remnant of radical Utopianism that had no place in a scientific socialist movement.

[ 50 ] Instead of dialectical materialism , he advocated for a return to the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and a greater emphasis on ethics .

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] For Bernstein, socialism was not a historical inevitability but an ethical ideal. It was something that ought to be, a goal to be striven for based on a commitment to justice and equality, rather than something that must be as a result of impersonal historical laws.

[ 53 ] This reintroduction of ethics into socialist theory was a direct challenge to Marxist determinism . He famously declared in a response to his critics: I confess openly, I have extraordinarily little interest or taste for what is generally called the 'final goal of Socialism.' This aim, whatever it be, is nothing to me, the movement everything.

[ 46 ] This statement, often taken out of context, was not a rejection of socialist goals but an assertion of the primacy of the democratic and ethical process—the "movement"—over dogmatic adherence to a single, predetermined outcome.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Economics [ edit ] Bernstein's economic revisionism was based on his observation that capitalism was not collapsing but adapting and stabilizing. He presented statistical evidence to refute several key Marxist predictions: Concentration of capital: While Marx predicted that capital would become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, Bernstein argued that the number of property owners was in fact growing, thanks to the rise of joint-stock companies and a more differentiated class structure. He showed that small and medium-sized enterprises were proving resilient, not disappearing as Marx had forecast.

[ 56 ] Collapse theory ( Zusammenbruchstheorie ): Bernstein rejected the idea that capitalism was doomed to collapse through increasingly severe economic crises. He argued that the development of the credit system, cartels , and an improved world market had given capitalism greater adaptability and flexibility, making general crises less likely.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Immiseration theory : The Marxist theory of the "growing misery" of the proletariat was, according to Bernstein, incorrect. He pointed to evidence that the working class in advanced industrial countries was experiencing an improvement in its standard of living.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] He also argued that the middle class was not vanishing but changing its character, with the rise of a "new middle class" of white-collar workers, technicians, and public officials.

[ 61 ] [ 55 ] Politics [ edit ] From this revised analysis of capitalism, Bernstein drew radical conclusions for socialist political strategy. If capitalism was not on the verge of collapse, and if democracy was expanding, then the path to socialism was not revolution but gradual, peaceful, parliamentary reform.

[ 62 ] He argued that the SPD should "dare to appear what it is today: a democratic-Socialist reform party." [ 63 ] Bernstein saw democracy as both the means and the end of socialism.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] He advocated for the expansion of political and economic rights through the existing state, championing trade unions and cooperatives as key "democratic elements in industry".

[ 66 ] He rejected the concept of the " dictatorship of the proletariat " as a "barbarian" and "atavistic" idea, arguing that socialism could only be achieved democratically.

[ 67 ] While he saw the necessity for the mass strike as a defensive weapon to protect democratic rights like the suffrage, he fundamentally believed in the power of gradual, "organic" evolution over violent upheaval.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Return to Germany and political career [ edit ] After the warrant for his arrest was allowed to lapse, Bernstein returned to Germany in February 1901.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] He was now the intellectual leader of a significant, if controversial, movement within the SPD. He was in heavy demand as a public speaker, and in 1902 he was elected to the Reichstag representing the constituency of Breslau -West, a seat he won with broad support from across the party.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] He served in the Reichstag for most of the next three decades (1902–1906, 1912–1918, and 1920–1928).

[ 74 ] In parliament, he specialized in issues of taxation, international trade, and constitutional law.

[ 75 ] His return intensified the "Bernstein Debates" within the SPD. At successive party congresses, particularly the one in Dresden in 1903, his theories were the subject of heated discussion. The party leadership, dominated by Bebel and Kautsky, officially condemned revisionism and reaffirmed the revolutionary goals of the Erfurt Program.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] However, the SPD's day-to-day practice continued to be largely reformist, and Bernstein's views found wide, if often unacknowledged, support, especially among trade union leaders and the party's southern German branches.

[ 78 ] Bernstein himself remained a loyal, though critical, member of the party, continuing to argue for a policy of democratic reform and alliances with progressive elements of the bourgeoisie.

[ 79 ] World War I [ edit ] Bernstein c.

1910s The outbreak of World War I in 1914 confronted Bernstein and the SPD with their most severe test. Bernstein initially accepted the argument that Germany was fighting a defensive war against Tsarist Russia and, with a heavy heart, voted with the SPD majority to approve war credits on 4 August 1914.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] He had been deeply affected by the assassination of his friend, the French socialist leader Jean Jaurès , which he wrongly believed had been engineered by Russian agents.

[ 80 ] However, as documentation of Germany's aggressive war aims came to light, Bernstein's position shifted dramatically. His Anglophile sentiments and his deep commitment to internationalism and truth led him to become a vocal opponent of the war.

[ 82 ] [ 81 ] He began publishing articles denouncing German chauvinism and annexationist ambitions, which isolated him from his former revisionist colleagues and led to the termination of his long collaboration with the Sozialistische Monatshefte .

[ 83 ] [ 84 ] On 20 March 1915, he was among a minority of SPD deputies who left the chamber rather than vote for further war credits.

[ 85 ] In June 1915, he, Kautsky, and Hugo Haase published a manifesto, "The Demand of the Hour", which condemned the war as an imperialist venture.

[ 85 ] [ 84 ] The growing split within the SPD became permanent in March 1916, when Haase and his followers were expelled from the parliamentary party. Bernstein followed them, and in April 1917, he became a founding member of the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD).

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Weimar Republic and final years [ edit ] Bernstein (second from right) with the rest of the USPD Executive Board, December 1919 During the German Revolution of 1918–1919 , Bernstein served as an assistant secretary in the Treasury Department under the provisional government formed by the SPD and USPD.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] Driven by his lifelong desire for party unity, he rejoined the SPD in early 1919 in a personal attempt to bridge the gap between the warring socialist factions, though the USPD prohibited dual membership and the move failed to inspire a larger reconciliation.

[ 90 ] Throughout the Weimar Republic , Bernstein was a courageous voice for reason and democracy. At the 1919 SPD party congress, he argued against the widespread nationalist sentiment in his party, insisting on Germany's share of responsibility for the war and the necessity of accepting the Treaty of Versailles , despite its harshness.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] His unwavering commitment to truth earned him ridicule from his colleagues but underscored his integrity.

[ 93 ] He also became a staunch opponent of Bolshevism , which he viewed as a "brutalized" and dictatorial perversion of Marxism.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] His role was instrumental in drafting the SPD's reformist Görlitz Program of 1921, though this was largely replaced by the more orthodox Heidelberg Program in 1925, following the SPD's reunification with the remnants of the USPD.

[ 96 ] As the Weimar Republic faltered, Bernstein found himself increasingly isolated. The party leadership was too preoccupied with its own version of Realpolitik to heed his warnings against the rising dangers of both right-wing reaction and communism.

[ 97 ] Upon his retirement from the Reichstag in 1928, he issued a manifesto with Kautsky urging the SPD to guard against "the deadly enemies of the republic", the alliance of great landowners, captains of industry, and the Communists .

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] Bernstein in 1932 Eduard Bernstein died in Berlin on 18 December 1932, at the age of 82.

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] His funeral was the occasion for a mass demonstration against the rising Nazi Party .

[ 100 ] He was spared from witnessing the final collapse of the republic he had championed, as Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany six weeks later.

[ 4 ] Legacy [ edit ] Eduard Bernstein is regarded as one of the founders of modern democratic socialism and a primary figure in the history of revisionism . His critique of orthodox Marxism forced the international socialist movement to confront the discrepancies between theory and reality at the turn of the 20th century. Although his ideas were officially rejected by the SPD, they reflected the party's actual reformist practice and provided a theoretical basis for social democratic parties throughout Europe in the 20th century.

[ 101 ] His work highlights the central "dilemma of democratic socialism": the tension between achieving radical social change and adhering to democratic, parliamentary means.

[ 102 ] He was unwavering in his conviction that socialism without democracy was a betrayal of its core principles.

[ 103 ] While critics like Rosa Luxemburg argued that his approach sacrificed the revolutionary goal of socialism for the sake of bourgeois reform, Bernstein insisted that a gradual, ethical, and democratic evolution was the only path compatible with a humane society.

[ 104 ] The historian Peter Gay concludes that Bernstein's greatest contribution was his profound honesty and his courage to "submit Marxist dogma to searching examination while not surrendering the Socialist standpoint".
