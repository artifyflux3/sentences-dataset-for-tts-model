A bijective function, _f_: _X_ → _Y_, where set X is {1, 2, 3, 4} and set Y is {A, B, C, D}. For example, _f_(1) = D.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **bijection**, **bijective function**, or **one-to-one correspondence** is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") between two [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") such that each element of the second set (the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain")) is the image of exactly one element of the first set (the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function")). Equivalently, a bijection is a [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") between two sets such that each element of either set is paired with exactly one element of the other set.

A function is bijective if it is [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function"); that is, a function ![Image 2: {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abd1e080abef4bbdab67b43819c6431e7561361c) is bijective if and only if there is a function ![Image 3: {\displaystyle g:Y\to X,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57be2f492983d382259f5e84d03152a29940605d) the _inverse_ of f, such that each of the two ways for [composing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition") the two functions produces an [identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function"): ![Image 4: {\displaystyle g(f(x))=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d12c5b0b3b9b020bfc9f5e330c074b809cc54ebc) for each ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) in ![Image 6: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) and ![Image 7: {\displaystyle f(g(y))=y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e774231d71a255aa573dfbb55f22e4d9137bbeb3) for each ![Image 8: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) in ![Image 9: {\displaystyle Y.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c668649af47a30006f93c9847d61fee8d9ffb61)

For example, the _multiplication by two_ defines a bijection from the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") to the [even numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number "Even number"), which has the _division by two_ as its inverse function.

A function is bijective if and only if it is both [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective "Injective") (or _one-to-one_)—meaning that each element in the codomain is mapped from at most one element of the domain—and [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective "Surjective") (or _onto_)—meaning that each element of the codomain is mapped from at least one element of the domain. The term _one-to-one correspondence_ must not be confused with _[one-to-one function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one\_function "One-to-one function")_, which means injective but not necessarily surjective.

The elementary operation of [counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting "Counting") establishes a bijection from some [finite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") to the first [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")(1, 2, 3, ...), up to the number of elements in the counted set. It results that two finite sets have the same number of elements if and only if there exists a bijection between them. More generally, two sets are said to have the same [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") if there exists a bijection between them.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-1) and the set of all permutations of a set forms its [symmetric group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group").

Some bijections with further properties have received specific names, which include [automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism"), [isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism"), [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism"), [diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism"), [permutation groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group "Permutation group"), and most [geometric transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation"). [Galois correspondences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_correspondence "Galois correspondence") are bijections between sets of [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") of apparently very different nature.

For a [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") pairing elements of set _X_ with elements of set _Y_ to be a bijection, four properties must hold:

1.   each element of _X_ must be paired with at least one element of _Y_,
2.   no element of _X_ may be paired with more than one element of _Y_,
3.   each element of _Y_ must be paired with at least one element of _X_, and
4.   no element of _Y_ may be paired with more than one element of _X_.

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a pairing is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") with [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function")_X_. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of _X_ is paired with exactly one element of _Y_. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be "[onto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onto "Onto")_Y_ " and are called [surjections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function "Surjective function") (or _surjective functions_). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be "[one-to-one functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_function "One-to-one function")" and are called [injections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function "Injective function") (or _injective functions_).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-2) With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both "one-to-one" and "onto".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-3)

### Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bijection&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team")]

Consider the [batting line-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball) "Batting order (baseball)") of a baseball or [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket "Cricket") team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set _X_ will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set _Y_ will be the positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The "pairing" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

### Seats and students of a classroom

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bijection&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Seats and students of a classroom")]

In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A group of students enter the room and the instructor asks them to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:

1.   Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),
2.   No student was in more than one seat,
3.   Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and
4.   No seat had more than one student in it.

The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.

A bijection from the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") to the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"), which maps 2 _n_ to −_n_ and 2 _n_ − 1 to _n_, for _n_ ≥ 0.

*   For any set _X_, the [identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function")**1**_X_: _X_ → _X_, **1**_X_(_x_) = _x_ is bijective.
*   The function _f_: **R** → **R**, _f_(_x_) = 2 _x_ + 1 is bijective, since for each _y_ there is a unique _x_ = (_y_ − 1)/2 such that _f_(_x_) = _y_. More generally, any [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function "Linear function") over the reals, _f_: **R** → **R**, _f_(_x_) = _ax_ + _b_ (where _a_ is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number _y_ is obtained from (or paired with) the real number _x_ = (_y_ − _b_)/_a_.
*   The function _f_: **R** → (−π/2, π/2), given by _f_(_x_) = arctan(_x_) is bijective, since each real number _x_ is paired with exactly one angle _y_ in the interval (−π/2,π/2) so that tan(_y_) = _x_ (that is, _y_ = arctan(_x_)). If the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain") (−π/2,π/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of π/2, then this function would no longer be onto (surjective), since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of π/2 by this arctan function.
*   The [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function"), _g_: **R** → **R**, _g_(_x_) = e _x_, is not bijective: for instance, there is no _x_ in **R** such that _g_(_x_) = −1, showing that _g_ is not onto (surjective). However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{+}\equiv \left(0,\infty \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca500b0e7d5e95360de2b1cccf05179fc977bbba), then _g_ would be bijective; its inverse (see below) is the [natural logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm "Natural logarithm") function ln.
*   The function _h_: **R** → **R**+, _h_(_x_) = _x_ 2 is not bijective: for instance, _h_(−1) = _h_(1) = 1, showing that _h_ is not one-to-one (injective). However, if the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") is restricted to ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{0}^{+}\equiv \left[0,\infty \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d91971a3b102da44c5007d7601345e236242856), then _h_ would be bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.
*   By [Schröder–Bernstein theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem "Schröder–Bernstein theorem"), given any two sets _X_ and _Y_, and two injective functions _f_: _X → Y_ and _g_: _Y → X_, there exists a bijective function _h_: _X → Y_.

A bijection _f_ with domain _X_ (indicated by _f_: _X → Y_ in [functional notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#Notation "Function (mathematics)")) also defines a [converse relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_relation "Converse relation") starting in _Y_ and going to _X_ (by turning the arrows around). The process of "turning the arrows around" for an arbitrary function does not, _in general_, yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain _Y_. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse _function_ is a surjection and an injection, that is, the [inverse function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be [invertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_function "Invertible function"). A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function _f_: _X → Y_ is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition

for every _y_ in _Y_ there is a unique _x_ in _X_ with _y_ = _f_(_x_).
Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Bijective_composition.svg/300px-Bijective_composition.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bijective_composition.svg)

A bijection composed of an injection (X → Y) and a surjection (Y → Z).

The [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")![Image 14: {\displaystyle g\,\circ \,f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee184e9e8a33749be6531c4effac43a704b79e) of two bijections _f_: _X → Y_ and _g_: _Y → Z_ is a bijection, whose inverse is given by ![Image 15: {\displaystyle g\,\circ \,f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee184e9e8a33749be6531c4effac43a704b79e) is ![Image 16: {\displaystyle (g\,\circ \,f)^{-1}\;=\;(f^{-1})\,\circ \,(g^{-1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e413920bda230689cc331c12ed8edb608467164).

Conversely, if the composition ![Image 17: {\displaystyle g\,\circ \,f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33ee184e9e8a33749be6531c4effac43a704b79e) of two functions is bijective, it only follows that _f_ is [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function "Injective function") and _g_ is [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function "Surjective function").

If _X_ and _Y_ are [finite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set"), then there exists a bijection between the two sets _X_ and _Y_[if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if")_X_ and _Y_ have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [axiomatic set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory "Axiomatic set theory"), this is taken as the definition of "same number of elements" ([equinumerosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinumerosity "Equinumerosity")), and generalising this definition to [infinite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set "Infinite set") leads to the concept of [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number"), a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

*   A function _f_: **R** → **R** is bijective if and only if its [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.
*   If _X_ is a set, then the bijective functions from _X_ to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (![Image 18: {\displaystyle \circ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99add39d2b681e2de7ff62422c32704a05c7ec31)), form a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(algebra) "Group (algebra)"), the [symmetric group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group "Symmetric group") of _X_, which is denoted variously by S(_X_), _S X_, or _X_! (_X_[factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial")).
*   Bijections preserve [cardinalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinalities "Cardinalities") of sets: for a subset _A_ of the domain with cardinality |_A_| and subset _B_ of the codomain with cardinality |_B_|, one has the following equalities: |_f_(_A_)| = |_A_| and |_f_−1(_B_)| = |_B_|.
*   If _X_ and _Y_ are [finite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") with the same cardinality, and _f_: _X → Y_, then the following are equivalent: 
    1.   _f_ is a bijection.
    2.   _f_ is a [surjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjection "Surjection").
    3.   _f_ is an [injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(mathematics) "Injection (mathematics)").

*   For a finite set _S_, there is a bijection between the set of possible [total orderings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_ordering "Total ordering") of the elements and the set of bijections from _S_ to _S_. That is to say, the number of [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation "Permutation") of elements of _S_ is the same as the number of total orderings of that set—namely, _n_!.

Bijections are precisely the [isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") in the [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory")_[Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category\_of\_sets "Category of sets")_ of [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") and set functions. However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories. For example, in the category _[Grp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category\_of\_groups "Category of groups")_ of [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"), the morphisms must be [homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism "Homomorphism") since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are _group isomorphisms_ which are bijective homomorphisms.

Generalization to partial functions
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bijection&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Generalization to partial functions")]

The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to [partial functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_functions "Partial functions"), where they are called _partial bijections_, although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a [total function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_function "Total function"), i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the [symmetric inverse semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_inverse_semigroup "Symmetric inverse semigroup").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-Hollings2014-4)

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from _A_ to _B_ is any relation _R_ (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that _R_ is the [graph of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") a bijection _f_:_A′_→_B′_, where _A′_ is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of _A_ and _B′_ is a subset of _B_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-Borceux1994-5)

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a _one-to-one partial [transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation\_(function) "Transformation (function)")_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-Grillet1995-6) An example is the [Möbius transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation") simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective#cite_note-Campbell2007-7)
