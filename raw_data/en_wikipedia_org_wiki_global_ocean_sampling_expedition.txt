The Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS) is an ocean exploration genome project whose goal is to assess genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. The two-year journey, which used Craig Venter's personal yacht, originated in Halifax , Canada , circumnavigated the globe and terminated in the U.S. in January 2006. The expedition sampled water from Halifax , Nova Scotia to the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean . During 2007, sampling continued along the west coast of North America.

Data analysis [ edit ] The GOS datasets were submitted to both NCBI [ 1 ] and Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA), a new online resource for marine metagenomics funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , developed by JCVI and hosted by UC San Diego 's Division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2). CAMERA's toolset was developed by JCVI, and reflects the tools used in the initial publication of the GOS datasets.

Funding [ edit ] The Sorcerer II effort has been funded by: the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation ( sequencing and analysis) [ 2 ] the United States Department of Energy , Office of Science (sequencing and analysis) [ 2 ] The J. Craig Venter Institute (vessel operation) [ 2 ] Moore Foundation seven-year, $24.5 million, grant ( CAMERA ) [ 2 ] Vessel [ edit ] History Name Sorcerer II Builder Cookson Launched 1998 Motto – General characteristics Length 28.95 m (95.0 ft) Beam 7.08 m (23.2 ft) Draught 2.84 m (9 ft 4 in) Propulsion One Cummins 300 HP Sorcerer II , a 95-foot sloop , completed a 2-year scientific expedition circumnavigating the globe in mid latitudes collecting samples of microbes in seawater for genetic sequencing and cataloguing. She was designed to be not just a world cruising yacht, but one that would be capable of handling the extremes in latitudes, from equatorial heat and humidity to latitudes between 60 and 70 degrees. SORCERER II's construction is light for performance, but very strong, with her kevlar and E glass laminates, epoxy bonding and carefully chosen core materials.

The vessel was designed by German Frers and carries 2,400 litres (630 US gal) of water.
