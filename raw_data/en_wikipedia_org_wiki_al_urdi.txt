Copy created in Iran, dated 15th century Al-Urdi (full name: Moayad Al-Din Al-Urdi Al-Amiri Al-Dimashqi ) [ 1 ] ( Arabic : مؤيد الدين العرضي العامري الدمشقي ) (d. 1266) was a medieval Syrian Arab astronomer and geometer .

[ 2 ] Born circa 1200, presumably (from the nisba al‐ʿUrḍī ) in the village of ʿUrḍ in the Syrian desert between Palmyra and Resafa , he moved to Damascus at some point before 1239, where he worked as an engineer and teacher of geometry, and built instruments for al-Malik al-Mansur of Hims . In 1259 he moved to Maragha in northwestern Iran, after being asked by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi to help establish the Maragha observatory under the patronage of Hulagu .

[ 1 ] Al-Urdi's most notable works are Risālat al-Raṣd , a treatise on observational instruments, and Kitāb al-Hayʾa (كتاب الهيئة), a work on theoretical astronomy. His influence can be seen on Bar Hebraeus and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi , in addition to being quoted by Ibn al-Shatir .

[ 1 ] Al-Urdi contributed to the construction of the observatory outside of the city, constructing special devices and water wheels in order to supply the observatory, which was built on a hill, with drinking water. He also constructed some of the instruments used in the observatory, in the year 1261/2.
Al-Urdi's son, who also worked in the observatory, made a copy of his father's Kitāb al‐Hayʾa and also constructed a celestial globe in 1279.

[ 3 ] Al-Urdi is a member of the group of Islamic astronomers of the 13th and 14th centuries who were active in the criticism of the astronomical model presented in Ptolemy 's Almagest . Saliba (1979) identified Bodleian ms.

Marsh 621 as a copy of Al-Urdi's Kitāb al-Hayʾa , based on which he argued that Al-Urdi's contributions predated Al-Tusi .

Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957 argued that the works of this group of astronomers, perhaps via Ibn al-Shatir , must have been received in 15th-century Europe and ultimately influenced the works of Copernicus .
This concerns the " Urdi lemma " in particular,  an extension of Apollonius' theorem that allowed an equant in an astronomic model to be replaced with an equivalent epicycle that moved around a deferent centered at half the distance to the equant point.
