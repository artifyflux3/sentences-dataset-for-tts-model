[ 1 ] The thesis is a comparative study on atomism of Democritus and Epicurus on contingency and dedicated to Marx's friend, mentor, and future father-in-law, Ludwig von Westphalen . Francis Wheen describes it as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".

[ 1 ] His thesis advisor was his fellow Young Hegelian and personal friend, Bruno Bauer .
