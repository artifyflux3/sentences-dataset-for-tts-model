**It's Immaterial** are an English [indie pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop "Indie pop") band from [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool "Liverpool"), England, formed in 1980. They are best known for their 1986 [single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music) "Single (music)") "[Driving Away from Home (Jim's Tune)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_Away_from_Home_(Jim%27s_Tune) "Driving Away from Home (Jim's Tune)")", which reached number 18 on the [UK Singles Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart "UK Singles Chart").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-2)

It's Immaterial were formed by three former members of [Yachts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yachts_(band) "Yachts (band)") – Mancunian John Campbell ([vocals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing "Singing")), Martin Dempsey ([guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar "Guitar")), and [Henry Priestman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Priestman "Henry Priestman") ([keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument "Keyboard instrument")) – in addition to Paul Barlow ([drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit "Drum kit")). By 1984, the band had been reduced to a duo – Campbell and Jarvis Whitehead, on guitar and keyboards, who joined in 1982.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-Strong-3)

On 11 November 1981, around the time of the release of the band’s third single, It's Immaterial recorded the first of four sessions for [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel "John Peel") at [BBC Radio 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1 "BBC Radio 1"). The track listing was "A Gigantic Raft (In the Philippines)", "Imitate the Worm", "White Man's Hut", and "Rake".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-4) "A Gigantic Raft" was featured on the soundtrack of [Jonathan Demme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme "Jonathan Demme")'s 2004 _[The Manchurian Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Manchurian\_Candidate\_(2004\_film) "The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)")_.

In April 1985, the band recorded their fourth and final John Peel session, with the tracks: "Rope", "Hang On Sleepy Town", "Space" and "Festival Time". In the same month, the band's _Fish Waltz_ EP reached number 30 on the [UK Indie Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Indie_Chart "UK Indie Chart").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-5)

Less than a year later the band had a hit single with "[Driving Away from Home (Jim's Tune)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_Away_from_Home_(Jim%27s_Tune) "Driving Away from Home (Jim's Tune)")".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-6) This song was their biggest hit and has since featured widely on [television advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement "Television advertisement") and on 1980s-based [compilation albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_album "Compilation album").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Another minor hit followed, "Ed's Funky Diner (Friday Night, Saturday Morning)", with accompanying video, before the release of the band's debut album, _[Life's Hard and Then You Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life%27s\_Hard\_and\_Then\_You\_Die "Life's Hard and Then You Die")_, in September 1986.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-8)

In 1990, they released their second album _[Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song\_(It%27s\_Immaterial\_album) "Song (It's Immaterial album)")_. As before, the music was of a subdued, understated nature, with wry wit in the manner of an indie [Pet Shop Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys "Pet Shop Boys").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-9) The album was a commercial flop, despite receiving positive reviews in the music press. The album was produced by [Calum Malcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calum_Malcolm "Calum Malcolm"), best known for his work with Glasgow band [the Blue Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Nile_(band) "The Blue Nile (band)"). In the same year as _Song_, former It's Immaterial keyboard player Henry Priestman had a UK number one album _[The Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Christians\_(album) "The Christians (album)")_ with [the band of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christians_(band) "The Christians (band)").

In 1993, the band started to work on a new album which remained uncompleted for many years.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-10) Since 2010 some unreleased songs from the album have appeared on different internet music channels: "Just North of Here", "New Moon", "Is It Alright (Between Us)", "House for Sale" and "How Can I Tell You".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A deluxe edition of their album _Life's Hard and Then You Die_ was released on 1 July 2016. The double-CD issue contains the original album remastered plus bonus tracks of single versions, B-sides, remixes and one of the group's John Peel sessions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-11)

On 23 September 2016, the group launched the campaign to produce and release their "lost and found" album _House for Sale_ via Pledge Music. The pledge target was reached, although an initial tentative release date of spring 2017 was later postponed to early 2018.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-12) The album was finally released on 18 September 2020, through Burning Shed Distribution.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Immaterial#cite_note-13)
