A distance between populations can be interpreted as measuring the distance between two probability distributions and hence they are essentially measures of distances between probability measures . Where statistical distance measures relate to the differences between random variables , these may have statistical dependence , [ 1 ] and hence these distances are not directly related to measures of distances between probability measures.  Again, a measure of distance between random variables may relate to the extent of dependence between them, rather than to their individual values.

Many statistical distance measures are not metrics , and some are not symmetric. Some types of distance measures, which generalize squared distance, are referred to as (statistical) divergences .

Terminology [ edit ] Many terms are used to refer to various notions of distance; these are often confusingly similar, and may be used inconsistently between authors and over time, either loosely or with precise technical meaning. In addition to "distance", similar terms include deviance , deviation , discrepancy , discrimination, and divergence , as well as others such as contrast function and metric . Terms from information theory include cross entropy , relative entropy , discrimination information , and information gain .

Distances as metrics [ edit ] Metrics [ edit ] A metric on a set X is a function (called the distance function or simply distance ) d : X × X → R + (where R + is the set of non-negative real numbers ). For all x , y , z in X , this function is required to satisfy the following conditions: d ( x , y ) ≥ 0     ( non-negativity ) d ( x , y ) = 0   if and only if x = y ( identity of indiscernibles . Note that condition 1 and 2 together produce positive definiteness ) d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x )      ( symmetry ) d ( x , z ) ≤ d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z )      ( subadditivity / triangle inequality ).

Generalized metrics [ edit ] Many statistical distances are not metrics , because they lack one or more properties of proper metrics. For example, pseudometrics violate property (2), identity of indiscernibles; quasimetrics violate property (3), symmetry; and semimetrics violate property (4), the triangle inequality. Statistical distances that satisfy (1) and (2) are referred to as divergences .

Statistically close [ edit ] The total variation distance of two distributions X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} over a finite domain D {\displaystyle D} , (often referred to as statistical difference [ 2 ] or statistical distance [ 3 ] in cryptography) is defined as Δ Δ ( X , Y ) = 1 2 ∑ ∑ α α ∈ ∈ D | Pr [ X = α α ] − − Pr [ Y = α α ] | {\displaystyle \Delta (X,Y)={\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{\alpha \in D}|\Pr[X=\alpha ]-\Pr[Y=\alpha ]|} .

We say that two probability ensembles { X k } k ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle \{X_{k}\}_{k\in \mathbb {N} }} and { Y k } k ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle \{Y_{k}\}_{k\in \mathbb {N} }} are statistically close if Δ Δ ( X k , Y k ) {\displaystyle \Delta (X_{k},Y_{k})} is a negligible function in k {\displaystyle k} .

Examples [ edit ] Metrics [ edit ] Total variation distance (sometimes just called "the" statistical distance) Hellinger distance Lévy–Prokhorov metric Wasserstein metric : also known as the Kantorovich metric, or earth mover's distance Mahalanobis distance Integral probability metrics generalize several metrics or pseudometrics on distributions Divergences [ edit ] Kullback–Leibler divergence Rényi divergence Jensen–Shannon divergence Ball divergence Bhattacharyya distance (despite its name it is not a distance, as it violates the triangle inequality) f-divergence : generalizes several distances and divergences Discriminability index , specifically the Bayes discriminability index , is a positive-definite symmetric measure of the overlap of two distributions.
