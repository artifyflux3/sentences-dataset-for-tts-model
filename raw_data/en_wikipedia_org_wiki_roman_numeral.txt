Year 1575 in Arabic and Roman numbers

**Roman numerals** are a [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system "Numeral system") that originated in [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages"). Numbers are written with combinations of letters from the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet"), each with a fixed integer value. The modern style uses only these seven:

[I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I "I")[V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V "V")[X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X "X")[L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L "L")[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C "C")[D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D "D")[M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M "M")
1 5 10 50 100 500 1000

The use of Roman numerals continued long after the [decline of the Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire "Fall of the Western Roman Empire"). From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced by [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals"); however, this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persisted in various places, including on [clock faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_face "Clock face"). For instance, on the clock of [Big Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben "Big Ben") (designed in 1852), the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:

**I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII**

The notations IV and IX can be read as "one less than five" (4) and "one less than ten" (9), although there is a tradition favouring the representation of "4" as "IIII" on Roman numeral clocks.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-1)

Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the title screens of films and television programmes. MCM, signifying "a thousand, and a hundred less than another thousand", means 1900, so 1912 is written MCMXII. For the years of the current (21st) century, MM indicates 2000; this year is MMXXV (2025).

Roman numerals on stern of the ship [_Cutty Sark_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark "Cutty Sark") showing [draught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull) "Draft (hull)") in [feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit) "Foot (unit)"). The numbers range from 13 to 22, from bottom to top.

Roman numerals use different symbols for each power of ten, and there is no zero symbol, in contrast with the [place value notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_value_notation "Place value notation") of Arabic numerals (in which place-keeping zeros enable the same digit to represent different powers of ten).

This allows some flexibility in notation, and there has never been an official or universally accepted standard for Roman numerals. Usage varied greatly in ancient Rome and became thoroughly chaotic in medieval times. The more recent restoration of a largely "classical" notation has gained popularity among some, while variant forms are used by some modern writers as seeking more "flexibility".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-adams-2) Roman numerals may be considered legally binding expressions of a number, as in U.S. copyright law before the [Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988 "Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988") (where an "incorrect" or ambiguous numeral in a [copyright notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_notice "Copyright notice") could invalidate a copyright claim or affect the termination date of the copyright period).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Hayes-3)

### Standard form

The following table displays how Roman numerals are usually written in modern times:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-4)

Individual decimal places |  | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | M | C | X | I |
| 2 | MM | CC | XX | II |
| 3 | MMM | CCC | XXX | III |
| 4 |  | CD | XL | IV |
| 5 |  | D | L | V |
| 6 |  | DC | LX | VI |
| 7 |  | DCC | LXX | VII |
| 8 |  | DCCC | LXXX | VIII |
| 9 |  | CM | XC | IX |

The numerals for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) are written using [subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation "Subtractive notation"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-deha1997-5) where the smaller symbol (I) is _subtracted_ from the larger one (V, or X), thus avoiding the clumsier IIII and VIIII.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-6) Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-ema1990-7) These are the only subtractive forms in standard use.

A number containing two or more decimal digits is built by appending the Roman numeral equivalent for each, from highest to lowest, as in the following examples:

*   39 = XXX + IX = **XXXIX**.
*   246 = CC + XL + VI = **CCXLVI**.
*   789 = DCC + LXXX + IX = **DCCLXXXIX**.
*   2,421 = MM + CD + XX + I = **MMCDXXI**.

Any missing place (represented by a zero in the place-value equivalent) is omitted, as in Latin (and English) speech:

*   160 = C + LX = **CLX**
*   207 = CC + VII = **CCVII**
*   1,009 = M + IX = **MIX**
*   1,066 = M + LX + VI = **MLXVI**[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-martelli-9)

The largest number that can be represented in this manner is 3,999 (**MMMCMXCIX**), but this is sufficient for the values for which Roman numerals are commonly used today, such as year numbers:

*   1776 = M + DCC + LXX + VI = **MDCCLXXVI** (the date written on the book held by the [Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty "Statue of Liberty")).
*   1918 = M + CM + X + VIII = **MCMXVIII** (the first year of the [Spanish flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu "Spanish flu") pandemic)
*   1944 = M + CM + XL + IV = **MCMXLIV** (erroneous copyright notice of the 1954 movie _[The Last Time I Saw Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Last\_Time\_I\_Saw\_Paris#Copyright "The Last Time I Saw Paris")_)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Hayes-3)
*   2025 = **MMXXV** (this year)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-10)

For larger numbers (4,000 and larger): Both before and after the introduction of Arabic numerals in the West, from ancient times through medieval and modern, users of Roman numerals have used various means to write larger numbers (see [§Large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#Large_numbers) below).

### Other forms

Forms exist that vary in one way or another from the general standard represented above.

#### Other additive forms

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/BadSalzdetfurthBadenburgerStr060529.jpg/250px-BadSalzdetfurthBadenburgerStr060529.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BadSalzdetfurthBadenburgerStr060529.jpg)

A [clock face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_face "Clock face") with the Roman numerals typical for clocks, in [Bad Salzdetfurth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Salzdetfurth "Bad Salzdetfurth"), Germany

While subtractive notation for 4, 40, and 400 (IV, XL, and CD) has been the usual form since Roman times [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], [additive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_notation "Additive notation") to represent these numbers (IIII, XXXX, and CCCC)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-caes0050-11) very frequently continued to be used, including in compound numbers like 24 (XXIIII),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-rocc1612-12) 74 (LXXIIII),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-borc1673-13) and 490 (CCCCLXXXX).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-plin2015-14) The additive forms for 9, 90, and 900 (VIIII,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-caes0050-11)LXXXX,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-benn1731-15) and DCCCC[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-mira1486-16)) have also been used, although less often.

The two conventions could be mixed in the same document or inscription, even in the same numeral. For example, on the numbered gates to the [Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum "Colosseum"), IIII is systematically used instead of IV, but subtractive notation is used for XL; consequently, gate 44 is labelled XLIIII.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-17)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-18)

Especially on tombstones and other funerary inscriptions, 5 and 50 have been occasionally written IIIII and XXXXX instead of V and L, and there are instances such as IIIIII and XXXXXX rather than VI or LX.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-19)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-20)

Modern [clock faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_face "Clock face") that use Roman numerals still very often use IIII for four o'clock but IX for nine o'clock, a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the [Wells Cathedral clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Cathedral_clock "Wells Cathedral clock") of the late 14th century.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-21)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-pickover-22)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-23) However, this is far from universal: for example, the clock on the [Palace of Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster "Palace of Westminster") tower (commonly known as [Big Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben "Big Ben")) uses a subtractive IV for 4 o'clock.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-pickover-22)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-25)

The year number on [Admiralty Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_Arch "Admiralty Arch"), London. The year 1910 is rendered as MDCCCCX, rather than the more usual MCMX

Several monumental inscriptions created in the early 20th century use variant forms for "1900" (usually written MCM). These vary from MDCCCCX for 1910 as seen on [Admiralty Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_Arch "Admiralty Arch"), London, to the more unusual, if not unique MDCDIII for 1903, on the north entrance to the [Saint Louis Art Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_Art_Museum "Saint Louis Art Museum").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-26)

#### Other subtractive forms

There are numerous historical examples of IIX being used for 8; for example, XIIX was used by officers of the [XVIII Roman Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_XVIII "Legio XVIII") to write their number.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-27)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-28) The notation appears prominently on the [cenotaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph "Cenotaph") of their senior [centurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion "Centurion")[Marcus Caelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Caelius "Marcus Caelius") (c. 45 BC – 9 AD). On the publicly displayed official Roman calendars known as [Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti "Fasti"), XIIX is used for the 18 days to the next [Kalends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calends "Calends"), and XXIIX for the 28 days in February. The latter can be seen on the sole extant pre-Julian calendar, the [Fasti Antiates Maiores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_Antiates_Maiores "Fasti Antiates Maiores").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Degrassi-29) There are historical examples of other subtractive forms: IIIXX for 17,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-lvnd1621-30)IIXX for 18,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-sulp1692-31)IIIC for 97,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-tent1699-32)IIC for 98,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-posn1698-33)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-tent1700-34) and IC for 99.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-picc1699-35) A possible explanation is that the word for 18 in Latin is _duodeviginti_—literally "two from twenty"⁠—while 98 is _duodecentum_ (two from hundred) and 99 is _undecentum_ (one from hundred).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-kenn1879-36) However, the explanation does not seem to apply to IIIXX and IIIC, since the Latin words for 17 and 97 were _septendecim_ (seven ten) and _nonaginta septem_ (ninety seven), respectively.

The `ROMAN()` function in [Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel "Microsoft Excel") supports multiple subtraction modes depending on the "Form" setting. For example, the number "499" (usually CDXCIX) can be rendered as LDVLIV, XDIX, VDIV or ID. The relevant Microsoft help page offers no explanation for this function other than to describe its output as "more concise".[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-37)

#### Non-standard variants

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Padlock%2C_Athlone.jpg/330px-Padlock%2C_Athlone.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Padlock,_Athlone.jpg)

Padlock used on the north [gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_gate "City gate") of the Irish town of [Athlone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlone "Athlone"). "1613" in the date is rendered XVIXIII, (literally "16, 13") instead of MDCXIII.

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._1433_fr.%2C_fol._24r.png/330px-Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._1433_fr.%2C_fol._24r.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._1433_fr.,_fol._24r.png)

Excerpt from [Bibliothèque nationale de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France "Bibliothèque nationale de France").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-38) The Roman numeral for 500 is rendered as C V, instead of D.

There are also historical examples of other additive and multiplicative forms, and forms which seem to reflect spoken phrases. Some of these variants may have been regarded as errors even by contemporaries.

*   IIXX was how people associated with the [XXII Roman Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_XXII_Deiotariana "Legio XXII Deiotariana") used to write their number. The practice may have been due to a common way to say "twenty-second" in Latin, namely _duo et vice(n)sima_ (literally "two and twentieth") rather than the "regular" _vice(n)sima secunda_ (twenty second).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-malo2005-39) Apparently, at least one ancient [stonecutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonecutter "Stonecutter") mistakenly thought that the IIXX of "22nd Legion" stood for 18, and "corrected" it to XVIII.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-malo2005-39)

*   Other numerals that do not fit the usual patterns – such as VXL for 45, instead of the usual XLV — may be due to scribal errors, or the writer's lack of familiarity with the system, rather than being genuine variant usage.

#### Non-numeric combinations

As Roman numerals are composed of ordinary alphabetic characters, there may sometimes be confusion with other uses of the same letters. For example, "[XXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXX_(disambiguation) "XXX (disambiguation)")" and "[XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XL_(disambiguation) "XL (disambiguation)")" have other connotations in addition to their values as Roman numerals, while "[IXL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IXL_(disambiguation) "IXL (disambiguation)")" more often than not is a [gramogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramogram "Gramogram") of "I excel", and is in any case not an unambiguous Roman numeral.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-ixl-story-40)

### Zero

As a non-[positional numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation "Positional notation"), Roman numerals have no "place-keeping" zeros. Furthermore, the system as used by the Romans lacked a numeral for the number [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)") itself (that is, what remains after 1 is subtracted from 1). The word _[nulla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nulla#Latin "wikt:nulla")_ (the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") word meaning "none") was used to represent 0, although the earliest attested instances are medieval. For instance [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus "Dionysius Exiguus") used _nulla_ alongside Roman numerals in a manuscript from 525 AD.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-41)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-42) About 725, [Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede") or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the initial of _nulla_ or of _[nihil](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nihil#Latin "wikt:nihil")_ (the Latin word for "nothing") for 0, in a table of [epacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epacts "Epacts"), all written in Roman numerals.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-zero-43)

The use of N to indicate "none" long survived in the historic [apothecaries' system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothecaries%27_system "Apothecaries' system") of measurement: used well into the 20th century to designate quantities in pharmaceutical prescriptions.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Bachenheimer-44)

In later times, the Arabic numeral "0" has been used as a zero to open enumerations with Roman numbers. Examples include the 24-hour [Shepherd Gate Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_Gate_Clock "Shepherd Gate Clock") from 1852 and [tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot "Tarot") packs such as the 15th-century [Sola Busca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_Busca_tarot "Sola Busca tarot") and the 20th century [Rider–Waite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite_Tarot "Rider-Waite Tarot") packs.

### Fractions

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Vecchi_003.jpg/250px-Vecchi_003.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vecchi_003.jpg)

A _[triens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triens "Triens")_ coin (1⁄3 or 4⁄12 of an _as_). Note the four dots (**····**) indicating its value.

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Semisse.jpg/250px-Semisse.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Semisse.jpg)

A _[semis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semis "Semis")_ coin (1⁄2 or 6⁄12 of an _as_). Note the S indicating its value.

The base "Roman fraction" is S, indicating 1⁄2. The use of S (as in VIIS to indicate 7+1⁄2) is attested in some ancient inscriptions[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-45) and in the now rare apothecaries' system (usually in the form SS):[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Bachenheimer-44) but while Roman numerals for [whole numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers") are essentially [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal"), S does not correspond to 5⁄10, as one might expect, but 6⁄12.

The Romans used a [duodecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal "Duodecimal") rather than a decimal system for [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), as the [divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility "Divisibility") of twelve (12 = 2 2 × 3) makes it easier to handle the common [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)") of 1⁄3 and 1⁄4 than does a system based on ten (10 = 2 × 5). Notation for fractions other than 1⁄2 is mainly found on surviving [Roman coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_coin "Roman coin"), many of which had values that were duodecimal fractions of the unit _[as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As\_(coin) "As (coin)")_. Fractions less than 1⁄2 are indicated by a dot (**·**) for each _uncia_ "twelfth", the source of the English words _inch_ and _ounce_; dots are repeated for fractions up to five twelfths. Six twelfths (one half), is S for _semis_ "half". _Uncia_ dots were added to S for fractions from seven to eleven twelfths, just as tallies were added to V for whole numbers from six to nine.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-46) The arrangement of the dots was variable and not necessarily [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity "Linearity"). Five dots arranged like (**⁙**) (as on the face of a [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice "Dice")) are known as a [quincunx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx "Quincunx"), from the name of the Roman fraction/coin. The Latin words _sextans_ and _quadrans_ are the source of the English words _[sextant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant "Sextant")_ and _[quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant\_(plane\_geometry) "Quadrant (plane geometry)")_.

Each fraction from 1⁄12 to 12⁄12 had a name in Roman times; these corresponded to the names of the related coins:

| Fraction | Roman numeral | Name (nominative and genitive singular) | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1⁄12 | **·** | _[Uncia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncia\_(coin) "Uncia (coin)"), unciae_ | "Ounce" |
| 2⁄12 = 1⁄6 | **··** or **:** | _[Sextans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextans\_(coin) "Sextans (coin)"), sextantis_ | "Sixth" |
| 3⁄12 = 1⁄4 | **···** or **∴** | _[Quadrans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrans "Quadrans"), quadrantis_ | "Quarter" |
| 4⁄12 = 1⁄3 | **····** or **∷** | _[Triens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triens "Triens"), trientis_ | "Third" |
| 5⁄12 | **·····** or **⁙** | _[Quincunx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx\_(Roman\_coin) "Quincunx (Roman coin)"), quincuncis_ | "Five-ounce" (_quinque unciae_ → _quincunx_) |
| 6⁄12 = 1⁄2 | S | _[Semis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semis "Semis"), semissis_ | "Half" |
| 7⁄12 | S**·** | _Septunx, septuncis_ | "Seven-ounce" (_septem unciae_ → _septunx_) |
| 8⁄12 = 2⁄3 | S**··** or S**:** | _[Bes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bes\_(coin) "Bes (coin)"), bessis_ | "Twice" (as in "twice a third") |
| 9⁄12 = 3⁄4 | S**···** or S**∴** | _[Dodrans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodrans "Dodrans"), dodrantis_ **or**_nonuncium, nonuncii_ | "Less a quarter" (_de-quadrans_ → _dodrans_) **or** "ninth ounce" (_nona uncia_ → _nonuncium_) |
| 10⁄12 = 5⁄6 | S**····** or S**∷** | _Dextans, dextantis_ **or**_decunx, decuncis_ | "Less a sixth" (_de-sextans_ → _dextans_) **or** "ten ounces" (_decem unciae_ → _decunx_) |
| 11⁄12 | S**·····** or S**⁙** | _Deunx, deuncis_ | "Less an ounce" (_de-uncia_ → _deunx_) |
| 12⁄12 = 1 | I | _[As](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As\_(Roman\_coin) "As (Roman coin)"), assis_ | "Unit" |

Other Roman fractional notations included the following:

| Fraction | Roman numeral | Name (nominative and genitive singular) | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1⁄1728=12−3 | 𐆕 | _[Siliqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siliqua "Siliqua"), siliquae_ |  |
| 1⁄288 | ℈ | _Scripulum, scripuli_ | "[scruple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothecaries%27_system "Apothecaries' system")" |
| 1⁄144=12−2 | ~~Ƨ~~ | _Dimidia sextula, dimidiae sextulae_ | "half a sextula" |
| 1⁄72 | Ƨ | _[Sextula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextula "Sextula"), sextulae_ | "1⁄6 of an uncia" |
| 1⁄48 | Ↄ | _Sicilicus, sicilici_ |  |
| 1⁄36 | ƧƧ | _Binae sextulae, binarum sextularum_ (Exceptionally, these are plural forms.) | "two sextulas" (_[duella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duella "Duella"), duellae_) |
| 1⁄24 | Σ or 𐆒 or Є | _[Semuncia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semuncia "Semuncia"), semunciae_ | "1⁄2 uncia" (_semi-_ + _uncia_) |
| 1⁄8 | Σ**·** or 𐆒**·** or Є**·** | _Sescuncia, sescunciae_ | "1+1⁄2 uncias" (_[sesqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral\_prefix "Numeral prefix")-_ + _uncia_) |

Fractions could also be indicated with a slash through the last letter in a numeral (e.g. Ɨ), which subtracted the number by an amount less than one (usually 1⁄2).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-cappelli-47)

### Large numbers

The modern form can only write numbers up to 3999, and without M in early Roman times only numbers up to 899 could be written. Various schemes have been used over time to write larger numbers.

#### Apostrophus

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Westerkerk_MDCXXX.jpg/250px-Westerkerk_MDCXXX.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Westerkerk_MDCXXX.jpg)

 "1630" on the [Westerkerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerkerk "Westerkerk") in Amsterdam. "M" and "D" are given archaic _apostrophus_ form.

Using the _apostrophus_ method,[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-merriam-webster-48) 500 is written as IↃ, while 1,000 is written as CIↃ.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-asimov_on_numbers_12-24) This system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (imagine the C s and Ↄ s as parentheses) had its origins in Etruscan numeral usage.

Each additional set of C and Ↄ surrounding CIↃ raises the value by a factor of ten: CCIↃↃ represents 10,000 and CCCIↃↃↃ represents 100,000. Similarly, each additional Ↄ to the right of IↃ raises the value by a factor of ten: IↃↃ represents 5,000 and IↃↃↃ represents 50,000. Numerals larger than CCCIↃↃↃ do not occur.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PropN3218-49)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Roman_numerals_Bungus_1584-1585.png/250px-Roman_numerals_Bungus_1584-1585.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_numerals_Bungus_1584-1585.png)

Page from a 16th-century manual, showing a mixture of _apostrophus_ and _vinculum_ numbers (see in particular the ways of writing 10,000).

*   **IↃ** = 500
*   **CIↃ** = 1,000
*   **IↃↃ** = 5,000
*   **CCIↃↃ** = 10,000
*   **IↃↃↃ** = 50,000
*   **CCCIↃↃↃ** = 100,000

Sometimes IↃ (500) is reduced to D, CIↃ (1,000) to ↀ, IↃↃ (5,000) to ↁ; CCIↃↃ (10,000) to ↂ; IↃↃↃ (50,000) to ↇ; and CCCIↃↃↃ (100,000) to ↈ.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Ifrah2000-50) It is likely CIↃ (1000) influenced the later M.

[John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") is often credited with introducing the symbol for [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity")⟨∞⟩, and one conjecture is his basing it on ↀ, since 1,000 was [hyperbolically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole "Hyperbole") used to represent very large numbers.

#### Vinculum

Using the _[vinculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinculum\_(symbol) "Vinculum (symbol)")_, conventional Roman numerals are multiplied by 1,000 by adding a "bar" or "overline", thus:[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Ifrah2000-50)

*   **IV** = 4,000
*   **XXV** = 25,000

An [overbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline "Overline") can be typed to represent this notation, such that X̄ denotes [ten thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000 "10,000"), C̄ denotes [a hundred thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000 "100,000"), and M̄ denotes [a million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000 "1,000,000").

The _vinculum_ came into use in the [late Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Dilke-51) and it was a common alternative to the apostrophic ↀ during the Imperial era around the Roman world (M for '1000' was not in use until the Medieval period).[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Chrisomalis01-52)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-gordon01-53) It continued in use in the Middle Ages, though it became known more commonly as _titulus_,[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Chrisomalis02-54) and it appears in modern editions of classical and medieval Latin texts.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-55)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PlinyNH-56)

In an extension of the _vinculum_, a three-sided box (now sometimes printed as two vertical lines and a _vinculum_) is used to multiply by 100,000,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Chrisomalis03-57)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Dilke-51) thus:

*   **XIII XXXII p.** = 1,332,000 paces (1,332 [Roman miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile#Roman "Mile")).[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-58)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PlinyNH-56)

_Vinculum_ notation is distinct from the custom of adding an overline to a numeral simply to indicate that it is a number. Both usages can be seen on Roman inscriptions of the same period and general location, such as on the [Antonine Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Wall "Antonine Wall").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-59)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-60)

#### Other

*   There are some examples of year numbers after 1000 written as two Roman numerals 1–99, e.g. 1613 as XVIXIII, corresponding to the common reading "sixteen thirteen" of such year numbers in English, or 1519 as X C V XIX as in [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_quinze-cent-dix-neuf_ (fifteen-hundred and nineteen), and similar readings in other languages.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-gach1862-61)

*   In some French texts from the 15th century and later, one finds constructions like IIII XX XIX for 99, reflecting the French reading of that number as _quatre-vingt-dix-neuf_ (four-score and nineteen).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-gach1862-61) Similarly, in some English documents one finds, for example, 77 written as "iii xx xvii" (which could be read "three-score and seventeen").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-salt1923-62)

*   A medieval accounting text from 1301 renders numbers like 13,573 as "XIII. M. V. C. III. XX. XIII", that is, "13×1000 + 5×100 + 3×20 + 13".[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-wade1865-63)

Origin
------

The system is closely associated with the ancient [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state") of Rome and the Empire that it created. However, due to the scarcity of surviving examples, the origins of the system are obscure and there are several competing theories, all largely conjectural.

### Etruscan numerals

Rome was founded sometime between 850 and 750 BC, next to the southern edge of the Etruscan domain, which covered a large part of north-central Italy.

The Roman numerals, in particular, are directly derived from the [Etruscan number symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_numerals "Etruscan numerals"): ⟨𐌠⟩, ⟨𐌡⟩, ⟨𐌢⟩, ⟨𐌣⟩, and ⟨𐌟⟩ for 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 (they had more symbols for larger numbers, but it is unknown which symbol represents which number). As in the basic Roman system, the Etruscans wrote the symbols that added to the desired number, from higher to lower value. Thus, the number 87, for example, would be written 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 𐌣𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌡𐌠𐌠 (this would appear as 𐌠𐌠𐌡𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌣 since [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language "Etruscan language") was written from right to left.)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-heem2009-64)

The symbols ⟨𐌠⟩ and ⟨𐌡⟩ resembled letters of the Etruscan alphabet, but ⟨𐌢⟩, ⟨𐌣⟩, and ⟨𐌟⟩ did not. The Etruscans used the subtractive notation, too, but not like the Romans. They wrote 17, 18, and 19 as 𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢, 𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢, and 𐌠𐌢𐌢, mirroring the way they spoke those numbers ("three from twenty", etc.); and similarly for 27, 28, 29, 37, 38, etc. However, they did not write 𐌠𐌡 for 4 (nor 𐌢𐌣 for 40), and wrote 𐌡𐌠𐌠, 𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠 and 𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌠 for 7, 8, and 9, respectively.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-heem2009-64)

### Early Roman numerals

The early Roman numerals for 1, 10, and 100 were the Etruscan ones: ⟨𐌠⟩, ⟨𐌢⟩, and ⟨𐌟⟩. The symbols for 5 and 50 changed from ⟨𐌡⟩ and ⟨𐌣⟩ to ⟨V⟩ and ⟨ↆ⟩ at some point. The latter had flattened to ⟨⊥⟩ (an inverted T) by the time of [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus"), and soon afterwards became identified with the graphically similar letter ⟨L⟩.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PropN3218-49)

The symbol for 100 was written variously as ⟨𐌟⟩ or ⟨ↃIC⟩, and was then abbreviated to ⟨Ↄ⟩ or ⟨C⟩, with ⟨C⟩ (which matched the Latin letter _C_) finally winning out. It might have helped that _C_ was the initial letter of _CENTUM_, Latin for "hundred".

The numbers 500 and 1000 were denoted by V or X overlaid with a box or circle. Thus, 500 was like a Ɔ superimposed on a ⋌ or ⊢, making it look like ~~Þ~~. It became ~~D~~ or Ð by the time of Augustus, under the graphic influence of the letter D. It was later identified as the letter D; an alternative symbol for "thousand" was a CIↃ, and half of a thousand or "five hundred" is the right half of the symbol, IↃ, and this may have been converted into D.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-asimov_on_numbers_12-24)

The notation for 1000 was a circled or boxed X: Ⓧ, ⊗, ⊕, and by Augustan times was partially identified with the Greek letter Φ _[phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi "Phi")_. Over time, the symbol changed to Ψ and ↀ. The latter symbol further evolved into ∞, then ⋈, and eventually changed to M under the influence of the Latin word _mille_ "thousand".[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PropN3218-49)

According to Paul Kayser, the basic numerical symbols were I, X, 𐌟 and Φ (or ⊕) and the intermediate ones were derived by taking half of those (half an X is V, half a 𐌟 is ↆ and half a Φ/⊕ is D). Then 𐌟 and ↆ developed as mentioned above.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-65)

### Classical Roman numerals

The [Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum "Colosseum") was constructed in Rome in CE 72–80,[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Hopkins_p.2-66) and while the original perimeter wall has largely disappeared, the numbered entrances from XXIII (23) to LIIII (54) survive,[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Claridge_pp._276%E2%80%93282-67) to demonstrate that in Imperial times Roman numerals had already assumed their classical form: [as largely standardised in current use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#Standard_form). The most obvious anomaly ([a common one that persisted for centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#Other_additive_forms)) is the inconsistent use of subtractive notation - while XL is used for 40, IV is avoided in favour of IIII: in fact, gate 44 is labelled XLIIII.

Use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance
--------------------------------------

[Lower case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case"), or _minuscule_, letters were developed in the Middle Ages, well after the demise of the [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire"), and since that time lower-case versions of Roman numbers have also been commonly used: i, ii, iii, iv, and so on.

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._23112_fr.%2C_fol._343v.png/330px-Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._23112_fr.%2C_fol._343v.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._23112_fr.,_fol._343v.png)

13th century example of iiij.

Since the Middle Ages, a "j" has sometimes been substituted for the final "i" of a "lower-case" Roman numeral, such as "iij" for 3 or "vij" for 7. This "j" can be considered a [swash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swash_(typography) "Swash (typography)") variant of "i". Into the early 20th century, the use of a final "j" was still sometimes used in [medical prescriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription "Medical prescription") to prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it was written.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-68)

Numerals in documents and inscriptions from the Middle Ages sometimes include additional symbols, which today are called "medieval Roman numerals". Some simply substitute another letter for the standard one (such as "A" for "V", or "Q" for "D"), while others serve as abbreviations for compound numerals ("O" for "XI", or "F" for "XL"). Although they are still listed today in some dictionaries, they are long out of use.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-cappelli-47)

A superscript "o" (sometimes written directly above the symbol) was sometimes used as an [ordinal indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator "Ordinal indicator").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-69)

| Number | Medieval abbreviation | Notes and etymology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | A | Resembles an upside-down V. Also said to equal 500. |
| 6 | ↅ | Either from a [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature") of VI, or from [digamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digamma "Digamma") (ϛ), the Greek numeral 6 (sometimes conflated with the [στ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigma_(letter) "Stigma (letter)") ligature).[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-PropN3218-49) |
| 7 | S, Z | Presumed abbreviation of _\_septem\__, Latin for 7. |
| 11 | O | Presumed abbreviation of _\_onze\__, French for 11. |
| 40 | F | Presumed abbreviation of English _forty_. |
| 70 | S | Also could stand for 7, with the same derivation. |
| 80 | R |  |
| 90 | N | Presumed abbreviation of _\_nonaginta\__, Latin for 90. (Ambiguous with N for "nothing" (_nihil_)). |
| 150 | Y | Possibly derived from the lowercase y's shape. |
| 151 | K | Unusual, origin unknown; also said to stand for 250.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-70) |
| 160 | T | Possibly derived from Greek _tetra_, as 4 × 40 = 160. |
| 200 | H | Could also stand for 2 (see also 𐆙, the symbol for the [dupondius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dupondius "Dupondius")). From a barring of two I's. |
| 250 | E |  |
| 300 | B |  |
| 400 | P, G |  |
| 500 | Q | Redundant with D; abbreviates _\_quingenti\__, Latin for 500. Also sometimes used for 500,000.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-71) |
| 800 | Ω | Borrowed from [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_alphabet "Gothic alphabet"). |
| 900 | ϡ | Borrowed from Gothic. |
| 2000 | Z |  |
| 9000 | Ṫ | Cappelli notes that the T with [double dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(diacritic) "Umlaut (diacritic)") is only attested for [Spanish-suited playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-suited_playing_cards "Spanish-suited playing cards"). |

[Chronograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronogram "Chronogram"), messages with dates encoded into them, were popular during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") era. The chronogram would be a phrase containing the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. By putting these letters together, the reader would obtain a number, usually indicating a particular year.

Modern use
----------

By the 11th century, Arabic numerals had been introduced into Europe from [al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"), by way of [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") traders and arithmetic treatises. Roman numerals, however, proved very persistent, remaining in common use in the West well into the 14th and 15th centuries, even in accounting and other business records (where the actual calculations would have been made using an [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus "Abacus")). Replacement by their more convenient "Arabic" equivalents was quite gradual, and Roman numerals are still used today in certain contexts. A few examples of their current use are:

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Carlos_IV_Coin.jpg/330px-Carlos_IV_Coin.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_IV_Coin.jpg)

Spanish [Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_real "Spanish real") using IIII instead of IV as regnal number of [Charles IV of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV_of_Spain "Charles IV of Spain").

*   Names of monarchs and popes, e.g. [Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II "Elizabeth II") of the United Kingdom, [Pope Leo XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIV "Pope Leo XIV"). These are referred to as [regnal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_number "Regnal number") and are usually read as [ordinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numbers_(linguistics) "Ordinal numbers (linguistics)"); e.g. II is pronounced "the second". This tradition began in Europe sporadically in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), gaining widespread use in England during the reign of [Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII "Henry VIII"). Previously, the monarch was not known by numeral but by an [epithet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet "Epithet") such as [Edward the Confessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor "Edward the Confessor"). Some monarchs (e.g. [Charles IV of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV_of_Spain "Charles IV of Spain"), [Louis XIV of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France "Louis XIV of France") and [William IV of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom "William IV of the United Kingdom")) seem to have preferred the use of IIII instead of IV on their coinage (see illustration).
*   [Generational suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name)#Generational_titles "Suffix (name)"), particularly in the U.S., for people sharing the same name across generations, such as [William Howard Taft IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Taft_IV "William Howard Taft IV"). These are also usually read as ordinals.
*   In the [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar#Converting_from_the_Gregorian_Calendar "French Republican Calendar"), initiated during the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), years were numbered by Roman numerals – from the year I (1792) when this calendar was introduced to the year XIV (1805) when it was abandoned.

This usage has also been inconsistent.

In [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics"), [United States rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orbital_launch_systems#United_States "List of orbital launch systems") model variants are sometimes designated by Roman numerals, e.g. [Titan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_I "Titan I"), [Titan II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_II "Titan II"), [Titan III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_III "Titan III"), [Saturn I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_I "Saturn I"), [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V").

In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), the [natural satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite") or "moons" of the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") are [designated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_of_moons#Roman_numeral_designations "Naming of moons") by capital Roman numerals appended to the planet's name. For example, [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)")'s designation is [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn")VI.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-jplsats-disc-73)

In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), Roman numerals are sometimes used to denote the [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(periodic_table) "Group (periodic table)") of the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"), but this has officially been deprecated in favour of Arabic numerals.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Fluck_1988-74) They are also used in the [IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry "IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry"), for the [oxidation number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_number "Oxidation number") of [cations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation "Cation") which can take on several different positive charges. They are also used for naming [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter) "Phase (matter)") of [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(materials_science) "Polymorphism (materials science)")[crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"), such as [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice").

In [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), school grades (in the sense of year-groups rather than test scores) are sometimes referred to by a Roman numeral; for example, "grade IX" is sometimes seen for "grade 9".

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/9th_Aero_Squadron_AEF.jpg/330px-9th_Aero_Squadron_AEF.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:9th_Aero_Squadron_AEF.jpg)

Stylised "IX" represents "9" in unit emblem of [9th Aero Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_Aero_Squadron "9th Aero Squadron") AEF, 1918.

In [entomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology "Entomology"), the broods of the thirteen- and seventeen-year [periodical cicadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas "Periodical cicadas") are identified by Roman numerals.

In [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design "Graphic design"), stylised Roman numerals may represent numeric values.

In [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), Roman numerals are commonly used to help organize legal codes as part of an [alphanumeric outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)#Alphanumeric_outline "Outline (list)").

*   In numbering [UK Acts of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom) "Act of Parliament (United Kingdom)") within a given year (a given [session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_session "Parliamentary session") until 1963), [local acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_and_personal_acts_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)#Local_acts "Local and personal acts of Parliament (United Kingdom)") have lowercase Roman numerals, whereas [public acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)#Public_general_acts "Act of Parliament (United Kingdom)") have plain Arabic numerals and [personal acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_and_personal_acts_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)#Personal_acts "Local and personal acts of Parliament (United Kingdom)") have [italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type "Italic type") Arabic numerals.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-75)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") (including [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), and [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus")), when a graph includes negative numbers, its quadrants are named using I, II, III, and IV.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-76) These quadrant names signify positive numbers on both axes, negative numbers on the x-axis, negative numbers on both axes, and negative numbers on the y-axis, respectively. The use of Roman numerals to designate quadrants avoids confusion, since Arabic numerals are used for the actual data represented in the graph.

In [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") unit designation, Roman numerals are often used to distinguish between units at different levels. This reduces possible confusion, especially when viewing operational or strategic level maps. In particular, army corps are often numbered using Roman numerals (for example, the American XVIII Airborne Corps or the Nazi III Panzerkorps) with Arabic numerals being used for divisions and armies.

In [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music"), Roman numerals are used in several contexts:

*   [Movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music) "Movement (music)") are often numbered using Roman numerals.
*   In [Roman numeral analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis "Roman numeral analysis"), [harmonic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(music) "Function (music)") is identified using Roman numerals.
*   Individual strings of [stringed instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stringed_instruments "Stringed instruments"), such as the [violin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin "Violin"), are often denoted by Roman numerals, with higher numbers denoting lower strings.

In [pharmacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy "Pharmacy"), Roman numerals were used with the now largely obsolete [apothecaries' system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothecaries%27_system "Apothecaries' system") of measurement: including SS to denote "one half" and N to denote "zero".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-Bachenheimer-44)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-77)

In [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography "Photography"), Roman numerals (with zero) are used to denote varying levels of brightness when using the [Zone System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_System "Zone System").

In [seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology "Seismology"), Roman numerals are used to designate degrees of the [Mercalli intensity scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale "Mercalli intensity scale") of earthquakes.

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Eire_Frankng_I-IV-1986.jpg/250px-Eire_Frankng_I-IV-1986.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eire_Frankng_I-IV-1986.jpg)

Example of postage stamp from Ireland (Éire) franked using Roman numeral for the month

In [sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport "Team sport") the team containing the "top" players and representing a nation or province, a [club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_club "Sports club") or a school at the highest level in (say) [rugby union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union "Rugby union") is often called the "1st XV", while a lower-ranking [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket "Cricket") or [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football") team might be the "3rd XI".

In [tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot "Tarot"), Roman numerals (with zero) are often used to denote the cards of the [Major Arcana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana "Major Arcana").

In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland"), Roman numerals were used until the late 1980s to indicate the month on postage [Franking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franking "Franking"). In documents, Roman numerals are sometimes still used to indicate the month to avoid confusion over day/month/year or month/day/year formats.

In [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") and [biblical scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_scholarship "Biblical scholarship"), the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint "Septuagint") is often referred to as LXX, as this translation of the [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") into Greek is named for the legendary number of its translators (_septuaginta_ being Latin for "seventy").

### Modern use in European languages other than English

Some uses that are rare or never seen in English-speaking countries may be relatively common in parts of [continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe "Continental Europe") and in other regions (e.g. [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America")) that use a European language other than English. For instance:

Capital or [small capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps "Small caps") Roman numerals are widely used in [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") to denote **centuries**, e.g. the French _\_xviii e siècle\__[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-78) and the Spanish _\_siglo xviii\__ (not _\_xviii siglo\__) for "18th century". Some Slavic and Turkic languages (especially in and adjacent to Russia) similarly favour Roman numerals (e.g. Russian XVIII век, Azeri _XVIII əsr_ or Polish _wiek XVIII_[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-79)). On the other hand, in [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language") and some [Central European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") Slavic languages, like most [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages "Germanic languages"), one writes "18." (with a period) before the local word for "century" (e.g. Turkish _18. yüzyıl_, Czech _18. století_).

When typing on Russian typewriters, the Roman-numeral "V" was replaced with "У" because the letter "V" was absent in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. Additionally, the Roman-numeral "I" was replaced with "1", since this letter had been removed from the Russian alphabet by the [1918 reform of orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforms_of_Russian_orthography "Reforms of Russian orthography"). For example, XVIII was typed as ХУ111. This style is sometimes maintained even when typing on a computer, either out of habit or due to the inconvenience of switching between Latin and Russian script for one or two letters.

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Yeltsin-authograph-1988.gif/330px-Yeltsin-authograph-1988.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yeltsin-authograph-1988.gif)

[Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin")'s signature, dated 10 November 1988, rendered as 10.XI.'88.

Mixed Roman and Arabic numerals are sometimes used in numeric representations of dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The **month** is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Arabic numerals: "4.VI.1789" and "VI.4.1789" both refer unambiguously to 4 June 1789.

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/DarboLaikas.jpg/250px-DarboLaikas.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DarboLaikas.jpg)

Business hours table on a shop window in [Vilnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius "Vilnius"), Lithuania.

Roman numerals are sometimes used to represent the **days of the week** in hours-of-operation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses,[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-80) and sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday, taken as the first day of the week, is represented by I. Sunday is represented by VII. The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the example case (left), the business opens from 10 AM to 7 PM on weekdays, 10 AM to 5 PM on Saturdays and is [closed on Sundays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_shopping "Sunday shopping"). Note that the listing uses 24-hour time.

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/S6002447_cropped.jpg/250px-S6002447_cropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:S6002447_cropped.jpg)

Sign at 17.9 km on route SS4 [Salaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Salaria "Via Salaria"), north of Rome, Italy.

Roman numerals may also be used for [floor numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_numbering "Floor numbering").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-81)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-82) For instance, apartments in central [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam "Amsterdam") are indicated as 138-III, with both an Arabic numeral (number of the block or house) and a Roman numeral (floor number). The apartment on the ground floor is indicated as _138-huis_.

In Italy, where roads outside built-up areas have [kilometre signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone "Milestone"), major roads and motorways also mark 100-metre subdivisionals, using Roman numerals from I to IX for the smaller intervals. The sign ⁠IX/17⁠ thus marks 17.9 km.

Certain romance-speaking countries use Roman numerals to designate assemblies of their national legislatures. For instance, the composition of the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy")[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Italy "Parliament of Italy") from 2018 to 2022 (elected in the [2018 Italian general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Italian_general_election "2018 Italian general election")) is called the [XVIII Legislature of the Italian Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature_XVIII_of_Italy "Legislature XVIII of Italy") (or more commonly the "XVIII Legislature").

A notable exception to the use of Roman numerals in Europe is in Greece, where [Greek numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals "Greek numerals") (based on the Greek alphabet) are generally used in contexts where Roman numerals would be used elsewhere.

Unicode
-------

The "[Number Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Forms "Number Forms")" block of the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") computer character set standard has a number of [Roman numeral symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerals_in_Unicode#Roman_numerals "Numerals in Unicode") in the range of [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_code_point "Unicode code point") from U+2160 to U+2188.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-UnicodeChartU2150-83) This range includes both upper- and lowercase numerals, as well as pre-combined characters for numbers up to 12. One justification for the existence of pre-combined numbers is to facilitate the setting of multiple-letter numbers (such as VIII) on a single horizontal line in Asian vertical text. The Unicode standard, however, includes special Roman numeral code points for compatibility only, stating that "[f]or most purposes, it is preferable to compose the Roman numerals from sequences of the appropriate Latin letters".[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-84) The block also includes some _[apostrophus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_numeral#Apostrophus)_ symbols for large numbers, an old variant of "L" (50) similar to the Etruscan character, the [Claudian letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian_letter "Claudian letter") "reversed C", etc.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-85)

### Notes

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_ref-6)**Without theorising about causation, it may be noted that IV and IX not only have fewer characters than IIII and VIIII, but are less likely to be confused (especially at a quick glance) with III and VIII.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_ref-10)**This is the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) year in which Wikipedia's cache of this page was last updated, so may be a few hours out of date.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_ref-25)**[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov") once mentioned an "interesting theory" that Romans avoided using IV because it was the initial letters of _IVPITER_, the Latin spelling of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology) "Jupiter (mythology)"), and might have seemed [impious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piety "Piety").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_note-asimov_on_numbers_12-24) He did not say whose theory it was.
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral#cite_ref-58)**XIII = 13 × 100,000 = 1,300,000 and XXXII = 32 × 1000 = 32,000, so 'XIII XXXII = 1,332,000. **p.** is a common abbreviation for _passus_, paces, the Romans counting a pace as two steps.
