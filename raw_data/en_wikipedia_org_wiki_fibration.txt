( August 2025 ) The notion of a fibration generalizes the notion of a fiber bundle and plays an important role in algebraic topology , a branch of mathematics.

Fibrations are used, for example, in Postnikov systems or obstruction theory .

In this article, all mappings are continuous mappings between topological spaces .

Formal definitions [ edit ] Homotopy lifting property [ edit ] A mapping p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} satisfies the homotopy lifting property for a space X {\displaystyle X} if: for every homotopy h : : X × × [ 0 , 1 ] → → B {\displaystyle h\colon X\times [0,1]\to B} and for every mapping (also called lift) h ~ ~ 0 : : X → → E {\displaystyle {\tilde {h}}_{0}\colon X\to E} lifting h | X × × 0 = h 0 {\displaystyle h|_{X\times 0}=h_{0}} (i.e.

h 0 = p ∘ ∘ h ~ ~ 0 {\displaystyle h_{0}=p\circ {\tilde {h}}_{0}} ) there exists a (not necessarily unique) homotopy h ~ ~ : : X × × [ 0 , 1 ] → → E {\displaystyle {\tilde {h}}\colon X\times [0,1]\to E} lifting h {\displaystyle h} (i.e.

h = p ∘ ∘ h ~ ~ {\displaystyle h=p\circ {\tilde {h}}} ) with h ~ ~ 0 = h ~ ~ | X × × 0 .

{\displaystyle {\tilde {h}}_{0}={\tilde {h}}|_{X\times 0}.} The following commutative diagram shows the situation: [ 1 ] : 66 Fibration [ edit ] A fibration (also called Hurewicz fibration) is a mapping p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} satisfying the homotopy lifting property for all spaces X .

{\displaystyle X.} The space B {\displaystyle B} is called base space and the space E {\displaystyle E} is called total space . The fiber over b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b\in B} is the subspace F b = p − − 1 ( b ) ⊆ ⊆ E .

{\displaystyle F_{b}=p^{-1}(b)\subseteq E.} [ 1 ] : 66 Serre fibration [ edit ] A Serre fibration (also called weak fibration) is a mapping p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} satisfying the homotopy lifting property for all CW-complexes .

[ 2 ] : 375-376 Every Hurewicz fibration is a Serre fibration.

Quasifibration [ edit ] A mapping p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} is called quasifibration , if for every b ∈ ∈ B , {\displaystyle b\in B,} e ∈ ∈ p − − 1 ( b ) {\displaystyle e\in p^{-1}(b)} and i ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle i\geq 0} holds that the induced mapping p ∗ ∗ : : π π i ( E , p − − 1 ( b ) , e ) → → π π i ( B , b ) {\displaystyle p_{*}\colon \pi _{i}(E,p^{-1}(b),e)\to \pi _{i}(B,b)} is an isomorphism .

Every Serre fibration is a quasifibration.

[ 3 ] : 241-242 Examples [ edit ] The projection onto the first factor p : : B × × F → → B {\displaystyle p\colon B\times F\to B} is a fibration. That is, trivial bundles are fibrations.

Every covering p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} is a fibration. Specifically, for every homotopy h : : X × × [ 0 , 1 ] → → B {\displaystyle h\colon X\times [0,1]\to B} and every lift h ~ ~ 0 : : X → → E {\displaystyle {\tilde {h}}_{0}\colon X\to E} there exists a uniquely defined lift h ~ ~ : : X × × [ 0 , 1 ] → → E {\displaystyle {\tilde {h}}\colon X\times [0,1]\to E} with p ∘ ∘ h ~ ~ = h .

{\displaystyle p\circ {\tilde {h}}=h.} [ 4 ] : 159 [ 5 ] : 50 Every fiber bundle p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} satisfies the homotopy lifting property for every CW-complex.

[ 2 ] : 379 A fiber bundle with a paracompact and Hausdorff base space satisfies the homotopy lifting property for all spaces.

[ 2 ] : 379 An example of a fibration which is not a fiber bundle is given by the mapping i ∗ ∗ : : X I k → → X ∂ ∂ I k {\displaystyle i^{*}\colon X^{I^{k}}\to X^{\partial I^{k}}} induced by the inclusion i : : ∂ ∂ I k → → I k {\displaystyle i\colon \partial I^{k}\to I^{k}} where k ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} ,} X {\displaystyle X} a topological space and X A = { f : : A → → X } {\displaystyle X^{A}=\{f\colon A\to X\}} is the space of all continuous mappings with the compact-open topology .

[ 4 ] : 198 The Hopf fibration S 1 → → S 3 → → S 2 {\displaystyle S^{1}\to S^{3}\to S^{2}} is a non-trivial fiber bundle and, specifically, a Serre fibration.

Basic concepts [ edit ] Fiber homotopy equivalence [ edit ] A mapping f : : E 1 → → E 2 {\displaystyle f\colon E_{1}\to E_{2}} between total spaces of two fibrations p 1 : : E 1 → → B {\displaystyle p_{1}\colon E_{1}\to B} and p 2 : : E 2 → → B {\displaystyle p_{2}\colon E_{2}\to B} with the same base space is a fibration homomorphism if the following diagram commutes: The mapping f {\displaystyle f} is a fiber homotopy equivalence if in addition a fibration homomorphism g : : E 2 → → E 1 {\displaystyle g\colon E_{2}\to E_{1}} exists, such that the mappings f ∘ ∘ g {\displaystyle f\circ g} and g ∘ ∘ f {\displaystyle g\circ f} are homotopic, by fibration homomorphisms, to the identities Id E 2 {\displaystyle \operatorname {Id} _{E_{2}}} and Id E 1 .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Id} _{E_{1}}.} [ 2 ] : 405-406 Pullback fibration [ edit ] Given a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} and a mapping f : : A → → B {\displaystyle f\colon A\to B} , the mapping p f : : f ∗ ∗ ( E ) → → A {\displaystyle p_{f}\colon f^{*}(E)\to A} is a fibration, where f ∗ ∗ ( E ) = { ( a , e ) ∈ ∈ A × × E | f ( a ) = p ( e ) } {\displaystyle f^{*}(E)=\{(a,e)\in A\times E\ |\ f(a)=p(e)\}} is the pullback and the projections of f ∗ ∗ ( E ) {\displaystyle f^{*}(E)} onto A {\displaystyle A} and E {\displaystyle E} yield the following commutative diagram: The fibration p f {\displaystyle p_{f}} is called the pullback fibration or induced fibration.

[ 2 ] : 405-406 Pathspace fibration [ edit ] With the pathspace construction, any continuous mapping can be extended to a fibration by enlarging its domain to a homotopy equivalent space. This fibration is called pathspace fibration .

The total space E f {\displaystyle E_{f}} of the pathspace fibration for a continuous mapping f : : A → → B {\displaystyle f\colon A\to B} between topological spaces consists of pairs ( a , γ γ ) {\displaystyle (a,\gamma )} with a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} and paths γ γ : : I → → B {\displaystyle \gamma \colon I\to B} with starting point γ γ ( 0 ) = f ( a ) , {\displaystyle \gamma (0)=f(a),} where I = [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle I=[0,1]} is the unit interval . The space E f = { ( a , γ γ ) ∈ ∈ A × × B I | γ γ ( 0 ) = f ( a ) } {\displaystyle E_{f}=\{(a,\gamma )\in A\times B^{I}|\gamma (0)=f(a)\}} carries the subspace topology of A × × B I , {\displaystyle A\times B^{I},} where B I {\displaystyle B^{I}} describes the space of all mappings I → → B {\displaystyle I\to B} and carries the compact-open topology .

The pathspace fibration is given by the mapping p : : E f → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E_{f}\to B} with p ( a , γ γ ) = γ γ ( 1 ) .

{\displaystyle p(a,\gamma )=\gamma (1).} The fiber F f {\displaystyle F_{f}} is also called the homotopy fiber of f {\displaystyle f} and consists of the pairs ( a , γ γ ) {\displaystyle (a,\gamma )} with a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} and paths γ γ : : [ 0 , 1 ] → → B , {\displaystyle \gamma \colon [0,1]\to B,} where γ γ ( 0 ) = f ( a ) {\displaystyle \gamma (0)=f(a)} and γ γ ( 1 ) = b 0 ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle \gamma (1)=b_{0}\in B} holds.

For the special case of the inclusion of the base point i : : b 0 → → B {\displaystyle i\colon b_{0}\to B} , an important example of the pathspace fibration emerges. The total space E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} consists of all paths in B {\displaystyle B} which starts at b 0 .

{\displaystyle b_{0}.} This space is denoted by P B {\displaystyle PB} and is called path space. The pathspace fibration p : : P B → → B {\displaystyle p\colon PB\to B} maps each path to its endpoint, hence the fiber p − − 1 ( b 0 ) {\displaystyle p^{-1}(b_{0})} consists of all closed paths. The fiber is denoted by Ω Ω B {\displaystyle \Omega B} and is called loop space .

[ 2 ] : 407-408 Properties [ edit ] The fibers p − − 1 ( b ) {\displaystyle p^{-1}(b)} over b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b\in B} are homotopy equivalent for each path component of B .

{\displaystyle B.} [ 2 ] : 405 For a homotopy f : : [ 0 , 1 ] × × A → → B {\displaystyle f\colon [0,1]\times A\to B} the pullback fibrations f 0 ∗ ∗ ( E ) → → A {\displaystyle f_{0}^{*}(E)\to A} and f 1 ∗ ∗ ( E ) → → A {\displaystyle f_{1}^{*}(E)\to A} are fiber homotopy equivalent.

[ 2 ] : 406 If the base space B {\displaystyle B} is contractible , then the fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} is fiber homotopy equivalent to the product fibration B × × F → → B .

{\displaystyle B\times F\to B.} [ 2 ] : 406 The pathspace fibration of a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} is very similar to itself. More precisely, the inclusion E ↪ ↪ E p {\displaystyle E\hookrightarrow E_{p}} is a fiber homotopy equivalence.

[ 2 ] : 408 For a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F {\displaystyle F} and contractible total space, there is a weak homotopy equivalence F → → Ω Ω B .

{\displaystyle F\to \Omega B.} [ 2 ] : 408 Puppe sequence [ edit ] For a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F {\displaystyle F} and base point b 0 ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b_{0}\in B} the inclusion F ↪ ↪ F p {\displaystyle F\hookrightarrow F_{p}} of the fiber into the homotopy fiber is a homotopy equivalence . The mapping i : : F p → → E {\displaystyle i\colon F_{p}\to E} with i ( e , γ γ ) = e {\displaystyle i(e,\gamma )=e} , where e ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in E} and γ γ : : I → → B {\displaystyle \gamma \colon I\to B} is a path from p ( e ) {\displaystyle p(e)} to b 0 {\displaystyle b_{0}} in the base space, is a fibration. Specifically it is the pullback fibration of the pathspace fibration P B → → B {\displaystyle PB\to B} along p {\displaystyle p} . This procedure can now be applied again to the fibration i {\displaystyle i} and so on. This leads to a long sequence: ⋯ ⋯ → → F j → → F i → j F p → i E → p B .

{\displaystyle \cdots \to F_{j}\to F_{i}\xrightarrow {j} F_{p}\xrightarrow {i} E\xrightarrow {p} B.} The fiber of i {\displaystyle i} over a point e 0 ∈ ∈ p − − 1 ( b 0 ) {\displaystyle e_{0}\in p^{-1}(b_{0})} consists of the pairs ( e 0 , γ γ ) {\displaystyle (e_{0},\gamma )} where γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is a path from p ( e 0 ) = b 0 {\displaystyle p(e_{0})=b_{0}} to b 0 {\displaystyle b_{0}} , i.e. the loop space Ω Ω B {\displaystyle \Omega B} . The inclusion Ω Ω B ↪ ↪ F i {\displaystyle \Omega B\hookrightarrow F_{i}} of the fiber of i {\displaystyle i} into the homotopy fiber of i {\displaystyle i} is again a homotopy equivalence and iteration yields the sequence: ⋯ ⋯ Ω Ω 2 B → → Ω Ω F → → Ω Ω E → → Ω Ω B → → F → → E → → B .

{\displaystyle \cdots \Omega ^{2}B\to \Omega F\to \Omega E\to \Omega B\to F\to E\to B.} Due to the duality of fibration and cofibration , there also exists a sequence of cofibrations. These two sequences are known as the Puppe sequences or the sequences of fibrations and cofibrations.

[ 2 ] : 407-409 Principal fibration [ edit ] A fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F {\displaystyle F} is called principal , if there exists a commutative diagram: The bottom row is a sequence of fibrations and the vertical mappings are weak homotopy equivalences. Principal fibrations play an important role in Postnikov towers .

[ 2 ] : 412 Long exact sequence of homotopy groups [ edit ] For a Serre fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} there exists a long exact sequence of homotopy groups . For base points b 0 ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b_{0}\in B} and x 0 ∈ ∈ F = p − − 1 ( b 0 ) {\displaystyle x_{0}\in F=p^{-1}(b_{0})} this is given by: ⋯ ⋯ → → π π n ( F , x 0 ) → → π π n ( E , x 0 ) → → π π n ( B , b 0 ) → → π π n − − 1 ( F , x 0 ) → → {\displaystyle \cdots \rightarrow \pi _{n}(F,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(E,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(B,b_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n-1}(F,x_{0})\rightarrow } ⋯ ⋯ → → π π 0 ( F , x 0 ) → → π π 0 ( E , x 0 ) .

{\displaystyle \cdots \rightarrow \pi _{0}(F,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{0}(E,x_{0}).} The homomorphisms π π n ( F , x 0 ) → → π π n ( E , x 0 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(F,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(E,x_{0})} and π π n ( E , x 0 ) → → π π n ( B , b 0 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(E,x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(B,b_{0})} are the induced homomorphisms of the inclusion i : : F ↪ ↪ E {\displaystyle i\colon F\hookrightarrow E} and the projection p : : E → → B .

{\displaystyle p\colon E\rightarrow B.} [ 2 ] : 376 Hopf fibration [ edit ] Hopf fibrations are a family of fiber bundles whose fiber, total space and base space are spheres : S 0 ↪ ↪ S 1 → → S 1 , {\displaystyle S^{0}\hookrightarrow S^{1}\rightarrow S^{1},} S 1 ↪ ↪ S 3 → → S 2 , {\displaystyle S^{1}\hookrightarrow S^{3}\rightarrow S^{2},} S 3 ↪ ↪ S 7 → → S 4 , {\displaystyle S^{3}\hookrightarrow S^{7}\rightarrow S^{4},} S 7 ↪ ↪ S 15 → → S 8 .

{\displaystyle S^{7}\hookrightarrow S^{15}\rightarrow S^{8}.} The long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the hopf fibration S 1 ↪ ↪ S 3 → → S 2 {\displaystyle S^{1}\hookrightarrow S^{3}\rightarrow S^{2}} yields: ⋯ ⋯ → → π π n ( S 1 , x 0 ) → → π π n ( S 3 , x 0 ) → → π π n ( S 2 , b 0 ) → → π π n − − 1 ( S 1 , x 0 ) → → {\displaystyle \cdots \rightarrow \pi _{n}(S^{1},x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(S^{3},x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n}(S^{2},b_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{n-1}(S^{1},x_{0})\rightarrow } ⋯ ⋯ → → π π 1 ( S 1 , x 0 ) → → π π 1 ( S 3 , x 0 ) → → π π 1 ( S 2 , b 0 ) .

{\displaystyle \cdots \rightarrow \pi _{1}(S^{1},x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{1}(S^{3},x_{0})\rightarrow \pi _{1}(S^{2},b_{0}).} This sequence splits into short exact sequences, as the fiber S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} in S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} is contractible to a point: 0 → → π π i ( S 3 ) → → π π i ( S 2 ) → → π π i − − 1 ( S 1 ) → → 0.

{\displaystyle 0\rightarrow \pi _{i}(S^{3})\rightarrow \pi _{i}(S^{2})\rightarrow \pi _{i-1}(S^{1})\rightarrow 0.} This short exact sequence splits because of the suspension homomorphism ϕ ϕ : : π π i − − 1 ( S 1 ) → → π π i ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle \phi \colon \pi _{i-1}(S^{1})\to \pi _{i}(S^{2})} and there are isomorphisms : π π i ( S 2 ) ≅ ≅ π π i ( S 3 ) ⊕ ⊕ π π i − − 1 ( S 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \pi _{i}(S^{2})\cong \pi _{i}(S^{3})\oplus \pi _{i-1}(S^{1}).} The homotopy groups π π i − − 1 ( S 1 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i-1}(S^{1})} are trivial for i ≥ ≥ 3 , {\displaystyle i\geq 3,} so there exist isomorphisms between π π i ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i}(S^{2})} and π π i ( S 3 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i}(S^{3})} for i ≥ ≥ 3.

{\displaystyle i\geq 3.} Analog the fibers S 3 {\displaystyle S^{3}} in S 7 {\displaystyle S^{7}} and S 7 {\displaystyle S^{7}} in S 15 {\displaystyle S^{15}} are contractible to a point. Further the short exact sequences split and there are families of isomorphisms: [ 6 ] : 111 π π i ( S 4 ) ≅ ≅ π π i ( S 7 ) ⊕ ⊕ π π i − − 1 ( S 3 ) {\displaystyle \pi _{i}(S^{4})\cong \pi _{i}(S^{7})\oplus \pi _{i-1}(S^{3})} and π π i ( S 8 ) ≅ ≅ π π i ( S 15 ) ⊕ ⊕ π π i − − 1 ( S 7 ) .

{\displaystyle \pi _{i}(S^{8})\cong \pi _{i}(S^{15})\oplus \pi _{i-1}(S^{7}).} Spectral sequence [ edit ] Spectral sequences are important tools in algebraic topology for computing (co-)homology groups.

The Leray-Serre spectral sequence connects the (co-)homology of the total space and the fiber with the (co-)homology of the base space of a fibration. For a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F , {\displaystyle F,} where the base space is a path connected CW-complex, and an additive homology theory G ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle G_{*}} there exists a spectral sequence: [ 7 ] : 242 H k ( B ; G q ( F ) ) ≅ ≅ E k , q 2 ⟹ ⟹ G k + q ( E ) .

{\displaystyle H_{k}(B;G_{q}(F))\cong E_{k,q}^{2}\implies G_{k+q}(E).} Fibrations do not yield long exact sequences in homology, as they do in homotopy. But under certain conditions, fibrations provide exact sequences in homology. For a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F , {\displaystyle F,} where base space and fiber are path connected , the fundamental group π π 1 ( B ) {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(B)} acts trivially on H ∗ ∗ ( F ) {\displaystyle H_{*}(F)} and in addition the conditions H p ( B ) = 0 {\displaystyle H_{p}(B)=0} for 0 < p < m {\displaystyle 0<p<m} and H q ( F ) = 0 {\displaystyle H_{q}(F)=0} for 0 < q < n {\displaystyle 0<q<n} hold, an exact sequence exists (also known under the name Serre exact sequence): H m + n − − 1 ( F ) → i ∗ ∗ H m + n − − 1 ( E ) → f ∗ ∗ H m + n − − 1 ( B ) → τ τ H m + n − − 2 ( F ) → i ∗ ∗ ⋯ ⋯ → f ∗ ∗ H 1 ( B ) → → 0.

{\displaystyle H_{m+n-1}(F)\xrightarrow {i_{*}} H_{m+n-1}(E)\xrightarrow {f_{*}} H_{m+n-1}(B)\xrightarrow {\tau } H_{m+n-2}(F)\xrightarrow {i^{*}} \cdots \xrightarrow {f_{*}} H_{1}(B)\to 0.} [ 7 ] : 250 This sequence can be used, for example, to prove Hurewicz's theorem or to compute the homology of loopspaces of the form Ω Ω S n : {\displaystyle \Omega S^{n}:} [ 8 ] : 162 H k ( Ω Ω S n ) = { Z ∃ ∃ q ∈ ∈ Z : : k = q ( n − − 1 ) 0 otherwise .

{\displaystyle H_{k}(\Omega S^{n})={\begin{cases}\mathbb {Z} &\exists q\in \mathbb {Z} \colon k=q(n-1)\\0&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}.} For the special case of a fibration p : : E → → S n {\displaystyle p\colon E\to S^{n}} where the base space is a n {\displaystyle n} -sphere with fiber F , {\displaystyle F,} there exist exact sequences (also called Wang sequences ) for homology and cohomology: [ 1 ] : 456 ⋯ ⋯ → → H q ( F ) → i ∗ ∗ H q ( E ) → → H q − − n ( F ) → → H q − − 1 ( F ) → → ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \cdots \to H_{q}(F)\xrightarrow {i_{*}} H_{q}(E)\to H_{q-n}(F)\to H_{q-1}(F)\to \cdots } ⋯ ⋯ → → H q ( E ) → i ∗ ∗ H q ( F ) → → H q − − n + 1 ( F ) → → H q + 1 ( E ) → → ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \cdots \to H^{q}(E)\xrightarrow {i^{*}} H^{q}(F)\to H^{q-n+1}(F)\to H^{q+1}(E)\to \cdots } Orientability [ edit ] For a fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} with fiber F {\displaystyle F} and a fixed commutative ring R {\displaystyle R} with a unit, there exists a contravariant functor from the fundamental groupoid of B {\displaystyle B} to the category of graded R {\displaystyle R} -modules, which assigns to b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b\in B} the module H ∗ ∗ ( F b , R ) {\displaystyle H_{*}(F_{b},R)} and to the path class [ ω ω ] {\displaystyle [\omega ]} the homomorphism h [ ω ω ] ∗ ∗ : : H ∗ ∗ ( F ω ω ( 0 ) , R ) → → H ∗ ∗ ( F ω ω ( 1 ) , R ) , {\displaystyle h[\omega ]_{*}\colon H_{*}(F_{\omega (0)},R)\to H_{*}(F_{\omega (1)},R),} where h [ ω ω ] {\displaystyle h[\omega ]} is a homotopy class in [ F ω ω ( 0 ) , F ω ω ( 1 ) ] .

{\displaystyle [F_{\omega (0)},F_{\omega (1)}].} A fibration is called orientable over R {\displaystyle R} if for any closed path ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } in B {\displaystyle B} the following holds: h [ ω ω ] ∗ ∗ = 1.

{\displaystyle h[\omega ]_{*}=1.} [ 1 ] : 476 Euler characteristic [ edit ] For an orientable fibration p : : E → → B {\displaystyle p\colon E\to B} over the field K {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } with fiber F {\displaystyle F} and path connected base space, the Euler characteristic of the total space is given by: χ χ ( E ) = χ χ ( B ) χ χ ( F ) .

{\displaystyle \chi (E)=\chi (B)\chi (F).} Here the Euler characteristics of the base space and the fiber are defined over the field K {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } .
