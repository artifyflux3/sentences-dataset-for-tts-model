The transformation was invented by Danish mathematician Johannes Hjelmslev . It utilizes Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky 's 23rd theorem [ 1 ] from his work Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels .

The Hjelmslev transformation is a method of mapping an infinite line into a finite one in hyperbolic geometry .

Lobachevsky observes, using a combination of his 16th and 23rd theorems, that it is a fundamental characteristic of hyperbolic geometry that there must exist a distinct angle of parallelism for any given line length.

[ 2 ] Let us say for the length AE, its angle of parallelism is angle BAF. This being the case, line AH and EJ will be hyperparallel , and therefore will never meet. Consequently, any line drawn perpendicular to base AE between A and E must necessarily cross line AH at some finite distance.

Johannes Hjelmslev discovered from this a method of compressing an entire hyperbolic plane into a finite circle.

Construction [ edit ] Formalisation [ edit ] The Hjelmslev transformation is a function designated as H ( P ) {\displaystyle H(P)} which operates upon all points P n {\displaystyle P_{n}} in hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) space. Given an angle α α {\displaystyle \alpha } such that 0 < α α < π π 2 {\displaystyle 0<\alpha <{\frac {\pi }{2}}} , and an origin O {\displaystyle O} , this mapping yields images P n ′ {\displaystyle P'_{n}} where the following properties are preserved: The image of a circle with a center at O {\displaystyle O} is a circle with a center at O {\displaystyle O} .

The image of a rectilinear angle is a rectilinear angle.

Any angle with vertex O {\displaystyle O} is mapped onto itself, i.e. any angle with vertex O {\displaystyle O} is preserved.

The image of a right angle with one side passing through O {\displaystyle O} is a right angle with one side passing through O {\displaystyle O} .

The image of any straight line will be a finite straight line segment.

Finally, the point order is maintained throughout a transformation, i.e. if B is between A and C, the image of B will be between the image of A and the image of C.

This function is useful in the studies of hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) space because it produces characteristic figures of parallel lines. Given a set of two parallel lines A B ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}} , C D ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {CD}}} such that A B ¯ ¯ ∥ ∥ C D ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}\parallel {\overline {CD}}} , the resulting images A ′ B ′ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {A'B'}}} , C ′ D ′ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {C'D'}}} will form a triangle △ △ A ′ B ′ I C ′ D ′ {\displaystyle \triangle A'B'IC'D'} with an imaginary vertex I {\displaystyle I} in their direction of parallelism.

Transformation of a single point P {\displaystyle P} into image P ′ {\displaystyle P'} [ edit ] Given α α {\displaystyle \alpha } , O {\displaystyle O} , P {\displaystyle P} , in order to find the P ′ {\displaystyle P'} (image) of P {\displaystyle P} . First draw the line segment O P ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OP}}} , connecting the point P {\displaystyle P} to the origin O {\displaystyle O} . Next, construct an auxiliary line O Q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OQ}}} such that ∠ ∠ P O Q = α α {\displaystyle \angle POQ=\alpha } . Point Q {\displaystyle Q} is only necessary to define the line O Q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OQ}}} .

Line O Q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OQ}}} at angle α α {\displaystyle \alpha } from O P ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OP}}} .

Now construct the perpendicular line P P ″ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {PP''}}} passing through the point P {\displaystyle P} , perpendicular to O Q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OQ}}} . This will form the right angle ∠ ∠ O P ″ P {\displaystyle \angle OP''P} at point P ″ {\displaystyle P''} : Perpendicular P P ″ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {PP''}}} onto O Q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OQ}}} .

Using line segment O P ″ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OP''}}} as a radius, construct a circle with center O {\displaystyle O} such that the circumference of said circle intersects O P ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OP}}} at a point P ′ {\displaystyle \color {red}P'} . Thus, we obtain the point P ′ {\displaystyle \color {red}P'} on line segment O P {\displaystyle OP} , which is the Hjelmslev transformation H ( P ) {\displaystyle H(P)} of the given point P {\displaystyle P} .

H ( P ) = P ′ {\displaystyle H(P)=\color {red}P'} : Point P ′ {\displaystyle P'} from radius O P ″ ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {OP''}}} .

The Hjelmslev Disk [ edit ] Let P 1 P 2 ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {P_{1}P_{2}}}} be parallel to P 3 P 4 ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {P_{3}P_{4}}}} , where ∠ ∠ P 3 P 1 P 2 {\displaystyle \angle P_{3}P_{1}P_{2}} is the angle of parallelism. By performing the transformation for every point on the two parallel lines, we yield the Hjelmslev circle: The circumference of the circle created does not have a corresponding location within the plane, and therefore, the product of a Hjelmslev transformation is more aptly called a Hjelmslev Disk . Likewise, when this transformation is extended in all three dimensions, it is referred to as a Hjelmslev Ball .

A completed Hjelmslev disk representing two intersecting lines A completed Hjelmslev disk representing two hyperparallel lines A completed Hjelmslev disk representing two ultraparallel lines The Hjelmslev transformation and the Klein model [ edit ] If we represent hyperbolic space by means of the Klein model , and take the center of the Hjelmslev transformation to be the center point of the Klein model, then the Hjelmslev transformation maps points in the unit disk to points in a disk centered at the origin with a radius less than one. Given a real number k, the Hjelmslev transformation, if we ignore rotations, is in effect what we obtain by mapping a vector u representing a point in the Klein model to
ku, with 0<k<1. It is therefore in terms of the model a uniform scaling which sends lines to lines and so forth. To beings living in a hyperbolic space it might be a suitable way of making a map.
