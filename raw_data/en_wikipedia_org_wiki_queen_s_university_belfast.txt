The university received its charter in 1845 as part of the Queen's University of Ireland and opened four years later, together with University of Galway (as Queen's College, Galway ) and University College Cork (as Queen's College, Cork ).

Queen's offers approximately 300 academic degree programmes at various levels.

History [ edit ] Queen's University Belfast has roots in the Belfast Academical Institution, which was founded in 1810 and which remains as the Royal Belfast Academical Institution .

[ 7 ] The present university was first chartered as "Queen's College, Belfast" when it was associated with the simultaneously founded Queen's College, Cork , and Queen's College, Galway on 30 December 1845 as part of the Queen's University of Ireland – founded to encourage higher education for Catholics and Presbyterians , as a counterpart to Trinity College, Dublin , then an almost exclusively Anglican institution.

[ 7 ] Queen's College, Belfast, opened in 1849.

[ 7 ] Its main building, the Lanyon Building, was designed by the English-born architect, Sir Charles Lanyon .
At its opening, it had 23 professors and 195 students.

[ 8 ] Some early students at Queen's University Belfast took University of London examinations.

[ 9 ] The Lanyon Building The Lanyon Building Gates The Irish Universities Act 1908 dissolved the Royal University of Ireland , which had replaced the Queen's University of Ireland in 1879, and created two separate universities: the current National University of Ireland and Queen's University of Belfast.

[ 7 ] Parliamentary representation [ edit ] Main articles: Queen's University of Belfast (UK Parliament constituency) and Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency) The university was one of only eight United Kingdom universities to hold a parliamentary seat in the House of Commons at Westminster until such representation was abolished in 1950. The university was also represented in the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1920 to 1968, when graduates elected four members.

Queen's University Belfast Map Contemporary university life [ edit ] On 20 June 2006, the university announced a £259 million investment programme focusing on facilities, recruitment and research.

[ 10 ] One of the outcomes of this investment has been a new university library; the McClay library was designed by Boston-based architects Shepley Bulfinch , working in association with Belfast architects, Robinson Patterson Partnership, and opened in July 2009. The building has been named in honour of Sir Allen McClay , a major benefactor of Queen's University and of the Library.

[ 11 ] In June 2010, the university announced the launch of a £7.5 million Ansin international research hub with Seagate Technology .

[ 12 ] Also in that year, Queen's was one of the largest employers in Northern Ireland, with a total workforce of 3,903, of whom 2,414 were members of academic, academic-related and research staff and 1,489 were administrative employees.

[ 13 ] Campus [ edit ] Whitla Hall Lanyon Quadrangle The Thomas J. Moran Graduate School Students in the adjacent Botanic Gardens In addition to the main campus on the southern fringes of Belfast city centre, the university has two associated university colleges , St Mary's and Stranmillis , located in the west and south-west of the city respectively. These colleges offer teacher training for those who wish to pursue teaching careers and a range of degree courses, all of which are centred around a liberal arts core.

Although the university refers to its main site as a campus, [ 14 ] the university's buildings are spread over a number of public streets in South Belfast; primarily, University Road, University Square, University Street, Malone Road and Stranmillis Road , with other departments located further afield such as in Titanic Quarter and Portaferry .

Organisation and governance [ edit ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Academic life at Queen's is organised into fifteen schools across three faculties: the Faculty of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences (AHSS); the Faculty of Engineering & Physical Sciences (EPS); and the Faculty of Medicine, Health & Life Sciences (MHLS).

[ 45 ] The Sunday Times has described the Queen's admissions policy as "among the most socially inclusive in Britain and Northern Ireland".

[ 45 ] 99.5% of first degree entrants are from state schools , [ 46 ] although this is mainly due to the lack of private schools in Northern Ireland. The university gives offers of admission to 86.1% of its applicants, the 3rd highest amongst the Russell Group .

[ 47 ] In the 2023/24 academic year, the total student population was 24,915, of whom 18,310 were undergraduates and 6,605 postgraduates.

[ 4 ] In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 87:4:9 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 56:44.

[ 48 ] There was also a total student population of 2,250 at its St Mary's and Stranmillis university colleges as of 2013/2014.

[ 5 ] The university was established with the aim of attracting both Protestant and Catholic students. While the university does not publish data on the religion affiliation of its students, Rupert Taylor , who conducted his PhD research on the university during The Troubles , argued in an article published in 1988 that "Whilst in the past, especially before the Second World War, Catholics were under-represented this is not currently the case". Taylor cites data showing that Catholic representation among undergraduates rose from 21.9 per cent in 1958/59 to 27.4 per cent in 1968/69 and 42.5 per cent in 1978/79.

[ 49 ] By the late 1990s, 54 per cent of Queen's students were Catholics, compared to a 48 per cent share of the Northern Ireland population aged 18–25.

[ 50 ] The growing share of Catholics in the student population is partially due to the tendency of middle-class Protestants to attend university in Great Britain rather than in Northern Ireland.

[ 49 ] In 2009, Queen's signed a joint venture partnership with INTO University Partnerships , creating INTO Queen's University Belfast . The INTO centre is based on campus and provides a foundation year for international students who want to study at the university.

All students at the university are automatic members of the union, making it one of the largest unions on a single campus in Ireland and the UK. It is administered by the Students' Representative Council (SRC) (elected every October, on a faculty basis) and an executive (elected in March), who manage the operations of the union in conjunction with several full-time staff.

The old union building closed at the end of August 2018 to make way for construction of the new Students' Union building. Interim facilities were provided in other university buildings on Elmwood Avenue and, for the Speakeasy bar, an acquired space on the Lisburn Road (opposite the Medical Biology Centre).

The new Students' Union building, officially named One Elmwood opened to students on 5 September 2022 and houses the Students' Union, Student Guidance Services, the Union bar, and Mandela Hall. It also houses a café called Social and a SPAR retail outlet under the name Union Shop.

Commercial services including a shop, kitchen lounge area and coffee franchise are also provided by the union. The Mandela Hall hosts numerous concerts each year as well as the majority the students' union's club nights.  Student Disability, Student Wellbeing, Student Finance, Careers, Learning Development service and other services are also provided.

Riddel Hall Clubs and societies [ edit ] More than fifty sporting clubs and over one hundred non-sporting societies are recognised by the Students' Union Council and are therefore eligible to apply for an annual grant from the university.

[ 57 ] The university provides accommodation on a purpose-built student village called Elms Village, which has its own bar and shop, located on the Malone Road , south of the main campus, as well as in a number of houses in the South Belfast area, including at College Gardens and on Mount Charles.

[ 58 ] Cultural life [ edit ] The university had hosted the annual Belfast Festival at Queen's since 1961 but announced in March 2015 that it would not continue to fund the festival.

[ 59 ] It runs the hugely successful Queen's Film Theatre , described as Northern Ireland's leading independent cinema, [ 60 ] the Brian Friel Theatre and an art gallery, the Naughton Gallery at Queen's , which is a registered museum.

[ 61 ] In 2008 the Naughton Gallery was awarded the Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] The Queen's Physical Education Centre (abbreviated to and known widely as the PEC) is one of the largest sports centres in Ireland or the UK. This building houses many squash courts, several climbing walls and is home to QUB's senior men's and women's basketball teams.

[ 67 ] The University Playing Fields, also known as Malone Playing Fields, is located just over 2 miles (3.2 km) from the main campus, comprising 17 pitches for rugby , association football, Gaelic football , hockey , hurling , camogie , and cricket . In addition, there are three netball courts, nine tennis courts, and an athletics arena where the Mary Peters Track is situated.
