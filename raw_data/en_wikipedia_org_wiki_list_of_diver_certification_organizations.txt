These include certification in cave diving , commercial diving , recreational diving , technical diving and freediving .

Diver certification agencies are organisations which issue certification of competence in diving skills under their own name, and which train, assess, certify and register the instructors licensed to present courses following the standards for the certification they issue. They are expected to provide quality assurance for the training done to their standards by licensed schools and instructors.
