The College of Saint Benedict is a college for women in St. Joseph and Saint John's University is a university for men in Collegeville . Students at the institutions have a shared curriculum and access to the resources of both campuses. Together, the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University offer over 70 areas of study to undergraduate students, plus graduate programs in nursing and theology.

History [ edit ] College of Saint Benedict [ edit ] Tennis courts, 1918 The College of Saint Benedict opened in 1913, with six students enrolled, and grew out of St. Benedict's Academy, which was founded by Saint Benedict's Monastery in 1889. The Benedictine community incorporated CSB in 1961.

[ 6 ] In addition to its undergraduate offerings, CSB offers three graduate nursing tracks [ 7 ] that confer Doctor of Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing degrees.

Saint John's University [ edit ] Saint John's University is the oldest continuously operating institution of higher learning in Minnesota. It was founded in 1857 by the Benedictine monks of Saint John's Abbey . The Benedictine community incorporated SJU in 2012.

In addition to its undergraduate offerings, SJU includes Saint John's School of Theology and Seminary [ 8 ] (SOT), a graduate school that confers Master of Divinity and master of arts degrees and also prepares seminarians for the priesthood.

Minnesota Public Radio began on January 22, 1967, when KSJR signed on from the campus of Saint John's University. The station's director of broadcasting was SJU alumnus Bill Kling .

SJU has produced its own coarse-grained bread, Johnnie Bread, since 1856, and used the proceeds to fund projects such as the Abbey Church.

[ 9 ] Saint John's University operated St. John's Indian Industrial School, a Native American residential school from 1885 to 1896. In 1888, Indigenous residential school students represented 47 percent of the university's student population.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Institutional partnership [ edit ] Starting in 1955, CSB and SJU began offering joint evening classes, where men and women attend classes together on both campuses. They began sharing a common academic program in the 1960s, and a classes now are co-educational and taught by a shared faculty of approximately 300 professors, mostly full-time, permanent appointees. About 3,000 students are enrolled in CSB and SJU.

Prior to 2022, the two institutions were led by separate presidents. Brian J. Bruess became the first person to serve as president of both the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University on July 1, 2022, succeeding transitional presidents Laurie Hamen and James Mullen.

[ 12 ] Academics [ edit ] Ninety percent of CSB and SJU graduates finish in four years, 95% of CSB and SJU students receive financial aid, and 95% of CSB and SJU alums rate their college experience as good or excellent.

The Institute of International Education ranks CSB and SJU among the top baccalaureate institutions in the nation for the number of students who study abroad.

[ 23 ] According to Open Doors 2018, CSB and SJU ranked second in the nation among undergraduate institutions for participation in semester-long study abroad programs.

This gift is now used to fund student experiences and research as well as provide financial assistance for students completing unpaid internships.

[ 27 ] Campus [ edit ] Marcel Breuer 's Saint John's Abbey Church The campuses are located on 3,500 acres (1,400 ha) of forests, prairies, and lakes. Since CSB and SJU are located about three and a half miles apart, a regular inter-campus bus service [ 28 ] known as "The Link" connects the campuses.

Marcel Breuer , renowned Brutalist architect, designed several buildings on the Saint John's campus in the 1960s, including the Saint John's Abbey Church and bell banner; Alcuin Library; Peter Engel Science Center; the Ecumenical Institute, and Saints Thomas, Bernard, Boniface, and Patrick Residence Halls.

[ 29 ] The central cores of the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University are both listed as historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] The campus area first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census with a population of 1,585.

[ 32 ] Sustainability [ edit ] CSB and SJU were listed in "The Princeton Review's Guide to 361 Green Colleges: 2016 Edition" as an institution that "demonstrates notable commitments to sustainability in their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation." [ 33 ] The campuses each have their own sustainability office to foster a strong culture of sustainability among the students and the broader community. The institutions signed the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) in 2007, which formalized their goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. Dramatic steps have been taken by CSB/SJU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the most recent report, Saint John's reported a 56 per cent reduction in emissions since 2008 levels.

[ 34 ] Both institutions also complete STARS reports on sustainability and are signatories of the Catholic Climate Covenant.

[ 35 ] Saint John's Abbey Energy Farm.

The Saint John's Abbey is well known for having one of the largest solar fields in the state.

[ 36 ] The original 3.9-acre facility was built in 2009, and its tracking panels provide the university with about 4% of its annual energy needs and up to 20% of its real-time needs in peak conditions. In 2014, the Solar Farm was expanded to include 616 additional fixed panels.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] These new panels will allow the Solar Farm to produce more than 600 kilowatts of electricity—enough energy to power up to 30% of the SJU campus in peak conditions, and 6% of its energy annually. This project creates a research opportunity for students and others to compare the performance differences between the two types of panels.

[ 39 ] Fine arts [ edit ] Fine Arts Programming is a department of CSB and SJU that presents professional performances and art exhibitions from a range of national and international artists, and also supports and enhances the academic mission of CSB-SJU through its programming, resources, and personnel. Events take place in either the Benedicta Arts Center , a performing and visual arts center located on the CSB campus, or the Stephen B. Humphrey Theater or Alice R. Rogers Gallery and Target Gallery in the Art Center at SJU.

[ 40 ] The Benedicta Arts Center is home to Escher Auditorium, Gorecki Family Theater, Colman Black Box Theater, Darnall Amphitheater, Helgeson Dance Studio, Gorecki Gallery & Gallery Lounge, the BAC Box Office, and classroom and rehearsal spaces, faculty and staff offices, and other music, theater, and art-related spaces.

It also features an opinion section, with articles sourced via submissions from students, faculty, and community members.

The Record is a member of the Associated Collegiate Press (ACP) and the Minnesota Newspaper Association, and has won awards from each body for its work. Most recently, it took home second place accolades for General Excellence at the 2019 ACP "Best of the Midwest" awards.

[ 51 ] KJNB: The official CSB/SJU student-run radio station allows students to host an hour-long talk and music-oriented shows. Broadcasts are streamed online, on closed-circuit campus TV Channel 8. When KJNB first started out in 1954 (as KSJU), it was a carrier-current AM station located in the basement of Mary Hall, which broadcast on FM from 1977 to 1988. In 2001, the studio moved to its current location in the lower level of Guild Hall. New automation software was recently purchased "to allow for operating, organizing, and scheduling the streaming audio content.

In the process of filming, a small group of students from ETL travel to the international location to film in the country, and return to CSB and SJU to share their film.

[ 52 ] The Saint John's Bible [ edit ] The Saint John's Bible is an entirely handwritten and illuminated Bible, believed to be the first handwritten and illuminated Bible commissioned by a monastery since the invention of the printing press.
