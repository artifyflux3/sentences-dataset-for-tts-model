In mathematics , specifically linear algebra , a degenerate bilinear form f ( x , y ) on a vector space V is a bilinear form such that the map from V to V ∗ (the dual space of V ) given by v ↦ ( x ↦ f ( x , v )) is not an isomorphism .  An equivalent definition when V is finite-dimensional is that it has a non-trivial kernel : there exist some non-zero x in V such that f ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=0\,} for all y ∈ ∈ V .

{\displaystyle \,y\in V.} Nondegenerate forms [ edit ] A nondegenerate or nonsingular form is a bilinear form that is not degenerate, meaning that v ↦ ↦ ( x ↦ ↦ f ( x , v ) ) {\displaystyle v\mapsto (x\mapsto f(x,v))} is an isomorphism , or equivalently in finite dimensions, if and only if [ 1 ] f ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=0} for all y ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle y\in V} implies that x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} .

Using the determinant [ edit ] If V is finite-dimensional then, relative to some basis for V , a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the associated matrix is zero – if and only if the matrix is singular , and accordingly degenerate forms are also called singular forms . Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the associated matrix is non-singular , and accordingly nondegenerate forms are also referred to as non-singular forms . These statements are independent of the chosen basis.

Related notions [ edit ] If for a quadratic form Q there is a non-zero vector v ∈ V such that Q ( v ) = 0, then Q is an isotropic quadratic form . If Q has the same sign for all non-zero vectors, it is a definite quadratic form or an anisotropic quadratic form .

There is the closely related notion of a unimodular form and a perfect pairing ; these agree over fields but not over general rings .

Examples [ edit ] The study of real, quadratic algebras shows the distinction between types of quadratic forms. The product zz * is a quadratic form for each of the complex numbers , split-complex numbers , and dual numbers . For z = x + ε y , the dual number form is x 2 which is a degenerate quadratic form . The split-complex case is an isotropic form, and the complex case is a definite form.

The most important examples of nondegenerate forms are inner products and symplectic forms .

Symmetric nondegenerate forms are important generalizations of inner products, in that often all that is required is that the map V → → V ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle V\to V^{*}} be an isomorphism, not positivity. For example, a manifold with an inner product structure on its tangent spaces is a Riemannian manifold , while relaxing this to a symmetric nondegenerate form yields a pseudo-Riemannian manifold .

( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Note that in an infinite-dimensional space, we can have a bilinear form ƒ for which v ↦ ↦ ( x ↦ ↦ f ( x , v ) ) {\displaystyle v\mapsto (x\mapsto f(x,v))} is injective but not surjective .  For example, on the space of continuous functions on a closed bounded interval , the form f ( ϕ ϕ , ψ ψ ) = ∫ ∫ ψ ψ ( x ) ϕ ϕ ( x ) d x {\displaystyle f(\phi ,\psi )=\int \psi (x)\phi (x)\,dx} is not surjective: for instance, the Dirac delta functional is in the dual space but not of the required form.  On the other hand, this bilinear form satisfies f ( ϕ ϕ , ψ ψ ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(\phi ,\psi )=0} for all ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } implies that ψ ψ = 0.

{\displaystyle \psi =0.\,} In such a case where ƒ satisfies injectivity (but not necessarily surjectivity), ƒ is said to be weakly nondegenerate .

[ citation needed ] Terminology [ edit ] If f vanishes identically on all vectors it is said to be totally degenerate . Given any bilinear form f on V the set of vectors { x ∈ ∈ V ∣ ∣ f ( x , y ) = 0 for all y ∈ ∈ V } {\displaystyle \{x\in V\mid f(x,y)=0{\mbox{ for all }}y\in V\}} forms a totally degenerate subspace of V . The map f is nondegenerate if and only if this subspace is trivial.

Geometrically, an isotropic line of the quadratic form corresponds to a point of the associated quadric hypersurface in projective space . Such a line is additionally isotropic for the bilinear form if and only if the corresponding point is a singularity . Hence, over an algebraically closed field , Hilbert's Nullstellensatz guarantees that the quadratic form always has isotropic lines, while the bilinear form has them if and only if the surface is singular.
