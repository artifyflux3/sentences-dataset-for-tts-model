He had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time, integrating pure and applied sciences and making major contributions to many fields, including mathematics , physics , economics , computing , and statistics . He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA .
