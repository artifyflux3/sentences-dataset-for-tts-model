A remnant natural area , also known as remnant habitat , is an ecological community containing native flora and fauna that has not been significantly disturbed by destructive activities such as agriculture , logging , pollution , development , fire suppression, or non-native species invasion .

[ 1 ] The more disturbed an area has been, the less characteristic it becomes of remnant habitat. Remnant areas are also described as " biologically intact " or "ecologically intact." [ 2 ] Remnant natural areas are often used as reference ecosystems in ecological restoration projects.

[ 3 ] Ecology [ edit ] A remnant natural area can be described in terms of its natural quality or biological integrity , which is the extent to which it has the internal biodiversity and abiotic elements to replicate itself over time.

[ 4 ] Another definition of biological integrity is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity , and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region." [ 5 ] Abiotic elements determining the quality of a natural area may include factors such as hydrologic connectivity or fire. In areas that have been dredged , drained , or dammed , the altered hydrology can destroy a remnant natural area. Similarly, too much or too little fire can degrade or destroy a remnant natural area.

[ 4 ] Remnant natural areas are characterized by the presence of " conservative " plants and animals—organisms that are restricted to or highly characteristic of areas that have not been disturbed by humans.

[ 6 ] Tools to measure aspects of natural areas quality in remnant areas include Floristic Quality Assessment and the Macroinvertebrate Community Index .

Examples [ edit ] In the upper Midwestern United States , remnant natural areas date prior to European settlement , going back to the end of the Wisconsinian Glaciation approximately 15,000 years ago.

[ 1 ] Diverse remnant plant community examples in that region include tallgrass prairie , beech-maple forest , savannas , bogs , and fens .

[ 7 ] Remnant natural areas in Illinois have largely been classified by the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory as Category I "high quality terrestrial or wetland natural communities." [ 8 ] In Australia , remnant habitats are sometimes called " bushland ," and include communities such as forest, woodland, grasslands, mallee , coastal heathland , and rainforest .
