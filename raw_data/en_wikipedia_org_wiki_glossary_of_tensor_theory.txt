This is a **glossary of tensor theory**. For expositions of [tensor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensor_theory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tensor theory (page does not exist)") from different points of view, see:

For some history of the abstract theory see also [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra").

[Ricci calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_calculus "Ricci calculus")The earliest foundation of tensor theory – tensor index notation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tensor_theory#cite_note-1)[Order of a tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_order "Tensor order")The components of a tensor with respect to a basis is an indexed array. The _order_ of a tensor is the number of indices needed. Some texts may refer to the tensor order using the term _degree_ or _rank_.[Rank of a tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_rank "Tensor rank")The rank of a tensor is the minimum number of rank-one tensor that must be summed to obtain the tensor. A rank-one tensor may be defined as expressible as the outer product of the number of nonzero vectors needed to obtain the correct order.[Dyadic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_tensor "Dyadic tensor")A _dyadic_ tensor is a tensor of order two, and may be represented as a square [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"). In contrast, a _dyad_ is specifically a dyadic tensor of rank one.[Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation "Einstein notation")This notation is based on the understanding that whenever a multidimensional array contains a repeated index letter, the default interpretation is that the product is summed over all permitted values of the index. For example, if _a ij_ is a matrix, then under this convention _a ii_ is its [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(matrix) "Trace (matrix)"). The Einstein convention is widely used in physics and engineering texts, to the extent that if summation is not to be applied, it is normal to note that explicitly.[Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta "Kronecker delta")[Levi-Civita symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_symbol "Levi-Civita symbol")[Covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") tensor[Contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") tensor The classical interpretation is by components. For example, in the differential form _a i dx i_ the **components**_a i_ are a covariant vector. That means all indices are lower; contravariant means all indices are upper.[Mixed tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_tensor "Mixed tensor")This refers to any tensor that has both lower and upper indices.Cartesian tensor Cartesian tensors are widely used in various branches of [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics"), such as [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics") and [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)"). In classical [continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics"), the space of interest is usually 3-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), as is the tangent space at each point. If we restrict the local coordinates to be [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") with the same scale centered at the point of interest, the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") is the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta "Kronecker delta"). This means that there is no need to distinguish covariant and contravariant components, and furthermore there is no need to distinguish tensors and [tensor densities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_density "Tensor density"). All [Cartesian-tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tensor "Cartesian tensor") indices are written as subscripts. [Cartesian tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tensor "Cartesian tensor") achieve considerable computational simplification at the cost of generality and of some theoretical insight.[Contraction of a tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction "Tensor contraction")[Raising and lowering indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_and_lowering_indices "Raising and lowering indices")[Symmetric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_tensor "Symmetric tensor")[Antisymmetric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_tensor "Antisymmetric tensor")[Multiple cross products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_cross_products "Multiple cross products")
This avoids the initial use of components, and is distinguished by the explicit use of the tensor product symbol.

Tensor product If _v_ and _w_ are vectors in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")_V_ and _W_ respectively, then ![Image 1: {\displaystyle v\otimes w}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/710c0ffa6ca79aa8934b9a477f5e675068d63e9c)is a tensor in ![Image 2: {\displaystyle V\otimes W.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e460ff27de7aa583107fe31092296bccd0714236)That is, the ⊗ operation is a [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation"), but it takes values into a fresh space (it is in a strong sense _external_). The ⊗ operation is a [bilinear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map"); but no other conditions are applied to it.Pure tensor A pure tensor of _V_ ⊗ _W_ is one that is of the form _v_ ⊗ _w_.It could be written dyadically _a i b j_, or more accurately _a i b j_**e**_i_ ⊗ **f**_j_, where the **e**_i_ are a basis for _V_ and the **f**_j_ a basis for _W_. Therefore, unless _V_ and _W_ have the same dimension, the array of components need not be square. Such _pure_ tensors are not generic: if both _V_ and _W_ have dimension greater than 1, there will be tensors that are not pure, and there will be non-linear conditions for a tensor to satisfy, to be pure. For more see [Segre embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segre_embedding "Segre embedding").Tensor algebra In the tensor algebra _T_(_V_) of a vector space _V_, the operation ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \otimes }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de29098f5a34ee296a505681a0d5e875070f2aea) becomes a normal (internal) [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation"). A consequence is that _T_(_V_) has infinite dimension unless _V_ has dimension 0. The [free algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_algebra "Free algebra") on a set _X_ is for practical purposes the same as the tensor algebra on the vector space with _X_ as basis.Hodge star operator Exterior power The [wedge product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product "Wedge product") is the anti-symmetric form of the ⊗ operation. The quotient space of _T_(_V_) on which it becomes an internal operation is the _[exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior\_algebra "Exterior algebra")_ of _V_; it is a [graded algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_algebra "Graded algebra"), with the graded piece of weight _k_ being called the _k_-th **exterior power** of _V_.Symmetric power, symmetric algebra This is the invariant way of constructing [polynomial algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_algebra "Polynomial algebra").[Metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")[Strain tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_tensor "Strain tensor")[Stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor")
