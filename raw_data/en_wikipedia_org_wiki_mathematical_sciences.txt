Statistics , for example, is mathematical in its methods but grew out of bureaucratic and scientific observations , [ 1 ] which merged with inverse probability and then grew through applications in some areas of physics , biometrics , and the social sciences to become its own separate, though closely allied, field.

Theoretical astronomy , theoretical physics , theoretical and applied mechanics , continuum mechanics , mathematical chemistry , actuarial science , computer science , computational science , data science , operations research , quantitative biology , control theory , econometrics , geophysics and mathematical geosciences are likewise other fields often considered part of the mathematical sciences.

Some institutions offer degrees in mathematical sciences (e.g. the United States Military Academy , Stanford University , and University of Khartoum ) or applied mathematical sciences (for example, the University of Rhode Island ).
