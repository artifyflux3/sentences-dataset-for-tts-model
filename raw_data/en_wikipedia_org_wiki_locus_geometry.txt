Each curve in this example is a locus defined as the conchoid of the point P and the line l . In this example, P is 8 cm from l .

In geometry , a locus (plural: loci ) (Latin word for "place", "location") is a set of all points (commonly, a line , a line segment , a curve or a surface ), whose location satisfies or is determined by one or more specified conditions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The set of the points that satisfy some property is often called the locus of a point satisfying this property. The use of the singular in this formulation is a witness that, until the end of the 19th century, mathematicians did not consider infinite sets . Instead of viewing lines and curves as sets of points, they viewed them as places where a point may be located or may move.

History and philosophy [ edit ] Until the beginning of the 20th century, a geometrical shape (for example a curve) was not considered as an infinite set of points; rather, it was considered as an entity on which a point may be located or on which it moves. Thus a circle in the Euclidean plane was defined as the locus of a point that is at a given distance of a fixed point, the center of the circle. In modern mathematics, similar concepts are more frequently reformulated by describing shapes as sets; for instance, one says that the circle is the set of points that are at a given distance from the center.

[ 3 ] In contrast to the set-theoretic view, the old formulation avoids considering infinite collections, as avoiding the actual infinite was an important philosophical position of earlier mathematicians.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Once set theory became the universal basis over which the whole mathematics is built, [ 6 ] the term of locus became rather old-fashioned.

[ 7 ] Nevertheless, the word is still widely used, mainly for a concise formulation, for example: Critical locus , the set of the critical points of a differentiable function .

Zero locus or vanishing locus , the set of points where a function vanishes, in that it takes the value zero.

Singular locus , the set of the singular points of an algebraic variety .

Connectedness locus , the subset of the parameter set of a family of rational functions for which the Julia set of the function is connected.

More recently, techniques such as the theory of schemes , and the use of category theory instead of set theory to give a foundation to mathematics, have returned to notions more like the original definition of a locus as an object in itself rather than as a set of points.

[ 5 ] Examples in plane geometry [ edit ] Examples from plane geometry include: The set of points equidistant from two points is a perpendicular bisector to the line segment connecting the two points.

[ 8 ] The set of points equidistant from two intersecting lines is the union of their two angle bisectors .

All conic sections are loci: [ 9 ] Circle : the set of points at constant distance (the radius ) from a fixed point (the center ).

Parabola : the set of points equidistant from a fixed point (the focus ) and a line (the directrix ).

Hyperbola : the set of points for each of which the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two given foci is a constant.

Ellipse : the set of points for each of which the sum of the distances to two given foci is a constant Other examples of loci appear in various areas of mathematics. For example, in complex dynamics , the Mandelbrot set is a subset of the complex plane that may be characterized as the connectedness locus of a family of polynomial maps.

Proof of a locus [ edit ] To prove a geometric shape is the correct locus for a given set of conditions, 
one generally divides the proof into two stages: the proof that all the points that satisfy the conditions are on the given shape, and the proof that all the points on the given shape satisfy the conditions.

[ 10 ] Examples [ edit ] (distance PA ) = 3.(distance PB ) First example [ edit ] Find the locus of a point P that has a given ratio of distances k = d 1 / d 2 to two given points.

In this example k = 3, A (−1, 0) and B (0, 2) are chosen as the fixed points.

P ( x , y ) is a point of the locus ⇔ ⇔ | P A | = 3 | P B | {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow |PA|=3|PB|} ⇔ ⇔ | P A | 2 = 9 | P B | 2 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow |PA|^{2}=9|PB|^{2}} ⇔ ⇔ ( x + 1 ) 2 + ( y − − 0 ) 2 = 9 ( x − − 0 ) 2 + 9 ( y − − 2 ) 2 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow (x+1)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}=9(x-0)^{2}+9(y-2)^{2}} ⇔ ⇔ 8 ( x 2 + y 2 ) − − 2 x − − 36 y + 35 = 0 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow 8(x^{2}+y^{2})-2x-36y+35=0} ⇔ ⇔ ( x − − 1 8 ) 2 + ( y − − 9 4 ) 2 = 45 64 .

{\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow \left(x-{\frac {1}{8}}\right)^{2}+\left(y-{\frac {9}{4}}\right)^{2}={\frac {45}{64}}.} This equation represents a circle with center (1/8, 9/4) and radius 3 8 5 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {3}{8}}{\sqrt {5}}} . It is the circle of Apollonius defined by these values of k , A , and B .

Second example [ edit ] Locus of point C A triangle ABC has a fixed side [ AB ] with length c . 
Determine the locus of the third vertex C such that
the medians from A and C are orthogonal .

Choose an orthonormal coordinate system such that A (− c /2, 0), B ( c /2, 0).

C ( x , y ) is the variable third vertex. The center of [ BC ] is M ((2 x + c )/4, y /2). The median from C has a slope y / x . The median AM has slope 2 y /(2 x + 3 c ).

The locus is a circle C ( x , y ) is a point of the locus ⇔ ⇔ {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow } the medians from A and C are orthogonal ⇔ ⇔ y x ⋅ ⋅ 2 y 2 x + 3 c = − − 1 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow {\frac {y}{x}}\cdot {\frac {2y}{2x+3c}}=-1} ⇔ ⇔ 2 y 2 + 2 x 2 + 3 c x = 0 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow 2y^{2}+2x^{2}+3cx=0} ⇔ ⇔ x 2 + y 2 + ( 3 c / 2 ) x = 0 {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow x^{2}+y^{2}+(3c/2)x=0} ⇔ ⇔ ( x + 3 c / 4 ) 2 + y 2 = 9 c 2 / 16.

{\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow (x+3c/4)^{2}+y^{2}=9c^{2}/16.} The locus of the vertex C is a circle with center (−3 c /4, 0) and radius 3 c /4.

Third example [ edit ] The intersection point of the associated lines k and l describes the circle A locus can also be defined by two associated curves depending on one common parameter . If the parameter varies, the intersection points of the associated curves describe the locus.

In the figure, the points K and L are fixed points on a given line m . The line k is a variable line through K . The line l through L is perpendicular to k . The angle α α {\displaystyle \alpha } between k and m is the parameter.

k and l are  associated lines depending on the common parameter. The variable intersection point S of k and l describes a circle. This circle is the locus of the intersection point of the two associated lines.

Fourth example [ edit ] A locus of points need not be one-dimensional (as a circle, line, etc.). For example, [ 1 ] the locus of the inequality 2 x + 3 y – 6 < 0 is the portion of the plane that is below the line of equation 2 x + 3 y – 6 = 0 .
