The distance between two parallel lines in the plane is the minimum distance between any two points.

Formula and proof [ edit ] Because the lines are parallel, the perpendicular distance between them is a constant, so it does not matter which point is chosen to measure the distance. Given the equations of two non-vertical parallel lines y = m x + b 1 {\displaystyle y=mx+b_{1}\,} y = m x + b 2 , {\displaystyle y=mx+b_{2}\,,} the distance between the two lines is the distance between the two intersection points of these lines with the perpendicular line y = − − x / m .

{\displaystyle y=-x/m\,.} This distance can be found by first solving the linear systems { y = m x + b 1 y = − − x / m , {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}y=mx+b_{1}\\y=-x/m\,,\end{cases}}} and { y = m x + b 2 y = − − x / m , {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}y=mx+b_{2}\\y=-x/m\,,\end{cases}}} to get the coordinates of the intersection points. The solutions to the linear systems are the points ( x 1 , y 1 ) = ( − − b 1 m m 2 + 1 , b 1 m 2 + 1 ) , {\displaystyle \left(x_{1},y_{1}\right)\ =\left({\frac {-b_{1}m}{m^{2}+1}},{\frac {b_{1}}{m^{2}+1}}\right)\,,} and ( x 2 , y 2 ) = ( − − b 2 m m 2 + 1 , b 2 m 2 + 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)\ =\left({\frac {-b_{2}m}{m^{2}+1}},{\frac {b_{2}}{m^{2}+1}}\right)\,.} The distance between the points is d = ( b 1 m − − b 2 m m 2 + 1 ) 2 + ( b 2 − − b 1 m 2 + 1 ) 2 , {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {\left({\frac {b_{1}m-b_{2}m}{m^{2}+1}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {b_{2}-b_{1}}{m^{2}+1}}\right)^{2}}}\,,} which reduces to d = | b 2 − − b 1 | m 2 + 1 .

{\displaystyle d={\frac {|b_{2}-b_{1}|}{\sqrt {m^{2}+1}}}\,.} When the lines are given by a x + b y + c 1 = 0 {\displaystyle ax+by+c_{1}=0\,} a x + b y + c 2 = 0 , {\displaystyle ax+by+c_{2}=0,\,} the distance between them can be expressed as d = | c 2 − − c 1 | a 2 + b 2 .

{\displaystyle d={\frac {|c_{2}-c_{1}|}{\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}.} See also [ edit ] Distance from a point to a line References [ edit ] Abstand In: Schülerduden – Mathematik II .
