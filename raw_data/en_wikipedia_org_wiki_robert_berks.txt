Berks ( 1922-04-26 ) April 26, 1922 Boston , Massachusetts , US Died May 16, 2011 (2011-05-16) (aged 89) New York City, US Occupation sculptor Known for John Fitzgerald Kennedy bust Spouse Dorothy "Tod" Berks Children 3 Robert Berks (April 26, 1922 – May 16, 2011) was an American sculptor , industrial designer and planner. He created hundreds of bronze sculptures and monuments including the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial , and the Albert Einstein Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Bob was prolific and created numerous sketches, drawings, and paintings; often in service of sculpture and site-planning subjects.  He worked for over 50 years in a converted schoolhouse on the north fork of Long Island, NY.  For projects with living subjects, Bob would often invite individuals to visit with him and his wife, Tod, for a period of a week or two so he could observe them in real life; through this time he captured emotions, tendencies, facial expressions, and body language.  It was this commitment to understanding his subject below the surface that facilitated the intimacy and personality found in his sculptural portraits.  Bob's work is spread around the world, but he is best known for his commissions in Washington DC.  Bob is one of the only artists in the world to have multiple pieces regularly on display in the Oval office.  Depending on the desires of the sitting US President, Berks' busts of famed civil servants and civil rights leaders line the walls of the Oval (Eight (8) original works are owned by the National Gallery); most often on view are busts of FDR, Lincoln, RFK, Ronald Reagan, and JFK.

The large 8 foot bust of John F Kennedy in front of the Kennedy Center , is most commonly recognized given the reach of televised programs including the annual Kennedy Center honors and The Mark Twain Prize.  In the 1960's, Berks was named "The Capitol's Michelangelo" for his bronze monuments around the mall.
