The abscissa shows the domain of the (to be tested) function .

In mathematics, the vertical line test is a visual way to determine if a curve is a graph of a function or not. A function can only have one output, y , for each unique input, x . If a vertical line intersects a curve on an xy -plane more than once then for one value of x the curve has more than one value of y , and so, the curve does not represent a function. If all vertical lines intersect a curve at most once then the curve represents a function.

The Vertical Line Test: A curve in the xy -plane is the graph of a function of x if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
