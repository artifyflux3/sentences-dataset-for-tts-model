By 17 March 2020, every country in Europe had confirmed a case, [ 3 ] and all have reported at least one death, with the exception of Vatican City .

Italy was the first European country to experience a major outbreak in early 2020, becoming the first country worldwide to introduce a national lockdown .

[ 4 ] By 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and it remained so until the WHO announced it was overtaken by South America on 22 May.

[ 7 ] By 18 March 2020, lockdowns introduced in Europe affected more than 250 million people.

[ 8 ] Despite deployment of COVID-19 vaccines , Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021.

[ 9 ] On 11 January 2022, Dr.

Hans Kluge , the WHO Regional Director for Europe said, "more than 50 percent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks".

[ 10 ] As the outbreak became a major crisis across Europe, national and European Union responses have led to debate over restrictions of civil liberties and the extent of European Union solidarity.

As of 20 May 2022, Europe is the most affected continent in the world. Most affected countries in Europe include Italy, France, Germany , the United Kingdom and Russia .

International comparisons [ edit ] In March 2022, The Lancet published a study comparing excess mortality rates per 100,000 population, in 191 countries in the world, over the first two years of the pandemic (2020 and 2021). The study showed that amongst the major western European countries, those with the highest rates were Italy with 227, Portugal 202, Spain 187, Belgium 147, and the Netherlands 140. The average was 140 and below that were the United Kingdom at 127, France 124, and Germany 121 - the difference between these three was not statistically significant - and that Ireland (13) and the Scandinavian countries had lower rates.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ medical citation needed ] Economic activity decreased by almost 4% in the majority of sub-regions in Europe in 2020, which was similar to the global average of 3.2%. However, the variance between nations is prominent. The high infection and mortality rates of the pandemic in countries in the Western Balkans , the Eastern Neighbourhood, and Central and Eastern Europe meant they faced deeper recessions.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] From 2019 to 2020, there was also a difference in how EU countries were adapting to new COVID-19 regulations, one of them being work from home . The proportion of EU enterprises employing advanced digital technology in their operations expanded dramatically during that time. From 2020 to 2021, this percentage remained relatively stable, reaching 61% in 2021, compared to 63% in 2020 and 58% in 2019.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Since the beginning of 2020, EU enterprises that embraced advanced digital technology and invested in becoming more digital during the pandemic have increased the number of employees they employ.

[ 15 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The number of non-digital enterprises that downsized was also greater than the share of non-digital firms that had positive job growth. Non-digital companies had a negative net employment balance.

[ 15 ] [ 19 ] According to a survey of firms by the European Investment Bank , the Czech Republic was the top-performing EU country for the usage of advanced digital technologies during the pandemic.

[ 15 ] [ 20 ] Finland was the top performing EU country in terms of digital infrastructure and the use of formal strategic business monitoring.

[ 15 ] [ 21 ] [ 20 ] Austria had the highest percentage of firms becoming more digital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

[ 15 ] [ 20 ] Cyprus led software and data investment, and firms in Sweden invested in digital training for their employees at the highest rate.

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Belgium on 4 February 2020, when one of a group of nine Belgians repatriated from Wuhan to Brussels was reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus.

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] Transmission within Belgium was confirmed in early March; authorities linked this to holidaymakers returning from Northern Italy at the end of the half-term holidays.

[ 151 ] [ 152 ] The epidemic increased rapidly in March–April 2020. By the end of March all 10 provinces of the country had registered cases.

[ citation needed ] By March 2021, Belgium had the third highest number of COVID-19 deaths per head of population in the world , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . However, Belgium may have been over-reporting the number of cases, with health officials reporting that suspected cases were being reported along with confirmed cases.

[ 153 ] Unlike some countries that publish figures based primarily on confirmed hospital deaths, the death figures reported by the Belgian authorities included deaths in the community, such as in care homes, confirmed to have been caused by the virus, as well as a much larger number of such deaths suspected to have been caused by the virus, even if the person was not tested.

Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases which is maybe because the PCR test that was used is defective.

[ 374 ] Those measures were prolonged until 26 April 2020.

[ 375 ] On 23 December, following an unexpectedly quick authorization by Swissmedic of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine , the vaccination campaign was launched in several cantons. A 90-year-old woman from the Lucerne region became the first vaccinated patient in continental Europe outside Russia.

[ 376 ] [ 377 ] All cantons are expected to start vaccinating by 11 January 2021.

Turkey [ edit ] Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey The COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ).

The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home [ note 1 ] from a trip to Europe.

[ 379 ] The first death due to COVID-19 in the country occurred on 15 March.

[ 379 ] Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown [ note 2 ] [ 380 ] until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions.

[ 381 ] The government kept many businesses open, and allowed companies to set their own guidelines for workers.

[ 380 ] The Turkish health system [ 380 ] has the highest number of intensive care units [ 382 ] in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). As of 3 May 2021 [update] , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stood at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally.

[ 383 ] [ 384 ] This low case-fatality rate has generated various explanations, including the relative rarity of nursing homes , [ 385 ] favorable demographics, [ 386 ] a long legacy of contact tracing , [ 387 ] the high number of intensive care units , [ 388 ] universal health care , [ 387 ] and a lockdown regime that led to a higher proportion of positive cases among working-age adults.

[ 380 ] But according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management , the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics.

[ 389 ] On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association .

[ 390 ] This practice ended on 25 November, when the ministry started to report asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases alongside symptomatic ones.

[ 390 ] Ukraine [ edit ] Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine The COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine has resulted in 5,543,832 [ 148 ] confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 109,925 [ 148 ] deaths.

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Ukraine when the country's first case was confirmed to be hospitalized in Chernivtsi Oblast on 3 March 2020, [ 391 ] a man who had travelled from Italy to Romania by plane and then arrived in Ukraine by car.

[ 392 ] An emergency was declared on 20 March 2020 in Kyiv Oblast , Chernivtsi Oblast , Zhytomyr Oblast , Dnipropetrovsk Oblast , Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast , and the city of Kyiv .

[ 393 ] New infections and deaths started to break records by late October 2021.

[ 394 ] [ 395 ] By then, a total of 2.8 million coronavirus cases and 64,936 COVID-19 related deaths had occurred in Ukraine.

[ 395 ] Ukraine's ongoing vaccination program [ 396 ] started on 24 February 2021 and from that day to 12 September 2021, 10,710,944 vaccinations were given in Ukraine (meaning 18% of the adult population of Ukraine had been vaccinated against COVID-19).

[ 397 ] About 44% of those vaccinated had been fully vaccinated.

[ 398 ] [ 399 ] In an August 2021 poll 56% of Ukrainians did not plan to be vaccinated.

[ 399 ] Demand for vaccinations multiplied sharply by late October 2021.

[ 394 ] [ 395 ] On 7 January 2022 the Ministry of Health announced that 44.9% of the adult population had undergone a full course of vaccination.

[ 400 ] Statistics for the Russian-held Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol , and for the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, are not reported by Ukraine's state agencies, and are not included in the country's totals.

[ 401 ] Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine , the Ukrainian Ministry of Healthcare has made no further press releases related to COVID-19, and the latest counts were for 23 February 2022.

[ 402 ] As a result, daily counts are displayed in various diagrams as zero. In late May 2022, Chief State Sanitary Doctor Ihor Kuzin stated that since the beginning of the invasion, more than 750 studies had been conducted and that COVID-19 outbreaks were not expected in Ukraine in the near future.

[ 403 ] On 1 July 2023, the Ministry downgraded the disease's alert levels to that of regular respiratory diseases and lifted all emergency measures relating to it.

[ 404 ] United Kingdom [ edit ] Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom Mark Drakeford, First Minister at the Welsh Government in one of his daily briefings.

Man in London wearing a face mask on 19 March In December 2019, Peter Attwood, an 84-year-old from Chatham, Kent , England, developed an unexplained respiratory illness. His symptoms worsened and he was admitted to Medway Hospital on 7 January 2020 and remained in hospital until his death on 30 January 2020. A follow-up pathology test of lung tissue taken during Peter's post-mortem examination showed he had had COVID-19 at the time of his death. Attwood would appear to be the first known UK casualty of SARS-CoV-2.

[ citation needed ] On 31 January 2020, England confirmed the first two cases, both members of a family of Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York who were taken to specialist facilities in Newcastle upon Tyne .

[ 405 ] Afterwards, several confirmed cases were detected across the UK.

[ 406 ] [ 407 ] [ 408 ] The UK government implemented preventive measures to curb the spread of infections which included contact tracing , isolation and testing, some of which were related to the Italy clusters.

[ 409 ] [ 410 ] [ 411 ] The NHS set up drive-through screening centres at several hospitals to test members of the public showing symptoms.

[ 412 ] [ 413 ] On 2 March, Ministers approved the Department of Health and Social Care COVID-19 action plan, [ 414 ] which sets out actions to date, future measures, cooperation between devolved political and health authorities, and the level of preparedness of the country's four National Health Services. It outlined the government's objectives to deploy phased actions to contain, delay, and mitigate any outbreak, using research to inform policy development.

[ 415 ] On 23 March, it was announced that the UK would be entering a nationwide lockdown. The public were advised to stay at home except for essential shopping and one hour of exercise a day. These measures came into effect on 26 March and lasted until 1 June when measures were eased allowing early years pupils and exams students to return to school in a limited capacity. These measures are further eased on 15 June when retail and attractions were able to open for the first time since March.

[ 416 ] On 25 March, the UK Parliament legislated to provide the government and authorities with emergency powers to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the power to restrict public gatherings, order businesses to close, and the ability to detain those suspected of having the virus.

[ 417 ] The Coronavirus Act 2020 received Royal Assent on 25 March and came into force on the same day.

[ 418 ] On 5 April, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital after testing positive to COVID-19 10 days earlier.

[ 419 ] He was admitted into intensive care the following night, when his symptoms further worsened.

[ 420 ] He left hospital on 12 April.

[ 421 ] The NHS was given access to emergency supplies of PPE and patients that did not need to remain in hospital were moved to residential care homes if needed. However, there was no need for a negative COVID-19 test before patients were transferred to these settings, this was only required from 15 April. On 15 May, the government approved the first social care specific legislation that helped to ensure that staff had access to adequate PPE and protect both those working and living in care homes.

[ 422 ] As of 6 May, the total of confirmed cases was 201,101; the total of recorded deaths in all settings was 30,076, the highest in Europe and second highest in all the countries after the United States. It is estimated that care home residents accounted for 30–40% of these deaths, with social care workers being twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as the general population.

[ 422 ] However, the death toll did not continue to increase throughout the summer, and Brazil and Mexico now have more deaths as of 1 August 2020.

[ 423 ] During August and September, the number of infections per day began to increase significantly although the death rate remained fairly low. Boris Johnson announced changes to restrictions on 22 September which included forcing pubs, bars and restaurants to close by 10 pm in England and the so-called rule of six saying no more than six people should meet. In October, Scotland's first minister declared new restrictions it meant that some areas of the country those like Edinburgh had to close bars, pubs and go back to doing self-service. Northern Ireland's executive that also have control over health policy tightened restrictions to make them close to a lockdown as did Wales announced by Welsh first minister. It also emerged that Boris Johnson had been advised by SAGE committee of scientists to have a short lockdown back on 21 September. Johnson subsequently introduced a three-tier system of restrictions Liverpool was put under the top tier meaning tougher restrictions but falling short of a full lockdown. The UK has since recorded over 40,000 deaths.

On 5 November, the UK had to enter a second national lockdown due to the rising number of cases and hospitalisations.

[ 424 ] Following the end of this lockdown on 2 December case numbers began to rise again and over 70,000 deaths have been recorded in relation to COVID-19 as of 11 December 2020.

[ 425 ] On 4 January 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation announcing a third lockdown.

[ 426 ] The UK went into Lockdown that day due to rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths caused by a new more infectious variant of COVID-19 spreading around the UK.

[ 427 ] The UK has begun to vaccinate its population against COVID-19. The first vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19, was approved for use in the UK on 2 December 2020, [ 428 ] the first of the 800,000 immediately available doses was administered on 8 December.

[ 429 ] The second vaccine approved for use in the UK was the Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was approved for use on 30 December 2020, [ 430 ] with the first dose of this vaccine given on 4 January 2021.

[ 431 ] A third vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, was approved for use in the UK on 8 January 2021, [ 432 ] and the first dose was administered in Wales on 6 April.

[ 433 ] Vatican City [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from COVID-19 pandemic in Vatican City .

[ edit ] The COVID-19 pandemic in Vatican City was a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ). The Holy See reported the first case of infection in Vatican City on 7 March 2020.

[ 434 ] Unlike other jurisdictions that report cases within a given territory or cases of residents or citizens of a territory, the Holy See reports on cases "in Vatican City State and among the employees of the Holy See" regardless of location of testing, treatment, or residence.

[ 435 ] There were 29 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the Vatican's residents and employees; there were no associated deaths.

[ 436 ] The 29 cases included 10 employees, 1 new hire, and 1 resident of Vatican City.

[ note 3 ] All those infected tested negative by 6 June 2020.

[ 437 ] An outbreak among members of the Holy See's Swiss Guard was reported in mid-October, totaling 11 as of October 15.

[ 438 ] In late February 2020, Pope Francis became ill with symptoms of a cold , but tested negative for COVID-19.

[ 439 ] It was announced on January 14, 2021, that both he and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI had received the first dose of a vaccine.

[ 440 ] They received their second dose in February.

Response and criticism [ edit ] Immigrants and refugees [ edit ] The European Union closed borders to non-nationals on 17 March. The next day, Greece imposed restrictions on refugees' movement within camps.

[ 442 ] Thousands of asylum seekers are living in crowded camps, and there are fears that pandemic could not be controlled under such conditions. The Greek prime minister K. Mitsotakis said that Europe should do more to help because Greece "cannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone".

[ 443 ] Unnamed Greek officials have stated concerns that Turkey may send infected refugees and migrants towards the islands.

[ 444 ] [ 445 ] [ 446 ] Early in April Malta and Italy closed their ports to vessels carrying asylum seekers from North Africa.

[ 447 ] Computational approach [ edit ] The Exscalate4Cov project, founded by the Horizon 2020 program, [ 448 ] conducted a series of drug repositioning and virtual screening experiments to evaluate the interactions between known drugs and billions of other compounds against the spike protein .

[ 449 ] These experiments utilized in-silico computational models.

[ 449 ] The E4C drug repositioning and in-silico large-scale screening experiments [ 449 ] on two European supercomputers identified raloxifene as a candidate for treating early-stage COVID-19 patients.

[ 450 ] Vaccination [ edit ] Main article: COVID-19 vaccines In early 2021, EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen was criticised for the EU's slow rollout, and she noted that the EU was "late to authorise" and said that ordering vaccines on behalf of member states was "the right thing to do".

[ 451 ] Some countries withheld recommending the AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns of blood clots.  By 20 June 2021, nearly half the population of the European Union had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination.

[ 452 ] In November 2021, a study by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved since the start of vaccination roll-out in the European region.

[ 453 ] Herd immunity through infection in Iceland [ edit ] Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland On 23 February 2022, the Ministry of Health lifted all remaining COVID-19 restrictions, including gathering limits, restricted opening hours for bars, and border restrictions.  Adopting a herd immunity approach, [ 454 ] the ministry stated that "widespread societal resistance to COVID-19 is the main route out of the epidemic", and "to achieve this, as many people as possible need to be infected with the virus as the vaccines are not enough, even though they provide good protection against serious illness".

[ 455 ] Criticism [ edit ] Travel bans and border closures [ edit ] Full closure of a bridge over the Rhine , on the border between Austria and Switzerland Although by 7 March some European politicians such as France's Marine Le Pen had called for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed, [ 456 ] the European Union by 13 March continued to reject the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy.

[ 457 ] [ 458 ] [ 459 ] [ 460 ] [ 461 ] The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League , Lorenzo Quadri, by 29 February had criticised the decision, saying, "It is alarming that the dogma of wide-open borders is considered a priority." [ 462 ] United States President Donald Trump said by 12 March the European Union had "failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots" as the US had implemented.

[ 463 ] Trump also said that "As a result a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe." [ 464 ] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travelers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.

[ 465 ] By 9 March, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated that "European countries cannot ban the entry of Italian citizens within the Schengen area. The only possible way is to have the Italian prime minister call on his fellow citizens to refrain from traveling to other countries of the European Union." [ 466 ] After Slovakia, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Poland announced complete closure of their national borders, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said by 12 March that "Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization. Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people's lives and business across the borders." [ 467 ] European Union leaders condemned the US decision to restrict travel from Europe to the United States.

European Council President Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement: "The European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation." [ 468 ] Ursula von der Leyen admitted by 17 March that "all of us who are not experts initially underestimated the coronavirus." [ 469 ] As of 22 February 2021, the UK has banned direct flights from 33 countries, including Portugal, South Africa, Peru and the United Arab Emirates. All travelers entering the UK via indirect flights have been ordered to quarantine in a designated hotel for 10 days.

[ 470 ] Since passengers coming from high-risk countries with South African virus's mutant (like the UAE and South Africa) are mixing with other travellers before reaching their accommodation, this travel ban is being criticised extensively.

[ 471 ] EU solidarity [ edit ] Main article: European Union response to the COVID-19 pandemic The Italian government has criticised EU's lack of solidarity with Italy.

[ 472 ] [ 473 ] [ 474 ] Politico reported on 7 March that "EU countries have so far refused Italy's plea for help fighting coronavirus, as national capitals worry that they may need to stockpile face masks and other medical gear to help their own citizens, officials and diplomats said." [ 475 ] Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "Only China responded bilaterally. Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity." [ 476 ] Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said that "European solidarity does not exist. That was a fairy tale." [ 476 ] Eventually, in July 2020 the European Council agreed to a massive recovery fund of 750 billion € branded Next Generation EU (NGEU) to support member states hit by the COVID-19 pandemic . The NGEU fund goes over the years 2021 – 2023 and will be tied to the 2021–2027 budget of the EU (MFF). The comprehensive packages of NGEU and MFF will reach the size of 1824.3 Billion €.

[ 477 ] In response to the pandemic, the European Investment Bank Group is establishing a €25 billion Pan-European Guarantee fund. It is projected that the guarantee fund would raise up to €200 billion.

[ 478 ] [ 479 ] The EIB Group signed a new EUR 8.6 billion assistance agreement for its pandemic response programs in 2022. Since pandemic recovery has been slowed down, the allocation time for the guarantee goods under the pan-European Guarantee Fund (EGF), which was introduced in 2020, was extended until the end of 2022.

[ 480 ] Reaction time of Spain [ edit ] International Women's Day march in Mérida, Spain, 8 March [ 481 ] Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Spain According to The Guardian , Spain's initially slow response to COVID-19 caused the epidemic to become severe even though it did not share a land border with Italy or other severely affected countries.

[ 482 ] An analysis in Vox hypothesised that the minority government did not want to risk its hold on power by banning large gatherings early; Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez initially defended his decision to allow large gatherings to continue.

[ 483 ] Military exercises during pandemic [ edit ] The planned NATO " Defender 2020 " military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, [ 484 ] the largest NATO war manoeuvres since the end of the Cold War , was to be held on a reduced scale because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

[ 485 ] Restrictions on civil liberties [ edit ] There was concern that measures taken by some national governments on occasion of the COVID-19 pandemic would have the aim or effect of restricting democracy and civil liberties and rights.

[ 486 ] In Hungary, prime minister Viktor Orbán acquired near absolute powers through such legislation on 3 April.

[ 487 ] Use of scientific advice [ edit ] The European Union 's Chief Scientific Advisors issued a statement on 24 June 2020, providing guidance for how scientific advice should be given and interpreted during the pandemic. One key point made by the Advisors was that scientists must be clearer about the degree of uncertainty that characterises the evolving evidence on which their advice is based, for instance around the use of face-masks. They also emphasised that scientific advice must be separated from decision-making, and this separation must be made clear by politicians.

[ 488 ] In April 2021, the leaders of the Society for Aerosol Research warned the debate on COVID-19 measures does not reflect current scientific knowledge. They said protection against infection must take place above all where people spend time indoors, because "the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses takes place almost without exception indoors." [ 489 ] Romani people [ edit ] Romani people were hit hard by the pandemic.

[ 490 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Data Protection Law number 6698 [ 378 ] precludes the Turkish Ministry of Health from disclosing sensitive patient health information, interpreted broadly to include location during the pandemic.

^ Turkey's Article 11/C of the Law on Public Health authorizes only provinces to order quarantines, for a maximum period of 15 days. The national government is barred by the constitution from ordering lockdowns.

[ 379 ] ^ Unlike other governments, the Holy See Press Office reports on diagnoses and status of its employees, not only cases within its jurisdiction. Its announcements are generally imprecise as to the nationality and residence of the cases it reports. One was identified as a resident of Vatican City. Another was diagnosed and is being treated in an Italian location that is neither Vatican City nor Rome.
