The length of the flow velocity vector is scalar, the flow speed .
It is also called velocity field ; when evaluated along a line , it is called a velocity profile (as in, e.g., law of the wall ).

Definition [ edit ] The flow velocity u of a fluid is a vector field u = u ( x , t ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t),} which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \,} and time t .

{\displaystyle t.\,} The flow speed q is the length of the flow velocity vector [ 3 ] q = ‖ ‖ u ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle q=\|\mathbf {u} \|} and is a scalar field.

Uses [ edit ] The flow velocity of a fluid effectively describes everything about the motion of a fluid.  Many physical properties of a fluid can be expressed mathematically in terms of the flow velocity.  Some common examples follow: Steady flow [ edit ] Main article: Steady flow The flow of a fluid is said to be steady if u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } does not vary with time.  That is if ∂ ∂ u ∂ ∂ t = 0.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}=0.} Incompressible flow [ edit ] Main article: Incompressible flow If a fluid is incompressible the divergence of u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is zero: ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ u = 0.

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0.} That is, if u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is a solenoidal vector field .

Irrotational flow [ edit ] Main article: Irrotational flow A flow is irrotational if the curl of u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is zero: ∇ ∇ × × u = 0.

{\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {u} =0.} That is, if u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } is an irrotational vector field .

A flow in a simply-connected domain which is irrotational can be described as a potential flow , through the use of a velocity potential Φ Φ , {\displaystyle \Phi ,} with u = ∇ ∇ Φ Φ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \Phi .} If the flow is both irrotational and incompressible, the Laplacian of the velocity potential must be zero: Δ Δ Φ Φ = 0.

{\displaystyle \Delta \Phi =0.} Vorticity [ edit ] Main article: Vorticity The vorticity , ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } , of a flow can be defined in terms of its flow velocity by ω ω = ∇ ∇ × × u .

{\displaystyle \omega =\nabla \times \mathbf {u} .} If the vorticity is zero, the flow is irrotational.

The velocity potential [ edit ] Main article: Potential flow If an irrotational flow occupies a simply-connected fluid region then there exists a scalar field ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } such that u = ∇ ∇ ϕ ϕ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \mathbf {\phi } .} The scalar field ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is called the velocity potential for the flow. (See Irrotational vector field .) Bulk velocity [ edit ] In many engineering applications the local flow velocity u {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} } vector field is not known in every point and the only accessible velocity is the bulk velocity or average flow velocity u ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}} (with the usual dimension of length per time), defined as the quotient between the volume flow rate V ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {V}}} (with dimension of cubed length per time) and the cross sectional area A {\displaystyle A} (with dimension of square length): u ¯ ¯ = V ˙ ˙ A {\displaystyle {\bar {u}}={\frac {\dot {V}}{A}}} .
