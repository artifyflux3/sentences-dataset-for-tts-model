The function x 2 {\displaystyle x^{2}} with domain R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } does not have an inverse function . If we restrict x 2 {\displaystyle x^{2}} to the non-negative real numbers , then it does have an inverse function, known as the square root of x .

{\displaystyle x.} Function x ‚Ü¶ f ( x ) History of the function concept Types by domain and codomain X ‚Üí ùîπ ùîπ ‚Üí X ùîπ n ‚Üí X X ‚Üí ‚Ñ§ ‚Ñ§ ‚Üí X X ‚Üí ‚Ñù ‚Ñù ‚Üí X ‚Ñù n ‚Üí X X ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ ‚ÑÇ ‚Üí X ‚ÑÇ n ‚Üí X Classes/properties Constant Identity Linear Polynomial Rational Algebraic Analytic Smooth Continuous Measurable Injective Surjective Bijective Constructions Restriction Composition Œª Inverse Generalizations Relation ( Binary relation ) Set-valued Multivalued Partial Implicit Space Higher-order Morphism Functor List of specific functions v t e In mathematics , the restriction of a function f {\displaystyle f} is a new function, denoted f | A {\displaystyle f\vert _{A}} or f ‚Üæ ‚Üæ A , {\displaystyle f{\upharpoonright _{A}},} obtained by choosing a smaller domain A {\displaystyle A} for the original function f .

{\displaystyle f.} The function f {\displaystyle f} is then said to extend f | A .

{\displaystyle f\vert _{A}.} Formal definition [ edit ] Let f : E ‚Üí ‚Üí F {\displaystyle f:E\to F} be a function from a set E {\displaystyle E} to a set F .

{\displaystyle F.} If a set A {\displaystyle A} is a subset of E , {\displaystyle E,} then the restriction of f {\displaystyle f} to A {\displaystyle A} is the function [ 1 ] f | A : A ‚Üí ‚Üí F {\displaystyle {f|}_{A}:A\to F} given by f | A ( x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle {f|}_{A}(x)=f(x)} for x ‚àà ‚àà A .

{\displaystyle x\in A.} Informally, the restriction of f {\displaystyle f} to A {\displaystyle A} is the same function as f , {\displaystyle f,} but is only defined on A {\displaystyle A} .

If the function f {\displaystyle f} is thought of as a relation ( x , f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle (x,f(x))} on the Cartesian product E √ó √ó F , {\displaystyle E\times F,} then the restriction of f {\displaystyle f} to A {\displaystyle A} can be represented by its graph , G ( f | A ) = { ( x , f ( x ) ) ‚àà ‚àà G ( f ) : x ‚àà ‚àà A } = G ( f ) ‚à© ‚à© ( A √ó √ó F ) , {\displaystyle G({f|}_{A})=\{(x,f(x))\in G(f):x\in A\}=G(f)\cap (A\times F),} where the pairs ( x , f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle (x,f(x))} represent ordered pairs in the graph G .

{\displaystyle G.} Extensions [ edit ] A function F {\displaystyle F} is said to be an extension of another function f {\displaystyle f} if whenever x {\displaystyle x} is in the domain of f {\displaystyle f} then x {\displaystyle x} is also in the domain of F {\displaystyle F} and f ( x ) = F ( x ) .

{\displaystyle f(x)=F(x).} That is, if domain ‚Å° ‚Å° f ‚äÜ ‚äÜ domain ‚Å° ‚Å° F {\displaystyle \operatorname {domain} f\subseteq \operatorname {domain} F} and F | domain ‚Å° ‚Å° f = f .

{\displaystyle F{\big \vert }_{\operatorname {domain} f}=f.} A linear extension (respectively, continuous extension , etc.) of a function f {\displaystyle f} is an extension of f {\displaystyle f} that is also a linear map (respectively, a continuous map , etc.).

Examples [ edit ] The restriction of the non-injective function f : R ‚Üí ‚Üí R , x ‚Ü¶ ‚Ü¶ x 2 {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} ,\ x\mapsto x^{2}} to the domain R + = [ 0 , ‚àû ‚àû ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{+}=[0,\infty )} is the injection f : R + ‚Üí ‚Üí R , x ‚Ü¶ ‚Ü¶ x 2 .

{\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} _{+}\to \mathbb {R} ,\ x\mapsto x^{2}.} The factorial function is the restriction of the gamma function to the positive integers, with the argument shifted by one: Œì Œì | Z + ( n ) = ( n ‚àí ‚àí 1 ) !

{\displaystyle {\Gamma |}_{\mathbb {Z} ^{+}}\!(n)=(n-1)!} Properties of restrictions [ edit ] Restricting a function f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí Y {\displaystyle f:X\rightarrow Y} to its entire domain X {\displaystyle X} gives back the original function, that is, f | X = f .

{\displaystyle f|_{X}=f.} Restricting a function twice is the same as restricting it once, that is, if A ‚äÜ ‚äÜ B ‚äÜ ‚äÜ dom ‚Å° ‚Å° f , {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\subseteq \operatorname {dom} f,} then ( f | B ) | A = f | A .

{\displaystyle \left(f|_{B}\right)|_{A}=f|_{A}.} The restriction of the identity function on a set X {\displaystyle X} to a subset A {\displaystyle A} of X {\displaystyle X} is just the inclusion map from A {\displaystyle A} into X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 2 ] The restriction of a continuous function is continuous.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Applications [ edit ] Inverse functions [ edit ] Main article: Inverse function For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one . If a function f {\displaystyle f} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a partial inverse of f {\displaystyle f} by restricting the domain.  For example, the function f ( x ) = x 2 {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} defined on the whole of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is not one-to-one since x 2 = ( ‚àí ‚àí x ) 2 {\displaystyle x^{2}=(-x)^{2}} for any x ‚àà ‚àà R .

{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} .} However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain R ‚â• ‚â• 0 = [ 0 , ‚àû ‚àû ) , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{\geq 0}=[0,\infty ),} in which case f ‚àí ‚àí 1 ( y ) = y .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)={\sqrt {y}}.} (If we instead restrict to the domain ( ‚àí ‚àí ‚àû ‚àû , 0 ] , {\displaystyle (-\infty ,0],} then the inverse is the negative of the square root of y .

{\displaystyle y.} )  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we allow the inverse to be a multivalued function .

Selection operators [ edit ] Main article: Selection (relational algebra) In relational algebra , a selection (sometimes called a restriction to avoid confusion with SQL 's use of SELECT) is a unary operation written as œÉ œÉ a Œ∏ Œ∏ b ( R ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{a\theta b}(R)} or œÉ œÉ a Œ∏ Œ∏ v ( R ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{a\theta v}(R)} where: a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are attribute names, Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } is a binary operation in the set { < , ‚â§ ‚â§ , = , ‚â† ‚â† , ‚â• ‚â• , > } , {\displaystyle \{<,\leq ,=,\neq ,\geq ,>\},} v {\displaystyle v} is a value constant, R {\displaystyle R} is a relation .

The selection œÉ œÉ a Œ∏ Œ∏ b ( R ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{a\theta b}(R)} selects all those tuples in R {\displaystyle R} for which Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } holds between the a {\displaystyle a} and the b {\displaystyle b} attribute.

The selection œÉ œÉ a Œ∏ Œ∏ v ( R ) {\displaystyle \sigma _{a\theta v}(R)} selects all those tuples in R {\displaystyle R} for which Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } holds between the a {\displaystyle a} attribute and the value v .

{\displaystyle v.} Thus, the selection operator restricts to a subset of the entire database.

The pasting lemma [ edit ] Main article: Pasting lemma The pasting lemma is a result in topology that relates the continuity of a function with the continuity of its restrictions to subsets.

Let X , Y {\displaystyle X,Y} be two closed subsets (or two open subsets) of a topological space A {\displaystyle A} such that A = X ‚à™ ‚à™ Y , {\displaystyle A=X\cup Y,} and let B {\displaystyle B} also be a topological space. If f : A ‚Üí ‚Üí B {\displaystyle f:A\to B} is continuous when restricted to both X {\displaystyle X} and Y , {\displaystyle Y,} then f {\displaystyle f} is continuous.

This result allows one to take two continuous functions defined on closed (or open) subsets of a topological space and create a new one.

Sheaves [ edit ] Main article: Sheaf theory Sheaves provide a way of generalizing restrictions to objects besides functions.

In sheaf theory , one assigns an object F ( U ) {\displaystyle F(U)} in a category to each open set U {\displaystyle U} of a topological space , and requires that the objects satisfy certain conditions. The most important condition is that there are restriction morphisms between every pair of objects associated to nested open sets; that is, if V ‚äÜ ‚äÜ U , {\displaystyle V\subseteq U,} then there is a morphism res V , U : F ( U ) ‚Üí ‚Üí F ( V ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {res} _{V,U}:F(U)\to F(V)} satisfying the following properties, which are designed to mimic the restriction of a function: For every open set U {\displaystyle U} of X , {\displaystyle X,} the restriction morphism res U , U : F ( U ) ‚Üí ‚Üí F ( U ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {res} _{U,U}:F(U)\to F(U)} is the identity morphism on F ( U ) .

{\displaystyle F(U).} If we have three open sets W ‚äÜ ‚äÜ V ‚äÜ ‚äÜ U , {\displaystyle W\subseteq V\subseteq U,} then the composite res W , V ‚àò ‚àò res V , U = res W , U .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {res} _{W,V}\circ \operatorname {res} _{V,U}=\operatorname {res} _{W,U}.} (Locality) If ( U i ) {\displaystyle \left(U_{i}\right)} is an open covering of an open set U , {\displaystyle U,} and if s , t ‚àà ‚àà F ( U ) {\displaystyle s,t\in F(U)} are such that s | U i = t | U i {\displaystyle s{\big \vert }_{U_{i}}=t{\big \vert }_{U_{i}}} for each set U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} of the covering, then s = t {\displaystyle s=t} ; and (Gluing) If ( U i ) {\displaystyle \left(U_{i}\right)} is an open covering of an open set U , {\displaystyle U,} and if for each i {\displaystyle i} a section x i ‚àà ‚àà F ( U i ) {\displaystyle x_{i}\in F\left(U_{i}\right)} is given such that for each pair U i , U j {\displaystyle U_{i},U_{j}} of the covering sets the restrictions of s i {\displaystyle s_{i}} and s j {\displaystyle s_{j}} agree on the overlaps: s i | U i ‚à© ‚à© U j = s j | U i ‚à© ‚à© U j , {\displaystyle s_{i}{\big \vert }_{U_{i}\cap U_{j}}=s_{j}{\big \vert }_{U_{i}\cap U_{j}},} then there is a section s ‚àà ‚àà F ( U ) {\displaystyle s\in F(U)} such that s | U i = s i {\displaystyle s{\big \vert }_{U_{i}}=s_{i}} for each i .

{\displaystyle i.} The collection of all such objects is called a sheaf . If only the first two properties are satisfied, it is a pre-sheaf .

Left- and right-restriction [ edit ] More generally, the restriction (or domain restriction or left-restriction ) A ‚óÉ ‚óÉ R {\displaystyle A\triangleleft R} of a binary relation R {\displaystyle R} between E {\displaystyle E} and F {\displaystyle F} may be defined as a relation having domain A , {\displaystyle A,} codomain F {\displaystyle F} and graph G ( A ‚óÉ ‚óÉ R ) = { ( x , y ) ‚àà ‚àà F ( R ) : x ‚àà ‚àà A } .

{\displaystyle G(A\triangleleft R)=\{(x,y)\in F(R):x\in A\}.} Similarly, one can define a right-restriction or range restriction R ‚ñπ ‚ñπ B .

{\displaystyle R\triangleright B.} Indeed, one could define a restriction to n {\displaystyle n} -ary relations, as well as to subsets understood as relations, such as ones of the Cartesian product E √ó √ó F {\displaystyle E\times F} for binary relations.
These cases do not fit into the scheme of sheaves .

[ clarification needed ] Anti-restriction [ edit ] The domain anti-restriction (or domain subtraction ) of a function or binary relation R {\displaystyle R} (with domain E {\displaystyle E} and codomain F {\displaystyle F} ) by a set A {\displaystyle A} may be defined as ( E ‚àñ ‚àñ A ) ‚óÉ ‚óÉ R {\displaystyle (E\setminus A)\triangleleft R} ; it removes all elements of A {\displaystyle A} from the domain E .

{\displaystyle E.} It is sometimes denoted A {\displaystyle A} ‚©§ R .

{\displaystyle R.} [ 5 ] Similarly, the range anti-restriction (or range subtraction ) of a function or binary relation R {\displaystyle R} by a set B {\displaystyle B} is defined as R ‚ñπ ‚ñπ ( F ‚àñ ‚àñ B ) {\displaystyle R\triangleright (F\setminus B)} ; it removes all elements of B {\displaystyle B} from the codomain F .

{\displaystyle F.} It is sometimes denoted R {\displaystyle R} ‚©• B .
