It and the nearby Halebidu are well connected to northern Karnataka, western Andhra Pradesh and northern Tamil Nadu.

[ 6 ] Around this region, between the 10th and 14th century, the Hoysaḷa dynasty came to power, whose history is unclear. By their own 11th and 12th-century inscriptions, they were descendants of the Krishna-Baladeva-roots and the Yadavas of Maharashtra. They married into the Kalyana Chalukya Hindu dynasty, known for its temple and art tradition. The reliability of these inscriptions have been questioned as potential mythistory by some historians, who propose that the Hoysalas were a local Hindu family – a hill chief from the Western Ghats remembered for having killed a tiger or a lion, and they seized power and over time expanded their territory starting in the 10th century.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Belur was the early capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 11th-century, before they built Dwarasamudra (modern Halebid).

[ 9 ] According to inscriptions discovered here, it was called Velur or Velapuri during the Hoysala era. Belur remained an alternate capital through the 14th century. The city was esteemed by the Hoysalas, and they referred to it as "earthly Vaikuntha " (Vishnu's abode) and "Dakshina Varanasi " (southern holy city of Hindus) in later inscriptions.

[ 10 ] In early 12th-century, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana met the Hindu philosopher Ramanujacharya – famed for his ideas on Sri Vaishnavism. Belur's profile rose thereafter, becoming a Vaishnava temples and monasteries town. It has remained a Vaishnava Hindu pilgrimage center.

[ 11 ] Monuments [ edit ] Belur is home to several monuments: [ 12 ] Chennakeshava Temple, Belur – a large Vishnu -related Hoysala Hindu temples complex from the early 12th century. The main temple was originally called the Vijaya-Narayana temple built by the king, which is surrounded by many smaller temples built by a Hoysala queen, generals and merchants of Hoysalas, an attached monastery, Brahmins residences, a simple pushkarini (temple water tank), a pilgrim's choultry, kitchen and grains storage. The towering Belur gopura is visible from a distance.

Shankareshvara temple – the oldest temple in Belur, predates the Vishnuvardhana's Chennakeshava temples complex. Also called Shankaralingeshwara temple, dedicated to Shiva, it is about 400 metres (1,300 ft) northwest of the Chennakeshava temple gopura. The temple has a phamsana style shikara, square architectural plan, notable sukhanasi , much simpler artwork, with ruins of its mandapa scattered nearby.

[ 13 ] Pathaleshwara Temple – a small Hoysala style Shiva temple with fine artwork, about 600 metres (2,000 ft) east of the Chennakeshava temple gopura.

Amrutheshwara temple ruins – a temple with a large temple tank, it was restored and expanded with a mandapa during the Vijayanagara-Nayaka period, but damaged and its parts scattered after the fall of Vijayanagara. The temple is about 800 metres (2,600 ft) south of the Chennakeshava temple gopura. It provides a contrast between the Hoysala and Vijayanagara architectural styles.
