A lexeme ( / ˈ l ɛ k s iː m / ⓘ ) is a unit of lexical meaning that underlies a set of words that are related through inflection . It is a basic abstract unit of meaning, [ 1 ] a unit of morphological analysis in linguistics that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single root word . For example, in the English language , run , runs , ran and running are forms of the same lexeme, which can be represented as RUN .

[ note 1 ] One form, the lemma (or citation form), is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme. The lemma is the form used in dictionaries as an entry's headword . Other forms of a lexeme are often listed later in the entry if they are uncommon or irregularly inflected.

Description [ edit ] The notion of the lexeme is central to morphology , [ 2 ] the basis for defining other concepts in that field. For example, the difference between inflection and derivation can be stated in terms of lexemes: Inflectional rules relate a lexeme to its forms.

Derivational rules relate a lexeme to another lexeme.

A lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category , has a certain meaning ( semantic value ), and in inflecting languages, has a corresponding inflectional paradigm . That is, a lexeme in many languages will have many different forms. For example, the lexeme RUN has a present third person singular form runs , a present non-third-person singular form run (which also functions as the past participle and non-finite form), a past form ran , and a present participle running . (It does not include runner, runners, runnable etc.) The use of the forms of a lexeme is governed by rules of grammar . In the case of English verbs such as RUN , they include subject– verb agreement and compound tense rules, which determine the form of a verb that can be used in a given sentence .

In many formal theories of language , lexemes have subcategorization frames to account for the number and types of complements. They occur within sentences and other syntactic structures .

Decomposition [ edit ] A language's lexemes are often composed of smaller units with individual meaning called morphemes , according to root morpheme + derivational morphemes + affix (not necessarily in that order), where: The root morpheme is the primary lexical unit of a word, which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced to smaller constituents.

[ 3 ] The derivational morphemes carry only derivational information.

[ 4 ] The affix is composed of all inflectional morphemes, and carries only inflectional information.

[ 5 ] The compound root morpheme + derivational morphemes is often called the stem .

[ 6 ] The decomposition stem + desinence can then be used to study inflection.

Software limitations may result in its display either in full-sized capitals (RUN) or in full-sized capitals of a smaller font. Either is regarded as an acceptable substitute for genuine small caps.
