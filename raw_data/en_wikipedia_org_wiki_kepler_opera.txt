Its libretto is based on the life and work of Johannes Kepler , the 16th and 17th century mathematician and astronomer . The work was commissioned by the Linz Landestheater and Linz09 (a programme celebrating the city's designation as a European Capital of Culture ). The opera was performed in the USA for the first time in May 2012 at the Spoleto Festival USA ; it was conducted by John Kennedy and directed by Sam Helfrich, featuring an English translation by Saskia M.
