Also known as descent with modification . Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ( speciation ), changes within lineages ( anagenesis ), and loss of species ( extinction ). "Evolution" is also another name for evolutionary biology , the subfield of biology concerned with studying evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth.
