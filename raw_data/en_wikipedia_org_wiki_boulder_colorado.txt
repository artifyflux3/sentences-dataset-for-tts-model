[ 1 ] With a population of 108,250 at the 2020 census , it is the most populous city in the county and the 12th-most populous city in Colorado.

[ 7 ] It is the principal city of the Boulder metropolitan statistical area , which had 330,758 residents in 2020 and is part of the Front Range Urban Corridor .

Boulder is located at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains , at an elevation of 5,430 feet (1,655 m) above sea level.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The city is 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the Colorado state capital of Denver . Boulder is a college town , hosting the University of Colorado Boulder , the flagship and largest campus of the University of Colorado system as well as numerous research institutes . Starting in 2027, Boulder will become the new home of the Sundance Film Festival .

History [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Boulder, Colorado .

Archaeological evidence shows that Boulder Valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era . Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.

[ 13 ] The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the Apache , Arapaho , Cheyenne , Comanche , Kiowa , Pawnee , Shoshone , Sioux , and Ute peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.

[ 14 ] Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but the settlers abused this peaceful approach, and some later took part in the Sand Creek massacre of Arapaho.

[ 15 ] In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. The Boulder, Nebraska Territory, post office opened on April 22, 1859.

[ 16 ] On August 24, 1859, voters of the Pike's Peak mining region approved the formation of the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson , [ 17 ] and on November 28, 1859, the extralegal Jefferson Territory created Jackson County with Boulder City as its seat.

[ 18 ] By 1860, Boulder City had 70 cabins, occupied mainly by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder, but were rarely pictured.

[ 13 ] The free Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, [ 19 ] and Boulder County was created on November 1, 1861, with Boulder City as its seat The Arapaho were forced to relocate by the Treaty of Fort Wise. With declining numbers, Niwot's band soon moved to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation. By 1862, the creek had yielded $100,000 in gold, and Boulder's population exceeded 300.

On November 7, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly passed legislation to locate the University of Colorado in Boulder.

[ 20 ] The City of Boulder City was incorporated on November 4, 1871.

[ 4 ] On September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main) on the CU campus. Colorado became a state on August 1, 1876, [ 21 ] and the university officially opened on September 5, 1877.

[ 22 ] The City of Boulder City shortened its name to the City of Boulder.

In 1907, Boulder adopted an anti- saloon ordinance.

[ 23 ] In 1916, statewide prohibition started in Colorado, and ended with the repeal of national prohibition in 1933.

[ 24 ] Boulder in 1900 Housing [ edit ] Median home prices rose 60% from 2010 to 2015 to $648,200.

[ 25 ] In 2024, the City Council of Boulder repealed a long-standing law that prevented Boulder from increasing new residential units by more than 1% in a year.

[ 26 ] In 1959, city voters approved the "Blue Line" city-charter amendment, which restricted city water service to altitudes below 5,750 feet (1,750 m), to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax to acquire open space to contain urban sprawl . In 1970, Boulder created a "comprehensive plan" to dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents' views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. In 1974, a Historic Preservation Code was passed. In 1976, a residential-growth management ordinance, the Danish Plan, was passed.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Geography [ edit ] Boulder's rock formations, the Flatirons The city of Boulder is located in the Boulder Valley, where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plains . The Flatirons , slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, are located west of the city and are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.

[ 29 ] Boulder Creek is the primary flow of water through Boulder. The creek was named before the city's founding and its etymology is unknown. It is from Boulder Creek that the city is believed to have taken its name.

[ citation needed ] Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city.

[ citation needed ] The creek flows into St. Vrain Creek east of Longmont , which is a tributary of the South Platte River .

At the 2020 United States census , the city had a total area of 17,514 acres (70.877 km 2 ), including 664 acres (2.689 km 2 ) of water.

[ 7 ] The 40th parallel , 40 degrees north latitude, runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as Baseline Road today.

Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath Flagstaff Mountain just a few miles east of the continental divide and about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Denver. Arapahoe Glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.

[ 30 ] Denver International Airport is located 33 miles (53 km) east-southeast of Boulder.

[ 31 ] Environment [ edit ] In 1899, government preservation of open space around Boulder began, with the Congress of the United States approving the allocation of 1,800 acres (7.3 km 2 ) of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon.

[ citation needed ] Wildlife protection [ edit ] Boulder has created an Urban Wildlife Management Plan which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife.

[ 32 ] The city's Parks and Recreation and Open Space and Mountain Parks departments have volunteers who monitor parks, including wetlands, lakes, etc., to protect ecosystems.

[ 33 ] From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.

[ 34 ] Traditionally, Boulder has avoided using chemical pesticides to control the insect population. However, with the threat of West Nile virus , the city began an integrative plan [ 35 ] to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides. Residents can opt out of the program by contacting the city and asking that their areas not be sprayed.

[ 36 ] Under Boulder law, exterminating prairie dogs requires a permit.

[ 37 ] In 2005, the city experimented with using goats for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse knapweed and Canada thistle , and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in future weed control projects. In 2010, goats were used to keep weeds under control at the Boulder Reservoir.

[ 38 ] The city's Open Space and Mountain Parks department manages approximately 8,000 acres (32 km 2 ) of protected forest land west of the city, in accordance with a 1999 Forest Ecosystem Management Plan. The plan aims to maintain or enhance native plant and animal species, their communities, the ecological processes that sustain them and to reduce the wildfire risk to forest and human communities.

Boulder has a temperate climate typical for much of the state and receives many sunny or mostly sunny days each year. Boulder is considered semi-arid (Köppen: BSk ) or humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa ) within the Köppen climate classification due to its relatively high yearly precipitation and average temperatures remaining above 32 °F (0 °C) year-round.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Winter conditions range from generally mild to the occasional bitterly cold. Highs average in the mid to upper 40s °F (7–9 °C). There are 4.6 nights annually where the temperature drops to 0 °F (−18 °C). Because of orographic lift , the mountains to the west often dry out the air passing over the Front Range , shielding the city from precipitation in winter, though heavy snowfalls may occur. Snowfall averages 88 inches (220 cm) per season. Snow depth is usually shallow. Due to the high elevation, a strong warming sun can quickly melt snow cover during the day and Chinook winds bring rapid warm-ups throughout the winter months.

[ 44 ] Summers are warm, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. There are roughly 30 days of 90 °F (32 °C) or above each year.

[ 44 ] Diurnal temperature variation is typically large due to the high elevation and semi-arid climate. Daytime highs are generally cooler than those of most Colorado cities with similar elevations.

The highest recorded temperature of 104 °F (40 °C) was on June 25, 2012.

[ 45 ] The record low was −33 °F (−36 °C) on January 17, 1930. The coldest high temperature, −12 °F (−24 °C), was on February 4, 1989. The warmest overnight low was on July 20, 1998, with a temperature of 82 °F (28 °C) [ 46 ] Climate data for Boulder, Colorado, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1893–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 73 (23) 79 (26) 90 (32) 88 (31) 95 (35) 104 (40) 104 (40) 102 (39) 100 (38) 90 (32) 80 (27) 76 (24) 104 (40) Mean maximum °F (°C) 65.4 (18.6) 66.4 (19.1) 73.9 (23.3) 79.5 (26.4) 86.6 (30.3) 94.2 (34.6) 97.9 (36.6) 95.3 (35.2) 91.5 (33.1) 83.1 (28.4) 72.8 (22.7) 65.4 (18.6) 98.5 (36.9) Mean daily maximum °F (°C) 47.0 (8.3) 48.3 (9.1) 57.0 (13.9) 62.8 (17.1) 71.3 (21.8) 82.5 (28.1) 88.0 (31.1) 86.0 (30.0) 78.8 (26.0) 65.9 (18.8) 54.5 (12.5) 46.3 (7.9) 65.7 (18.7) Daily mean °F (°C) 34.3 (1.3) 35.3 (1.8) 43.0 (6.1) 48.7 (9.3) 57.0 (13.9) 66.8 (19.3) 72.5 (22.5) 70.7 (21.5) 63.5 (17.5) 51.6 (10.9) 41.3 (5.2) 33.7 (0.9) 51.5 (10.9) Mean daily minimum °F (°C) 21.5 (−5.8) 22.3 (−5.4) 29.0 (−1.7) 34.5 (1.4) 42.7 (5.9) 51.1 (10.6) 57.0 (13.9) 55.5 (13.1) 48.1 (8.9) 37.2 (2.9) 28.1 (−2.2) 21.1 (−6.1) 37.3 (2.9) Mean minimum °F (°C) −0.5 (−18.1) 0.9 (−17.3) 10.7 (−11.8) 19.4 (−7.0) 30.1 (−1.1) 41.3 (5.2) 50.0 (10.0) 47.4 (8.6) 34.7 (1.5) 20.1 (−6.6) 7.9 (−13.4) 0.4 (−17.6) −7.5 (−21.9) Record low °F (°C) −33 (−36) −28 (−33) −13 (−25) −3 (−19) 17 (−8) 20 (−7) 40 (4) 40 (4) 15 (−9) −2 (−19) −12 (−24) −24 (−31) −33 (−36) Average precipitation inches (mm) 0.83 (21) 0.99 (25) 1.99 (51) 3.05 (77) 3.21 (82) 1.95 (50) 1.83 (46) 1.68 (43) 2.09 (53) 1.62 (41) 1.18 (30) 0.81 (21) 21.23 (540) Average snowfall inches (cm) 11.3 (29) 15.0 (38) 15.7 (40) 14.7 (37) 2.0 (5.1) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 1.0 (2.5) 7.0 (18) 13.1 (33) 13.0 (33) 92.8 (235.6) Average extreme snow depth inches (cm) 5.9 (15) 6.6 (17) 6.5 (17) 4.6 (12) 0.8 (2.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.3 (0.76) 3.9 (9.9) 7.0 (18) 6.9 (18) 12.9 (33) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 5.8 6.9 8.1 10.1 12.6 10.1 10.6 10.5 7.9 7.1 5.9 5.4 101.0 Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 5.6 6.5 6.0 4.9 0.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 2.1 4.8 5.5 36.8 Mean daily daylight hours 9.7 10.7 12.0 13.3 14.4 15.0 14.7 13.7 12.4 11.1 10.0 9.4 12.2 Average ultraviolet index 2 3 5 7 9 11 11 10 7 5 3 2 6 Source 1: NOAA [ 47 ] [ 44 ] Source 2: Weather Atlas (daylight) [ 48 ] Demographics [ edit ] A map of racial distribution in Boulder, 2020 US census.

[ 107 ] Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] The city from northbound US 36 as the highway descends into Boulder Since Boulder has operated under residential growth control ordinances since 1976, the growth of employment in the city has far outstripped population growth. Considerable road traffic enters the city each morning and leaves each afternoon, since many employees live in Longmont , Lafayette , Louisville , Broomfield , Westminster , and Denver .

The Boulder station is to be north of Pearl Street and east of 30th Street. At one time this commuter rail service was scheduled to commence in 2014, but major delays have ensued. In 2016, an initial 6-mile (9.7 km) segment opened, reaching from downtown Denver to southern Westminster at Westminster Station .

[ 115 ] The remaining 35 miles (56 km) of the Northwest Rail Line is planned to be completed by 2044, depending upon funding.
