Bipolar coordinate system Bipolar coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system based on the Apollonian circles .

[ 1 ] There is also a third system, based on two poles ( biangular coordinates ).

The term "bipolar" is further used on occasion to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses , hyperbolas , and Cassini ovals .  However, the term bipolar coordinates is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used for systems associated with those other curves, such as elliptic coordinates .

Geometric interpretation of the bipolar coordinates. The angle σ is formed by the two foci and the point P , whereas τ is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci. The corresponding circles of constant σ and τ are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.

Definition [ edit ] The system is based on two foci F 1 and F 2 . Referring to the figure at right, the σ -coordinate of a point P equals the angle F 1 P F 2 , and the τ -coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d 1 and d 2 : τ τ = ln ⁡ ⁡ d 1 d 2 .

{\displaystyle \tau =\ln {\frac {d_{1}}{d_{2}}}.} If, in the Cartesian system, the foci are taken to lie at (− a , 0) and ( a , 0), the coordinates of the point P are x = a sinh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ , y = a sin ⁡ ⁡ σ σ cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ .

{\displaystyle x=a\ {\frac {\sinh \tau }{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }},\qquad y=a\ {\frac {\sin \sigma }{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }}.} The coordinate τ ranges from − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } (for points close to F 1 ) to ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } (for points close to F 2 ). The coordinate σ is only defined modulo 2π , and is best taken to range from − π to π , by taking it as the negative of the acute angle F 1 P F 2 if P is in the lower half plane.

Proof that coordinate system is orthogonal [ edit ] The equations for x and y can be combined to give x + i y = a i cot ⁡ ⁡ ( σ σ + i τ τ 2 ) {\displaystyle x+iy=ai\cot \left({\frac {\sigma +i\tau }{2}}\right)} [ 2 ] [ 3 ] or x + i y = a coth ⁡ ⁡ ( τ τ − − i σ σ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle x+iy=a\coth \left({\frac {\tau -i\sigma }{2}}\right).} This equation shows that σ and τ are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function of x+iy (with logarithmic branch points at the foci), which in turn proves (by appeal to the general theory of conformal mapping ) (the Cauchy-Riemann equations ) that these particular curves of σ and τ intersect at right angles, i.e., it is an orthogonal coordinate system .

Curves of constant σ and τ [ edit ] The curves of constant σ correspond to non-concentric circles x 2 + ( y − − a cot ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 = a 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ σ σ = a 2 ( 1 + cot 2 ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) {\displaystyle x^{2}+\left(y-a\cot \sigma \right)^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{\sin ^{2}\sigma }}=a^{2}(1+\cot ^{2}\sigma )} (1) that intersect at the two foci.  The centers of the constant- σ circles lie on the y -axis at a cot ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle a\cot \sigma } with radius a sin ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle {\tfrac {a}{\sin \sigma }}} .  Circles of positive σ are centered above the x -axis, whereas those of negative σ lie below the axis.  As the magnitude | σ | − π /2 decreases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0, 0), which is reached when | σ | = π /2.  (From elementary geometry, all triangles on a circle with 2 vertices on opposite ends of a diameter are right triangles.) The curves of constant τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } are non-intersecting circles of different radii ( x − − a coth ⁡ ⁡ τ τ ) 2 + y 2 = a 2 sinh 2 ⁡ ⁡ τ τ = a 2 ( coth 2 ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \left(x-a\coth \tau \right)^{2}+y^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{\sinh ^{2}\tau }}=a^{2}(\coth ^{2}\tau -1)} (2) that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant- τ circles lie on the x -axis at a coth ⁡ ⁡ τ τ {\displaystyle a\coth \tau } with radius a sinh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ {\displaystyle {\tfrac {a}{\sinh \tau }}} .  The circles of positive τ lie in the right-hand side of the plane ( x > 0), whereas the circles of negative τ lie in the left-hand side of the plane ( x < 0).  The τ = 0 curve corresponds to the y -axis ( x = 0).  As the magnitude of τ increases, the radius of the circles decreases and their centers approach the foci.

Inverse relations [ edit ] The passage from the Cartesian coordinates towards the bipolar coordinates can be done via the following formulas: τ τ = 1 2 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x + a ) 2 + y 2 ( x − − a ) 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {1}{2}}\ln {\frac {(x+a)^{2}+y^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}+y^{2}}}} and π π − − σ σ = 2 arctan ⁡ ⁡ 2 a y a 2 − − x 2 − − y 2 + ( a 2 − − x 2 − − y 2 ) 2 + 4 a 2 y 2 .

{\displaystyle \pi -\sigma =2\arctan {\frac {2ay}{a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}+{\sqrt {(a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2})^{2}+4a^{2}y^{2}}}}}.} The coordinates also have the identities: tanh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ = 2 a x x 2 + y 2 + a 2 {\displaystyle \tanh \tau ={\frac {2ax}{x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2}}}} and tan ⁡ ⁡ σ σ = 2 a y x 2 + y 2 − − a 2 , {\displaystyle \tan \sigma ={\frac {2ay}{x^{2}+y^{2}-a^{2}}},} which can derived by solving Eq. (1) and (2) for cot ⁡ ⁡ σ σ {\displaystyle \cot \sigma } and coth ⁡ ⁡ τ τ {\displaystyle \coth \tau } , respectively.

Scale factors [ edit ] To obtain the scale factors for bipolar coordinates, we take the differential of the equation for x + i y {\displaystyle x+iy} , which gives d x + i d y = − − i a sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 2 ( σ σ + i τ τ ) ) ( d σ σ + i d τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle dx+i\,dy={\frac {-ia}{\sin ^{2}{\bigl (}{\tfrac {1}{2}}(\sigma +i\tau ){\bigr )}}}(d\sigma +i\,d\tau ).} Multiplying this equation with its complex conjugate yields ( d x ) 2 + ( d y ) 2 = a 2 [ 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ 1 2 ( σ σ + i τ τ ) sin ⁡ ⁡ 1 2 ( σ σ − − i τ τ ) ] 2 ( ( d σ σ ) 2 + ( d τ τ ) 2 ) .

{\displaystyle (dx)^{2}+(dy)^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{{\bigl [}2\sin {\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}\sigma +i\tau {\bigr )}\sin {\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}\sigma -i\tau {\bigr )}{\bigr ]}^{2}}}{\bigl (}(d\sigma )^{2}+(d\tau )^{2}{\bigr )}.} Employing the trigonometric identities for products of sines and cosines, we obtain 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ 1 2 ( σ σ + i τ τ ) sin ⁡ ⁡ 1 2 ( σ σ − − i τ τ ) = cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ − − cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ , {\displaystyle 2\sin {\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}\sigma +i\tau {\bigr )}\sin {\tfrac {1}{2}}{\bigl (}\sigma -i\tau {\bigr )}=\cos \sigma -\cosh \tau ,} from which it follows that ( d x ) 2 + ( d y ) 2 = a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 ( ( d σ σ ) 2 + ( d τ τ ) 2 ) .

{\displaystyle (dx)^{2}+(dy)^{2}={\frac {a^{2}}{(\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma )^{2}}}{\bigl (}(d\sigma )^{2}+(d\tau )^{2}{\bigr )}.} Hence the scale factors for σ and τ are equal, and given by h σ σ = h τ τ = a cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ .

{\displaystyle h_{\sigma }=h_{\tau }={\frac {a}{\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma }}.} Many results now follow in quick succession from the general formulae for orthogonal coordinates .
Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals d A = a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 d σ σ d τ τ , {\displaystyle dA={\frac {a^{2}}{\left(\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma \right)^{2}}}\,d\sigma \,d\tau ,} and the Laplacian is given by ∇ ∇ 2 Φ Φ = 1 a 2 ( cosh ⁡ ⁡ τ τ − − cos ⁡ ⁡ σ σ ) 2 ( ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ σ σ 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 Φ Φ ∂ ∂ τ τ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\Phi ={\frac {1}{a^{2}}}\left(\cosh \tau -\cos \sigma \right)^{2}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \sigma ^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}\Phi }{\partial \tau ^{2}}}\right).} Expressions for ∇ ∇ f {\displaystyle \nabla f} , ∇ ∇ ⋅ ⋅ F {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} } , and ∇ ∇ × × F {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} } can be expressed obtained by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates .

Applications [ edit ] The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations , e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation , for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables .  An example is the electric field surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors with unequal diameters.

Extension to 3-dimensions [ edit ] Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates .

The bipolar cylindrical coordinates are produced by translating the bipolar coordinates along the z -axis, i.e., the out-of-plane axis.

The bispherical coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the x -axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci.

The toroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the y -axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.
