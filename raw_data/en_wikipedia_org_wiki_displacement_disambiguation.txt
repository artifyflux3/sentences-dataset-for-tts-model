Displacement may refer to: Physical sciences [ edit ] Mathematics and physics [ edit ] Displacement (geometry) , is the difference between the final and initial position of a point trajectory (for instance, the center of mass of a moving object). The actual path covered to reach the final position is irrelevant.

Particle displacement , a measurement of distance of the movement of a particle in a medium as it transmits a wave (represented in mathematics by the lower-case Greek letter ξ) Displacement field (mechanics) , an assignment of displacement vectors for all points in a body that is displaced from one state to another Electric displacement field , as appears in Maxwell's equations Wien's displacement law , a relation concerning the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation Angular displacement , a change in orientation of a rigid body, the amount of rotation about a fixed axis.

Engineering [ edit ] Engine displacement , the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can draw in during one complete engine cycle Displacement (fluid) , an object immersed in a fluid pushes the fluid out of the way Positive displacement meter , a pump or flow meter which processes a definite fluid volume per revolution Displacement has several meanings related to ships and boats Displacement hull , where the moving hull's weight is supported by buoyancy alone and it must displace water from its path rather than planing on the water's surface Displacement speed , a rule of thumb for non planing watercraft to estimate their theoretical maximum speed Displacement (ship) , the weight of a ship Insulation displacement connector , a type of electrical connector Displacement mapping , a technique in 3D computer graphics Chemistry [ edit ] Single displacement reaction , a chemical reaction concerning the exchange of ions Double displacement reaction , a chemical reaction concerning the exchange of ions Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy , elements/isotopes created during radioactive decay Geology [ edit ] Earth Crustal Displacement, an aspect of the Pole shift hypothesis Medicine [ edit ] Displacement (orthopedic surgery) , change in alignment of the fracture fragments Social sciences [ edit ] Displacement (linguistics) , the ability of humans (and possibly some animals) to communicate ideas that are remote in time and/or space Forced displacement , by persecution or violence Displacement (psychology) , a sub-conscious defense mechanism Displacement (parapsychology) , a statistical or qualitative correspondence between targets and responses.

Development-induced displacement , the displacement of population for economic development Displacement may occur during gentrification.

Sport [ edit ] Displacement (fencing) , a movement that avoids or dodges an attack Economy [ edit ] Layoff Other [ edit ] Child displacement See also [ edit ] Offset (disambiguation) Transformation (geometry) Topics referred to by the same term This disambiguation page lists  articles associated with the title Displacement .
