A graph with six vertices and seven edges

In [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics"), particularly in [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), a **graph** is a structure consisting of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of objects where some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects are represented by abstractions called _[vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex\_(graph\_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)")_ (also called _nodes_ or _points_) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an _edge_ (also called _link_ or _line_).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-1) Typically, a graph is depicted in [diagrammatic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagrammatic_form "Diagrammatic form") as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.

The edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person _A_ can shake hands with a person _B_ only if _B_ also shakes hands with _A_. In contrast, if an edge from a person _A_ to a person _B_ means that _A_ owes money to _B_, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.

Graphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. The word "graph" was first used in this sense by [J. J. Sylvester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Sylvester "James Joseph Sylvester") in 1878 due to a direct relation between mathematics and [chemical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure "Chemical structure") (what he called a chemico-graphical image).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-3)

Definitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related [mathematical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure").

A graph with three vertices and three edges

A **graph** (sometimes called an _undirected graph_ to distinguish it from a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph), or a _simple graph_ to distinguish it from a [multigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph "Multigraph"))[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBenderWilliamson2010148-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-5) is a [pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair")_G_ = (_V_, _E_), where V is a set whose elements are called _vertices_ (singular: vertex), and E is a set of unordered pairs ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \{v_{1},v_{2}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ab3dfacc1827a2590fc80e98396513bdfc41945) of vertices, whose elements are called _edges_ (sometimes _links_ or _lines_).

The vertices u and v of an edge {_u_, _v_}  are called the edge's _endpoints_. The edge is said to _join_ u and v and to be _incident_ on them. A vertex may belong to no edge, in which case it is not joined to any other vertex and is called _isolated_. When an edge ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \{u,v\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f507af3d28091510daed6d4241af30d88c1c2c92) exists, the vertices u and v are called _adjacent_.

A [multigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph "Multigraph") is a generalization that allows multiple edges to have the same pair of endpoints. In some texts, multigraphs are simply called graphs.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBenderWilliamson2010149-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-7)

Sometimes, graphs are allowed to contain _[loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop\_(graph\_theory) "Loop (graph theory)")_, which are edges that join a vertex to itself. To allow loops, the pairs of vertices in E must be allowed to have the same node twice. Such generalized graphs are called _graphs with loops_ or simply _graphs_ when it is clear from the context that loops are allowed.

Generally, the vertex set V is taken to be finite (which implies that the edge set E is also finite). Sometimes [infinite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_graph "Infinite graph") are considered, but they are usually viewed as a special kind of [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation"), because most results on finite graphs either do not extend to the infinite case or need a rather different proof.

An [empty graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_graph "Empty graph") is a graph that has an [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set") of vertices (and thus an empty set of edges). The _order_ of a graph is its number |_V_| of vertices, usually denoted by n. The _size_ of a graph is its number |_E_| of edges, typically denoted by m. However, in some contexts, such as for expressing the [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity "Computational complexity") of algorithms, the term _size_ is used for the quantity |_V_| + |_E_| (otherwise, a non-empty graph could have size 0). The _degree_ or _valency_ of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to it; for graphs with loops, a loop is counted twice.

In a graph of order _n_, the maximum degree of each vertex is _n_ − 1 (or _n_ + 1 if loops are allowed, because a loop contributes 2 to the degree), and the maximum number of edges is _n_(_n_ − 1)/2 (or _n_(_n_ + 1)/2 if loops are allowed).

The edges of a graph define a [symmetric relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation") on the vertices, called the _adjacency relation_. Specifically, two vertices x and y are _adjacent_ if {_x_, _y_}  is an edge. A graph is fully determined by its [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix "Adjacency matrix")A, which is an _n_ × _n_ square matrix, with A ij specifying the number of connections from vertex i to vertex j. For a simple graph, _A ij_ is either 0, indicating disconnection, or 1, indicating connection; moreover _A ii_ = 0 because an edge in a simple graph cannot start and end at the same vertex. Graphs with self-loops will be characterized by some or all A ii being equal to a positive integer, and multigraphs (with multiple edges between vertices) will be characterized by some or all A ij being equal to a positive integer. Undirected graphs will have a [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix "Symmetric matrix") adjacency matrix (meaning _A ij_ = _A ji_).

A directed graph with three vertices and four directed edges, where the double arrow represents two directed edges in opposite directions

A **directed graph** or **digraph** is a graph in which edges have orientations.

In one restricted but very common sense of the term,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBenderWilliamson2010161-8) a **directed graph** is a pair _G_ = (_V_, _E_) comprising:

*   V, a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of _vertices_ (also called _nodes_ or _points_);
*   E, a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of _edges_ (also called _directed edges_, _directed links_, _directed lines_, _arrows_, or _arcs_), which are [ordered pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of distinct vertices: ![Image 6: {\displaystyle E\subseteq \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/410d2e8a388594591b3aa8f63b0cb4ad69063d01).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a **directed simple graph**.

In the edge (_x_, _y_) directed from x to y, the vertices x and y are called the _endpoints_ of the edge, x the _tail_ of the edge and y the _head_ of the edge. The edge is said to _join_ x and y and to be _incident_ on x and on y. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge (_y_, _x_) is called the _inverted edge_ of (_x_, _y_). _[Multiple edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple\_edges "Multiple edges")_, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head.

In one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBenderWilliamson2010161-8) a directed graph is sometimes defined to be an ordered triple _G_ = (_V_, _E_, _ϕ_) comprising:

*   V, a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of _vertices_ (also called _nodes_ or _points_);
*   E, a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of _edges_ (also called _directed edges_, _directed links_, _directed lines_, _arrows_ or _arcs_);
*   ϕ, an _incidence function_ mapping every edge to an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices): ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \phi :E\to \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/096c0238dab3bcc057031535d376c314af5c1823).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a **directed multigraph**.

A _[loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop\_(graph\_theory) "Loop (graph theory)")_ is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Directed graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex ![Image 8: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) to itself is the edge (for a directed simple graph) or is incident on (for a directed multigraph) ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (x,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72f9e25892f6d000349b8bb6578a59567efbdd63) which is not in ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\mid (x,y)\in V^{2}\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c443a9831089f642e75b9f2b0fa4e77579fe8f5f). So to allow loops the definitions must be expanded. For directed simple graphs, the definition of ![Image 11: {\displaystyle E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b) should be modified to ![Image 12: {\displaystyle E\subseteq V^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8ea84ada3f66ce8af25358315f46bd85cc8ecc7). For directed multigraphs, the definition of ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) should be modified to ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \phi :E\to V^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/485ac18937de71de3af261d6f24621ba8786f467). To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called precisely a **directed simple graph permitting loops** and a **directed multigraph permitting loops** (or a _[quiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver\_(mathematics) "Quiver (mathematics)")_) respectively.

The edges of a directed simple graph permitting loops G is a [homogeneous relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation#Homogeneous_relation "Binary relation") ~ on the vertices of G that is called the _adjacency relation_ of G. Specifically, for each edge (_x_, _y_), its endpoints x and y are said to be _adjacent_ to one another, which is denoted _x_ ~ _y_.

A mixed graph with three vertices, two directed edges, and an undirected edge.

A _mixed graph_ is a graph in which some edges may be directed and some may be undirected. It is an ordered triple _G_ = (_V_, _E_, _A_) for a _mixed simple graph_ and _G_ = (_V_, _E_, _A_, _ϕ E_, _ϕ A_) for a _mixed multigraph_ with V, E (the undirected edges), A (the directed edges), ϕ E and ϕ A defined as above. Directed and undirected graphs are special cases.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Weighted_network.svg/330px-Weighted_network.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Weighted_network.svg)

A weighted graph with ten vertices and twelve edges

A _weighted graph_ or a _network_[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-10) is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#cite_note-11) Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in [shortest path problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem "Shortest path problem") such as the [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem "Traveling salesman problem").

One definition of an _oriented graph_ is that it is a directed graph in which at most one of (_x_, _y_) and (_y_, _x_) may be edges of the graph. That is, it is a directed graph that can be formed as an [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory) "Orientation (graph theory)") of an undirected (simple) graph.

Some authors use "oriented graph" to mean the same as "directed graph". Some authors use "oriented graph" to mean any orientation of a given undirected graph or multigraph.

A _regular graph_ is a graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex has the same degree. A regular graph with vertices of degree _k_ is called a _k_‑regular graph or regular graph of degree _k_.

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Complete_graph_K5.svg/190px-Complete_graph_K5.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Complete_graph_K5.svg)

A complete graph with five vertices and ten edges. Each vertex has an edge to every other vertex.

A _complete graph_ is a graph in which each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. A complete graph contains all possible edges.

A _finite graph_ is a graph in which the vertex set and the edge set are [finite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set"). Otherwise, it is called an _infinite graph_.

Most commonly in graph theory it is implied that the graphs discussed are finite. If the graphs are infinite, that is usually specifically stated.

In an undirected graph, an unordered pair of vertices {_x_, _y_} is called _connected_ if a path leads from _x_ to _y_. Otherwise, the unordered pair is called _disconnected_.

A _connected graph_ is an undirected graph in which every unordered pair of vertices in the graph is connected. Otherwise, it is called a _disconnected graph_.

In a directed graph, an ordered pair of vertices (_x_, _y_) is called _strongly connected_ if a directed path leads from _x_ to _y_. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called _weakly connected_ if an undirected path leads from _x_ to _y_ after replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges. Otherwise, the ordered pair is called _disconnected_.

A _strongly connected graph_ is a directed graph in which every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is strongly connected. Otherwise, it is called a _weakly connected graph_ if every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is weakly connected. Otherwise it is called a _disconnected graph_.

A _[k-vertex-connected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-vertex-connected\_graph "K-vertex-connected graph")_ or _[k-edge-connected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-edge-connected\_graph "K-edge-connected graph")_ is a graph in which no set of _k_ − 1 vertices (respectively, edges) exists that, when removed, disconnects the graph. A _k_-vertex-connected graph is often called simply a _k-connected graph_.

A _[bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite\_graph "Bipartite graph")_ is a simple graph in which the vertex set can be [partitioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set "Partition of a set") into two sets, _W_ and _X_, so that no two vertices in _W_ share a common edge and no two vertices in _X_ share a common edge. Alternatively, it is a graph with a [chromatic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_number "Chromatic number") of 2.

In a [complete bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_bipartite_graph "Complete bipartite graph"), the vertex set is the union of two disjoint sets, _W_ and _X_, so that every vertex in _W_ is adjacent to every vertex in _X_ but there are no edges within _W_ or _X_.

A _path graph_ or _linear graph_ of order _n_ ≥ 2 is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order _v_ 1, _v_ 2, …, _v_ _n_ such that the edges are the {_v_ _i_, _v_ _i_+1} where _i_ = 1, 2, …, _n_ − 1. Path graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all but two vertices is 2 and the degree of the two remaining vertices is 1. If a path graph occurs as a [subgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Subgraphs "Glossary of graph theory") of another graph, it is a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") in that graph.

A _planar graph_ is a graph whose vertices and edges can be drawn in a plane such that no two of the edges intersect.

A _cycle graph_ or _circular graph_ of order _n_ ≥ 3 is a graph in which the vertices can be listed in an order _v_ 1, _v_ 2, …, _v_ _n_ such that the edges are the {_v_ _i_, _v_ _i_+1} where _i_ = 1, 2, …, _n_ − 1, plus the edge {_v_ _n_, _v_ 1}. Cycle graphs can be characterized as connected graphs in which the degree of all vertices is 2. If a cycle graph occurs as a subgraph of another graph, it is a cycle or circuit in that graph.

A _tree_ is an undirected graph in which any two [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") are connected by _exactly one_[path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)"), or equivalently a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph "Connected graph")[acyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) "Cycle (graph theory)") undirected graph.

A _forest_ is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _at most one_ path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union_of_graphs "Disjoint union of graphs") of trees.

A _polytree_ (or _directed tree_ or _oriented tree_ or _singly connected network_) is a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph "Directed acyclic graph") (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree.

A _polyforest_ (or _directed forest_ or _oriented forest_) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest.

More advanced kinds of graphs are:

*   [Petersen graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph "Petersen graph") and its generalizations;
*   [perfect graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_graph "Perfect graph");
*   [cographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cograph "Cograph");
*   [chordal graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph "Chordal graph");
*   other graphs with large [automorphism groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_automorphism "Graph automorphism"): [vertex-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex-transitive_graph "Vertex-transitive graph"), [arc-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc-transitive_graph "Arc-transitive graph"), and [distance-transitive graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-transitive_graph "Distance-transitive graph");
*   [strongly regular graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_regular_graph "Strongly regular graph") and their generalizations [distance-regular graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-regular_graph "Distance-regular graph").

Properties of graphs
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graph_(discrete_mathematics)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Properties of graphs")]

Two vertices of a graph are called _adjacent_ if they share a common edge. Two vertices of a directed graph are called _consecutive_ if the head of the first one is the tail of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called _adjacent_ if they share a common edge (_consecutive_ if the first one is the tail and the second one is the head of an edge), in which case the common edge is said to _join_ the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called _incident_.

The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the _trivial graph_. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an _edgeless graph_. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the _[null graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null\_graph "Null graph")_ or _empty graph_, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.

Normally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called _vertex-labeled_. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges.) The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called _edge-labeled_. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as _labeled_. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called _unlabeled_. (In the literature, the term _labeled_ may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)

The [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory") of directed multigraphs permitting loops is the [comma category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_category "Comma category") Set ↓ _D_ where _D_: Set → Set is the [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor") taking a set _s_ to _s_ × _s_.

A graph with six vertices and seven edges

There are several operations that produce new graphs from initial ones, which might be classified into the following categories:

*   _unary operations_, which create a new graph from an initial one, such as: 
    *   [edge contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_contraction "Edge contraction"),
    *   [line graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph "Line graph"),
    *   [dual graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph "Dual graph"),
    *   [complement graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph "Complement graph"),
    *   [graph rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_rewriting "Graph rewriting");

*   _binary operations_, which create a new graph from two initial ones, such as: 
    *   [disjoint union of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union_of_graphs "Disjoint union of graphs"),
    *   [cartesian product of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs "Cartesian product of graphs"),
    *   [tensor product of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_graphs "Tensor product of graphs"),
    *   [strong product of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_product_of_graphs "Strong product of graphs"),
    *   [lexicographic product of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_product_of_graphs "Lexicographic product of graphs"),
    *   [series–parallel graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series%E2%80%93parallel_graph "Series–parallel graph").

In a [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph "Hypergraph"), an edge can join any positive number of vertices.

An undirected graph can be seen as a [simplicial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex "Simplicial complex") consisting of 1-[simplices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex") (the edges) and 0-simplices (the vertices). As such, complexes are generalizations of graphs since they allow for higher-dimensional simplices.

Every graph gives rise to a [matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid "Matroid").

In [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory "Model theory"), a graph is just a [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(model_theory) "Structure (model theory)"). But in that case, there is no limitation on the number of edges: it can be any [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number"), see [continuous graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_graph "Continuous graph").

In [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology "Computational biology"), [power graph analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_graph_analysis "Power graph analysis") introduces power graphs as an alternative representation of undirected graphs.

In [geographic information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_systems "Geographic information systems"), [geometric networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_networks "Geometric networks") are closely modeled after graphs, and borrow many concepts from [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory") to perform spatial analysis on road networks or utility grids.
