With the decline of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party following 1960, the movement is most closely associated with the Republican Party (GOP).

Economic conservatives favor less government regulation, lower taxes and weaker labor unions while social conservatives focus on moral issues and neoconservatives focus on democracy worldwide. Conservatives generally distrust the United Nations and Europe and apart from the libertarian wing favor a strong military and give enthusiastic support to Israel.

[ 1 ] Although conservatism has much older roots in American history , the modern movement began to gel in the mid-1930s when intellectuals and politicians collaborated with businessmen to oppose the liberalism of the New Deal led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt , newly energized labor unions and big-city Democratic machines. After World War II, that coalition gained strength from new philosophers and writers who developed an intellectual rationale for conservatism.

[ 2 ] Richard Nixon 's victory in the 1968 election is often considered a realigning election in American politics . From 1932 to 1968, the Democratic Party was the majority party as during that time the Democrats had won seven out of nine presidential elections and their agenda gravely affected that undertaken by  Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower administration , which was altered completely with Nixon's 1968 electoral victory. Democrats were largely split over whether to support or oppose the Vietnam War , and many whites felt the national Democratic Party had deserted them, leading many of them to vote Republican at the presidential level since the 1950s and at the state and local level since the 1990s.

[ citation needed ] In the 1980 presidential election and in his subsequent presidential administration , Ronald Reagan rejuvenated conservatism in the United States, supporting tax cuts , significantly increasing defense spending , deregulation , and breaking with the post- World War II foreign policy consensus of containing the Soviet Union and instead introducing and advancing the Reagan Doctrine , which sought to rollback global communism and bring an end to the Cold War.

Reagan also supported and advanced the ideals associated with family values and conservative Judeo-Christian morality , leading many historians to call the 1980s the Reagan era .

[ 3 ] The Reagan model remains the conservative standard for social, economic, and foreign policies. In the 21st century, social issues such as abortion , gun control , and gay marriage have grown in importance to many American conservatives. Since 2009, the Tea Party movement has energized conservatives at the local level against the policies made by the presidency of Barack Obama , leading to Republican success in the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, and the 2016 election , in which Donald Trump was elected president.

Chronology of events [ edit ] Main articles: Conservatism in the United States and History of the United States Republican Party 1930s [ edit ] As the nation plunged into its deepest depression ever , Republicans and conservatives fall into disfavor in 1930, 1932 and 1934, losing more and more of their seats. Liberals (mostly Democrats with a few Republicans and independents) come to power with the landslide 1932 election of liberal Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his first 100 days Roosevelt pushes through a series of dramatic economic programs known as the New Deal .

[ 4 ] Major metropolitan newspapers generally opposed the New Deal , including those owned by William Randolph Hearst and his Hearst chain [ 5 ] Robert R. McCormick , who then owned the Chicago Tribune , compared the New Deal to communism and was an America First isolationist who strongly opposed entering World War II . McCormick also railed against the League of Nations , the World Court , and socialism .

[ 6 ] 1934 Opposition to New Deal policies first takes shape as the American Liberty League . Led by conservative Democrats such as Al Smith , it fades after Roosevelt's 1936 landslide and disbands in 1940.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Businessmen begin organizing their opposition especially to labor unions .

[ 9 ] 1935 Former President Herbert Hoover develops his critique of New Deal liberalism based on the values of liberty, limited government , and constitutionalism .

[ 10 ] 1936 1937 cartoon by Joseph L. Parrish in the Chicago Tribune warning Franklin D. Roosevelt 's executive branch reorganization plan is a power grab President Roosevelt calls his opponents "conservatives" as a term of abuse, they reply that they are "true liberals".

[ 11 ] Most publishers favor Republican moderate Alf Landon for president. In the nation's 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed Landon represented 70% of the circulation, while Roosevelt won 69% of the actual voters.

[ 12 ] Roosevelt carries 46 of the 48 states and liberals gain in both the House and the Senate , thanks to newly energized labor unions, city machines, and the WPA.

[ 13 ] Since 1928 the GOP has lost 178 House seats, 40 Senate seats, and 19 governorships; it retains a mere 89 seats in the House and 16 in the Senate.

[ 14 ] 1937 Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court alienates conservative Democrats; most newspapers which supported FDR in 1936 oppose the plan, with many warning it was a prelude to dictatorship.

[ 15 ] Conservative Republicans (nearly all from the North) and conservative Democrats (most from the South), form the Conservative Coalition and block most new liberal proposals until the 1960s.

[ 16 ] The Conservative Manifesto (originally titled "An Address to the People of the United States") rallies the opposition to Roosevelt. It is drafted by Senators Josiah Bailey (D-NC) and Arthur H. Vandenberg (R-MI).

[ 17 ] The liberal American Federation of Labor (AFL) and more leftist Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) labor federations are both growing and both support FDR. Their bitter feud over jurisdiction, however, produces numerous strikes, angers public opinion and weakens their political power.

[ 18 ] 1938 Opponents of conservatism weaken sharply. FDR's allies in the AFL and CIO battle each other; his court-packing plan is rejected; his attempt to purge the conservatives from the Democratic Party fails and strengthens them; the sharp recession of 1937–1938 discredits his argument that New Deal policies would lead to full recovery.

[ 19 ] The Republicans make major gains in the House and Senate in the 1938 elections.

[ 20 ] Leo Strauss (1899–1973), a refugee from Nazi Germany , teaches political philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York (1938–49) and the University of Chicago (1949–1969). He was not an activist but his ideas have been influential.

[ 21 ] 1939 Robert A. Taft As Republican senator from Ohio (1939–53), Robert A. Taft leads the conservative opposition to liberal policies (apart from public housing and aid to education, which he supported). Taft opposed most of the New Deal, entry into World War II , NATO , and sending troops to the Korean War . He was not so much an "isolationist" as a staunch opponent of the ever-expanding powers of the White House. The growth of this power, Taft feared, would lead to dictatorship or at least spoil American democracy, republicanism and civil virtue.

[ 22 ] 1940s [ edit ] 1943 Medical missionary Walter Judd (1898–1994) enters Congress (1943–63) and defines the conservative position on China as all-out support for the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and opposition to the Communists under Mao . Judd redoubled his support after the Nationalists in 1949 fled to Formosa (Taiwan).

[ 23 ] The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) is founded in Washington "to defend the principles and improve the institutions of American freedom and democratic capitalism—limited government, private enterprise, individual liberty and responsibility, vigilant and effective defense and foreign policies, political accountability, and open debate." [ 24 ] 1944 Party change of House seats in 1946 showcasing GOP landslide March: Friedrich Hayek , an Austrian-born British economist, publishes The Road to Serfdom , which is widely read in America and Britain. He warns that well-intentioned government intervention in the economy is a slippery slope that will lead to tight government controls over people's lives, just as medieval serfdom had done.

[ 25 ] The weekly magazine Human Events is founded by Frank Hanighen and Felix Morley with a significant contribution from ex-New Dealer Henry Regnery .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Ronald Reagan later says that the magazine "helped me stop being a liberal Democrat." [ 28 ] 1945 Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973), having fled the Nazis, becomes professor of economics at New York University (1945–1969) where he disseminates Austrian School libertarianism.

[ 29 ] 1946 Milton Friedman (1912–2006) is appointed professor of economics at the University of Chicago.

[ 30 ] Previously a Keynesian , Friedman moves right under the influence of his close friend George Stigler (1911–1991). He founds the market-oriented Chicago School of Economics which reshapes conservative economic theory. Stigler opposes regulation of industry as counterproductive; Friedman undermines Keynesian macroeconomics .

[ 31 ] Friedman wins the Nobel Prize in 1976 and Stigler in 1982.

November 5: Republicans score landslide victories in the House and Senate in off-year elections and set about enacting a conservative agenda in the 80th Congress .

[ 32 ] Warning against communism, 1947 1947 June: Congress passes the Taft-Hartley Act , designed by conservatives to create what they consider a proper balance between the rights of management and the rights of labor. Unions call it a slave labor law; Truman vetoes it and both houses override the veto.

[ 33 ] 1948 Deep South Democrats led by Strom Thurmond split from the National Democratic Party to form the pro- segregation States' Rights Democratic Party or Dixiecrat party. They are protesting support for civil rights legislation in the party platform and make Thurmond their nominee for president in the 1948 election . Nearly all return to the Democratic party in 1949.

[ 34 ] Scholar Richard M. Weaver publishes Ideas Have Consequences , which influences intellectuals to question sophistic interpretations of literature.

[ 35 ] June: Liberal Republican Thomas Dewey again wins the Republican nomination , to the frustration of conservatives.

[ 36 ] November: Pundits are astonished when Dewey loses to incumbent Democrat Harry S. Truman in the presidential election .

[ 37 ] 1950s [ edit ] After the war, businessmen opposed to New Deal liberalism read Hayek, fight labor unions, and fund politicized think tanks such as American Enterprise Institute (founded 1943). They promote statewide right-to-work campaigns.

[ 38 ] 1950 The intellectual reputation of conservatism reaches a low ebb; Lionel Trilling observes that "liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition" and dismisses conservatism as a series of "irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas." [ 39 ] February: Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy gives a speech saying, "While I cannot take the time to name all the men in the State Department who have been named as members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring, I have here in my hand a list of 205." The speech marks the beginning of McCarthy's anti-communist pursuits.

[ 40 ] 1951 Political philosopher Francis Wilson in The Case for Conservatism (1951) defines conservatism as "a philosophy of social evolution, in which certain lasting values are defended within the framework of the tension of political conflict. And when given values are at stake the conservative can even become a revolutionary." [ 41 ] [ 42 ] William F. Buckley Jr.

with publisher Henry Regnery Company release God and Man at Yale to mixed reviews.

[ citation needed ] 1952 In securing the Republican Party presidential nomination, Dwight D. "Ike" Eisenhower leads moderate and liberal Republicans to victory over Sen.

Robert A. Taft , the conservative champion.

[ 43 ] Ike then wins the presidency in a landslide by denouncing the failures of the Truman Administration in terms of "Korea, Communism and Corruption." [ 44 ] Russell Kirk Four major works of intellectual history that would influence conservatism are published: Daniel J. Boorstin 's The Genius of American Politics , Peter Viereck 's Conservatism: From John Adams to Churchill , Russell Kirk 's The Conservative Mind , and Robert Nisbet 's Quest for Community [ 45 ] Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) is founded by libertarian journalist Frank Chodorov (1887–1966) to counter the growing spread of collectivism; its original name was Intercollegiate Society of Individualists .

[ 46 ] 1953 President Eisenhower works closely with Senator Taft, the new GOP majority leader, on domestic issues; they differ on foreign policy.

[ 47 ] 1955 The National Review weekly magazine is founded by William F. Buckley, Jr.

(1925–2008). The editors include representative traditionalists, Catholics, libertarians and ex-communists. The most notable were Russell Kirk , James Burnham , Frank Meyer , Willmoore Kendall , L. Brent Bozell, Jr.

, and Whittaker Chambers .

[ 48 ] In The Liberal Tradition in American , Louis Hartz claims that there has never been a European-style conservative tradition in America and that the sole mainstream tradition is Lockean liberalism.

[ 49 ] 1957 Russian-born philosopher Ayn Rand (1905–1982) publishes her novel Atlas Shrugged ; it attracts the libertarian wing of American conservatism by promoting aggressive entrepreneurship and rejecting religion and altruism . She influences even those conservative intellectuals who reject her ethical system such as Buckley and Whittaker Chambers.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] 1958 Barry Goldwater Vermont C. Royster (1914–1996) becomes editor of the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal (1958 to 1971). He wins two Pulitzer Prizes for his conservative interpretation of economic and political news.

[ 52 ] Conservatives try economic populism to appeal to blue collar workers forced to join labor unions. The GOP pushes "right-to-work" laws in California and elsewhere, but the unions counter-organize for the Democrats. Conservatives try again in 2011.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] November: In a deep economic recession the Democrats score a landslide victory , defeating many old-guard conservative Republicans. The new Congress has large Democratic majorities: 282 Democrats to 154 GOP in the House , 64 to 34 in the Senate . Nevertheless, the new Congress fails to pass any major liberal legislation as most committee chairs are Southern Democrats who support the Conservative Coalition .

[ 55 ] Two Republicans score upsets in the face of the landslide—liberal Nelson Rockefeller as Governor of New York , [ 56 ] and Barry Goldwater as Senator from Arizona ; [ 57 ] both become presidential prospects.

[ citation needed ] December: Businessman Robert W. Welch, Jr.

(1899–1985) and twelve others found the John Birch Society , an anti-communist advocacy group with chapters across the country. Welch uses an elaborate control system that enables him to keep a very tight rein on each chapter. Its major activities are circulating petitions and supporting the local police. It becomes a favorite target of attack from the left and is disowned by many of the prominent conservatives of the day.

[ 58 ] 1959 As late as 1959 William Buckley complains that conservatives were "bound together for the most part by negative response to liberalism," and that, philosophically, "there [is] no commonly-acknowledged conservative position." [ 59 ] 1960s [ edit ] Liberalism made major gains after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, as Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) pushed through his liberal Great Society as well as civil rights laws. An unexpected bonanza helped conservatism in the late 1960s as liberalism came under intense attack from the New Left , especially in academe. This new element, says liberal historian Michael Kazin , worked to "topple the corrupted liberal order." [ 60 ] For the New Left "liberal" became a nasty epithet. Liberal commentator E. J. Dionne finds that, "If liberal ideology began to crumble intellectually in the 1960s it did so in part because the New Left represented a highly articulate and able wrecking crew." [ 61 ] "A Time for Choosing" Speech In support of Goldwater in 1964, Reagan delivers the TV address "A Time for Choosing", a speech which made Reagan the leader of movement conservatism Date October 27, 1964 ( 1964-10-27 ) Duration 29 : 33 Location Los Angeles, CA, United States Also known as "The Speech" Type Televised campaign speech Participants Ronald Reagan Website Video clip, audio, transcript Movement conservatism emerges as grassroots activists react to liberal and New Left agendas. It develops a structure that supports Goldwater in 1964 and Ronald Reagan in 1976–80. By the late 1970s, local evangelical churches join the movement.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Liberalism faces a racial crisis nationwide. Within weeks of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights law , "long hot summers" begin, lasting until 1970, with the worst outbreaks coming in the summer of 1967 . Nearly 400 racial disorders in 298 cities saw blacks attacking shopkeepers and police, and looting stores.

[ 64 ] Meanwhile, the urban crime rates shoot up. Demands for " law and order " escalate and the backlash causes disillusionment among working class whites with the liberalism of the Democratic Party.

[ 65 ] In the mid-1960s the GOP debates race and civil rights intensely. Republican liberals, led by Nelson Rockefeller , argue for a strong federal role because it was morally right and politically advantageous. Conservatives call for a more limited federal presence and discount the possibility of significant black voter support. Nixon avoids race issues in 1968.

[ 66 ] Highlights of the 1960 Republican convention in Chicago, Illinois 1960 Cover of Modern Age Conservatives are angered when GOP presidential nominee Richard Nixon strikes a deal with liberal leader Nelson Rockefeller. Nixon agrees to put all 14 of Rockefeller's demands in the party platform, including promises that the executive branch be totally reorganized and that Rockefeller's liberal policies on economic growth, medical care for the aged and civil rights be included.

[ 67 ] Led by Goldwater, conservatives vow to organize at the grass roots and take control of the GOP.

[ 68 ] Barry Goldwater publishes The Conscience of a Conservative . The book helps the Arizona Senator reignite the conservative movement which rallies behind the charismatic Arizona Senator.

[ 69 ] Fall: Frank S. Meyer 's article, "Freedom, Tradition, Conservatism", is published in Modern Age ,  argues that traditional conservatism and libertarianism share a common philosophical heritage. The concept comes to be known as " fusionism " and unites the two strands of thought.

[ 70 ] September: William F. Buckley, Jr., forms a youth group called the Young Americans for Freedom ; it helps Goldwater win the 1964 nomination but is otherwise ineffective and collapses in internal bickering.

[ 71 ] November: Nixon loses a close election to liberal Democrat John F. Kennedy .

[ 72 ] 1961 Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) is founded by Pat Robertson ; its signature program The 700 Club launches in 1966.

[ 73 ] May: Texas elects Senator John Tower ; he is the first Republican from the former Confederacy ever to win popular election and begins the growth of the GOP in that state.

[ 74 ] 1962 Buckley and the National Review launch denunciations of the John Birch Society; Goldwater agrees; the attack limits its influence to the conspiracy-minded.

[ 75 ] 1963 The controversial " Daisy " Johnson TV commercial in 1964 attacks Goldwater foreign policy as inviting nuclear war [ 76 ] January: Governor of Alabama, Democrat George Wallace , electrifies the white South by proclaiming " segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!

"  Wallace's angry populist rhetoric appeals to the poor farmers and workers who comprise a major part of the New Deal Coalition . He does well in Democratic primaries in the industrial North as well as the rural South. He exploits distrust of government, racial fear, anti-communism and a yearning for "traditional" American values.

[ 77 ] In support of Goldwater, Reagan delivers the address, " A Time for Choosing ", which speech launches Reagan to national prominence [ 78 ] 1964 June: Senator Everett Dirksen (R-IL) plays a key role in passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to end segregation, but Goldwater joins Southern Democrats in voting against it.

[ 79 ] In the 1964 presidential election , Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the Deep South Jul: George Wallace gives a speech condemning the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , claiming that it would threaten individual liberty, free enterprise and private property rights and that "The liberal left-wingers have passed it. Now let them employ some pinknik social engineers in Washington, D.C., to figure out what to do with it." [ 80 ] July: Goldwater defeats liberal Republicans Rockefeller  to win the GOP presidential nomination and launch a conservative crusade.

July: Under attack as an "extremist," Goldwater lashes back in his speech accepting the GOP nomination: I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!

[ 81 ] November: In the presidential election , Goldwater is defeated in a landslide, and many GOP congressmen are defeated with him.

[ 82 ] December: The American Conservative Union , the oldest conservative lobbying organization in the United States, is founded by William F. Buckley, Jr.

[ 83 ] 1965 William F. Buckley Jr. gains national attention by running for mayor of New York City on the ticket of the new Conservative Party of New York State . He loses the election but gains visibility and respectability for the cause in the aftermath of Goldwater's defeat.

[ 84 ] 1966 April: Socialist Norman Thomas appears on the premiere episode of Firing Line with host William F. Buckley. The program remains on the air for 33 years and is the longest running television program with the same host.

[ 85 ] November: Republicans score major gains in the off-year elections , emphasizing issues of law and order. Liberal candidates endorsed by the AFL–CIO do poorly.

[ 86 ] Ronald Reagan is elected governor of California.

[ 87 ] 1967 New Left students hold highly publicized rallies chanting, "Hey– Hey– LBJ– How many kids did you kill today?". Their confrontational rhetoric and efforts to disrupt the draft alienates millions of voters who move to the right.

[ 88 ] A generational rift opens as leftist students espouse Marxism , sexual freedom , marijuana , rock music and long hair that outrages the older generation. Elite colleges and universities come under heavy pressure (but not the smaller state schools and community colleges that generally remain calm).

[ 89 ] 1968 presidential election results in which red denotes states won by Nixon/Agnew, blue denotes those won by Humphrey/Muskie and orange denotes states won by Wallace/LeMay The American Spectator monthly political magazine is founded by Emmett Tyrrell ; its name until 1977 was The Alternative: An American Spectator .

[ 90 ] Phyllis Schlafly launches the Eagle Trust Fund, a precursor to the conservative think tank Eagle Forum .

[ 91 ] 1968 Liberalism collapses politically as the Democratic Party splits into five factions over issues of Vietnam, race and attacks from New Left.

[ 92 ] Richard Nixon is elected president over Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace ( American Independent Party ), emphasizing the need for law and order.

[ 93 ] The New Left denounced Humphrey as a war criminal , Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler—a man with "a personal attitude of indulgence and permissiveness toward the lawless." [ 94 ] Beinart observes that "with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey was the one thing on which left and right could agree." [ 95 ] 1969 Libertarian economists , especially Milton Friedman and Walter Oi , lead the intellectual charge against the draft. Nixon abolishes it as the Vietnam War ends in 1973.

[ 96 ] Young Americans for Freedom splits into competing, irreconcilable factions.

[ 97 ] The libertarians, influenced by Ayn Rand, split from the traditionalists and form the Society for Individual Liberty .

[ 98 ] 1970s [ edit ] Historians Meg Jacobs and Julian Zelizer argue that the 1970s were characterized by "a vast shift toward social and political conservatism," as well as a sharp decline in the proportion of voters who identified with liberalism.

[ 99 ] Neoconservatism emerges as liberals become disenchanted with Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society welfare programs. They increasingly focus on foreign policy, especially anti-communism, and support for Israel and for democracy in the Third World.

[ 100 ] While Nixon continues to antagonize and anger liberals, many of his programs upset conservatives. His foreign policy with Henry Kissinger focuses on détente with the USSR and China, and becomes a main target of conservatives. Nixon is uninterested in tax cuts or deregulation, but he does use executive orders and presidential authority to impose price and wage controls, expand the welfare state, require Affirmative Action, grow the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts , and create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

[ 101 ] 1970 November: James L. Buckley is elected Senator for New York with 39% of the vote, running as a candidate for the Conservative Party of New York .
