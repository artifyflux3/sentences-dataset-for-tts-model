Life [ edit ] He was born in Great Gonerby , on the outskirts of Grantham in Lincolnshire , where his father was a dairy farmer.

[ 2 ] He was educated at King's School, Grantham from age 11, and went to Queen Mary College, London for a degree course in theoretical physics and mathematics.

[ 3 ] He graduated B.Sc. there in 1964.

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Pask studied for a Ph.D. in nuclear physics under John M. Blatt at the University of New South Wales from 1964, graduating in 1967 with a dissertation entitled Studies in the Nuclear Three-Body Problem .

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] He spent a period at Duke University , then returned to the University of New South Wales as lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics.

[ 4 ] In 1971 Pask moved to the Australian National University , with an Australian Research Council fellowship to work in the Department of Applied Mathematics there. He was made a Fellow in 1973, and Senior Fellow in 1978.

[ 4 ] He moved in 1986 to become head of University College at UNSW Canberra at ADFA , retiring from that post after 12 years.

[ 3 ] Pask is now Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Sciences and History at University of New South Wales.

[ 6 ] Research interests [ edit ] As a post-doctoral researcher, Pask turned to optical physics and biological vision , among other topics.

[ 4 ] In 1973 he published with Allan Snyder an optical waveguide explanation of the Stiles–Crawford effect . Pask and McIntyre reviewed the theory and experimental results in the area, in a survey from 2013.

[ 7 ] Work of Pask and Kevin Barrell from 1980 contributed to the theory of the apposition eye .

[ 8 ] During the 1970s, Pask also published on attenuation effects in optical fibres . He collaborated in this area with Adrian Ankiewicz.

[ 9 ] Works [ edit ] Pask has written some works of popularisation: Math for the Frightened: Facing Scary Symbols and Everything Else That Freaks You Out About Mathematics (2011) [ 10 ] Magnificent Principia: Exploring Isaac Newton's Masterpiece (2013) [ 11 ] Great Calculations: A Surprising Look Behind 50 Scientific Inquiries (2015) [ 12 ] References [ edit ] ^ "British National Bibliography, Pask, Colin, 1943-, The British Library" .
