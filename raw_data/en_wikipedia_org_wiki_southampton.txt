SU 42 11 ONS code 00MS (ONS) E06000045 (GSS) Police Hampshire and Isle of Wight Ambulance South Central Fire Hampshire and Isle of Wight Website southampton .gov .uk Southampton [ a ] is a port city and unitary authority in Hampshire , England. It is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) southwest of London , 20 miles (32 km) west of Portsmouth , and 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Salisbury .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Southampton had a population of 253,651 at the 2011 census, making it one of the most populous cities in southern England.

[ 2 ] Southampton forms part of the larger South Hampshire conurbation which includes the city of Portsmouth and the boroughs of Havant , Eastleigh , Fareham and Gosport . A major port, [ 8 ] and close to the New Forest , Southampton lies at the northernmost point of Southampton Water , at the confluence of the River Test and Itchen , [ 9 ] with the River Hamble joining to the south. Southampton is classified as a Medium-Port City.

[ 10 ] Southampton was the departure point for the RMS Titanic [ 11 ] and home to 500 of the people who perished on board.

[ 12 ] The Spitfire was built in the city [ 13 ] and Southampton has a strong association with the Mayflower , being the departure point before the vessel was forced to return to Plymouth . In the past century the city was one of Europe's main ports for ocean liners . More recently, Southampton is known as the home port of some of the largest cruise ships in the world.

[ 14 ] The Cunard Line maintains a regular transatlantic service to New York from the city. Southampton is also one of the largest retail destinations in the South of England.

[ 15 ] Southampton was heavily bombed during the Second World War during what was known as the Southampton Blitz . It was one of the major embarkation points for D-Day . In the Middle Ages Southampton was where troops left England for the Battle of Agincourt . It was itself raided by French pirates, leading to the construction of the fortified town walls , many of which still stand today.

Jane Austen also lived in Southampton for a number of years. In 1964, the town of Southampton acquired city status , becoming the City of Southampton.

[ 16 ] Some notable employers in the city include the University of Southampton , Ordnance Survey , BBC South , Associated British Ports , and Carnival UK .

[ 17 ] History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Southampton and Timeline of Southampton Pre-Norman [ edit ] Archaeological finds suggest that the area has been inhabited since the Stone Age .

[ 18 ] Following the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 and the conquering of the local Britons in AD 70 the fortress settlement of Clausentum was established. It was an important trading port and defensive outpost of Winchester , at the site of modern Bitterne Manor .

Clausentum was defended by a wall and two ditches and is thought to have contained a bath house.

[ 19 ] Clausentum was not abandoned until around 410.

[ 18 ] The Anglo-Saxons formed a new, larger, settlement across the Itchen centred on what is now the St Mary's area of the city. The settlement was known as Hamwic , [ 18 ] which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton .

[ 20 ] Archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe.

[ 18 ] It is from this town that the county of Hampshire gets its name.

Viking raids from 840 onwards contributed to the decline of Hamwic in the 9th century, [ 21 ] and by the 10th century a fortified settlement, which became medieval Southampton, had been established.

[ 22 ] 11th–13th centuries [ edit ] Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, Southampton became the major port of transit between the then capital of England, Winchester, and Normandy .

Southampton Castle was built in the 12th century [ 16 ] and surviving remains of 12th-century merchants' houses such as King John's House and Canute's Palace are evidence of the wealth that existed in the town at this time.

[ 23 ] By the 13th century Southampton had become a leading port, particularly involved in the import of French wine [ 22 ] in exchange for English cloth and wool .

[ 24 ] The Franciscan friary in Southampton was founded circa 1233.

[ 25 ] The friars constructed a water supply system in 1290, which carried water from Conduit Head (remnants of which survive near Hill Lane, Shirley ) some 1.1 mi (1.7 km) to the site of the friary inside the town walls.

[ 26 ] [ verification needed ] Further remains can be observed at Conduit House on Commercial Road. The friars granted use of the water to the town in 1310.

[ 26 ] 14th century [ edit ] Between 1327 and 1330, the King and Council received a petition from the people of Southampton. The community of Southampton claimed that Robert Batail of Winchelsea and other men of the Cinque Ports came to Southampton under the pretence that they were a part of Thomas of Lancaster 's rebellion against Edward II . The community thought that they were in conspiracy with Hugh le Despenser the Younger . The petition states that, the supposed rebels in the Despenser War 'came to Southampton harbour, and burnt their ships, and their goods, chattels and merchandise which was in them, and carried off other goods, chattels and merchandise of theirs found there, and took some of the ships with them, to a loss to them of £8000 and more.' [ 27 ] For their petition to the King somewhere after 1321 and before 1327 earned some of the people of Southampton a prison sentence at Portchester Castle , possibly for insinuating the king's advisor Hugh le Despenser the Younger acted in conspiracy with the Cinque Port men to damage Southampton, a flourishing port in the fourteenth century. When King Edward III came to the throne, this petition was given to the king and his mother, Queen Isabella , who was in charge of the town, and the country at this stage likely organised the writ of trespass that took any guilt away from the community at Southampton.

Part of Southampton's Town Walls The town was sacked in 1338 by French, Genoese and Monegasque ships (under Charles Grimaldi , who used the plunder to help found the principality of Monaco ).

[ 28 ] On visiting Southampton in 1339, Edward III ordered that walls be built to "close the town". The extensive rebuilding — part of the walls dates from 1175 — culminated in the completion of the western walls in 1380.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Roughly half of the walls, 13 of the original towers, and six gates survive.

[ 29 ] In 1348, the Black Death reached England via merchant vessels calling at Southampton.

[ 31 ] 15th century [ edit ] Prior to King Henry's departure for the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the ringleaders of the " Southampton Plot "— Richard, Earl of Cambridge , Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham , and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton —were accused of high treason and tried at what is now the Red Lion public house in the High Street.

[ 32 ] [ dubious – discuss ] They were found guilty and summarily executed outside the Bargate .

[ 33 ] The city walls include God's House Tower , built in 1417, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England.

[ 34 ] Over the years it has been used as home to the city's gunner, the Town Gaol and even as storage for the Southampton Harbour Board.

[ 30 ] Until September 2011, it housed the Museum of Archaeology.

[ 35 ] The walls were completed in the 15th century, [ 22 ] but later development of several new fortifications along Southampton Water and the Solent by Henry VIII meant that Southampton was no longer dependent upon its own fortifications.

[ 36 ] During the Middle Ages , shipbuilding had become an important industry for the town.

Henry V 's famous warship Grace Dieu was built in Southampton and launched in 1418.

[ 16 ] The friars passed on ownership of the water supply system itself to the town in 1420.

[ 26 ] On the other hand, many of the medieval buildings once situated within the town walls are now in ruins or have disappeared altogether. From successive incarnations of the motte and bailey castle, only a section of the bailey wall remains today, lying just off Castle Way.

[ 37 ] In 1447 Henry VI granted Southampton a charter which made it a county of itself, separate for most purposes from the county of Hampshire. The town was granted its own sheriff , which it retains to this day.

[ 38 ] 16th–18th centuries [ edit ] The friary was dissolved in 1538 but its ruins remained until they were swept away in the 1940s.

[ 25 ] The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard Mayflower in 1620.

[ 29 ] In 1642, during the English Civil War , a Parliamentary garrison moved into Southampton.

[ 39 ] The Royalists advanced as far as Redbridge in March 1644 but were prevented from taking the town.

[ 39 ] Southampton became a spa town in 1740.

[ 40 ] It had also become a popular site for sea bathing by the 1760s, despite the lack of a good quality beach.

[ 40 ] Innovative buildings specifically for this purpose were built at West Quay, with baths that were filled and emptied by the flow of the tide.

[ 40 ] Southampton engineer Walter Taylor 's 18th-century mechanisation of the block -making process was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution .

[ 41 ] The port was used for military embarkation, including during 18th-century wars with the French.

[ 42 ] 19th century [ edit ] The town experienced major expansion during the Victorian era .

[ 16 ] The Southampton Docks company had been formed in 1835.

[ 16 ] In October 1838 the foundation stone of the docks was laid [ 16 ] and the first dock opened in 1842.

[ 16 ] The structural and economic development of docks continued for the next few decades.

[ 16 ] The railway link to London was fully opened in May 1840.

[ 16 ] Southampton subsequently became known as The Gateway to the Empire .

[ 43 ] In his 1854 book The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star John Choules described Southampton thus: "I hardly know a town that can show a more beautiful Main Street than Southampton, except it be Oxford. The High Street opens from the quay, and under various names it winds in a gently sweeping line for one mile and a half, and is of very handsome width. The variety of style and color of material in the buildings affords an exhibition of outline, light and colour, that I think is seldom equalled. The shops are very elegant, and the streets are kept exceedingly clean." The port was used for military embarkation, including the Crimean War [ 44 ] and the Boer War .

[ 45 ] A new pier, with ten landing stages, was opened by the Duke of Connaught on 2 June 1892.

[ 38 ] The Grand Theatre opened in 1898. It was demolished in 1960.

[ 46 ] 20th century [ edit ] The memorial to the engineers of the RMS Titanic From 1904 to 2004, the Thornycroft shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton, [ 16 ] building and repairing ships used in the two World Wars.

[ 16 ] In 1912, the RMS Titanic sailed from Southampton. 497 men (four in five of the crew on board the vessel) were Sotonians, [ 47 ] with about a third of those who perished in the tragedy hailing from the city.

[ 29 ] Today, visitors can see the Titanic Engineers' Memorial in East Park, built in 1914, dedicated to the ship's engineers who died on board. Nearby is another Titanic memorial, commemorating the ship's musicians.

Southampton subsequently became the home port for the transatlantic passenger services operated by Cunard with their Blue Riband liner RMS Queen Mary and her running mate RMS Queen Elizabeth . In 1938, Southampton docks also became home to the flying boats of Imperial Airways .

[ 16 ] Southampton Container Terminals first opened in 1968 [ 16 ] and has continued to expand.

Home Secretary John Anderson with members of the Auxiliary Fire Service in Southampton in February 1940 Evacuee children returning to Southampton from Australia aboard the troop ship Andes in September 1945 Southampton was designated No. 1 Military Embarkation port during World War I [ 16 ] and became a major centre for treating the returning wounded and POWs .

[ 16 ] It was also central to the preparations for the Invasion of Europe during World War II in 1944.

[ 16 ] The Supermarine Spitfire was designed and developed in Southampton, evolving from the Schneider trophy -winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s. Its designer, R. J. Mitchell , lived in the Portswood area of Southampton, and his house is today marked with a blue plaque.

[ 48 ] Heavy bombing of the Woolston factory in September 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity, killing civilians and workers. World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area. Prior to the Invasion of Europe , components for a Mulberry harbour were built here.

[ 16 ] After D-Day , Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied, [ 16 ] making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944.

[ 49 ] Southampton docks was featured in the television show 24: Live Another Day in Day 9: 9:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.

[ 50 ] Some 630 people died as a result of the air raids on Southampton and nearly 2,000 more were injured, not to mention the thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed.

[ 51 ] Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. There has been extensive redevelopment since World War II.

[ 16 ] Increasing traffic congestion in the 1920s led to partial demolition of medieval walls around the Bargate in 1932 and 1938.

[ 16 ] However, a large portion of those walls remain.

A Royal Charter in 1952 upgraded University College at Highfield to the University of Southampton.

[ 16 ] In 1964 Southampton acquired city status , becoming the City of Southampton, [ 16 ] and because of the Local Government Act 1972 was turned into a non-metropolitan district within Hampshire in 1973.

Southampton City Council took over most of the functions of Hampshire County Council within the city in April 1997 (including education and social services, but not the fire service), and thus became a unitary authority .

[ 52 ] 21st century [ edit ] In the 2010s several developments to the inner-city of Southampton were completed. In 2016 the south section of West Quay, or West Quay South, originally known as West Quay Watermark, was opened to the public. Its public plaza has been used for several annual events, such as an ice skating rink during the winter season, [ 53 ] and a public broadcast of the Wimbledon tennis championship .

[ 54 ] Two new buildings, the John Hansard Gallery with City Eye and a secondary site for the University of Southampton's Nuffield Theatre , in addition to several flats, were built in the "cultural quarter" adjacent to Guildhall Square in 2017.

[ 55 ] Governance [ edit ] Southampton Civic Centre After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the passage of the Local Government Act 1888 , Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that the corporation in Southampton had the combined powers of a lower-tier (borough) and an upper-tier (county) council within the city boundaries, while the new county council was responsible for upper-tier functions outside the city of Southampton. The ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton [ 56 ] or Southamptonshire .

[ 57 ] This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959, although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire (and previously Hantescire – the origin of the abbreviation "Hants.") for centuries. In the reorganisation of English and Welsh local government that took effect on 1 April 1974 , Southampton lost its county borough when it became a non-metropolitan district (i.e. with lower-tier local government functions only) within a modified non-metropolitan county of Hampshire (Bournemouth and Christchurch were transferred to the neighbouring non-metropolitan county of Dorset ). From this date, Hampshire County Council became responsible for all upper-tier functions within its boundaries, including Southampton, until local government was once again reorganised in the late 1990s.

Southampton as a port and city has had a long history of administrative independence of the surrounding county; as far back as the reign of King John the town and its port were removed from the writ of the king's sheriff in Hampshire and the rights of custom and toll were granted by the King to the burgesses of Southampton over the port of Southampton and the Port of Portsmouth; [ 58 ] this tax farm was granted for an annual fee of £200 in the charter dated at Orival on 29 June 1199. The definition of the port of Southampton was apparently broader than today and embraced all of the area between Lymington and Langstone. The corporation had resident representatives in Newport, Lymington and Portsmouth.

[ 59 ] By a charter of Henry VI , granted on 9 March 1446/7 (25+26 Hen. VI, m. 52), the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses of the towns and ports of Southampton and Portsmouth became a County incorporate and separate from Hampshire. The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county. The formal title of the town became "The Town and County of the Town of Southampton".

[ citation needed ] These charters and royal grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the "constitution" of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period when the Local Government Act 1888 set up county councils and county borough councils across England and Wales, including Southampton County Borough Council. Under this regime, "The Town and County of the Town of Southampton" became a county borough with responsibility for all aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 Elizabeth II, by letters patent, granted the County Borough of Southampton the title of "City", so creating "The City and County of the City of Southampton".

[ 60 ] This did not, however, affect its composition or powers.

The city has undergone many changes to its governance over the centuries and once again became administratively independent from Hampshire County as it was made into a unitary authority in a local government reorganisation on 1 April 1997, a result of the Local Government Act 1992 . The district remains part of the Hampshire ceremonial county .

Southampton City Council consists of 51 councillors, 3 for each of the 17 wards.

Council elections are held in early May for one third of the seats (one councillor for each ward), elected for a four-year term, so there are elections three years out of four. The Labour Party has held overall control since 2022; after the 2023 council elections the composition of the council is: Party Members Labour 34 Conservative 9 Liberal Democrat 3 Green 2 Total 51 [ 61 ] There are three members of Parliament for the city: Darren Paffey (Labour) for Southampton Itchen , the constituency covering the east of the city; Satvir Kaur (Labour) for Southampton Test , which covers the west of the city; and Caroline Nokes (Conservative) for Romsey and Southampton North , which includes a northern portion of the city.

Lord mayor and sheriff [ edit ] The first mayor of Southampton served in 1222 meaning 2022 was the 800th anniversary of the office.

Early mayors of Southampton include: 1386–89, 1390–91, and 1396–97: William Maple [ 62 ] 1393–94, 1407–08, Walter Lange [ 63 ] The first female mayor was Lucia Foster Welch , elected in 1927.

[ 64 ] In 1959 the city elected its sixth female mayor, Rosina Marie Stonehouse, mother to John Stonehouse .

[ 65 ] The current mayor of Southampton is Councillor David Shields [ 66 ] Southampton is one of 16 cities and towns in England and Wales to have a ceremonial sheriff who acts as a deputy for the mayor. Traditionally the sheriff serves for one year after, which they will become the mayor of Southampton.

Southampton's submission of an application for Lord Mayor status, as part of Queen Elizabeth II 's Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours Competition 2022, was successful.

[ 67 ] Once the Letters Patent were published, the current Mayor (Councillor Jaqui Rayment) became the first Lord Mayor of Southampton. The Princess Royal presented the Lord Mayor with the Letters Patent in February 2023.

[ 68 ] Town crier [ edit ] The town crier from 2004 until his death in 2014 was John Melody, who acted as master of ceremonies in the city and who possessed a cry of 104 decibels .

[ 69 ] Southampton's current Town Crier is Alan Spencer [ 70 ] Twinned towns [ edit ] Southampton City Council has developed twinning links with Le Havre in France (since 1973), [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Rems-Murr-Kreis in Germany (since 1991), [ 73 ] Trieste in Italy (since 2002), Hampton, Virginia , in the US, [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Qingdao in China (since 1998), [ 73 ] Busan in South Korea (since 1978), [ 78 ] and Miami, Florida , also in the US (since 14 June 2019).

[ 79 ] Geography [ edit ] The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers. The city lies at the northern tip of the Southampton Water , a deep water estuary, which is a ria formed at the end of the last Ice Age and which opens into The Solent . At the head of Southampton Water the rivers Test and Itchen converge.

[ 80 ] The Test — which has a salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing [ 81 ] — runs along the western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two—east and west. The city centre is located between the two rivers.

Town Quay is the original public quay, and dates from the 13th century. Today's Eastern Docks were created in the 1830s by land reclamation of the mud flats between the Itchen and Test estuaries. The Western Docks date from the 1930s when the Southern Railway Company commissioned a major land reclamation and dredging programme.

[ 82 ] Most of the material used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water, [ 83 ] to ensure that the port can continue to handle large ships.

Southampton Water has the benefit of a double high tide, with two high tide peaks, [ 84 ] making the movement of large ships easier.

[ 85 ] This is not caused as popularly supposed by the presence of the Isle of Wight, but is a function of the shape and depth of the English Channel . In this area the general water flow is distorted by more local conditions reaching across to France.

[ 86 ] The city lies in the Hampshire Basin , which sits atop chalk beds.

[ 80 ] The River Test runs along the western border of the city, separating it from the New Forest . There are bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at Redbridge in the south and the M27 motorway to the north. The River Itchen runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built, [ 87 ] is at Mansbridge , where the A27 road crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at Swaythling , where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is Cobden Bridge which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a toll bridge . Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the Northam Road Bridge , which was the first major pre-stressed concrete bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom.

[ 88 ] The southernmost, and newest, bridge on the Itchen is the Itchen Bridge , which is a toll bridge.

It has a number of parks and green spaces, the largest being the 148-hectare Southampton Common , [ 89 ] parts of which are used to host the annual summer festivals, circuses and fun fairs. The Common includes Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre [ 90 ] on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a paddling pool and several lakes and ponds. The common also hosts the Parkrun event every Saturday.

[ 91 ] Council estates are in the Weston , Thornhill and Townhill Park districts. The city is ranked 96th most deprived out of all 354 Local Authorities in England.

[ 92 ] In 2006–2007, 1,267 residential dwellings were built in the city — the highest number for 15 years. Over 94 per cent of these were flats.

[ 93 ] There are 16 Electoral Wards in Southampton, each consisting of longer-established neighbourhoods (see below).

Settlements outside the city are sometimes considered suburbs of Southampton, including Chartwell Green , Chilworth , Nursling , Rownhams , Totton , Eastleigh and West End . The villages of Marchwood , Ashurst and Hedge End may be considered exurbs of Southampton.

Climate [ edit ] As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb ). Its southerly, low-lying and sheltered location ensures it is among the warmer, sunnier cities in the UK. It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) since 1976.

This energy is processed at a plant in the West Quay region in Southampton city centre, the only geothermal power station in the UK. The plant provides electricity for the Port of Southampton and hot water to the Southampton District Energy Scheme used by many buildings including the Westquay shopping centre. In a 2006 survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest carbon-emitting cities in the United Kingdom.

[ 119 ] In 2016–17, 24.8% of the city's resident population aged 16–64 were classed as economically inactive, higher than the national rate of 21.8%, although for over 40% of this group the reason was that they were students.

[ 119 ] Just over a quarter of the jobs available in the city are in the health and education sector. A further 19 per cent are property and other business and the third-largest sector is wholesale and retail, which accounts for 16.2 per cent.

[ 120 ] Between 1995 and 2004, the number of jobs in Southampton has increased by 18.5 per cent.

[ 101 ] In January 2007, the average annual salary in the city was £22,267. This was £1,700 lower than the national average and £3,800 less than the average for the South East.

[ 121 ] Inaugurated in 1843, the Port of Southampton has served as a major source of employment for generations. It became particularly prominent as a passenger port in the first half of the 20th century, especially during the inter-war years when it handed nearly half of the UK's passenger traffic. Today, it remains a key hub for luxury cruise ships and is the largest freight port on the Channel coast and the fourth-largest UK port by tonnage.

[ 122 ] Unlike other UK port cities, such as Liverpool , London , and Bristol - where dockside industry has largely relocated from city centres - Southampton has retained much of its inner-city industrial character.

[ citation needed ] While the western docklands remain active and continue to expand, including the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, some eastern dock areas have been redeveloped. An example is Ocean Village , a mixed-use marina , residential, business and leisure development. The city is also home to the headquarters of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency , the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (of the Department for Transport), and cruise operator Carnival UK .

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] During the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and car manufacturing, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemicals. These developed alongside the city's older industries of the docks, grain milling and tobacco processing.

[ 9 ] [ 125 ] Later changes saw the loss of Pirelli General cables and Joseph Rank 's Solent Flour Mills.

[ 126 ] Westquay Shopping Centre Westquay South University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust is one of the city's largest employers. It provides local hospital services to 500,000 people in the Southampton area and specialist regional services to more than 3 million people across the South of England. The Trust owns and manages Southampton General Hospital , the Princess Anne Hospital and a palliative care service at Countess Mountbatten House, part of the Moorgreen Hospital site in the village of West End , just outside the city.

Other major employers in the city include Ordnance Survey , the UK's national mapping agency, whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city, opened in February 2011.

[ 127 ] The Lloyd's Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton.

[ 128 ] Southampton's largest retail centre, and 27th-largest in the UK , is the Westquay Shopping Centre , which opened in September 2000 and hosts major high street stores including John Lewis and Marks and Spencer . The centre was Phase Two of the West Quay development of the former Pirelli undersea cables factory; the first phase of this was the West Quay Retail Park, while the third phase, Watermark Westquay, was put on hold due to the recession. Work resumed in 2015, with plans for this third stage including shops, housing, an hotel and a public piazza alongside the Town Walls on Western Esplanade.

[ 129 ] Southampton has also been granted a licence for a large casino.

[ 130 ] A further part of the redevelopment of the West Quay site resulted in a new store, opened on 12 February 2009, for Swedish home products retailer IKEA .

[ 131 ] Marlands is a smaller shopping centre, built in the 1990s on the site of the former bus station and located close to the northern side of Westquay . In October 2014, the city council approved a follow-up from the Westquay park, WestQuay Watermark. Construction by Sir Robert McAlpine commenced in January 2015.

[ 132 ] Opened in 2016–2017, it has been renamed Westquay South .

In 2007, Southampton was ranked 13th for shopping in the UK.

[ 133 ] Southampton currently has three major city centre regeneration schemes under way. Construction on the £132m Bargate Quarter scheme, which is being built on the site of the former Bargate Centre, started in February 2022 and will provide over 500 new homes, new retail and hospitality venues and a new linear park running alongside the medieval town walls which is hoped to be completed by late 2024. A £200m redevelopment scheme opposite Southampton Central Railway Station is also planned and will replace the former Toys R Us store which is situated off Western Esplanade. The 4.8-acre (1.9 ha) Maritime Gateway scheme will have a new pedestrian-led public area with 600 new homes and new commercial space. Located close to the waterfront, Leisure World is Southampton's largest redevelopment project covering 13 acres (5.3 ha) and replacing the original Leisure World development which first opened in 1997. The £280m scheme will deliver 650 new homes, two hotels, a cinema, casino and catering outlets, with the first phase expected to complete by 2024/25.

The Cultural Quarter is home to the Southampton O2 Guildhall, MAST (Mayflower Studies), the John Hansard Gallery (Studio 144) and City Eye, the much-anticipated new arts centre for Southampton. It is also home to Southampton Art Gallery which first opened its doors in 1939 and offers the opportunity to enjoy national and international quality exhibitions ranging from painting, sculpture, and drawing, to photography and film, as well as permanent collection and displays. The gallery has a unique partnership with the National Gallery in London which, in 2021, was celebrated with an exhibition entitled "Creating a National Collection: The Partnership Between Southampton City Art Gallery and the National Gallery." [ 145 ] The Cultural Quarter's Guildhall Square often plays host to events and promotions such as Southampton Pride , Chinese New Year festivities, Seaside in the Square, Oktoberfest, Music in the city, Re:claim Street festival, the Southampton Slamma Skateboarding festival and it is also a start and finish area for the ABP Southampton Marathon, as well as it being the Southampton Remembrance Parade start and finish point.

( August 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Main article: Transport in South Hampshire Road [ edit ] Southampton is a major UK port which has good transport links with the rest of the country. The M27 motorway , linking places along the south coast of England, runs just to the north of the city. The M3 motorway links the city to London and also with the Midlands and North, via a link to the A34 (part of the European route E05 ) at Winchester . The M271 motorway is a spur of the M27, linking it with the Western Docks and city centre.

[ 191 ] Rail [ edit ] Southampton Central railway station Southampton is served by the rail network , both by freight services to and from the docks and passenger services as part of the national rail system. The main station in the city is Southampton Central . Rail routes run: [ 192 ] [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] East towards Portsmouth , Chichester , Worthing and Brighton ; North to Winchester , the Midlands and London ; West to Bournemouth , Poole , Dorchester and Weymouth ; North-west towards Salisbury , Bristol and Cardiff .

The route to London was opened in 1840, by what was to become the London and South Western Railway Company. Both this and its successor, Southern Railway , played a significant role in the creation of the modern port following their purchase and development of the town's docks.

The town was the subject of an attempt by a separate company, the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway , to open another rail route to the North in the 1880s and some building work, including a surviving embankment, was undertaken in the Hill Lane area. However an agreement was made to construct a junction with the existing LSWR main line south of Winchester.

[ 196 ] Air [ edit ] Southampton Airport is a regional airport located in the town of Eastleigh , just north of the city. It offers flights to UK and near European destinations, and is connected to the city by a frequent rail service from Southampton Airport Parkway railway station [ 197 ] and by bus services.

[ 198 ] For longer flights, Heathrow and Gatwick airports are linked by regular National Express coach services.

[ 199 ] Ocean and cruise shipping [ edit ] Queen Mary 2 at the new Ocean Terminal, with Isle of Wight passenger ferry Red Jet 3 Southampton's tradition of luxury cruising began in the 1840s, one of the pioneers being P&O , who advertised tours to Egypt.

[ 200 ] The city was one of Europe's main ports for ocean passenger travel to North America and elsewhere, with British, French, and US liners regularly visiting.

Many of the world's largest cruise ships can regularly be seen in Southampton water, including record-breaking vessels from Royal Caribbean and Carnival Corporation & plc . The latter has headquarters in Southampton, with its brands including Princess Cruises , P&O Cruises , and Cunard Line .

The city has a particular historical connection to Cunard Line and their fleet of ships. This was particularly evident on 11 November 2008, when the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 departed the city for the final time amid a spectacular fireworks display, after a full day of celebrations.

[ 201 ] Cunard ships are regularly christened in the city, for example Queen Victoria was named by The Duchess of Cornwall in December 2007, and the Queen named Queen Elizabeth in the city during October 2011. The Duchess of Cambridge performed the naming ceremony of Royal Princess on 13 June 2013.

At certain times of the year, the Queen Mary 2 , Queen Elizabeth , and Queen Victoria may all visit Southampton at the same time, in an event commonly called 'Arrival of the Three Queens'. The Cunard Line maintains a regular transatlantic service to New York City for most of the year, with its ocean liner RMS Queen Mary 2 .

The importance of Southampton to the cruise industry was indicated by P&O Cruises ' 175th-anniversary celebrations, which included all seven of the company's liners visiting Southampton in a single day.

Adonia , Arcadia , Aurora , Azura , Oceana , Oriana , and Ventura all left the city in a procession on 3 July 2012.

[ 202 ] The use of the port by cruise ships and bulk cargo ships has led to concerns over air quality.

[ 203 ] In 2017 Southampton City Council estimated that the port contributed between seven and 23 per cent of air pollution in the city.

[ 204 ] Cruise ships had to run their engines whilst docked because, unlike other cruise ship ports, Southampton did not provide shore power.

[ 205 ] In 2019 an environmental pressure group ranked Southampton as the fifth highest in a list of 50 European ports whose air was polluted by sulphur oxide.

[ 206 ] The cruise industry trade association Cruise Lines International Association claimed that the report was inaccurate and used highly questionable methodology.

[ 207 ] Since September 2021, Port of Southampton has shore power installed at the Horizon Cruise Terminal at berth 102 and at the Mayflower Cruise Terminal at berth 106, both situated in the port's Western Docks.

[ 208 ] Shore power will eventually be available at all five of the port's cruise terminals.
