The awards are presented annually for books published in the previous year. The Lambda Literary Foundation states that its mission is "to celebrate LGBT literature and provide resources for writers, readers, booksellers, publishers, and librarians—the whole literary community." [ 1 ] Since their inception in 1989, awards have been given in various categories in fiction and non-fiction .

[ 2 ] The title for this category has changed several times, most recently to "LGBTQ+ Speculative Fiction".

Eligibility guidelines [ edit ] To be eligible for the award, a book must meet the following requirements: [ 3 ] The book must have been published for the first time in the United States between January 1 and December 31 of the previous calendar year.

The book must be published in English; translations are accepted.

The book must be available for purchase in a bound or collected format.

Self-published books are eligible, provided they exist in a single published file; books published exclusively on social or subscription-based sites (including blogs, personal newsletters, Wattpad , and Patreon ) are not eligible.

This category includes science fiction, fantasy, horror and related genres; submissions can be in the form of novels , novellas , or short story collections.

[ 3 ] As with other Lambda Literary Awards , the books nominated for the Lambda Literary Award for Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror are selected based on several factors, including LGBTQ+ content, quality of writing and artistic merit.
