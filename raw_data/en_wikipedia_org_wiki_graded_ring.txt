The index set is usually the set of nonnegative integers or the set of integers, but can be any monoid . The direct sum decomposition is usually referred to as gradation or grading .

A graded module is defined similarly (see below for the precise definition). It generalizes graded vector spaces . A graded module that is also a graded ring is called a graded algebra . A graded ring could also be viewed as a graded ⁠ Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } ⁠ -algebra.

The associativity is not important (in fact not used at all) in the definition of a graded ring; hence, the notion applies to non-associative algebras as well; e.g., one can consider a graded Lie algebra .

First properties [ edit ] Generally, the index set of a graded ring is assumed to be the set of nonnegative integers, unless otherwise explicitly specified. This is the case in this article.

A graded ring is a ring that is decomposed into a direct sum R = ⨁ ⨁ n = 0 ∞ ∞ R n = R 0 ⊕ ⊕ R 1 ⊕ ⊕ R 2 ⊕ ⊕ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle R=\bigoplus _{n=0}^{\infty }R_{n}=R_{0}\oplus R_{1}\oplus R_{2}\oplus \cdots } of additive groups , such that R m R n ⊆ ⊆ R m + n {\displaystyle R_{m}R_{n}\subseteq R_{m+n}} for all nonnegative integers m {\displaystyle m} and ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ .

A nonzero element of R n {\displaystyle R_{n}} is said to be homogeneous of degree ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ . By definition of a direct sum, every nonzero element a {\displaystyle a} of R {\displaystyle R} can be uniquely written as a sum a = a 0 + a 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n {\displaystyle a=a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots +a_{n}} where each a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} is either 0 or homogeneous of degree ⁠ i {\displaystyle i} ⁠ . The nonzero a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} are the homogeneous components of ⁠ a {\displaystyle a} ⁠ .

Some basic properties are: R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} is a subring of ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ ; in particular, the multiplicative identity 1 {\displaystyle 1} is a homogeneous element of degree zero.

For any n {\displaystyle n} , R n {\displaystyle R_{n}} is a two-sided ⁠ R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ⁠ - module , and the direct sum decomposition is a direct sum of ⁠ R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ⁠ -modules.

R {\displaystyle R} is an associative ⁠ R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ⁠ -algebra .

An ideal I ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle I\subseteq R} is homogeneous , if for every ⁠ a ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle a\in I} ⁠ , the homogeneous components of a {\displaystyle a} also belong to ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ . (Equivalently, if it is a graded submodule of ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ ; see § Graded module .) The intersection of a homogeneous ideal I {\displaystyle I} with R n {\displaystyle R_{n}} is an ⁠ R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ⁠ - submodule of R n {\displaystyle R_{n}} called the homogeneous part of degree n {\displaystyle n} of ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ . A homogeneous ideal is the direct sum of its homogeneous parts.

If I {\displaystyle I} is a two-sided homogeneous ideal in ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ , then R / I {\displaystyle R/I} is also a graded ring, decomposed as R / I = ⨁ ⨁ n = 0 ∞ ∞ R n / I n , {\displaystyle R/I=\bigoplus _{n=0}^{\infty }R_{n}/I_{n},} where I n {\displaystyle I_{n}} is the homogeneous part of degree n {\displaystyle n} of ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ .

Basic examples [ edit ] Any (non-graded) ring R can be given a gradation by letting ⁠ R 0 = R {\displaystyle R_{0}=R} ⁠ , and R i = 0 {\displaystyle R_{i}=0} for i ≠ 0.  This is called the trivial gradation on R .

The polynomial ring R = k [ t 1 , … … , t n ] {\displaystyle R=k[t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n}]} is graded by degree : it is a direct sum of R i {\displaystyle R_{i}} consisting of homogeneous polynomials of degree i .

Let S be the set of all nonzero homogeneous elements in a graded integral domain R . Then the localization of R with respect to S is a Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } -graded ring.

If I is an ideal in a commutative ring R , then ⨁ ⨁ n = 0 ∞ ∞ I n / I n + 1 {\textstyle \bigoplus _{n=0}^{\infty }I^{n}/I^{n+1}} is a graded ring called the associated graded ring of R along I ; geometrically, it is the coordinate ring of the normal cone along the subvariety defined by I .

Let X be a topological space , H i ( X ; R ) the i th cohomology group with coefficients in a ring R . Then H * ( X ; R ), the cohomology ring of X with coefficients in R , is a graded ring whose underlying group is ⨁ ⨁ i = 0 ∞ ∞ H i ( X ; R ) {\textstyle \bigoplus _{i=0}^{\infty }H^{i}(X;R)} with the multiplicative structure given by the cup product .

Graded module [ edit ] The corresponding idea in module theory is that of a graded module , namely a left module M over a graded ring R such that M = ⨁ ⨁ i ∈ ∈ N M i , {\displaystyle M=\bigoplus _{i\in \mathbb {N} }M_{i},} and R i M j ⊆ ⊆ M i + j {\displaystyle R_{i}M_{j}\subseteq M_{i+j}} for every i and j .

Examples: A graded vector space is an example of a graded module over a field (with the field having trivial grading).

A graded ring is a graded module over itself. An ideal in a graded ring is homogeneous if and only if it is a graded submodule. The annihilator of a graded module is a homogeneous ideal.

Given an ideal I in a commutative ring R and an R -module M , the direct sum ⨁ ⨁ n = 0 ∞ ∞ I n M / I n + 1 M {\displaystyle \bigoplus _{n=0}^{\infty }I^{n}M/I^{n+1}M} is a graded module over the associated graded ring ⨁ ⨁ 0 ∞ ∞ I n / I n + 1 {\textstyle \bigoplus _{0}^{\infty }I^{n}/I^{n+1}} .

A morphism f : N → → M {\displaystyle f:N\to M} of graded modules, called a graded morphism or graded homomorphism , is a homomorphism of the underlying modules that respects grading; i.e., ⁠ f ( N i ) ⊆ ⊆ M i {\displaystyle f(N_{i})\subseteq M_{i}} ⁠ . A graded submodule is a submodule that is a graded module in own right and such that the set-theoretic inclusion is a morphism of graded modules. Explicitly, a graded module N is a graded submodule of M if and only if it is a submodule of M and satisfies ⁠ N i = N ∩ ∩ M i {\displaystyle N_{i}=N\cap M_{i}} ⁠ . The kernel and the image of a morphism of graded modules are graded submodules.

Remark: To give a graded morphism from a graded ring to another graded ring with the image lying in the center is the same as to give the structure of a graded algebra to the latter ring.

Given a graded module M {\displaystyle M} , the ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } -twist of M {\displaystyle M} is a graded module defined by M ( ℓ ℓ ) n = M n + ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle M(\ell )_{n}=M_{n+\ell }} (cf.

Serre's twisting sheaf in algebraic geometry ).

Let M and N be graded modules. If f : : M → → N {\displaystyle f\colon M\to N} is a morphism of modules, then f is said to have degree d if f ( M n ) ⊆ ⊆ N n + d {\displaystyle f(M_{n})\subseteq N_{n+d}} . An exterior derivative of differential forms in differential geometry is an example of such a morphism having degree 1.

Invariants of graded modules [ edit ] Given a graded module M over a commutative graded ring R , one can associate the formal power series ⁠ P ( M , t ) ∈ ∈ Z [ [ t ] ] {\displaystyle P(M,t)\in \mathbb {Z} [\![t]\!]} ⁠ : P ( M , t ) = ∑ ∑ ℓ ℓ ( M n ) t n {\displaystyle P(M,t)=\sum \ell (M_{n})t^{n}} (assuming ℓ ℓ ( M n ) {\displaystyle \ell (M_{n})} are finite.) It is called the Hilbert–Poincaré series of M .

A graded module is said to be finitely generated if the underlying module is finitely generated . The generators may be taken to be homogeneous (by replacing the generators by their homogeneous parts.) Suppose R is a polynomial ring ⁠ k [ x 0 , … … , x n ] {\displaystyle k[x_{0},\dots ,x_{n}]} ⁠ , k a field, and M a finitely generated graded module over it. Then the function n ↦ ↦ dim k ⁡ ⁡ M n {\displaystyle n\mapsto \dim _{k}M_{n}} is called the Hilbert function of M . The function coincides with the integer-valued polynomial for large n called the Hilbert polynomial of M .

Graded algebra [ edit ] See also: Graded Lie algebra An associative algebra A over a ring R is a graded algebra if it is graded as a ring.

In the usual case where the ring R is not graded (in particular if R is a field), it is given the trivial grading (every element of R is of degree 0). Thus, R ⊆ ⊆ A 0 {\displaystyle R\subseteq A_{0}} and the graded pieces A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} are R -modules.

In the case where the ring R is also a graded ring, then one requires that R i A j ⊆ ⊆ A i + j {\displaystyle R_{i}A_{j}\subseteq A_{i+j}} In other words, we require A to be a graded left module over R .

Examples of graded algebras are common in mathematics: Polynomial rings . The homogeneous elements of degree n are exactly the homogeneous polynomials of degree n .

The tensor algebra T ∙ ∙ V {\displaystyle T^{\bullet }V} of a vector space V . The homogeneous elements of degree n are the tensors of order n , ⁠ T n V {\displaystyle T^{n}V} ⁠ .

The exterior algebra ⋀ ⋀ ∙ ∙ V {\displaystyle \textstyle \bigwedge \nolimits ^{\bullet }V} and the symmetric algebra S ∙ ∙ V {\displaystyle S^{\bullet }V} are also graded algebras.

The cohomology ring H ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle H^{\bullet }} in any cohomology theory is also graded, being the direct sum of the cohomology groups ⁠ H n {\displaystyle H^{n}} ⁠ .

Graded algebras are much used in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry , homological algebra , and algebraic topology . One example is the close relationship between homogeneous polynomials and projective varieties (cf.

Homogeneous coordinate ring .) It is also possible to consider non-commutative graded algebras. One example is the Leavitt path algebra which has a natural Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } -grading.

G -graded rings and algebras [ edit ] The above definitions have been generalized to rings graded using any monoid G as an index set.  A G -graded ring R is a ring with a direct sum decomposition R = ⨁ ⨁ i ∈ ∈ G R i {\displaystyle R=\bigoplus _{i\in G}R_{i}} such that R i R j ⊆ ⊆ R i ⋅ ⋅ j .

{\displaystyle R_{i}R_{j}\subseteq R_{i\cdot j}.} Elements of R that lie inside R i {\displaystyle R_{i}} for some i ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle i\in G} are said to be homogeneous of grade i .

The previously defined notion of "graded ring" now becomes the same thing as an N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } -graded ring, where N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } is the monoid of natural numbers under addition. The definitions for graded modules and algebras can also be extended this way replacing the indexing set N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } with any monoid G .

Remarks: If we do not require that the ring have an identity element , semigroups may replace monoids.

Examples: A group naturally grades the corresponding group ring ; similarly, monoid rings are graded by the corresponding monoid.

An (associative) superalgebra is another term for a Z 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}} -graded algebra. Examples include Clifford algebras . Here the homogeneous elements are either of degree 0 (even) or 1 (odd).

Anticommutativity [ edit ] Some graded rings (or algebras) are endowed with an anticommutative structure.  This notion requires a homomorphism of the monoid of the gradation into the additive monoid of Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } , the field with two elements.  Specifically, a signed monoid consists of a pair ( Γ Γ , ε ε ) {\displaystyle (\Gamma ,\varepsilon )} where Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is a monoid and ε ε : : Γ Γ → → Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \varepsilon \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } is a homomorphism of additive monoids.  An anticommutative Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } -graded ring is a ring A graded with respect to Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } such that: x y = ( − − 1 ) ε ε ( deg ⁡ ⁡ x ) ε ε ( deg ⁡ ⁡ y ) y x , {\displaystyle xy=(-1)^{\varepsilon (\deg x)\varepsilon (\deg y)}yx,} for all homogeneous elements x and y .

Examples [ edit ] An exterior algebra is an example of an anticommutative algebra, graded with respect to the structure ( Z , ε ε ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} ,\varepsilon )} where ε ε : : Z → → Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \varepsilon \colon \mathbb {Z} \to \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } is the quotient map.

A supercommutative algebra (sometimes called a skew-commutative associative ring ) is the same thing as an anticommutative ( Z , ε ε ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} ,\varepsilon )} -graded algebra, where ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } is the identity map of the additive structure of ⁠ Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ .

Graded monoid [ edit ] Intuitively, a graded monoid is the subset of a graded ring, ⨁ ⨁ n ∈ ∈ N 0 R n {\textstyle \bigoplus _{n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}}R_{n}} , generated by the R n {\displaystyle R_{n}} 's, without using the additive part. That is, the set of elements of the graded monoid is ⋃ ⋃ n ∈ ∈ N 0 R n {\displaystyle \bigcup _{n\in \mathbb {N} _{0}}R_{n}} .

Formally, a graded monoid [ 1 ] is a monoid ( M , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (M,\cdot )} , with a gradation function ϕ ϕ : M → → N 0 {\displaystyle \phi :M\to \mathbb {N} _{0}} such that ϕ ϕ ( m ⋅ ⋅ m ′ ) = ϕ ϕ ( m ) + ϕ ϕ ( m ′ ) {\displaystyle \phi (m\cdot m')=\phi (m)+\phi (m')} . Note that the gradation of 1 M {\displaystyle 1_{M}} is necessarily 0. Some authors request furthermore that ϕ ϕ ( m ) ≠ ≠ 0 {\displaystyle \phi (m)\neq 0} when m is not the identity.

Assuming the gradations of non-identity elements are non-zero, the number of elements of gradation n is at most g n {\displaystyle g^{n}} where g is the cardinality of a generating set G of the monoid. Therefore the number of elements of gradation n or less is at most n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} (for g = 1 {\displaystyle g=1} ) or g n + 1 − − 1 g − − 1 {\textstyle {\frac {g^{n+1}-1}{g-1}}} else. Indeed, each such element is the product of at most n elements of G , and only g n + 1 − − 1 g − − 1 {\textstyle {\frac {g^{n+1}-1}{g-1}}} such products exist.  Similarly, the identity element can not be written as the product of two non-identity elements. That is, there is no unit divisor in such a graded monoid.

Power series indexed by a graded monoid [ edit ] See also: Novikov ring These notions allow us to extend the notion of power series ring . Instead of the indexing family being N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , the indexing family could be any graded monoid, assuming that the number of elements of degree n is finite, for each integer n .

More formally, let ( K , + K , × × K ) {\displaystyle (K,+_{K},\times _{K})} be an arbitrary semiring and ( R , ⋅ ⋅ , ϕ ϕ ) {\displaystyle (R,\cdot ,\phi )} a graded monoid. Then K ⟨ ⟨ ⟨ ⟨ R ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle K\langle \langle R\rangle \rangle } denotes the semiring of power series with coefficients in K indexed by R . Its elements are functions from R to K . The sum of two elements s , s ′ ∈ ∈ K ⟨ ⟨ ⟨ ⟨ R ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle s,s'\in K\langle \langle R\rangle \rangle } is defined pointwise, it is the function sending m ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle m\in R} to s ( m ) + K s ′ ( m ) {\displaystyle s(m)+_{K}s'(m)} , and the product is the function sending m ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle m\in R} to the infinite sum ∑ ∑ p , q ∈ ∈ R p ⋅ ⋅ q = m s ( p ) × × K s ′ ( q ) {\displaystyle \sum _{p,q\in R \atop p\cdot q=m}s(p)\times _{K}s'(q)} . This sum is correctly defined (i.e., finite) because, for each m , there are only a finite number of pairs ( p , q ) such that pq = m .

Free monoid [ edit ] In formal language theory , given an alphabet A , the free monoid of words over A can be considered as a graded monoid, where the gradation of a word is its length.
