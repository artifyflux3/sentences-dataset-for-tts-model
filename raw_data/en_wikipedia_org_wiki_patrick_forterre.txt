He is Head of the Department of Microbiology at the Pasteur Institute and is known for his work on Archaea , viruses and the evolution of life .  Forterre was the first to use the abbreviation of " Last Universal Common Ancestor ", or "LUCA", in a 1999 paper.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] In 1988, he became head of a research team at the Institute of Genetics and Microbiology (IGM) in Orsay and directed research on Archaea, the new living area discovered in 1977 by Carl Woese .  In 2004, he joined the Pasteur Institute as Director of Microbiology .

Patrick Forterre is particularly known for his theories on evolution and his stances on the recognition of viruses as living beings in their own right.

He works as a scientist in the documentary film Species of Species , produced in 2008.
