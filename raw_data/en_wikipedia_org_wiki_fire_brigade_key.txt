[ 1 ] Uses include securing areas such as common storage cupboards and equipment rooms and access control devices such as road barriers and movable bollards.

Fire brigade keys are not secret or restricted, and are widely available for sale from locksmiths and hardware stores. Because of their widespread availability, they are only suitable for low-security applications.
