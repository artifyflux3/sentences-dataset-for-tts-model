It is based on William Gibson 's 1984 short story of the same name .

Plot [ edit ] Fox and X are Tokyo-based freelance industrial spies who specialize in helping R&D scientists defect from corporations who would rather see them dead than working for competitors. Fox is obsessed with Dr. Hiroshi, a paradigm-shattering super-genius who works for Maas, the German corporation that crippled Fox. Japanese firm Hosaka hires Fox and X to help Hiroshi defect, offering a fee of $50 million. Fox and X hire Sandii, a nightclub singer and call girl in Shinjuku , to help persuade Hiroshi to defect to a newly outfitted Hosaka lab in Marrakech .

While training her for the extraction, X falls in love with Sandii, who offers conflicting accounts of her past. Fox and X meet with Hosaka representatives and negotiate their fee up to $100 million. Sandii meets Hiroshi in Vienna and persuades him to leave his wife and defect to Hosaka. Fox travels to Marrakech to await Hiroshi's arrival, and X arranges to spend a night with Sandii in Berlin before her rendezvous in Marrakech.

Sandii proposes that she and X leave Fox and marry. X offers to discuss it after Sandii visits Marrakech. That night, while Sandii sleeps, X rummages through her personal effects, finding cash, information about her aliases, and an unmarked computer chip.

Hosaka transfers the agreed-upon $100 million fee. Fox returns from Marrakech, and X informs him that he will be meeting Sandii in Shinjuku to start a new life with her, a plan that Fox begrudgingly accepts. Later, Fox and X celebrate the success of the operation and their newfound wealth with a group of prostitutes. The next day, X's contact in Marrakech informs him that Hosaka has relocated many of their top scientists to the new lab in Marrakech, a move that Fox decries as unsafe but potentially lucrative for him and X, despite X's insistence that he is finished with the case.

During the night, X's Marrakech contact informs him that somebody secretly reprogrammed the lab's DNA synthesizer to spread a virus that killed everyone, including Hiroshi, and that Sandii has vanished. X also discovers that the bank account holding the $100 million has been wiped out. Fox deduces that Maas recruited Sandii in Vienna and ordered her to kill Hosaka's scientists in Marrakech, and that Hosaka, presuming that Fox and X were complicit, has wiped their account and will send agents to kill them. After being surrounded by Hosaka agents in a department store, Fox leaps to his death. X flees to a run-down capsule hotel called the New Rose Hotel. There, he reflects on his time with Fox and Sandii and views security footage of Sandii using the unmarked computer chip in the DNA synthesizer in Marrakech. Knowing that Hosaka agents will hunt him wherever he goes, X contemplates suicide before masturbating to the memory of his last night with Sandii.
