According to the [Smithsonian Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution "Smithsonian Institution"), the first musical instruments played in outer space were an 8-note [Hohner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohner "Hohner") "Little Lady" [harmonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica "Harmonica") and a handful of small bells carried by American astronauts [Wally Schirra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra "Wally Schirra") and [Thomas P.

The instruments had been [smuggled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_objects_smuggled_into_space "List of objects smuggled into space") on-board without NASA's knowledge, leading [Mission Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control "Mission Control") director [Elliot See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_See "Elliot See") to exclaim "You're too much" to Schirra after the song.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Smithsonian_Mag_2005-3) The harmonica was donated to the Smithsonian by Schirra in 1967, with his note that it "...plays quite well".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Harmonica,_Gemini_6-4)

In the 1970s music tape cassettes were brought to the American space station [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-5) while Soviet cosmonauts [Aleksandr Laveikin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Laveikin "Aleksandr Laveikin") and [Yuri Romanenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Romanenko "Yuri Romanenko") brought a guitar to the space station _[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir")_ in 1987.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-sciencemuseum-1) Musical instruments must be checked for gases they may emit before being taken aboard the confined environment of a space station.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-space_station_music_nasasci-6) As of 2003, instruments that have been aboard the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") include a flute, a keyboard, a guitar, a saxophone, and a [didgeridoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo "Didgeridoo").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-space_station_music_nasasci-6)

Music in space has been a focal point of public relation events of various [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") programs.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-sciencemuseum-1)[NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") astronaut [Carl Walz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Walz "Carl Walz") played a rendition of the [Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley "Elvis Presley") song "[Heartbreak Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreak_Hotel "Heartbreak Hotel")" aboard the ISS in 2003 which was also recorded and transmitted to Earth.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-space_station_music_nasasci-6)[Canadian Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency "Canadian Space Agency") astronaut [Chris Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield "Chris Hadfield"), commander of [Expedition 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_35 "Expedition 35") to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), recorded a [music video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video "Music video") of the song "[Space Oddity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Oddity "Space Oddity")" by [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie") aboard the space station. The first music video ever shot in space,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-7) the video went [viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video "Viral video") and received widespread international media coverage after being posted to [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-8) Bowie himself later called the cover "possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-9) Hadfield also recorded his own album titled Space Sessions: Songs from a Tin Can.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-10)

_**Dongfanghong I**_ ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 东方红一号; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 東方紅一號; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _Dōngfānghóng Yīhào_; lit.

The satellite carried a [radio transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_transmitter "Radio transmitter") which broadcast the song of the same name, _Dōngfānghóng_ or "[The East Is Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_East_Is_Red_(song) "The East Is Red (song)")"; the broadcast lasted for 20 days while in orbit.

A few bars of "[The Fountain in the Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountain_in_the_Park "The Fountain in the Park")" were sung on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") Astronauts [Harrison Schmitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt "Harrison Schmitt") and [Eugene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Cernan "Eugene Cernan") on the 1972 [Apollo 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17 "Apollo 17") mission, the final Apollo moon mission. Schmitt started by singing "I was strolling on the Moon one day..." after which Cernan joined in. Cernan kept with the original "merry month of May", however, while Schmitt sang "December", which was the actual date at the time. Cernan interjected, "No, May!", and Schmitt corrected himself. Schmitt resumed, singing "When much to my surprise, a pair of bonny eyes..." until he could no longer remember the lyrics and began vocalizing the notes instead.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-11) Moments later, [Capsule Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_communicator#Capsule_Communicator "Capsule communicator")[Robert A.

Soyuz TM-3 and Didier Marouani
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_in_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Soyuz TM-3 and Didier Marouani")]

On 22 July 1987, [Soyuz TM-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-3 "Soyuz TM-3") was the third crewed spaceflight to visit the Soviet space station [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir"). The cosmonauts took a CD-player with them, together with two small speakers and the _Space Opera_ album by French composer [Didier Marouani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Marouani "Didier Marouani"). According to Marouani, the CD, the player and speakers were launched into outer space in October 1987. Cosmonaut [Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Pavlovich_Aleksandrov "Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov") confirmed that he listened to the album during his mission on Mir.

On 21 November 1988, a [cassette tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape "Cassette tape") of [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd "Pink Floyd")'s live _[Delicate Sound of Thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicate\_Sound\_of\_Thunder "Delicate Sound of Thunder")_ album (minus the cassette box, for weight reasons) was taken into space by the crew of the Soviet [Soyuz TM-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-7 "Soyuz TM-7") mission.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Mabbett-3-18) The launch, at [Baikonur Cosmodrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome "Baikonur Cosmodrome"), was attended by the band's [David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour "David Gilmour") and [Nick Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason "Nick Mason"), who made an audio recording of the event for potential use in a future project.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Mabbett-3-18) This was claimed by Gilmour to have been the first [rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") recording in space.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Mabbett-3-18) In actuality, various cassettes carried by [Al Worden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Worden "Al Worden") on [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15") nearly two decades earlier contained recordings from multiple various rock artists.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-19) The tape was left on the [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") space station when the mission crew returned to Earth.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-Mabbett-3-18)

In 2003 the British space organization's _[Beagle 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle\_2 "Beagle 2")_ probe was scheduled to play a song from the British rock band [Blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_(band) "Blur (band)"), upon touchdown on the planet [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-theverge-20) It was not known what happened to _Beagle 2_ for 11 years after landing, and it was considered lost. When it was found intact in 2015, however, the possibility was raised that _Beagle 2_ had successfully played the song on Christmas Day in 2003 upon landing, but failed to transmit back to Earth.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_space#cite_note-21) The song, also called "Beagle 2", was composed for the project and had been issued as the [B-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side "A-side and B-side") of the band's 1999 "[No Distance Left to Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Distance_Left_to_Run "No Distance Left to Run")" single prior to the launch.
