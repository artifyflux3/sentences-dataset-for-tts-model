Established in 1930 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts , it is the largest independent oceanographic research institution in the U.S., with staff and students numbering about 1,000.

Constitution [ edit ] The institution is organized into six departments, [ 1 ] the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Ocean Research, and a marine policy center. Its shore-based facilities are located in the village of Woods Hole , Massachusetts , United States and a mile and a half away on the Quissett Campus. The bulk of the institution's funding comes from grants and contracts from the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, augmented by foundations and private donations.

WHOI scientists, engineers, and students collaborate to develop theories, test ideas, build seagoing instruments, and collect data in diverse marine environments. Ships operated by WHOI carry research scientists throughout the world's oceans. The WHOI fleet includes two large research vessels ( Atlantis and Neil Armstrong ), the coastal craft Tioga , small research craft such as the dive-operation work boat Echo, the deep-diving human-occupied submersible Alvin , the tethered, remotely operated vehicle Jason/Medea , and autonomous underwater vehicles such as the REMUS and SeaBED .

[ 2 ] WHOI offers graduate and post-doctoral studies in marine science. There are several fellowship and training programs, and graduate degrees are awarded through a joint program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] WHOI is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges .

[ 5 ] WHOI also offers public outreach programs and informal education through its Exhibit Center and summer tours. The institution has a volunteer program and a membership program, WHOI Associate.

[ citation needed ] WHOI shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with the Marine Biological Laboratory . The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences. The library also conducts digitization, data preservation and informatics projects.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] On October 1, 2020, Peter B. de Menocal became the institution's eleventh president and director.

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] R/V Atlantis , the first research vessel operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, pictured here in 1955 near the Virgin Islands [ 9 ] In 1927, a National Academy of Sciences committee concluded that it was time to "consider the share of the United States of America in a worldwide program of oceanographic research." The committee's recommendation for establishing a permanent independent research laboratory on the East Coast to "prosecute oceanography in all its branches" led to the founding in 1930 of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

[ 10 ] A $2.5 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation supported the summer work of a dozen scientists, construction of a laboratory building and commissioning of a research vessel, the 142-foot (43 m) ketch Atlantis , whose profile still forms the institution's logo.

[ 10 ] WHOI grew substantially to support significant defense-related research during World War II, and later began a steady growth in staff, research fleet, and scientific stature. From 1950 to 1956, the director was Dr.

Edward "Iceberg" Smith , an Arctic explorer, oceanographer and retired Coast Guard rear admiral .

[ 11 ] In 1977 the institution appointed oceanographer John Steele as director, and he served until his retirement in 1989.

[ 12 ] On 1 September 1985, a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution identified the location of the wreck of RMS Titanic , which sank off the coast of Newfoundland 15 April 1912.

On 3 April 2011, within a week of resuming of the search operation for Air France Flight 447 , a team led by WHOI, operating full ocean depth autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) owned by the Waitt Institute discovered, by means of sidescan sonar , a large portion of debris field from flight AF447.

[ 13 ] Marine Biological Laboratory Library bookplate, 1914 In March 2017 the institution effected an open-access policy to make its research publicly accessible online.

[ 14 ] In 2019, iDefense reported that China's hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy .

[ 15 ] Some of the targets included the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

[ 15 ] The attacks had been underway since at least April 2017.

[ 15 ] In August 2024, institution researchers are scheduled, pending approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , to conduct a $10 million ocean alkalinity enhancement experiment partially funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that will release 6,000 gallons of a liquid solution of sodium hydroxide into the ocean 10 miles south of Martha's Vineyard in an attempt to remove 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .

[ 16 ] Military contracting [ edit ] The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution develops technology for the United States Navy, including ocean battlespace sensors, [ 17 ] unmanned undersea vehicles, [ 18 ] and acoustic navigation and communication systems for operations in the Arctic.

[ 19 ] The institution is also working on Project Sundance for the Office of Naval Research.

[ 20 ] Awards issued [ edit ] B. H. Ketchum Award [ edit ] The B. H. Ketchum award, established in 1983, is presented for innovative coastal/nearshore research and is named in honor of oceanographer Bostwick H. "Buck" Ketchum. The award is administered by the WHOI Coastal Ocean Institute and Rinehart Coastal Research Center.
