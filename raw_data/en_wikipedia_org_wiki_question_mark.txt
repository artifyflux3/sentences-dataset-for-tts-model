The **question mark****?** (also known as **interrogation point**, **query**, or **eroteme** in [journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism "Journalism")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003139-1)) is a [punctuation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") that indicates a [question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question "Question") or [interrogative clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_clause "Interrogative clause") or phrase in many [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language").

The history of the question mark is contested. One popular theory posits that the shape of the symbol is inspired by the crook in a cat's tail, often attributed to the ancient Egyptians.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-burb-2) However, [Egyptian hieroglyphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphics "Egyptian hieroglyphics") did not utilize punctuation marks.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-3)

In the fifth century, [Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Syriac "Classical Syriac") Bible manuscripts used question markers, according to a 2011 theory by manuscript specialist Chip Coakley: he believes the _zagwa elaya_ ("upper pair"), a vertical double dot over a word at the start of a sentence, indicates that the sentence is a question.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-5)

8th century _punctus interrogativus_ from the [Godescalc Evangelistary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godescalc_Evangelistary "Godescalc Evangelistary"). ([BnF NAL 1203, f. 6v](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6000718s/f12).)

From around 783, in [Godescalc Evangelistary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godescalc_Evangelistary "Godescalc Evangelistary"), a mark described as "a lightning flash, striking from right to left" is attested.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-grammarphobia-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003159-7) This mark is later called a _[punctus interrogativus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/punctus\_interrogativus#English "wikt:punctus interrogativus")_. According to some [paleographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeography "Palaeography"), it may have indicated [intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics) "Intonation (linguistics)"), perhaps associated with early musical notation like [neumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neume "Neume").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-grammarphobia-6) Another theory, is that the "lightning flash" was originally a [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") or [titlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titlo "Titlo"), as in ·~, one of many wavy or more or less slanted marks used in [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") texts for denoting things such as [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviations "Abbreviations"), which would later become various [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritics "Diacritics") or [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-9) The creation of the _punctus interrogativus_ has also been attributed to [Alcuin of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York "Alcuin of York"), an advisor to [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-burb-2)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Punctus_interrogativus_from_Bern%2C_B%C3%BCrgerbibliothek_Cod._162%2C_f._15r.jpg/250px-Punctus_interrogativus_from_Bern%2C_B%C3%BCrgerbibliothek_Cod._162%2C_f._15r.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Punctus_interrogativus_from_Bern,_B%C3%BCrgerbibliothek_Cod._162,_f._15r.jpg)

An 11th century _punctus interrogativus_; in the third line, before "tamen". ([Burgerbibliothek Bern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgerbibliothek_of_Berne "Burgerbibliothek of Berne"), [Cod. 162, f. 15r](https://www.e-codices.ch/en/bbb/0162/15r).)

From the 10th century, the pitch-defining element (if it ever existed) seems to have been gradually forgotten, so that the "lightning flash" sign (with the stroke sometimes slightly curved) is often seen indifferently at the end of clauses, whether they embody a question or not.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the early 13th century, when the growth of communities of scholars ([universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University")) in Paris and other major cities led to an expansion and streamlining of the book-production trade,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-10) punctuation was rationalized by assigning the "lightning flash" specifically to [interrogatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative "Interrogative"); by this time, the stroke was more sharply curved and can easily be recognized as the modern question mark (see, for example, _[De Aetna](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De\_Aetna&action=edit&redlink=1 "De Aetna (page does not exist)")[[it](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Aetna "it:De Aetna")]_ (1496) printed by [Aldo Manuzio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius "Aldus Manutius") in [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-11)).

In 1598, the English term _point of interrogation_ is attested in an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language")–English dictionary by [John Florio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Florio "John Florio").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-12)

In the 1850s, the term _question mark_ is attested:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-13)

> The mark which you are to notice in this lesson is of this shape **?** You see it is made by placing a little crooked mark over a period.... The name of this mark is the _Question Mark_, because it is always put after a question. Sometimes it is called by a longer and harder name. The long and hard name is the _Interrogation Point_.

In English, the question mark typically occurs at the end of a sentence, where it replaces the [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") (period). However, the question mark may also occur at the end of a clause or phrase, where it replaces the comma (see also [Question comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_comma "Question comma")):

"Is it good in form? style? meaning?"
or:

"Showing off for him, for all of them, not out of hubris—hubris? him? what did he have to be hubrid about?—but from mood and nervousness."— [Stanley Elkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Elkin "Stanley Elkin").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-14)
This is quite common in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_(language) "Spanish (language)"), where the use of bracketing question marks explicitly indicates the scope of interrogation.

_En el caso de que no puedas ir con ellos, ¿quieres ir con nosotros?_ ('In case you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?')
A question mark may also appear immediately after questionable data, such as dates:

### Opening and closing question marks in Spanish

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Opening and closing question marks in Spanish")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Question_opening-closing.svg/150px-Question_opening-closing.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Question_opening-closing.svg)

Opening and closing question marks

In Spanish, since the second edition of the _Ortografía_ of the [Real Academia Española](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Academia_Espa%C3%B1ola "Real Academia Española") in 1754, interrogatives require both opening ¿ and closing ? question marks.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003142%E2%80%93143-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-16) An interrogative sentence, clause, or phrase begins with an [inverted question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_question_mark_and_exclamation_point "Inverted question mark and exclamation point")¿ and ends with the question mark ?, as in:

_Ella me pregunta «¿qué hora es?»_ – 'She asks me, "What time is it?"'
Question marks must always be matched, but to mark uncertainty rather than actual interrogation omitting the opening one is allowed, although discouraged:[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-17)

_Gengis Khan (¿1162?–1227)_ is preferred in Spanish over _Gengis Khan (1162?–1227)_
The omission of the opening mark is common in informal writing, but is considered an error. The one exception is when the question mark is matched with an exclamation mark, as in:

_¡Quién te has creído que eres?_ – 'Who do you think you are?!'
(The order may also be reversed, opening with a question mark and closing with an exclamation mark.) Nonetheless, even here the Academia recommends matching punctuation:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-18)

_¡¿Quién te has creído que eres?!_
The opening question mark in Unicode is U+00BF¿INVERTED QUESTION MARK (&iquest;).

### Solomon Islands Pidgin

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Solomon Islands Pidgin")]

In [Solomon Islands Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands_Pidgin "Solomon Islands Pidgin"), the question can be between question marks since, in yes/no questions, the intonation can be the only difference.

_?Solomon Aelan hemi barava gudfala kandre, ia man?_ ('[Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands "Solomon Islands") is a great country, isn't it?')[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-Lee-19)

Armenian question mark

In [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet "Armenian alphabet"), the question mark is a [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") that takes the form of an open circle and is placed over the stressed vowel of the question word. It is defined in Unicode at U+055E◌՞ARMENIAN QUESTION MARK.

### Greek question mark

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Greek question mark")]

The [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") question mark (Greek: ερωτηματικό, romanized:_erōtīmatikó_) looks like ;. It appeared around the same time as the Latin one, in the 8th century.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-20) It was adopted by [Church Slavonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Slavonic "Church Slavonic") and eventually settled on a form essentially similar to the Latin [semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon"). In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"), it is separately encoded as U+037E;GREEK QUESTION MARK, but the similarity is so great that the [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") is [normalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_normalisation "Unicode normalisation") to U+003B;SEMICOLON, making the marks identical in practice.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-21)

### Mirrored question mark in right-to-left scripts

Mirrored question mark in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet") and [Perso-Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_alphabet "Persian alphabet")

In [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") and other languages that use Arabic script such as [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"), [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu "Urdu") and [Uyghur (Arabic form)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language "Uyghur language"), which are written from [right to left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_script "Right-to-left script"), the question mark is mirrored right-to-left from the Latin question mark. In Unicode, two encodings are available: U+061F؟ARABIC QUESTION MARK (with [bi-directional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-directional_text "Bi-directional text") code AL: Right-to-Left Arabic) and U+2E2E⸮REVERSED QUESTION MARK (with bi-directional code Other Neutrals). Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to font or text directionality issues.

The Arabic question mark is also used in some other right-to-left scripts: [Dhivehi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldivian_language "Maldivian language"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-22)[N'Ko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Ko_script "N'Ko script"),[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-23)[Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_alphabet "Syriac alphabet"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-24) and [Adlam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlam_script "Adlam script").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-r12a-25) Adlam also has U+1E95F𞥟ADLAM INITIAL QUESTION MARK: 𞥟 𞤢𞤤𞤢𞥄 ؟, 'No?'.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-r12a-25)

[Hebrew script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet") is also written right-to-left, but it uses a question mark that appears on the page in the same orientation as the left-to-right question mark (e.g. את מדברת עברית?).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003143-26)

### Fullwidth question mark in East Asian languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Fullwidth question mark in East Asian languages")]

The question mark is also used in modern writing in [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") and, to a lesser extent, [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"). Usually, it is written as [fullwidth form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullwidth_form "Fullwidth form") in Chinese and Japanese, in Unicode: [U+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode")FF1F？FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK. Fullwidth form is always preferred in official usage.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-29) In [Korean language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"), however, halfwidth is used.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-30)

Japanese has an interrogative particle, [か](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%8B "wiktionary:か") (ka), which functions grammatically like a question mark. Therefore, the question mark is not historically used Japanese, and still not officially sanctioned for use in government publications or school textbooks, but its popularity has been gradually increasing among younger people. Where official usage is 終わったのかもしれませんよ。, some people would now informally write 終わったのかもしれませんよ？ to express "It may be over"; the question mark here adds a nuance of uncertainty to the sentence rather than turning it into a question.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-31)

Chinese also has a spoken indicator of questions, which is [吗](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%90%97 "wiktionary:吗") (ma). However, the question mark should always be used after 吗 when asking questions.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-32)

Some other scripts have a specific question mark:

*   U+1367፧[ETHIOPIC QUESTION MARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_writing_system "Ge'ez writing system")
*   U+A60F꘏[VAI QUESTION MARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vai_script "Vai script")
*   U+2CFA⳺[COPTIC OLD NUBIAN DIRECT QUESTION MARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Nubian_language "Old Nubian language"), and U+2CFB⳻COPTIC OLD NUBIAN INDIRECT QUESTION MARK
*   U+1945᥅LIMBU QUESTION MARK

[French orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_orthography "French orthography") specifies a [narrow non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_non-breaking_space "Narrow non-breaking space") before the question mark.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-33) (e.g., "_Que voulez-vous boire ?_"); in [English orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography "English orthography"), no space appears in front of the question mark (e.g. "What would you like to drink?").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-34)

Typological variants of _?_
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Typological variants of ?")]

The rhetorical question mark or percontation point (see [Irony punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_punctuation "Irony punctuation")) was invented by [Henry Denham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Denham "Henry Denham") in the 1580s and was used at the end of a [rhetorical question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question "Rhetorical question");[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003142-35) however, it became obsolete in the 17th century. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss2003142-35) This character can be represented using U+2E2E⸮[REVERSED QUESTION MARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_punctuation#Irony_mark "Irony punctuation").

Bracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example Oh, really(?), in informal contexts such as [closed captioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning "Closed captioning").

The question mark can also be used as a [meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_(prefix) "Meta (prefix)")-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: (?). The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-conditional_semantics "Truth-conditional semantics") (real [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(philosophy_of_language) "Meaning (philosophy of language)")).

In typography, some other variants and combinations are available: "⁇," "⁈," and "⁉," are usually used for [chess annotation symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_annotation_symbols "Chess annotation symbols"); the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang "Interrobang"), "‽," is used to combine the functions of the question mark[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-A_course_of_reading_for_common_schools_and_the_lower_classes_of_academies-36) and the [exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark"), superposing these two marks.

Unicode makes available these variants:

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), the question mark [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") is represented by [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point U+003F?QUESTION MARK (&quest;). The full-width (double-byte) equivalent (**？**), is located at code-point U+FF1F？FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-37)

The [inverted question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_question_mark_and_exclamation_point "Inverted question mark and exclamation point") (**¿**) corresponds to Unicode code-point U+00BF¿INVERTED QUESTION MARK (&iquest;), and can be accessed from the keyboard in [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") on the default US layout by holding down the [Alt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_key "Alt key") and typing either 1 6 8 (ANSI) or 0 1 9 1 (Unicode) on the numeric keypad. In [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") applications on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") operating systems, it can be entered by typing the hexadecimal Unicode character (minus leading zeros) while holding down both [Ctrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctrl_key "Ctrl key") and [Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key "Shift key"), i.e.: Ctrl Shift B F. In recent [XFree86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86 "XFree86") and [X.Org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server "X.Org Server") incarnations of the [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System "X Window System"), it can be accessed as a compose sequence of two straight question marks, i.e. pressing [Compose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key "Compose key")?? yields ¿. In [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS "Classic Mac OS") and [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X "Mac OS X") (macOS), the key combination [Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key "Option key") Shift? produces an inverted question mark.

In shell and scripting languages, the question mark is often utilized as a [wildcard character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character "Wildcard character"): a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)"). In particular, [filename globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming) "Glob (programming)") uses "?" as a substitute for any one character, as opposed to the [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk"), "*", which matches zero or more characters in a string.

The question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet"), such as [SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA "SAMPA"), in place of the [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop") symbol, **ʔ**, (which resembles "**?**" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point U+0294 ʔ LATIN LETTER GLOTTAL STOP.

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), the symbol "**?**" has a special meaning in many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"). In [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)")-descended languages, `?` is part of the [`?:`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F: "?:") operator, which is used to evaluate simple [boolean conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_domain "Boolean domain"). In [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)") 2.0, the `?` modifier is used to handle [nullable data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type "Nullable type") and `??` is the [null coalescing operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator "Null coalescing operator"). In the [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX "POSIX") syntax for [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), such as that used in [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), `?` stands for "zero or one instance of the previous subexpression", i.e. an optional element. It can also make a quantifier like `{x,y}`, `+` or `*` match as few characters as possible, making it lazy, e.g. `/^.*?px/` will match the substring `165px` in `165px 17px` instead of matching `165px 17px`.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-pcre-qm-Uflag-38) In certain implementations of the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC "BASIC") programming language, the `?` character may be used as a shorthand for the "print" function; in others (notably the [BBC BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC "BBC BASIC") family), `?` is used to address a single-byte memory location. In [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml "OCaml"), the question mark precedes the label for an optional parameter. In [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) "Scheme (programming language)"), as a convention, symbol names ending in `?` are used for predicates, such as `odd?`, `null?`, and `eq?`. Similarly, in [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)"), method names ending in `?` are used for predicates. In [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language) "Swift (programming language)") a type followed by `?` denotes an [option type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type "Option type"); `?` is also used in "optional chaining", where if an option value is nil, it ignores the following operations. Similarly, in [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language) "Kotlin (programming language)"), a type followed by `?` is [nullable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullable_type "Nullable type") and functions similar to option chaining are supported. In [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), `?` generates random numbers or a random subset of indices. In [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) "Rust (programming language)"), a `?` suffix on a function or method call indicates error handling. In [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL "SPARQL"), the question mark is used to introduce variable names, such as `?name`. In [MUMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS "MUMPS"), it is the pattern match operator.

In the [Xbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbase "Xbase") family of programming languages, which includes [dBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase "DBase") and [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro "FoxPro"), either one or two question marks at the start of a line of code serve as a shorthand for the Print function. The effect is to evaluate the following expression(s) and to send the result(s) either to the screen or a printer. A single question mark sends a carriage return and line feed before the output; this is not the case with a double question mark.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-39)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-40)

In many [Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target [character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_set "Character set"). In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark ?, inverted question mark ¿, or the Unicode [replacement character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replacement_character "Replacement character"), usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: U+FFFD�REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office "Microsoft Office")'s ["smart quotes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_marks_in_English#Smart_quotes "Quotation marks in English").

The generic [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") syntax allows for a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string "Query string") to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, `?`, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the [ampersand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand "Ampersand") symbol, `&`, as seen in this URL:

`http://www.example.com/search.php?query=testing&database=English`

Here, a script on the page search.php on the server www.example.com is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs query=testing and database=English.

In [algebraic chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_chess_notation "Algebraic chess notation"), some [chess punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_punctuation "Chess punctuation") conventions include: "**?**" denotes a bad move, "**??**" a [blunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunder_(chess) "Blunder (chess)"), "**?!**" a [dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubious "Dubious") move, and "**!?**" an interesting move.

In [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble "Scrabble"), a question mark indicates a blank tile.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-41)

In most areas of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), but especially in [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"), a question mark in front of a word, phrase or sentence indicates that the form in question is strongly dispreferred, "questionable" or "strange", but not outright [ungrammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungrammatical "Ungrammatical").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-45) (The [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisks_in_linguistics "Asterisks in linguistics") is used to indicate outright ungrammaticality.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-Graffi-46): 332 )

Other sources go further and use several symbols (e.g. the question mark and the asterisk plus `?*` or the [degree symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol "Degree symbol")`°`) to indicate gradations or a continuum of acceptability.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-48)

Yet others use double question marks `??` to indicate a degree of strangeness between those indicated by a single question mark and that indicated by the combination of question mark and asterisk.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-49)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-50)

Mathematics and formal logic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_mark&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Mathematics and formal logic")]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), "**?**" commonly denotes [Minkowski's question mark function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%27s_question_mark_function "Minkowski's question mark function").

In [linear logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic "Linear logic"), the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.

When placed above the relational symbol in an [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") or [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics) "Inequality (mathematics)"), a question-mark annotation means that the stated relation is "questioned". This can be used to ask whether the relation might be true or to point out the relation's possible invalidity.

*   U+225F≟QUESTIONED EQUAL TO
*   U+2A7B⩻LESS-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE
*   U+2A7C⩼GREATER-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE

A question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis "Diagnosis"). It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left [lower abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_abdominal_pain "Lower abdominal pain"), a differential diagnosis might include _?[diverticulitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis "Diverticulitis")_ (read as "query diverticulitis").

2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_ref-45)**One article notes succinctly that "common practice in linguistics [is that] an asterisk preceding a word, a clause or a sentence is used to indicate ungrammaticality or unacceptability, while a question mark is used to indicate questionable usage",[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-Xu-42): 15  another that, "A question mark indicates that the example is marginal; an asterisk indicates unacceptability"[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-Simons-43): 409  and another that "examples preceded by an asterisk are ungrammatical, and those preceded by a question mark would be considered strange".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark#cite_note-Everett-44): 623
