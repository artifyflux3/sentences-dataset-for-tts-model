It is bounded to the south by the Tjörnes Fracture Zone, which connects the submarine ridge to the on-shore Northern Volcanic Zone rifting center in eastern Iceland.

[ 1 ] The volcanic islands Kolbeinsey and Grímsey lie along the Kolbeinsey Ridge.

Bacteria [ edit ] In 1992, Robert Huber and Karl Stetter discovered a new species of thermophilic bacteria here and named it A. pyrophilus .
