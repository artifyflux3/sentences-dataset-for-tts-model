In Britain, he is currently a member of the Labour Left Alliance, the Socialist Labour Network, and the Campaign for a New Workers Party.

Early life [ edit ] Dave Hill was brought up in a working-class family from the East End of London . His mother was a dressmaker and his father, a cabinet maker and carpenter.

[ 2 ] Hill became the first in his family to go to a grammar school; he attended Westlain Grammar School in Brighton.

[ 3 ] Hill studied Politics and Modern History at Manchester University and subsequently gained master's degrees, one in politics and another in Education at the University of Sussex and a PhD at the London University Institute of Education under the supervision of Geoff Whitty . During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, he worked as a part-time photo-journalist for some of the Left Press in Britain, covering elections in Portugal, Spain, and France for New Socialist , Labour Weekly and Tribune .

Politics [ edit ] In 1961, Dave Hill joined the Labour Party and became Chair of Brighton Young Socialists . In 2005, after 44 years of active membership, [ 4 ] he left the Labour Party and joined the International Socialist Group (which later merged into Socialist Resistance ), and the Respect Party . He left Socialist Resistance in 2014 and joined the Independent Socialist Network, an organisation within the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), for whom he has fought local and parliamentary elections, [ 5 ] and was a member of Left Unity. He unsuccessfully applied to rejoin the Labour Party in July 2016 as part of the influx of socialists into the Labour Party to support the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn and, after an appeal, was re-admitted to Labour in 2018. He is now a member of the National Organising Group of the Labour Left Alliance, of the Socialist Labour Network, and the Campaign for a Mass Workers Party.

In 1988, Hill announced he was leaving Labour electoral politics.
