They are constructed as quotient spaces of [0, 1] × K where K is a Cantor set .

[ 3 ] Background [ edit ] Cheeger defined a notion of differentiability for real-valued functions on metric measure spaces which are doubling and satisfy a Poincaré inequality , generalizing the usual notion on Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds .  Spaces that satisfy these conditions include Carnot groups and other sub-Riemannian manifolds , but not classic fractals such as the Koch snowflake or the Sierpiński gasket .  The question therefore arose whether spaces of fractional Hausdorff dimension can satisfy a Poincaré inequality.  Bourdon and Pajot [ 4 ] were the first to construct such spaces.  Tomi J. Laakso [ 3 ] gave a different construction which gave spaces with Hausdorff dimension any real number greater than 1.  These examples are now known as Laakso spaces.

Construction [ edit ] We describe a space F Q {\displaystyle F_{Q}} with Hausdorff dimension Q ∈ ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) {\displaystyle Q\in (1,2)} .  (For integer dimensions, Euclidean spaces satisfy the desired condition, and for any Hausdorff dimension S + r in the interval ( S , S + 1) , where S is an integer, we can take the space R S − − 1 × × F r + 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{S-1}\times F_{r+1}} .)  Let t ∈ (0, 1/2) be such that Q = 1 + ln ⁡ ⁡ 2 ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / t ) .

{\displaystyle Q=1+{\frac {\ln 2}{\ln(1/t)}}.} Then define K to be the Cantor set obtained by cutting out the middle 1 - 2 t portion of an interval and iterating that construction.  In other words, K can be defined as the subset of [0, 1] containing 0 and 1 and satisfying K = t K ∪ ∪ ( 1 − − t + t K ) .

{\displaystyle K=tK\cup (1-t+tK).} The space F Q {\displaystyle F_{Q}} will be a quotient of I × K , where I is the unit interval and I × K is given the metric induced from ℝ 2 .

To save on notation, we now assume that t = 1/3 , so that K is the usual middle thirds Cantor set.  The general construction is similar but more complicated.  Recall that the middle thirds Cantor set consists of all points in [0, 1] whose ternary expansion consists of only 0's and 2's.  Given a string a of 0's and 2's, let K a be the subset of points of K consisting of points whose ternary expansion starts with a .  For example, K 2022 = 2 3 + 2 27 + 2 81 + 1 81 K .

{\displaystyle K_{2022}={\frac {2}{3}}+{\frac {2}{27}}+{\frac {2}{81}}+{\frac {1}{81}}K.} Now let b = u /3 k be a fraction in lowest terms.  For every string a of 0's and 2's of length k - 1 , and for every point x ∈ K a 0 , we identify ( b , x ) with the point ( b , x + 2/3 k ) ∈ { b } × K a 2 .

We give the resulting quotient space the quotient metric : d F Q ( p , q ) = inf ( d I × × K ( p , q 1 ) + d I × × K ( p 2 , q 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + d I × × K ( p n − − 1 , q n − − 1 ) + d I × × K ( p n , q ) ) , {\displaystyle d_{F_{Q}}(p,q)=\inf(d_{I\times K}(p,q_{1})+d_{I\times K}(p_{2},q_{2})+\cdots +d_{I\times K}(p_{n-1},q_{n-1})+d_{I\times K}(p_{n},q)),} where each q i is identified with p i +1 and the infimum is taken over all finite sequences of this form.

In the general case, the numbers b (called wormhole levels ) and their orders k are defined in a more complicated way so as to obtain a space with the right Hausdorff dimension, but the basic idea is the same.

Properties [ edit ] F Q is a doubling space and satisfies a (1, 1) - Poincaré inequality .

F Q does not have a bilipschitz embedding into any Euclidean space.
