It is the county seat of and the most populous city in Alameda County , with a population of 440,646 in 2020.

[ 12 ] A major West Coast port, Oakland is the most populous city in the East Bay, the third most populous city in the Bay Area, and the eighth most populous city in California. It serves as the Bay Area's trade center: the Port of Oakland is the busiest port in Northern California , and the fifth- or sixth-busiest in the United States.

[ 14 ] A charter city , [ 15 ] Oakland was incorporated on May 4, 1852, in the wake of the state's increasing population due to the California gold rush .

[ 4 ] Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of California coastal terrace prairie , oak woodland , and north coastal scrub .

[ 16 ] In the late 18th century, it became part of a large rancho grant in the colony of New Spain , and was known for its plentiful oak tree stands. Its land served as a resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco .

[ 16 ] The fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the 1850s, what became the first campus of the University of California was founded in Oakland, and Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869.

[ 17 ] The following year, Oakland's Lake Merritt became the United States' first officially designated wildlife refuge, now a National Historic Landmark . Following the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake , many San Francisco citizens moved to Oakland, enlarging the population, increasing its housing stock, and improving its infrastructure. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its port, shipyards , and manufacturing industry. In the 21st century, between 2019 and 2023, after the city and county refused requests for hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits to the privately owned teams, Oakland lost three teams of the major North American sports leagues within a span of five years.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Oakland, California For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Oakland, California .

Ohlone era [ edit ] The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Huchiun natives, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone (a Miwok word meaning "western people").

[ 20 ] In Oakland, they were concentrated around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek , a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at Emeryville .

Spanish and Mexican eras [ edit ] Oakland and much of the East Bay was part of Rancho San Antonio , granted to Luís María Peralta in 1820. Here the Peralta family is pictured at their hacienda in Oakland, c. 1840.

In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was colonized, along with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the king of Spain . In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to Luis María Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio . The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.

[ 21 ] Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland was within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente.

[ 22 ] The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called Encinar (misrendered at an early date and carried forward as "encinal") – Spanish for " oak grove " – due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which eventually led to the city's name.

[ 5 ] According to Stanford University historian Albert Camarillo, the Peralta family struggled to keep their land after the incorporation of California into the United States after the Mexican–American War . Camarillo claims the family was the victim of targeted racial violence . He writes in Chicanos in California , "They lost everything when squatters cut down their fruit trees, killed their cattle, destroyed their buildings, and even fenced off the roads leading to the rancho. Especially insidious were the actions of attorney Horace Carpentier , who tricked Vicente Peralta into signing a 'lease' which turned out to be a mortgage against the 19,000-acre rancho. The lands became Carpentier's when Peralta refused to repay the loan he believed was fraudulently incurred. The Peraltas had no choice but to abandon the homesite they had occupied for two generations." [ 23 ] City beginnings [ edit ] 1857 map of Oakland In 1851, three men— Horace Carpentier , Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland.

[ 24 ] In 1852, the Town of Oakland was incorporated by the state legislature.

[ 25 ] During this time, Oakland had 75–100 inhabitants, two hotels, a wharf, two warehouses, and only cattle trails. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland.

[ 26 ] Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year.

[ 27 ] In 1853, a preparatory academy was founded in Oakland that soon became the College of California , and in 1869, the first campus of the University of California . The university moved just north to Berkeley in the 1870s.

[ 28 ] During the 1850s, just as gold was discovered in California, Oakland started growing and further developing because land was becoming too expensive in San Francisco .

[ 29 ] People in China were struggling financially as a result of the First Opium War , the Second Opium War , and the Taiping Rebellion , so they began migrating to Oakland, many of whom were recruited to work on railroads. However, the Chinese struggled to settle because they were discriminated against by the white community and their living quarters were burned down on several occasions.

[ 30 ] [ page needed ] The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today's Port of Oakland .

[ 31 ] A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis "Borax" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System , the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit .

1900–1950s [ edit ] The Santa Fe rail station in 1912.

Oakland was one of the worst affected cities in California that was impacted by the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904 .

Quarantine measures were set in place at the Oakland ports requiring the authorities at the port to inspect the arriving vessels for the presence of infected rats.

[ 32 ] Quarantine authorities at these ports inspected over a thousand vessels per year for plague and yellow fever. By 1908, over 5,000 people were detained in quarantine.

[ 33 ] Hunters were sent to poison the affected areas in Oakland and shoot the squirrels, but the eradication work was limited in its range because the State Board of Health and the United States Public Health Service were only allotted about $60,000 a year to eradicate the disease. During this period Oakland did not have sufficient health facilities, so some of the infected patients were treated at home.

[ 34 ] The State Board of Health along with Oakland also advised physicians to promptly report any cases of infected patients.

[ 35 ] Yet, in 1919 it still resulted in a small epidemic of Pneumonic plague which killed a dozen people in Oakland.

[ 35 ] This started when a man went hunting in Contra Costa Valley and killed a squirrel. After eating the squirrel, he fell ill four days later and another household member contracted the plague. This in turn was passed on either directly or indirectly to about a dozen others.

[ 36 ] The officials in Oakland acted quickly by issuing death certificates to monitor the spread of plague.

[ 35 ] Incorporation [ edit ] One day's output of 1917 automobiles at Chevrolet 's major West Coast plant, now the location of Eastmont Town Center At the time of incorporation in 1852, Oakland had consisted of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of Alameda being made an island. In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.

In 1908, the lawyer, former miner, and newspaper owner Homer Wood (1880–1976) suggested to his friend Frank Bilger of Blake and Bilger Rock Quarry and Paving Company that he organize a gathering to establish a Rotary Club east of the bay. On November 27, 1908, Homer took a ferry across the bay in a driving rainstorm and met for lunch with Frank and twenty three other businessmen at the Hotel Metropole at 13th and Jefferson. This gathering became the first meeting of the Tri-City Rotary Club, renamed in 1911 The Rotary Club of Oakland, the third Rotary Club in the world. This group established the tradition of weekly meetings, something most clubs worldwide follow today.

[ 37 ] In 1917, General Motors opened an automobile factory in East Oakland called Oakland Assembly . It produced Chevrolet cars and then GMC trucks until 1963, when it was moved to Fremont in southern Alameda County.

[ 38 ] Also in 1916, the Fageol Motor Company chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming tractors from 1918 to 1923.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous manufacturing industries, including metals , canneries, bakeries, internal combustion engines , automobiles, and shipbuilding.

[ 41 ] By 1929, when Chrysler expanded with a new plant there, Oakland had become known as the " Detroit of the West," referring to the major auto manufacturing center in Michigan.

[ 42 ] Old Oakland neighborhood Oakland expanded during the 1920s, as its population expanded with factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built in the 3 years between 1921 and 1924, [ 43 ] more than during the 13 years between 1907 and 1920.

[ 44 ] Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; they reflect the architectural styles of the time.

Historic 1920s-era Parkway Theater In 1924, the Tribune Tower was completed; in 1976, it was restored and declared an Oakland landmark. While it is no longer occupied by the Oakland Tribune , its historic appearance is preserved.

Russell Clifford Durant established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street in 1916.

[ 45 ] The first transcontinental airmail flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, flown by Army Capt.

Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt.

Bert Acosta .

[ 46 ] Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport was soon established four miles (6.4 km) to the southwest.

[ 47 ] During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100 million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.

[ 48 ] President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers came from around the country, especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee.

Henry J. Kaiser 's representatives recruited sharecroppers and tenant farmers from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the Great Migration by which five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the Jim Crow South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony Oakland African-Americans had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated.

[ 49 ] Also migrating to the area during this time were many Mexican Americans from southwestern states such as New Mexico , Texas , and Colorado . Many worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad , at its major rail yard in West Oakland. Their young men encountered hostility and discrimination by Armed Forces personnel, and tensions broke out in " zoot suit riots " in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of a major disturbance in Los Angeles that year.

[ 50 ] View of Lake Merritt looking southwest toward the Alameda County Courthouse In 1946, National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company , acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland's electric streetcar system. The city's expensive electric streetcar fleet was converted to cheaper diesel buses.

[ 51 ] The state Legislature created the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District in 1955, which operates today as AC Transit , the third-largest bus-only transit system in the nation.

[ 52 ] After the war, as Oakland's shipbuilding industry declined and the automobile industry went through restructuring, many jobs were lost.

[ 53 ] In addition, labor unrest increased as workers struggled to protect their livelihoods. Oakland was the center of a general strike during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country that had such a strike after World War II.

[ 54 ] The Mary's First and Last Chance in Oakland was a lesbian bar, once the focus of the 1950s California Supreme Court lawsuit Vallerga v. Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control, when the bar challenged a state law for the right to serve gay patrons and won in 1959.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1960–1999 [ edit ] In 1960, Kaiser Corporation opened its new headquarters; it was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as "the largest office tower west of Chicago " up to that time.

[ 57 ] In the postwar period, suburban development increased around Oakland, and wealthier residents moved to new housing . Despite the major increases in the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality before the law. Police abuse of blacks was common.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party at Merritt College (then located at a former high school on Grove Street, now occupied by Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute ), which emphasized Black nationalism , advocated armed self-defense against police, and was involved in several incidents that ended in the deaths of police officers and other Black Panther members. Among their social programs were feeding children and providing other services to the needy.

[ 60 ] As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden cities.

[ 61 ] In 1980, Oakland's Black population reached its 20th-century peak at approximately 47% of the overall city population.

[ 62 ] The 6.9 M w Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989. The rupture was related to the San Andreas fault system and affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ). Many structures in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker portion of Interstate 880 that collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month.

On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm swept down from the Berkeley /Oakland hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and an estimated economic loss of US$ 1.5 billion, this was the worst urban firestorm in American history, until 2017.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] During the mid-1990s, Oakland's economy began to recover as it transitioned to new types of jobs. In addition, the city participated in large development and urban renewal projects, concentrated especially in the downtown area, at the Port of Oakland , and at the Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport .

[ 65 ] 21st century [ edit ] Port of Oakland and downtown, with the Oakland and Berkeley Hills in the background After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.

[ 66 ] Brown's plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification , which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities.

[ 67 ] Due to allegations of misconduct by the Oakland Police Department , the City of Oakland has paid claims for a total of US$ 57 million during the 2001–2011 timeframe to plaintiffs claiming police abuse; this is the largest sum paid by any city in California.

[ 68 ] On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began " Occupy Oakland " demonstrations at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland .

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] African-Americans dropped to 28% of Oakland's population in 2010, from nearly half in 1980, due to fast-rising rents and an extreme housing crisis in the region.

[ 71 ] The city inspected warehouses and live/work spaces after a fire broke out in the Ghost Ship warehouse , killing 36 people in 2016.

[ 72 ] Oakland is the second U.S. city, after Denver , to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms . In June 2019, the City Council passed the resolution in a unanimous vote ending the investigation and imposition of criminal penalties for use and possession of natural entheogens .

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] In November 2019, two homeless mothers and their children moved into a vacant three-bedroom house in West Oakland. The group, calling themselves Moms 4 Housing , said their goal was to protest what they said was a large number of vacant houses in Oakland owned by redevelopment companies while the city experienced a housing crisis.

[ 75 ] Two months later they were evicted from the house by three dozen sheriff's deputies, as hundreds of supporters demonstrated in favor of the women.

[ 76 ] The incident received nationwide coverage.

[ 77 ] The company that owns the house later said they would sell it to a nonprofit affordable housing group.

[ 78 ] As of 2019, Oakland's per-capita homeless rate was higher than San Francisco and Berkeley. Between 2014 and 2020, Oakland strengthened its protections for tenants in order to reduce the displacement of its long-time residents. Between January 2020 and March 2022, Oakland suffered a disproportionate death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic and Delta cron hybrid variant within the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 2023, prior to and during the Covid pandemic, Oakland became the first city in American history to lose three professional major league sports teams to other cities within a span of five years.

[ 79 ] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of Downtown Satellite picture of the Oakland area in 2019 Oakland is in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay .

The United States Census Bureau says the city's total area is 78.0 square miles (202 km 2 ), including 55.8 square miles (145 km 2 ) of land and 22.2 square miles (57 km 2 ) (28.48 percent) of water.

Oakland's highest point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over 1,760 feet (540 m) above sea level at about 37°52′43″N 122°13′27″W ﻿ / ﻿ 37.8786°N 122.2241°W ﻿ / 37.8786; -122.2241 . Oakland has 19 miles (31 km) of shoreline, [ 80 ] but Radio Beach is the only beach in Oakland.

Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as "the flatlands" and "the hills" . Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas Fault caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.

[ 81 ] Panorama of Oakland, California, from the top of Mountain View Cemetery Neighborhoods [ edit ] Main article: List of neighborhoods in Oakland, California The north end of the Adams Point district, as seen from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of the lake Upper Rockridge Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The city's greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District , Lake Merritt , East Oakland , North Oakland , West Oakland , and the Oakland Hills . East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville . West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point , and encompassing the Port of Oakland . In 2011, Oakland was ranked the tenth most walkable city in the United States by Walk Score .

[ 82 ] Oakland's Chinatown district is one of the oldest in the nation.

Lake Merritt, an urban estuary near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable features.

[ 83 ] It was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge in 1870.

[ 84 ] Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake .

The city of Piedmont , incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

Climate [ edit ] Oakland has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate ( Köppen : Csb , Trewartha : Csll) with an average of 260 sunny days per year. In general, the city features warm, dry summers, and cool, wet winters.

Based on data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities.

[ 85 ] Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are cool and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose , making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the Bay Bridge means the northern part of the city can have cooling maritime fog . It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from Berkeley .

The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was 104 °F (40 °C) on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was 24 °F (−4 °C) on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes.

Climate chart for Oakland Oakland, like much of Northern California, is susceptible to winter rainstorms and Atmospheric rivers . The wettest "rain year" was from July 1997 to June 1998 with 47.76 inches (1,213.1 mm) and the driest from July 2020 to June 2021 with 8.03 inches (204.0 mm). The most rainfall in one month was 15.35 inches (390 mm) in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 4.75 inches (121 mm) on December 31, 2022.

[ 86 ] Rainfall near the bayfront is only 23 inches (580 mm), but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to 30 inches [760 mm]), with nearly all precipitation falling between November and April. While measurable amounts of snowfall in Oakland at sea level is very rare, light snow accumulates on the ground the higher elevations of the Oakland hills with more regularity.

Overnight lows are mild. Oakland seldom experiences warm nights with the warmest recorded night of 72 °F (22 °C) in September 1971 and an average of 64 °F (18 °C) for the annual warmest low.

Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush.

Australian eucalyptus trees have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate.

Shifting of cultures [ edit ] Oakland has consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] A 2019 analysis by WalletHub showed that Oakland was the most ethnoracially diverse city in the United States.

[ 112 ] The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990, due to a combination of factors, including suburbanization. Oakland became a destination for African Americans in the Great Migration during and after World War II as they gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Blacks have formed a plurality in Oakland for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population.

Oakland's Black population decreased by nearly 25 percent between 2000 and 2010.

[ 113 ] The city's demographics have changed due to a combination of rising housing prices associated with gentrification and with blacks relocating to better (and in many cases more affordable) housing in Bay Area suburbs or moving to the Southern United States in a reverse migration, where conditions (including race relations) are considered to have improved in comparison to previous generations.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] These trends and cultural shifts have led to a decline among some of Oakland's long standing black institutions, such as churches, businesses and nightclubs, which had developed during the growing years of the 1950s through 1970.

[ 117 ] In the 2010 census African Americans maintained their status as Oakland's single largest ethnic group, with 27% of the population, followed by non-Hispanic whites at 25.9%, and Hispanics of any race at 25.4%.

[ 118 ] Ethnic Asians constitute 17%, followed by smaller minority groups.

Many immigrants have settled in the city. Immigrants and others have marched by the thousands down Oakland's International Boulevard in support of legal reforms benefiting undocumented immigrants .

[ 119 ] An analysis by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census 2000 numbers showed Oakland had the third-highest concentration of gays and lesbians among the 50 largest U.S. cities, behind San Francisco and Seattle. Census data showed that among incorporated places that have at least 500 female couples, Oakland had the nation's largest proportion. In the 2000 census, 2,650 lesbian couples identified as such in Oakland; one in every 41 Oakland couples identified as a same-sex female partnership.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] Gentrification [ edit ] As of 2020, the San Francisco-Oakland Metro shows indications of having the greatest intensity of gentrification nationally, with over 31% of eligible neighborhoods gentrifying. Gentrifying neighborhoods showed significant increases in median home value, median household income, percentage of college educated residents, but also in economic inequality.

[ 122 ] Historically low-income neighborhoods have been rapidly changed by new, higher-income residents as high-wage tech workers and expensive housing have continued to push lower-wage residents out of Oakland.

[ 122 ] In West Oakland, for example, median household income rose from $80,700 to $86,300 between 2010 and 2017, while the percent of population with four-year degrees rose from one-third to nearly one-half, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.

[ 123 ] Big tech companies have continued to transform the communities and culture of Oakland as modern apartments have appeared, housing prices have spiked, and many prior working-class residents have moved to suburbs further inland.

[ 124 ] According to 2015 data compiled by the Bay Area Equity Atlas, 91% of low-income households of color were either in neighborhoods that were gentrifying or were at risk of gentrification at the time.

[ 125 ] The number was higher for individual low-income communities, with 96% of Native American households in neighborhoods that either experienced gentrification or were at risk of being gentrified, followed by Latino households at 94%, Black households at 92%, and Asian or Pacific Islander households at 88%.

[ 130 ] Crime dramatically decreased since the early 1990s but the city has continued to suffer from serious violent crime problems.

[ 130 ] Crime trends generally tracked comparison cities of Fresno , Richmond , Sacramento , and Stockton "in terms of direction if not magnitude"; this suggested that crime trends are regional rather than city-specific.

[ 130 ] A 2007 journal article identified crime in Oakland as being fueled by the dramatic increase of street narcotics sales and use since the 1970s, with Oakland becoming a major west-coast hub for heroin and cocaine distribution. Subsequent battle for control over the lucrative narcotics trade incited gang conflicts and violence, with shootings becoming a regular occurrence. A concurrent rise in rape, robbery, burglary, auto-theft and other crimes occurred as well. Prior to 1960, there had been successful government-funded social programs whereby rebellious teens were enrolled in youth centers that would teach them proper values and improve their behavior. Similar programs since then have been inconsistent.

[ 138 ] By the 1970s, the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used military tactics such as SWAT teams, infiltration and counter intelligence in an attempt to counter groups such as the Black Panthers (responsible for several police ambushes), the S.L.A. and organized drug gangs such as the "69 Mob", with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment.

[ 138 ] During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States.

[ 139 ] The number of Oakland Police Department officers has varied from a low of 626 (in 1996 and in 2012) to a high of 814 (in 2002).

[ 130 ] There were 723 officers at the end of 2015.

[ 128 ] The city's strategic plan recommended 925 officers, and an independent study commissioned by the city in the mid-1990s recommended 1,200 officers.

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, although these districts have 44% of Oakland's residents.

[ 143 ] In 2012, Oakland implemented Operation Ceasefire , a gang violence reduction plan used in other cities, based in part on the research and strategies of author David M. Kennedy .

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Economy [ edit ] The iconic Tribune Tower , from 13th St. and Franklin St. in Downtown Further information: List of companies based in Oakland, California Oakland is a major West Coast port, and the fifth-busiest in the United States by cargo volume.

[ 148 ] The Port of Oakland handles 99% of all containerized goods moving through Northern California, representing $41 billion worth of international trade.

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] There are nearly 200,000 jobs related to marine cargo transport in the Oakland area.

[ 151 ] These jobs range from minimum wage hourly positions to Transportation Storage and Distribution Managers who earn an annual average salary of US$ 91,520.

[ 152 ] The Port of Oakland was an early innovator/pioneer in the technologies of Intermodal Containerized Shipping . The city is also home to several major corporations including Kaiser Permanente , Clorox , and Dreyer's ice cream.

[ 153 ] Tech companies such as Ask.com and Pandora Radio are in Oakland, [ 154 ] and in recent years many start-up high tech and green energy companies have found a home in the downtown neighborhoods of Uptown, City Center, Jack London Square and Lake Merritt Financial District.

[ 155 ] As of 2013 [update] , the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area has a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 360.4 billion, ranking eighth among metropolitan areas in the United States.

[ 156 ] In 2014, Oakland was amongst the best cities to start a career, the highest ranked city in California after San Francisco. Additionally, Oakland ranked fourth in cities with professional opportunities.

[ 157 ] Numerous companies in San Francisco continue to expand in or migrate over to Oakland.

[ 158 ] Oakland experienced an increase of both its population and of land values in the early-to-mid first decade of the 21st century.

Southern Pacific trains ended at the 16th Street Station .

[ 203 ] Western Pacific trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at Oakland Pier .

[ 204 ] From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco.

Mass transit and bicycling [ edit ] The Lake Merritt BART station The 12th St. BART subway entrance leading to 14th St.

Data compiled in 2007 by the United States Census Bureau before gasoline price spikes in 2008, showed that 24.3% of Oaklanders used public transportation, walked or used "other means" to commute to work, not including remote work , [ 205 ] with 17% of Oakland households being "car free" and/or statistically categorized as having "no vehicles available." [ 206 ] Bus transit service in Oakland and the inner East Bay is provided by the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District, AC Transit . The district originated in 1958 after the conspiratorial dissolution of the Key System of streetcars. Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.

[ 52 ] Construction of AC Transit's Westbound 12th St station Intercity bus companies that serve Oakland include Greyhound , BoltBus , USAsia , and Hoang Transportation . Megabus no longer serves Oakland.

[ 207 ] The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland, served by all BART lines.The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations.

The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) element of Oakland's 1998 General Plan. The creation of the plan was to promote alternatives to the private automobile.

[ 208 ] The Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005, revised it in 2007, and reaffirmed it in 2012.

[ 209 ] [ 208 ] From 1999 to 2007, the city installed 900 bike racks throughout Oakland, accommodating over 2,000 bicycles.

[ 210 ] By the end of 2017, over 160 bikeway miles and 9,900 bike parking spaces were constructed.

[ 211 ] Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland.

[ 212 ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey , Oakland came in seventh place out of the 100 largest cities in the nation by percentage of people that chose to commute by bike in 2011.

[ 213 ] Motorized scooters [ edit ] In July 2019, the City of Oakland Department of Transportation announced that it had issued official permits for the deployment of shared e-scooters to four companies: Bird , Clevr, Lime, and Lyft.

[ 214 ] Oakland requires these operators to educate users on the correct and safe use of scooters, to distribute the scooters equitably throughout the city, to ensure accessibility, and to provide insurance and indemnification.

[ 215 ] Bridges, freeways, and tunnels [ edit ] Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the MacArthur Maze freeway interchange: Interstate 580 (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward Hayward and eventually to the California Central Valley ; Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to San Jose ; and the Eastshore Freeway ( Interstate 80 /I-580) runs north, providing connections to Sacramento and San Rafael , respectively.

Interstate 980 (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into State Route 24 (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580.

State Route 13 begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the Montclair District before entering Berkeley . A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.

Portion of the collapsed Cypress Viaduct from the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake At the time of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1997–2001. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.

Two underwater tunnels, the Webster and Posey Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the Park Street , Fruitvale , and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the Oakland Estuary .

In the hills, the Leimert Bridge crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The Caldecott Tunnel carries Highway 24 through the Berkeley Hills , connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

Oakland Slow Streets Program [ edit ] Part of the Slow Streets Program in September 2020 On April 11, 2020, the City of Oakland launched its Slow Streets Program.

[ 216 ] This was facilitated in part by the sudden decrease of vehicle traffic that resulted from the state-wide stay-at-home order and school closures in response to the spread of the COVID-19 in California .

[ 217 ] The goal of the program was to "support safe physical activity and alleviate overcrowding in parks and on trails by discouraging through traffic." [ 218 ] This was accomplished by closing 74 miles of streets to through traffic.

[ 219 ] Over the course of three months the city installed "soft closure" barriers consisting of signage, traffic cones, and barricades in over 21 miles of city streets.

[ 216 ] While the primary goal at the time was to encourage socially distanced outdoor physical activities like biking, walking, and jogging, the long term implementation of the Slow Streets Program contributed to the city's traffic calming measures and promoted alternatives to car use as well.

[ 218 ] Although the Slow Streets Program was initially praised for its rapid implementation and prioritization of pedestrian safety, the Oakland Department of Transportation quickly came under fire for its failure to collect feedback that represented the opinions of the diverse range of residents whom the program affected.

[ 219 ] The high engagement with online surveys by wealthy white residents initially suggested an almost universally positive reaction to the program.

[ 220 ] The disproportionately low number of responses from residents of East Oakland—a largely Black and Latino and low-income area—revealed both the oversight of city officials as well as the shortcomings of urban planning systems' ability to equally benefit different social groups, which consequently perpetuates inequalities like the transport divide .

After the flaws of the feedback forms were brought to light, city planners made concentrated efforts to meet with representatives from different community groups who in turn stressed that simply closing streets to through traffic was not enough to protect pedestrians from dangerous driving.

[ 220 ] In response the city expressed its commitment to its local residents calling for road traffic safety by rolling out Slow Streets: Essential Places, a phase of the program which installed cones and signage at dangerous traffic areas in order to make grocery stores, COVID-19 test sites, and food distribution sites easily and safely accessible.

[ 217 ] Freight rail [ edit ] Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and to a lesser extent by BNSF Railway (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the Western Pacific Railroad (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the Sacramento Northern Railroad (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

Shipping [ edit ] As one of the three major ports on the West Coast of the United States , the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer , [ 221 ] thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco , which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.

[ 222 ] Utilities [ edit ] Public water supply and sewage treatment are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD).

Oakland's location, where rail and water transportation meet, made it an ideal site for canneries. Shippers brought produce from all over California for canning at several large plants—including the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which developed the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company, which took over the H. G. Prince Company between 1925 and 1930. In 1943, the Oakland Tribune reported that the $100,000,000 canning industry in Oakland ranked second only to shipbuilding in value.
