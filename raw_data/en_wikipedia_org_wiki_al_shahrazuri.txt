He was of Kurdish origin.

[ 1 ] It appears that he was alive in AD 1288. However, it is also said that he died in the same year.

[ 1 ] Shahrazuri was an important historian and scholar of the late 13th century who composed a biographical dictionary of both ancient Greek and early Muslim learned men. Although he wrote a major biographical work on scholars, very little is known about his life, including the dates of his birth and death.

[ 1 ] Perhaps the most well known work by him is Nuzhat al arwâḥ wa rawḍat al-afrâḥ . According to the correction and reprint by M A Khurshid, there are several copies of the book; one of them in the John Rylands library in Manchester.

[ 1 ] Edward Granville Browne mentions two medical works attributed to him, one in Arabic and another in Persian language .

(E. Browne, p. 100) One of his philosophical works is commentary about philosopher Suhrawardi called Sharḥ Ḥikma al-ishrâq .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is also said that the well known commentary works of Qutb al-Din Al Shirazi called Durrat al-Taj about Suhrawardi 's Hikmat al-Ishraq is based on Sharḥ Ḥikma al-ishrâq .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is also said that another of his work regarding Suhrawardi's Illumnationist philosophy is the most faithful, called al-Shajarah al-Ilahiyyah (The Divine Tree).
