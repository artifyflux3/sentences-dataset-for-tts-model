Hallway in Luhrs Tower , 1929 office building in Phoenix, Arizona Corridor inside a Government Medical College in Kollam , India A hallway (also passage , passageway , corridor or hall ) is an interior space in a building that is used to connect other rooms. Hallways are generally long and narrow.

[ 1 ] Hallways must be sufficiently wide to ensure buildings can be evacuated during a fire, and to allow people in wheelchairs to navigate them. The minimum width of a hallway is governed by building codes . Minimum widths in residences are 36 inches (910 mm) in the United States.

[ 2 ] Hallways are wider in higher-traffic settings, such as schools [ 3 ] and hospitals.

[ 4 ] In 1597 John Thorpe is the first recorded architect to replace multiple connected rooms with rooms along a corridor each accessed by a separate door.
