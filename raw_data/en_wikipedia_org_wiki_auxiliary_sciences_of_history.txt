For other uses, see Historical science (disambiguation) .

Auxiliary (or ancillary ) sciences of history are scholarly disciplines which help evaluate and use historical sources and are seen as auxiliary for historical research.

[ 1 ] [ page needed ] Many of these areas of study, classification and analysis were originally developed between the 16th and 19th centuries by antiquaries, and would then have been regarded as falling under the broad heading of antiquarianism .

[ 2 ] "History" was at that time regarded as a largely literary skill. However, with the spread of the principles of empirical source-based history championed by the Göttingen school of history in the late 18th century [ 3 ] and later by Leopold von Ranke from the mid-19th century onwards, they have been increasingly regarded as falling within the skill-set of the trained historian .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Examples [ edit ] Auxiliary sciences of history include, but are not limited to: [ 1 ] [ 6 ] : 1 Archaeology , the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture Archival science , the study and theory of creating and maintaining archives Chorography , the describing or mapping of regions and places Chronology , the study of the sequence of past events Cliometrics , the systematic application of economic theory, econometric techniques, and other formal or mathematical methods to the study of history Codicology , the study of books as physical objects Diplomatics , the study and textual analysis of historical documents Encyclopaedistics (or encyclopedistics), the study of encyclopaedias as sources of encyclopaedic knowledge Epigraphy , the study of ancient inscriptions Ethnography , the study of individual cultures Filigranology , the study of watermarks Genealogy , the study of family relationships Historical geography , the study of change regarding geographic phenomena Heraldry , the study of armorial devices Iconography , the study of images Numismatics , the study of coins Onomastics , the study of proper names Palaeography (rarely archaeography), the study of historic handwriting and manuscripts Paleoanthropology , the study of human evolution and ecology through the fossil record Phaleristics , the study of military orders, fraternities, and awards Philately , the study of postage stamps Philology , the study of the language of historical sources Prosopography , the investigation of a historical group of individuals through a collective study of their lives Sigillography (or sphragistics), the study of seals Toponymy , the study of place names Uniformology , the study of uniforms (especially military uniforms) Vexillology , the study of flags Several of these are disciplines or sub-disciplines of major social sciences , especially: Anthropology , the study of the development of humanity and culture (see also: Physical anthropology ) Linguistics , the study of language and its uses (see also: Historical linguistics ) Sociology , the study of societal behavior, groups, and relationships See also [ edit ] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Auxiliary sciences of history .
