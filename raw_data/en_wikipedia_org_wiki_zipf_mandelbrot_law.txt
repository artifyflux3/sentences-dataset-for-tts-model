Also known as the Pareto –Zipf law, it is a power-law distribution on ranked data , named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf , who suggested a simpler distribution called Zipf's law , and the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot , who subsequently generalized it.

The probability mass function is given by f ( k ; N , q , s ) = 1 H N , q , s 1 ( k + q ) s , {\displaystyle f(k;N,q,s)={\frac {1}{H_{N,q,s}}}{\frac {1}{(k+q)^{s}}},} where H N , q , s {\displaystyle H_{N,q,s}} is given by H N , q , s = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N 1 ( i + q ) s , {\displaystyle H_{N,q,s}=\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {1}{(i+q)^{s}}},} which may be thought of as a generalization of a harmonic number . In the formula, k {\displaystyle k} is the rank of the data, and q {\displaystyle q} and s {\displaystyle s} are parameters of the distribution. In the limit as N {\displaystyle N} approaches infinity, this becomes the Hurwitz zeta function ζ ζ ( s , q ) {\displaystyle \zeta (s,q)} . For finite N {\displaystyle N} and q = 0 {\displaystyle q=0} the Zipf–Mandelbrot law becomes Zipf's law . For infinite N {\displaystyle N} and q = 0 {\displaystyle q=0} it becomes a zeta distribution .

Applications [ edit ] The distribution of words ranked by their frequency in a random text corpus is approximated by a power-law distribution, known as Zipf's law .

If one plots the frequency rank of words contained in a moderately sized corpus of text data versus the number of occurrences or actual frequencies, one obtains a power-law distribution, with exponent close to one (but see Powers, 1998 and Gelbukh & Sidorov, 2001). Zipf's law implicitly assumes a fixed vocabulary size, but the Harmonic series with s = 1 does not converge, while the Zipf–Mandelbrot generalization with s > 1 does. Furthermore, there is evidence that the closed class of functional words that define a language obeys a Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution with different parameters from the open classes of contentive words that vary by topic, field and register.

[ 1 ] In ecological field studies, the relative abundance distribution (i.e. the graph of the number of species observed as a function of their abundance) is often found to conform to a Zipf–Mandelbrot law.

[ 2 ] Within music, many metrics of measuring "pleasing" music conform to Zipf–Mandelbrot distributions.
