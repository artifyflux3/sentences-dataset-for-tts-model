 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

**Engineering physics** (**EP**), sometimes **engineering science**, is the [field of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_study "Field of study") combining [pure science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_science "Pure science") disciplines (such as [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry")) and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") disciplines ([computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "Computer engineering"), [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering"), [electrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), [medical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_engineering "Medical engineering"), [materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_engineering "Materials engineering"), [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), etc.).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-princeReview-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-princeton-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-Khare-3)

In many languages, the term **technical physics** is also used. It has been used since 1861, after being introduced by the German physics teacher [J. Frick](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Frick&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joseph Frick (page does not exist)")[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Frick "de:Joseph Frick")] in his publications.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-4)

Terminology
-----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_physics&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Terminology")]

In some countries, both what would be translated as "engineering physics" and what would be translated as "technical physics" are disciplines leading to academic degrees. In China, for example, with the former specializing in nuclear power research (i.e. [nuclear engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering")), and the latter closer to engineering physics.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-5)

In some universities and their institutions, an engineering physics (or applied physics) major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or [applied science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-9)

Several related names have existed since the inception of the interdisciplinary field. For example, some university courses are called or contain the phrase "physical technologies" or "physical engineering sciences" or "physical technics". In some cases, a program formerly called "physical engineering" has been renamed "applied physics" or has evolved into specialized fields such as "[photonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonics "Photonics") engineering".

Expertise
---------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_physics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Expertise")]

Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science or engineering physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science or engineering physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in [applied physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_physics "Applied physics") for a selected specialty such as [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"), [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics"), [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), [applied mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics "Applied mechanics"), [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), [microfabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfabrication "Microfabrication"), [microelectronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics "Microelectronics"), [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), [photonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonics "Photonics"), [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [nuclear engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "Nuclear engineering"), [biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics"), [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"), [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics"), [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), [solid-state physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_physics "Solid-state physics"), etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research") and development, design, and analysis.

Degrees
-------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_physics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Degrees")]

In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech., [B.Sc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science"), [M.Sc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science "Master of Science") and [Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), and [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") forms the foundation of the [curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum "Curriculum"), while typical elective areas may include [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_physics "Plasma physics"), [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), [solid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_mechanics "Solid mechanics"), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research"), [quantitative finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_finance "Quantitative finance"), information technology and engineering, [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems "Dynamical systems"), [bioengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioengineering "Bioengineering"), [environmental engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_engineering "Environmental engineering"), computational engineering, [engineering mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_mathematics "Engineering mathematics") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [solid-state devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_(electronics) "Solid state (electronics)"), [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [nanoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoscience "Nanoscience"), [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics").

Awards
------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_physics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Awards")]

There are awards for excellence in engineering physics. For example, [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University")'s _[Jeffrey O. Kephart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey\_Owen\_Kephart "Jeffrey Owen Kephart") '80 Prize_ is awarded annually to the graduating senior with the best record.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-10) Since 2002, the [German Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Physical_Society "German Physical Society") has awarded the _Georg-Simon-Ohm-Preis_ for outstanding research in this field.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics#cite_note-11)
