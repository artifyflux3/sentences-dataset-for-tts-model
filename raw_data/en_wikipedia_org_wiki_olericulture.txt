( March 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Olericulture - panoramio Olericulture (from Latin : oleris + culture ) is the science of vegetable growing, dealing with the culture of non-woody ( herbaceous ) plants for food.

Olericulture is the production of plants for use of the edible parts. Vegetable crops can be classified into nine major categories: Potherbs and greens – spinach and collards Salad crops – lettuce, celery Cole crops – cabbage and cauliflower Root crops (tubers) – potatoes, beets, carrots, radishes Bulb crops – onions, leeks Legumes – beans, peas Cucurbits – melons, squash, cucumber Solanaceous crops – tomatoes, peppers, potatoes Sweet corn Olericulture deals with the production, storage, processing and marketing of vegetables. It encompasses crop establishment, including cultivar selection, seedbed preparation and establishment of vegetable crops by seed and transplants.

It also includes maintenance and care of vegetable crops as well commercial and non-traditional vegetable crop production including organic gardening and organic farming ; sustainable agriculture and horticulture; hydroponics ; and biotechnology .
