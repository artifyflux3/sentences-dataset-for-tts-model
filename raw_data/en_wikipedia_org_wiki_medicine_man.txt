An Ojibwe midew 'ceremonial leader' in a mide-wiigiwaam 'medicine lodge' A medicine man (from Ojibwe mashkikiiwinini ) or medicine woman (from Ojibwe mashkikiiwininiikwe ) is a traditional healer and spiritual leader who serves a community of Indigenous people of the Americas . Each culture has its own name in its language for spiritual healers and ceremonial leaders.

Cultural context [ edit ] See also: Heyoka Yup'ik "medicine man exorcising evil spirits from a sick boy" in Nushagak, Alaska , 1890s [ 1 ] In the ceremonial context of Indigenous North American communities , " medicine " usually refers to spiritual healing. Medicine people use many practices, including specialized knowledge of Native American ethnobotany .

[ 2 ] Herbal healing is a common practice in many Indigenous households of the Americas; [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] however, medicine people often have more in-depth knowledge of using plants for healing or other purposes.

[ 2 ] The terms medicine people or ceremonial people are sometimes used in Native American and First Nations communities, for example, when Arwen Nuttall ( Cherokee ) of the National Museum of the American Indian writes, "The knowledge possessed by medicine people is privileged, and it often remains in particular families." [ 6 ] Native Americans tend to be quite reluctant to discuss issues about medicine or medicine people with non-Indians. In some cultures, the people will not even discuss these matters with American Indians from other tribes. In most tribes, medicine elders are prohibited from advertising or introducing themselves as such.

[ citation needed ] As Nuttall writes, "An inquiry to a Native person about religious beliefs or ceremonies is often viewed with suspicion." [ 6 ] One example of this is the Apache medicine cord or Izze-kloth whose purpose and use by Apache medicine elders was a mystery to nineteenth century ethnologists [ who?

] because "the Apache look upon these cords as so sacred that strangers are not allowed to see them, much less handle them or talk about them." [ 7 ] The term medicine man/woman , like the term shaman , has been criticized by Native Americans, as well as other specialists in the fields of religion and anthropology.

[ citation needed ] While non-Native anthropologists often use the term shaman for Indigenous healers worldwide, including the Americas, shaman is the specific name for a spiritual mediator from the Tungusic peoples of Siberia , [ 8 ] which has been adopted by some Inuit communities but is not preferred by Native American or First Nations communities.
