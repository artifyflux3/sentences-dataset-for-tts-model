He authored over 200 papers on the microbiology of extreme habitats.

Biography [ edit ] Oremland was raised in Brooklyn , New York.

[ 1 ] He received his B.S. in biology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1968, where he was inspired by Hermann Ehrlich 's geomicrobiology course to pursue a career in marine microbiology.

[ 2 ] He served as an active duty officer on the USS Utina (ATF-163) in the U.S. Navy .

[ 3 ] In 1976, he received a PhD from the University of Miami under the mentorship of Barrie F. Taylor , where he worked on methane cycling in tropical marine sediments.

[ 4 ] He went on to a postdoc at the NASA Ames Research Center , where he worked with Melvin P. Silverman on sulfate-reducing bacteria . He died of acute leukemia on September 16, 2021, at the age of 74.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Research [ edit ] From 1977 to 2019, Oremland conducted research at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park on the microbial metabolism in extreme environments including Mono Lake . His research focused on the geomicrobiology of acetylene , [ 4 ] selenium , [ 7 ] and arsenic .

[ 8 ] Honors [ edit ] Oremland was an elected fellow of the American Society for Microbiology , American Geophysical Union , International Society for Environmental Biogeochemistry, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science . He was the 2020 recipient of the American Society of Microbiology Award for Environmental Research.
