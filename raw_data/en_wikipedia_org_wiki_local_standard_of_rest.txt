Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details.

( July 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In astronomy , the local standard of rest or LSR is a reference frame which follows the mean motion of material in the Milky Way in the neighborhood of the Sun (stars in radius 100 pc from the Sun), [ 1 ] on average sharing the same velocity around the Milky Way as the Sun.

[ 2 ] The path of this material is not precisely circular.

[ 3 ] The Sun follows the solar circle ( eccentricity e < 0.1) at a speed of about 255 km/s in a clockwise direction when viewed from the galactic north pole at a radius of ≈ 8.34 kpc [ 4 ] about the center of the galaxy near Sgr A* , and has only a slight  motion, towards the solar apex , relative to the LSR.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] LSR could be understood by analogy to a group of cars traveling at similar speed on a highway i.e. at LSR. If a faster car passes by or they pass a slower car then the faster and slower cars could be considered at not traveling at LSR. Typically a large variation of speed in astronomical bodies could be considered as indicator of their extraterrestrial nature. This analogy was used by theoretical physicist Avi Loeb in his 2021 book Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth .

The LSR velocity is  anywhere from 202–241 km/s.

[ 7 ] In 2014, very-long-baseline interferometry observations of maser emission in high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFR) placed tight constraints on combinations of kinematic parameters such as the circular orbit speed of the Sun (Θ 0 + V ☉ = 255.2 ± 5.1 km/s).

[ 4 ] There is significant correlation between the circular motion of the solar circle, the solar peculiar motion , and the predicted counterrotation of star-forming regions.

[ 8 ] Additionally, local estimates of the velocity of the LSR based on stars in the vicinity of the Sun [ 9 ] may potentially yield different results than global estimates derived from motions relative to the Galactic Center .

[ 10 ] See also [ edit ] Comoving coordinates for an example of another convenient astronomical reference frame.
