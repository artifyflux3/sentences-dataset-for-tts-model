[ 1 ] Several liberal political parties have claimed substantial popular support, mainly proved by having representation in the Knesset . While liberalism is usually suspicious of nationalism, Jewish liberals in Israel generally support some form of Zionism . They tend to be more receptive towards a Two-state solution .

Conservative liberals (see General Zionists , Liberal Party ) were founding members of the Likud , the country's main conservative party, while social liberals (see Progressive Party , Independent Liberals ) were integrated in the social-democratic Labor Party . Later on, a long-time liberal, anti-clerical and pro- free market party was Shinui , a member of the Liberal International . More recently, Kadima was a broad liberal and centrist party, integrating politicians from the left and the right.

Current liberal (and liberal Zionist ) parties are Yesh Atid and the Resilience Party ( Blue and White ).

New Hope is a national-liberal party. By contrast, Balad draws upon liberal values in its aim to eliminate discrimination against Arab citizens and redefine Israel as a state for all its citizens rather than a " Jewish and democratic state ", but it is a secular party rather than a liberal one.

מעכשיו אנחנו גם בטוויטר 🙂 אנו שואפים לקדם בישראל חופש בשלושה מובנים: חופש מדיני- סיום השלטון הצבאי ביו"ש. חופש כלכלי- מינימום התערבות ממשלתית. חופש הפרט- החופש של כל אחד לחיות לפי בחירתו בכל המובנים, לפי אורח חייו, אמונתו, מיניותו וכד', כל עוד הוא אינו פוגע ישירות באחר.

[From now on we are also on Twitter 🙂 We strive to promote freedom in Israel in three ways: Political freedom - the end of military rule in Judea and Samaria. Economic freedom - minimum government intervention. The freedom of the individual - the freedom of everyone to live according to his choice in all respects, according to his lifestyle, faith, sexuality, etc., as long as he does not directly harm the other.] ( Tweet ) (in Hebrew) – via Twitter .
