[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He studied medicine with his father. He lived in Marrakesh and Fez and was of Morisco descent. It is probable that he was the author of Hadiqat al-azhar fi mahiyyat al-ushb wa-l-aqqar ( Garden of Flowers in the Explanation of the Character of Herbs and Drugs ), a treatise on pharmacology and botany.

[ 3 ] A hospital in Fez was named after him.

He was sent by the Moroccan Sultan Mulay Zaidan as an envoy to the Low Countries . He was followed in this role by Al-Hajari , and later Yusuf Biscaino .

[ 4 ] Muhammad Alguazir was also the author of an anti-Christian polemical work, Apología contra los artículos de la ley Cristiana , written at the order of Mulay Zaidan.
