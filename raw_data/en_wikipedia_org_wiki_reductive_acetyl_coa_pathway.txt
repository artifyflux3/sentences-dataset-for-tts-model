It is also known as the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A ( acetyl-CoA ) pathway .

[ 1 ] This pathway enables these organisms to use hydrogen ( H 2 ) as an electron donor , and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as an electron acceptor and as a building block to generate acetate for biosynthesis .

In this pathway carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide (CO) and formic acid (HCOOH) or directly into a formyl group (R−CH=O), the formyl group is reduced to a methyl group (−CH 3 ) and then combined with the carbon monoxide and coenzyme A to produce acetyl-CoA. Two specific enzymes participate on the carbon monoxide side of the pathway: CO dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthase . The former catalyzes the reduction of the CO 2 and the latter combines the resulting CO with a methyl group to give acetyl-CoA.

[ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Some anaerobic bacteria use the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in reverse to break down acetate . For example, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) transform acetate completely into CO 2 and H 2 coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide .

[ 4 ] When operating in the reverse direction, the acetyl-CoA synthase is sometimes called acetyl-CoA decarbonylase.

An evolutionarily related but biochemically distinct pathway named the Wolfe Cycle [ 5 ] occurs exclusively in some methanogenic archaea called methanogens .

[ 6 ] In these anaerobic archaea , the Wolfe Cycle functions as a methanogenesis pathway to reduce CO 2 into methane ( CH 4 ) with electron donors such as hydrogen ( H 2 ) and formate (HCOO – ).

[ 7 ] Evolution [ edit ] Relevance to abiogenesis [ edit ] Main article: Iron–sulfur world hypothesis It has been proposed that the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway might have begun at deep sea alkaline hydrothermal vents where metal sulfides and transition metals catalyze the prebiotic reactions of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway.

[ 8 ] Recent experiments have tried to replicate this pathway by attempting to reduce CO 2 , with very little pyruvate observed using native iron (Fe 0 , zerovalent Fe ) as a reducing agent (< 30 μM), [ 9 ] and even less so under hydrothermal settings with H 2 (10 μM).

[ 10 ] Joseph Moran and colleagues state that "it has been proposed that either the complete or “horseshoe” forms of the r TCA cycle may have once been united with the acetyl CoA pathway in an ancestral, possibly prebiotic, carbon fixation network".

[ 9 ] Last universal common ancestor [ edit ] A 2016 study of the genomes of a set of bacteria and archaea suggested that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all cells was using an ancient Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in a hydrothermal setting, [ 11 ] but more recent work challenges this conclusion as they argued that the previous study had "undersampled protein families, resulting in incomplete phylogenetic trees which do not reflect protein family evolution".

[ 12 ] However geological evidence and phylogenomic reconstructions of the metabolic network of the common ancestors of archaea and bacteria support that LUCA fixed CO 2 and relied on H 2 .
