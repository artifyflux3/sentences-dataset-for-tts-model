It is the capital and largest city of Antwerp Province , and the third-largest municipality in Belgium by area at 208.22 km 2 (80.39 sq mi). With a population of 565,039, it is the most populous municipality in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million people, the country's second-largest metropolitan area after Brussels .

[ a ] [ 2 ] Flowing through Antwerp is the river Scheldt . Antwerp is linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 km (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 km (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe after Rotterdam [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and within the top 20 globally . The city is also known as the hub of the world's diamond trade . In 2020, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network rated Antwerp as a Gamma + (third level/top tier) Global City .

[ 5 ] Both economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries , especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt . The Bourse at Antwerp , originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872, was the world's first purpose-built commodity exchange .

[ b ] In 1920, the city hosted the Summer Olympics .

The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren ( Dutch pronunciation: [sɪˈɲoːrə(n)] ), after the Spanish honorific señor or French seigneur , "lord", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century.

[ 8 ] The city's population is very diverse, including about 180 nationalities; as of 2019, more than 50% of its population had a parent that was not a Belgian citizen at birth.

[ 9 ] A notable community is the Jewish one , as Antwerp is one of the only two cities in Europe (together with London and its Stamford Hill neighbourhood) that is home to a considerable Haredi population in the 21st century.

Toponymy [ edit ] Scaldis ("the Scheldt ") and Antverpia ("Antwerp"), Abraham Janssens , 1609, oil on panel, Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp Early recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, [ 10 ] Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), [ 11 ] and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado 's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is Neo-Latin .

[ 12 ] A Germanic ( Frankish or Frisian ) origin could contain prefix anda ("against") and a noun derived from the verb werpen ("to throw") and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit ; a mound (like a terp ) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean "those who live on both banks".

[ 16 ] There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen ("hand-throwing"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river and extracted a toll from passing boatmen. He severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo , who cut off the giant's own hand and flung that into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt .

[ 17 ] [ 10 ] History [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Antwerp .

Pre-1500 [ edit ] Historical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus . Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt river in 1952–1961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from the mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. In the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks .

[ 15 ] The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century.

Het Steen Castle has its origins in the Carolingian period in the 9th century. The castle may have been built after the Viking incursions in the early Middle Ages; in 879 the Normans invaded Flanders. The surviving structure was built between 1200 and 1225 as a gateway to a larger castle of the Dukes of Brabant which was demolished in the 19th century. It is Antwerp's oldest building.

[ 18 ] At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire . Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II , a border province facing the County of Flanders .

In the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096–1099), Godfrey of Bouillon , was originally Margrave of Antwerp , from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087–1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099–1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde , and his son Lionel , the Duke of Clarence , was born there in 1338.

[ 11 ] Grote Markt (main square) 16th century [ edit ] After the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges , Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant , grew in importance, with the city doubling its population between 1500 and 1569.

[ 19 ] At the end of the 15th century, the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510.

[ 11 ] During this time, the old Mediterranean trade routes were gradually losing importance and the discovery of new sea routes via Africa to Asia and via the Atlantic to America helped push Antwerp to a position of prominence.

[ 19 ] By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic . The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, "To the merchants of all nations." [ 20 ] View of Antwerp by Jan Wildens Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly with enslaved Africans as the century progressed.

[ 21 ] The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne .

[ 22 ] Antwerp also had an unusually high number of painters, around 360 in 1560, in a city with a population of roughly 89,000 in 1569 (250 people per painter), it was the most important artistic centre north of the Alps , serving notable painters such as Pieter Bruegel .

[ 19 ] Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544–1574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ceased its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.

[ 23 ] Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became "the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height." [ 24 ] Antwerp had the highest growth rate and was the richest city in Europe at the time.

[ 25 ] [ 19 ] Antwerp's Golden Age is tightly linked to the " Age of Exploration ". During the first half of the 16th century, Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps. Many foreign merchants were resident in the city.

Francesco Guicciardini , the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier "It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas".

[ 26 ] Sack of Antwerp in 1576, in which about 7,000 people died [ 27 ] Without a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreign-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venice , Genoa , Ragusa , Spain and Portugal. Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto- Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.

[ 28 ] Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilizing Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century, Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade.

[ 26 ] The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers. In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically. The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth. Numerous financial bankruptcies began around 1557.

Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.

[ 29 ] Reformation era [ edit ] The religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries . The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma , was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Dutch revolt against Spain broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury : 8,000 citizens were massacred, several houses burnt down, and over £2 million sterling of damage was done.

Dutch revolt [ edit ] View of Antwerp with the frozen Scheldt (1590) by Lucas van Valckenborch Subsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch Revolt . In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza , captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city.

[ 30 ] Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age . Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa , and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.

17th–19th centuries [ edit ] Map of Antwerp (1624) Antwerp and the river Scheldt, photochrom, c.

1890–1900 Antwerp from the left bank of the Scheldt, c.

1890–1900 The recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of Münster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830).

[ 11 ] Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon , realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock), an access-lock and mole , and deepening the Scheldt to allow larger ships to approach Antwerp.

[ 25 ] Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.

[ 31 ] In 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chassé . For a time, Chassé subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832, the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard . During this attack, the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chassé made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832) .

[ 11 ] Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi) from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.

[ 32 ] 20th century [ edit ] The German bombardment of Antwerp , October 1914, by Willy Stöwer Antwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships , in 1903. During World War I , the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Liège . The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice. A few years later, Antwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics .

During World War II , the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany on 18 May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp , which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote , V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic ) Orthodox Judaism .

A Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956–1965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.

[ 33 ] Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London , Milan , New York and Paris . It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.

[ 34 ] Districts [ edit ] Main article: Districts of Antwerp The municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into ten entities (districts): # name surface (km 2 ) inhabitants population density population density in residential areas Flag 1 Antwerp 83.18 198,784 2,390 11,959 2 Berchem 5.70 43,325 7,603 10,717 3 Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo 52.43 9,962 190 3,315 4 Borgerhout 3.90 46,424 11,904 17,026 5 Borsbeek 3.90 10,949 2,800 6 Deurne 13.03 82,270 6,315 11,932 7 Ekeren 13.48 28,720 2,131 4,614 8 Hoboken 10.52 41,352 3,932 8,451 9 Merksem 8.42 45,929 5,457 10,691 10 Wilrijk 13.71 41,916 3,057 7,026 In 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp , the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem , Borgerhout , Deurne , Ekeren , Hoboken , Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.

[ 35 ] The neighboring municipality of Borsbeek declared the intention to become the tenth district of the city of Antwerp. Since January 2025, Borsbeek has been a district of the city of Antwerp.

[ 36 ] With the exception of Ekeren and Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo, all the districts form together one contiguous inhabited area. The former town halls have been converted into district halls and the former town centers are now local main streets within the larger urban agglomeration.

Steen castle on the Scheldt-quai is the gate wing of the demolished castle of the Dukes of Brabant. It was partly reconstructed in the 19th century.

Antwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases: 10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch 12th and 13th century: canals (so called "vlieten" and "ruien") were made 16th century: Spanish fortifications 19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications 20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts Demographics [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Antwerp Antwerp population pyramid in 2022 Historical population [ edit ] Population timeline of Antwerp This is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.

At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic , live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Pinchas Padwa, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth ) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk , based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar , Belz , Bobov , Ger , Skver , Klausenburg , Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth , chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.

[ citation needed ] Jain community [ edit ] Jain temple in Wilrijk Main article: Jainism in Belgium The Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business.

[ 58 ] Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds.

[ 59 ] A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk). Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.

[ citation needed ] Armenian community [ edit ] Main article: Armenians in Belgium Significant Armenian communities reside in Antwerp, many of whom are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church , while a smaller number are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church .

One of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel at and are involved in is the diamond trade business, [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] that based primarily in the diamond district .

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.

[ 67 ] Economy [ edit ] Port Authority Building Bevrijdingsdok [ nl ] terminal at the Port of Antwerp Port [ edit ] According to the American Association of Port Authorities , the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest port in the world in 2005 (by tonnage), and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo , as well as bulk cargo . Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries , are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston , Texas.

[ 68 ] Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel , a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014–2020.

[ 69 ] The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping .

[ citation needed ] Diamonds [ edit ] Antwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district .

[ 70 ] 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, [ 71 ] and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion.

[ 72 ] The city has four diamond bourses : the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel.

[ 73 ] Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, [ 71 ] with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers.

[ 74 ] Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian [ 75 ] and Maronite Christians from Lebanon and Armenian , [ 64 ] traders become increasingly important.

[ 75 ] The district was the site of the 2003 Antwerp diamond heist , the largest diamond theft of all time.

Antwerp World Diamond Centre , (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant , plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry.

[ 76 ] In recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.

[ 77 ] The industry has avoided the 2022 European sanctions against Russia although the imports from Alrosa have diminished.
If banned, the AWDC claims 10,000 jobs would be at risk.

( February 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Rail [ edit ] Antwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international and Thalys trains to Amsterdam , Rotterdam and Paris , and national trains to Ghent , Bruges , Ostend , Brussels , Charleroi , Hasselt , Liège , Leuven and Turnhout .

Antwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald 's novel Austerlitz . Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 km (1 mi) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.

Antwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and the second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.

Local public transport [ edit ] The city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 14 lines, of which the underground section is called the " premetro " and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines. However, there has been an evolution to end regional lines at transportation hubs more outward of the city center, such as Zuid and Luchtbal.

Road [ edit ] A six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the "Ring" it offers motorway connections to Brussels , Hasselt and Liège , Ghent , Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).

Daily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the " Oosterweelconnection " being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper ) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.

[ citation needed ] In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg , Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built-up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port-related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.

[ citation needed ] In 2017 it was finally decided to complete the ringway of Antwerp with a new tunnel crossing the Scheldt. In a compromise with civil society, it has equally been decided that the ringway will in the long term completely be covered. This compromise is called the Toekomstverbond ("Agreement for the future"). Part of the same agreement is that highways further away from the city center will be further developed and that the number of motorized trips in all transportation should be reduced to 50%.

Many FlixBus es have a stop at the central Franklin Rooseveltplaats.

Air [ edit ] Antwerp International Airport A small airport, Antwerp International Airport , is located in the district of Deurne . The airport is mainly used for business travel. Flying Group, the largest business jet service in Benelux and France, has its headquarters there and several maintenance sheds and hangars for their private jets. There are also some regularly scheduled flights by TUI fly with direct connectivity to Spain, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Morocco.

Sky Alps operates a 2-3x weekly connection to Bolzano Airport . A bus service connects the airport to the city centre. The runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.

Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport , is about 45 km (28 mi) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.

There is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport , which runs twice per hour on working days.

Water [ edit ] Since 2017 there has been a regular water ferry halting at the city center, connecting it with towns up and down the river Scheldt from Kruibeke to Lillo. This service is called DeWaterbus . It is popular with both commuting port laborers and cyclist making a day trip.

Politics [ edit ] City council [ edit ] The current city council was elected in the 2024 local elections , with its governing coalition consisting of the parties New Flemish Alliance and Vooruit , led by acting mayor Els van Doesburg (N-VA).
