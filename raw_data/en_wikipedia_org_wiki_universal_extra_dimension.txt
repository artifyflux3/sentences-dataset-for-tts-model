 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Concept in particle physics

In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), models with **universal extra dimensions** include one or more spatial dimensions beyond the three spatial and one temporal dimensions that are observed.

Overview
--------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_extra_dimensions&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")]

Models with universal extra dimensions, studied in 2001[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_extra_dimension#cite_note-1) assume that all fields propagate universally in the extra dimensions; in contrast, the [ADD model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_extra_dimension "Large extra dimension") requires that the fields of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") be confined to a four-dimensional membrane, while only gravity propagates in the extra dimensions.

The universal extra dimensions are assumed to be compactified with radii much larger than the traditional Planck length, although smaller than in the ADD model, ~10−18 m.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_extra_dimension#cite_note-2) Generically, the—so far unobserved—Kaluza–Klein resonances of the Standard Model fields in such a theory would appear at an energy scale that is directly related to the inverse size ("compactification scale") of the extra dimension,

M KK≈R−1.{\displaystyle M_{\text{KK}}\approx R^{-1}.}![Image 17: {\displaystyle M_{\text{KK}}\approx R^{-1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/588d811257555f7636c7749d7d768cd8fea4f1fe)

The experimental bounds (based on [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider "Large Hadron Collider") data) on the compactification scale of one or two universal extra dimensions are about 1 TeV.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_extra_dimension#cite_note-3) Other bounds come from [electroweak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak "Electroweak") precision measurements at the Z pole, the [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon")'s [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment"), and limits on flavor-changing neutral currents, and reach several hundred GeV. Using universal extra dimensions to explain dark matter yields an upper limit on the compactification scale of several TeV.
