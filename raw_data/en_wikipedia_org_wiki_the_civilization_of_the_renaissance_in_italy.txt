The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy ( German : Die Cultur der Renaissance in Italien ) is an 1860 work on the Italian Renaissance by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt . Together with his History of the Renaissance in Italy ( Die Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien ; 1867) it is counted among the classics of Renaissance historiography .  An English translation was produced by S.G.C. Middlemore in two volumes, London 1878.

Content [ edit ] According to Denys Hay : Burckhardt sought to capture and define the spirit of the age in all its main manifestations. For him ‘’Kultur’’ was the whole picture: politics, manners, religion...the character that animated the particular activities of a people in a given epoch, and of which pictures, buildings, social and political habits, literature, are the concrete expressions.

[ 1 ] Its scholarly judgements are considered to have been largely justified by subsequent research according to historians including Desmond Seward and art historians such as Kenneth Clark .

[ citation needed ] The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy is divided into six parts: Part One: The State as a Work of Art Part Two: The Development of the Individual Part Three: The Revival of Antiquity Part Four: The Discovery of the World and of Man Part Five: Society and Festivals Part Six: Morality and Religion Editions [ edit ] 1878.
