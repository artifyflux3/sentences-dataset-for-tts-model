Most islands are sparsely populated, with some being barren, and some utilized for communication, military, or as ship docks . Some of the islands in the Persian Gulf are artificially constructed islands. The artificial islands often serve as tourist resorts, housing developments, or hotels. Despite their small sizes, some of these artificial islands have caused serious hazards for the already fragile ecosystem of the Gulf and its dwindling wildlife mass. A few of the Gulf islands are also historically significant, having been utilized by the ancient empires, neighboring kingdoms, and in the recent times, colonial powers such as the British Empire , and the Portuguese Empire . Recent globalization, and discovery of oil, has made some of the Persian Gulf islands very significant for developed nations as a source of oil and raw industrial material. Recent wars, and political unrest has also made these islands strategic military locations for foreign powers from America and Europe .

Some islands in the Persian Gulf are nations themselves; Bahrain , an independent Gulf state , is the only gulf country that is also an island.
