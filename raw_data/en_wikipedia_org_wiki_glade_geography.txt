[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Glades are often grassy meadows under the canopy of deciduous trees such as red alder or quaking aspen in western North America . They also represent openings in forests where local conditions such as avalanches , poor soils, or fire damage have created semipermanent clearings. They are very important to herbivorous animals, such as deer and elk , for forage and denning activities.

Sometimes the word is used in a looser sense, as in the treeless wetlands of the Everglades of Florida . In the central United States , calcareous glades occur with rocky, prairie -like habitats in areas of shallow soil.

Glades are characterized by unique plant and animal communities that are adapted to harsh and dry conditions.
