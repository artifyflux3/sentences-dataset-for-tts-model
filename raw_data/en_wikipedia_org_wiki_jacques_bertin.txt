This monumental work, based on his experience as a cartographer and geographer, represents the first and widest intent to provide a theoretical foundation to Information Visualization , [ 2 ] with his most lasting contribution being his set of visual variables that can be used to construct map symbols and other graphical techniques one of then being the Bertin Projection , an innovative map projection type, or to seriate them (the Bertin Matrix).

Bertin (1953) map projection Biography [ edit ] Jacques Bertin was born in 1918 in Maisons-Laffitte , Yvelines . When he was 10, he received the first prize of cartography at primary school.
