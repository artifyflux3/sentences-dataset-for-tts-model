[ 1 ] Evidence for intergalactic dust has been suggested as early as 1949, and study of it grew throughout the late 20th century.

[ 1 ] There are large variations in the distribution of intergalactic dust.

[ 1 ] Dust may affect intergalactic distance measurements, such as supernovae and quasars in other galaxies.

[ 2 ] Partially due to the dust's absorption and re-emission of visible light, observations of more distant astronomical objects have greater apparent magnitude when conducted in infrared .

[ 3 ] Intergalactic dust can form intergalactic dust clouds , known since the 1960s to exist around some galaxies.

[ 1 ] By the 1980s, at least four intergalactic dust clouds had been discovered within several megaparsecs of the Milky Way galaxy, [ 1 ] exemplified by the Okroy Cloud .
