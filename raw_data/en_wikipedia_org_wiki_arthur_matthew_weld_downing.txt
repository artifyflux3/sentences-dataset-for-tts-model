In one paper, he worked with George Johnstone Stoney on the perturbations of the Leonid meteors , predicting and explaining the sparseness of the 1899 shower.

[ 1 ] He became superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office from 1891 until his retirement in 1910. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1896. He collaborated with his American counterpart Simon Newcomb in establishing an international standard for astronomical constants .

[ 1 ] Downing was one of the founders of the British Astronomical Association , and was an ardent supporter during its early years. Through this work he gave significant support to amateur astronomy, serving as vice president (1890–1891) and later president (1892–1894) of the Association.
