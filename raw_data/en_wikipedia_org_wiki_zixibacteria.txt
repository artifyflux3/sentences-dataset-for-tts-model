[ 1 ] It is a member of the FCB group [ 2 ] Zixibacteria was proposed as a bacterial phylum following the recovery of a genome from representative RBG-1.

[ 1 ] This genome was recovered using genome-resolved metagenomics from sediment samples of an aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River (CO, USA) and was suggestive of metabolically versatility, which is presumably requisite for life in a rapidly changing environment such as aquifer sediments [ 1 ] Since being proposed as a phylum in 2013, members of the Zixibacteria phylum have been detected in a variety of other environments (sometimes retroactively), including subsurface sediments (WA, USA), [ 3 ] estuary water (NC, USA), [ 4 ] moonmilk cave deposits (Comblain-au-Pont, Belgium), [ 5 ] and deep subsurface fracture fluids from a gold mine (SD, USA) [ 6 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c Castelle, Cindy J.; Hug, Laura A.; Wrighton, Kelly C.; Thomas, Brian C.; Williams, Kenneth H.; Wu, Dongying; Tringe, Susannah G.; Singer, Steven W.; Eisen, Jonathan A.; Banfield, Jillian F.
