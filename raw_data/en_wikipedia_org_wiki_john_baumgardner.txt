The reason given is: Mostly this article cites creationist sources. Could use more mainstream citation.

.

Please help by adding reliable sources .

Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately from the article and its talk page, especially if potentially libelous .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Baumgardner earned a B.S.

from Texas Tech University in 1968, a M.S.

from Princeton University in 1970, and a Ph.D.

in geophysics and space physics from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1983.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and in 2002 joined the staff of the Institute for Creation Research .

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] As a professional scientist, Baumgardner is known for developing TERRA, a finite element code designed to solve problems in mantle convection .

[ 6 ] In 1994 he presented research at a geophysics conference stating that the slip-sliding geologic plates that cover the Earth might once have moved thousands of times faster than they do today.

[ 2 ] In 1997, U.S. News & World Report described him as "the world's pre-eminent expert in the design of computer models for geophysical convection".

[ 3 ] Baumgardner is a Christian who sometimes pursues creationist research. He has, for example, created a computer simulation called Terra to model the Noachian flood .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] In 1985, Baumgardner joined the amateur adventurer Ron Wyatt and salvage expert David Fasold to Durupınar, Turkey , for an expedition recounted in Fasold's The Ark of Noah to locate the biblical ship's remains.

[ 7 ] Baumgardner did not support Wyatt's and Fasold's claims to have found a boat-shaped 'object' which was the Ark. He argued that the object was a natural formation.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Select publications [ edit ] According to Web of Science , he has published 20 peer-reviewed papers, including: Baumgardner, John R. (1 June 1985).
