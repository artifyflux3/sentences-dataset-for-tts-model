**Classical mechanics** is a [physical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") describing the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") of objects such as [projectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile "Projectile"), parts of [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_(mechanical) "Machine (mechanical)"), [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets "Planets"), [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), and [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxies "Galaxies"). The development of classical mechanics involved [substantial change in the methods and philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") of physics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-1) The qualifier _classical_ distinguishes this type of mechanics from physics developed after the [revolutions in physics of the early 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics#20th_century:_birth_of_modern_physics "History of physics"), all of which revealed limitations in classical mechanics.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-2)

The earliest formulation of classical mechanics is often referred to as [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics"). It consists of the physical concepts based on the 17th century foundational works of Sir [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), and the mathematical methods invented by Newton, [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"), [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") and others to describe the motion of [bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") under the influence of [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"). Later, methods based on [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") were developed by Euler, [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange"), [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") and others, leading to the development of [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics") (which includes [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") and [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics")). These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extended beyond earlier works; they are, with some modification, used in all areas of modern physics.

If the present state of an object that obeys the laws of classical mechanics is known, it is possible to [determine how it will move in the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"), and how it has moved in the past. [Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") shows that the long term predictions of classical mechanics are not reliable. Classical mechanics provides accurate results when studying objects that are not extremely massive and have speeds not approaching the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). With objects about the size of an atom's diameter, it becomes necessary to use [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). To describe velocities approaching the speed of light, [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") is needed. In cases where objects become extremely massive, [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") becomes applicable. Some modern sources include [relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mechanics "Relativistic mechanics") in classical physics, as representing the field in its most developed and accurate form.

### Traditional division

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Traditional division")]

Classical mechanics was traditionally divided into three main branches. _[Statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics")_ is the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of force and torque acting on a physical system that does not experience an acceleration, but rather is in [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") with its environment.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Wright-3)_[Kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics")_ describes the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") of points, [bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object") (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") that cause them to move.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Whittaker-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Beggs-5)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Wright-3) Kinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the "geometry of motion" and is occasionally seen as a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-8)[_Dynamics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") goes beyond merely describing objects' behavior and also considers the forces which explain it. Some authors (for example, Taylor (2005)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Taylor-9) and Greenwood (1997)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Greenwood-10)) include [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") within classical dynamics.

Another division is based on the choice of mathematical formalism. Classical mechanics can be mathematically presented in multiple different ways. The physical content of these different formulations is the same, but they provide different insights and facilitate different types of calculations. While the term "Newtonian mechanics" is sometimes used as a synonym for non-relativistic classical physics, it can also refer to a particular formalism based on [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"). Newtonian mechanics in this sense emphasizes force as a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(physics) "Vector (physics)") quantity.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Lanczos-11)

In contrast, [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics "Analytical mechanics") uses _[scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar\_(physics) "Scalar (physics)")_ properties of motion representing the system as a whole—usually its [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy"). The [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") are derived from the scalar quantity by some underlying principle about the scalar's [variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"). Two dominant branches of analytical mechanics are [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics"), which uses generalized coordinates and corresponding generalized velocities in [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") space (the tangent bundle of the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") and sometimes called "state space"), and [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"), which uses coordinates and corresponding momenta in [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") (the [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") of the configuration space). Both formulations are equivalent by a [Legendre transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation#Hamilton%E2%80%93Lagrange_mechanics "Legendre transformation") on the generalized coordinates, velocities and momenta; therefore, both contain the same information for describing the dynamics of a system. There are other formulations such as [Hamilton–Jacobi theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_theory "Hamilton–Jacobi theory"), [Routhian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routhian_mechanics "Routhian mechanics"), and [Appell's equation of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appell%27s_equation_of_motion "Appell's equation of motion"). All equations of motion for particles and fields, in any formalism, can be derived from the widely applicable result called the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action "Principle of least action"). One result is [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem"), a statement which connects [conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law "Conservation law") to their associated [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics) "Symmetry (physics)").

### By region of application

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: By region of application")]

Alternatively, a division can be made by region of application:

*   [Celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), relating to [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") and other celestial bodies
*   [Continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics "Continuum mechanics"), for materials modelled as a continuum, e.g., [solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid") and [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") (i.e., [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid") and [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas")).
*   [Relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mechanics "Relativistic mechanics") (i.e. including the [special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") theories of relativity), for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light.
*   [Statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"), which provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk [thermodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") properties of materials.

Description of objects and their motion
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Description of objects and their motion")]

[![Image 2: diagram of parabolic projectile motion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Tir_parab%C3%B2lic.svg/250px-Tir_parab%C3%B2lic.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tir_parab%C3%B2lic.svg)

The analysis of [projectile motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion "Projectile motion") is a part of classical mechanics.

For simplicity, classical mechanics often models real-world objects as [point particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle"), that is, objects with negligible size. The motion of a point particle is determined by a small number of [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter"): its position, [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), and the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") applied to it. Classical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-pointlike objects. [Euler's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_laws "Euler's laws") provide extensions to Newton's laws in this area. The concepts of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") rely on the same [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") used to describe one-dimensional motion. The [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_equation "Rocket equation") extends the notion of rate of change of an object's momentum to include the effects of an object "losing mass". (These generalizations/extensions are derived from Newton's laws, say, by decomposing a solid body into a collection of points.)

In reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a [non-zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)") size. (The behavior of _very_ small particles, such as the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), is more accurately described by [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").) Objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles, because of the additional [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)"), e.g., a [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(ball) "Baseball (ball)") can [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") while it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as [composite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/composite "wikt:composite") objects, made of a large number of collectively acting point particles. The [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of a composite object behaves like a point particle.

Classical mechanics assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also [Action at a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance "Action at a distance")).

The _position_ of a [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle") is defined in relation to a [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") called the origin _O_. A simple coordinate system might describe the position of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle")_P_ with a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") notated by an arrow labeled **r** that points from the origin _O_ to point _P_. In general, the point particle does not need to be stationary relative to _O_. In cases where _P_ is moving relative to _O_, **r** is defined as a function of _t_, [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"). In pre-Einstein relativity (known as [Galilean relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_relativity "Galilean relativity")), time is considered an absolute, i.e., the [time interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_interval "Time interval") that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-12) In addition to relying on [absolute time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_time "Absolute time"), classical mechanics assumes [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") for the structure of space.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-13)

The _[velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")_, or the [rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") of displacement with time, is defined as the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the position with respect to time:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92a7d2f19f00b2972ba90635da426701bbd94bc6).
In classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For example, if one car travels east at 60 km/h and passes another car traveling in the same direction at 50 km/h, the slower car perceives the faster car as traveling east at 60 − 50 = 10 km/h. However, from the perspective of the faster car, the slower car is moving 10 km/h to the west, often denoted as −10 km/h where the sign implies opposite direction. Velocities are directly additive as [vector quantities](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_with_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar_and_Vector_Quantities "b:Physics with Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar and Vector Quantities"); they must be dealt with using [vector analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_analysis "Vector analysis").

Mathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector **u** = _u_**d** and the velocity of the second object by the vector **v** = _v_**e**, where _u_ is the speed of the first object, _v_ is the speed of the second object, and **d** and **e** are [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") in the directions of motion of each object respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '=\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cc94c55ea3e6a065dc748237bd10b4d8f07622e)
Similarly, the first object sees the velocity of the second object as:

![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v'} =\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {u} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bb53f1542de511363cac3689c5f8428b17eb614)
When both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be simplified to:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '=(u-v)\mathbf {d} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1624c018b5557d9536c0744f65cfc4dadaea77d)
Or, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle u'=u-v\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8018d62fee8045158d13ba81e7e1effe8c4d2d86)
The _[acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration")_, or rate of change of velocity, is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the velocity with respect to time (the [second derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the position with respect to time):

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}={\mathrm {d^{2}} \mathbf {r}  \over \mathrm {d} t^{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d60f14ca073ab34f4e95288db447b05a9b8f7311)
Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time. Velocity can change in magnitude, direction, or both. Occasionally, a decrease in the magnitude of velocity "_v_" is referred to as _deceleration_, but generally any change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is referred to as acceleration.

#### Frames of reference

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Frames of reference")]

While the position, velocity and acceleration of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") can be described with respect to any [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(special_relativity) "Observer (special relativity)") in any state of motion, classical mechanics assumes the existence of a special family of [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") in which the mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form. These special reference frames are called [inertial frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frames "Inertial frames"). An inertial frame is an idealized frame of reference within which an object with zero net force acting upon it moves with a constant velocity; that is, it is either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. In an inertial frame Newton's law of motion, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle F=ma}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ca4e42b7d6d66f52294364928cb5f7c590f514c), is valid.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Goldstein-14): 185

[Non-inertial reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-inertial_reference_frame "Non-inertial reference frame") accelerate in relation to another inertial frame. A body rotating with respect to an inertial frame is not an inertial frame.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Goldstein-14) When viewed from an inertial frame, particles in the non-inertial frame appear to move in ways not explained by forces from existing fields in the reference frame. Hence, it appears that there are other forces that enter the equations of motion solely as a result of the relative acceleration. These forces are referred to as [fictitious forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force"), inertia forces, or pseudo-forces.

Consider two [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_frames "Reference frames")_S_ and S'. For observers in each of the reference frames an event has space-time coordinates of (_x_,_y_,_z_,_t_) in frame _S_ and (x',y',z',t') in frame S'. Assuming time is measured the same in all reference frames, if we require _x_ = x' when _t_ = 0, then the relation between the space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames S' and _S_, which are moving at a relative velocity _u_ in the _x_ direction, is:

![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x-tu,\\y'&=y,\\z'&=z,\\t'&=t.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86e7c53d56693e48081903d4ca1085b88b88fb54)
This set of formulas defines a [group transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_transformation "Group transformation") known as the [Galilean transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation") (informally, the _Galilean transform_). This group is a limiting case of the [Poincaré group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group "Poincaré group") used in [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). The limiting case applies when the velocity _u_ is very small compared to _c_, the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light").

The transformations have the following consequences:

*   **v**′ = **v** − **u** (the velocity **v**′ of a particle from the perspective of _S_′ is slower by **u** than its velocity **v** from the perspective of _S_)
*   **a**′ = **a** (the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*   **F**′ = **F** (the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*   the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") is not a constant in classical mechanics, nor does the special position given to the speed of light in [relativistic mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mechanics "Relativistic mechanics") have a counterpart in classical mechanics.

For some problems, it is convenient to use rotating coordinates (reference frames). Thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame, or introduce additionally a fictitious [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force_(fictitious) "Centrifugal force (fictitious)") and [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force "Coriolis force").

Newtonian mechanics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Newtonian mechanics")]

A force in physics is any action that causes an object's velocity to change; that is, to accelerate. A force originates from within a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)"), such as an electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges), or gravitational field (caused by mass), among others.

[Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") was the first to mathematically express the relationship between [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"). Some physicists interpret [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law") as a definition of force and mass, while others consider it a fundamental postulate, a law of nature.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-15) Either interpretation has the same mathematical consequences, historically known as "Newton's second law":

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p}  \over \mathrm {d} t}={\mathrm {d} (m\mathbf {v} ) \over \mathrm {d} t}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/778c72a4b2dece458119de6b9b52e67abfd59e39)
The quantity _m_**v** is called the ([canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_momentum "Canonical momentum")) [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"). The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. Since the definition of acceleration is **a** = d**v**/d _t_, the second law can be written in the simplified and more familiar form:

![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8dc269e16348cc89ff75d9516ea7cfba7731e5e)
So long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation"), which is called the _equation of motion_.

As an example, assume that friction is the only force acting on the particle, and that it may be modeled as a function of the velocity of the particle, for example:

![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\rm {R}}=-\lambda \mathbf {v} \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dca3bb72778add17acc29fa26fa28e491949cfd6)
where _λ_ is a positive constant, the negative sign states that the force is opposite the sense of the velocity. Then the equation of motion is

![Image 14: {\displaystyle -\lambda \mathbf {v} =m\mathbf {a} =m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7073fe3f53a72a97348c35f68007ddd0c5e003fb)
This can be [integrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative") to obtain

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {v} _{0}e^{{-\lambda t}/{m}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/956862d2f1f16e86e6e1cbc603d968ce8101ae1b)
where **v**0 is the initial velocity. This means that the velocity of this particle [decays exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay "Exponential decay") to zero as time progresses. In this case, an equivalent viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction (which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy")), and the particle is slowing down. This expression can be further integrated to obtain the position **r** of the particle as a function of time.

Important forces include the [gravitational force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") and the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") for [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). In addition, [Newton's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_third_law "Newton's third law") can sometimes be used to deduce the forces acting on a particle: if it is known that particle _A_ exerts a force **F** on another particle _B_, it follows that _B_ must exert an equal and opposite _reaction force_, −**F**, on _A_. The strong form of Newton's third law requires that **F** and −**F** act along the line connecting _A_ and _B_, while the weak form does not. Illustrations of the weak form of Newton's third law are often found for magnetic forces.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

If a constant force **F** is applied to a particle that makes a displacement Δ**r**,[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-16) the _work done_ by the force is defined as the [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") of the force and displacement vectors:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1c00fa8d1dc4ff11544e8a53580eea0e3140460)
More generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle moves from **r**1 to **r**2 along a path _C_, the work done on the particle is given by the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral")

![Image 17: {\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e348ec36240e84e6e941288fc9e4456321c67857)
If the work done in moving the particle from **r**1 to **r**2 is the same no matter what path is taken, the force is said to be [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). [Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") is a conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized [spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device) "Spring (device)"), as given by [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law "Hooke's law"). The force due to [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction") is non-conservative.

The [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy")_E_ k of a particle of mass _m_ travelling at speed _v_ is given by

![Image 18: {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {k} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/37fdbdcc4d6eecf5020be8b1b89501455448b0f8)
For extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.

The [work–energy theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93energy_theorem "Work–energy theorem") states that for a particle of constant mass _m_, the total work _W_ done on the particle as it moves from position **r**1 to **r**2 is equal to the change in [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy")_E_ k of the particle:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle W=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }=E_{\mathrm {k_{2}} }-E_{\mathrm {k_{1}} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}m\left(v_{2}^{\,2}-v_{1}^{\,2}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9d80ed5cee5b41df1249b7c27b4a3f28973d853)
Conservative forces can be expressed as the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of a scalar function, known as the [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") and denoted _E_ p:

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46a51cf0584c83189ac2f83d9ab41bec28dfb410)
If all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and _E_ p is the total potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies corresponding to each force

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36522d278cbaaed0dbffb3cf2f332589076e65b9)
The decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic energy

![Image 22: {\displaystyle -\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }\Rightarrow \Delta (E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} })=0\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdc2b29443d2a7bef0e623a0cb59a25e038b3ac9)
This result is known as _conservation of energy_ and states that the total [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"),

![Image 23: {\displaystyle \sum E=E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} }\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4ce2a847aec2c86d4e6419bd982adbc666758c02)
is constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered forces are conservative.

Lagrangian mechanics
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Lagrangian mechanics")]

[Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") is a formulation of classical mechanics founded on the [stationary-action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action_principle "Stationary-action principle") (also known as the principle of least action). It was introduced by the Italian-French mathematician and astronomer [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange") in his presentation to the Turin Academy of Science in 1760[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-17) culminating in his 1788 grand opus, _[Mécanique analytique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9canique\_analytique "Mécanique analytique")_. Lagrangian mechanics describes a mechanical system as a pair ![Image 24: {\textstyle (M,L)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fc409055f0960592f2dc1e3d80263fd62af469f) consisting of a [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)")![Image 25: {\textstyle M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/913ace920108f7552777e36ac0b7ee3f5093a088) and a smooth function ![Image 26: {\textstyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fb88de7e4d31737dae8f02575033272f29e6720) within that space called a Lagrangian. For many systems, ![Image 27: {\textstyle L=T-V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc3468e5ecce3f1b9eb4d80d76ce04bcf70421b2) where ![Image 28: {\textstyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db299e88e5485f250f4ba15530469c8c6080a8cb) and ![Image 29: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) are the [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") and [potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy") energy of the system, respectively. The stationary action principle requires that the [action functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)#Action_(functional) "Action (physics)") of the system derived from ![Image 30: {\textstyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fb88de7e4d31737dae8f02575033272f29e6720) must remain at a stationary point (a [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_and_minimum "Maximum and minimum"), [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_and_minimum "Maximum and minimum"), or [saddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point "Saddle point")) throughout the time evolution of the system. This constraint allows the calculation of the equations of motion of the system using Lagrange's equations.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-18)

Hamiltonian mechanics
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Hamiltonian mechanics")]

[Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") emerged in 1833 as a reformulation of [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics"). Introduced by [Sir William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Rowan_Hamilton "Sir William Rowan Hamilton"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-19) Hamiltonian mechanics replaces (generalized) velocities ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\dot {q}}^{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a27052baf4d640bd44a642d1f450ea3819a2b4ff) used in Lagrangian mechanics with (generalized) _momenta_. Both theories provide interpretations of classical mechanics and describe the same physical phenomena. Hamiltonian mechanics has a close relationship with geometry (notably, [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry") and [Poisson structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_structure "Poisson structure")) and serves as a link between classical and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").

In this formalism, the dynamics of a system are governed by Hamilton's equations, which express the time derivatives of position and momentum variables in terms of [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") of a function called the Hamiltonian: ![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {q}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial {\boldsymbol {p}}}},\quad {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial {\boldsymbol {q}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64a55e53153f6ed6319f1f8c388e88fcf313dd2a) The Hamiltonian is the [Legendre transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transform "Legendre transform") of the Lagrangian, and in many situations of physical interest it is equal to the total energy of the system.

[![Image 33: two by two chart of mechanics for size by speed](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Modernphysicsfields_2.svg/500px-Modernphysicsfields_2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modernphysicsfields_2.svg)

Domain of validity for classical mechanics

Many branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms; two of the most accurate being [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and relativistic [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). [Geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics") is an approximation to the [quantum theory of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics "Quantum optics"), and does not have a superior "classical" form.

When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") (QFT) is of use. QFT deals with small distances, and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction. When treating large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") becomes useful. Statistical mechanics describes the behavior of large (but countable) numbers of particles and their interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level. Statistical mechanics is mainly used in [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") for systems that lie outside the bounds of the assumptions of classical thermodynamics. In the case of high [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") objects approaching the speed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). In case that objects become extremely heavy (i.e., their [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius "Schwarzschild radius") is not negligibly small for a given application), deviations from [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics") become apparent and can be quantified by using the [parameterized post-Newtonian formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism "Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism"). In that case, [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") (GR) becomes applicable. However, until now there is no theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity") unifying GR and QFT in the sense that it could be used when objects become extremely small and heavy.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-Hamber_2009-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-5)

### Newtonian approximation to special relativity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Newtonian approximation to special relativity")]

In special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by

![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m\mathbf {v} }{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad7ef6e1590c4dd00c12d2cde7168fd29fe439a9)
where _m_ is the particle's rest mass, **v** its velocity, _v_ is the modulus of **v**, and _c_ is the speed of light.

If _v_ is very small compared to _c_, _v_ 2/_c_ 2 is approximately zero, and so

![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \approx m\mathbf {v} \,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82fe45bbd6b2c8be946c98a01df3b5588b4e1ad8)
Thus the Newtonian equation **p** = _m_**v** is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.

For example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a [cyclotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron "Cyclotron"), [gyrotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrotron "Gyrotron"), or high voltage [magnetron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetron "Magnetron") is given by

![Image 36: {\displaystyle f=f_{\mathrm {c} }{\frac {m_{0}}{m_{0}+{\frac {T}{c^{2}}}}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1488fc3c02e8e4ecea7e9c71ec8c77c4f420c604)
where _f_ c is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle) with kinetic energy _T_ and ([rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass "Invariant mass")) mass _m_ 0 circling in a magnetic field. The (rest) mass of an electron is 511 keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11 kV direct current accelerating voltage.

### Classical approximation to quantum mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_mechanics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Classical approximation to quantum mechanics")]

The ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the [de Broglie wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie_wavelength "De Broglie wavelength") is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system. For non-relativistic particles, this wavelength is

![Image 37: {\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ba64e374ccd3f05ca8b646070a27e94a2b28921)
where _h_ is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") and _p_ is the momentum.

Again, this happens with [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons") before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by [Clinton Davisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Davisson "Clinton Davisson") and [Lester Germer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Germer "Lester Germer") in 1927, accelerated by 54 V, had a wavelength of 0.167 nm, which was long enough to exhibit a single [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction")[side lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_lobe "Side lobe") when reflecting from the face of a nickel [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") with atomic spacing of 0.215 nm. With a larger [vacuum chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_chamber "Vacuum chamber"), it would seem relatively easy to increase the [angular resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution "Angular resolution") from around a radian to a [milliradian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliradian "Milliradian") and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") computer memory.

More practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering scale are conduction by [quantum tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling "Quantum tunneling") in [tunnel diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_diode "Tunnel diode") and very narrow [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor")[gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_(transistor) "Gate (transistor)") in [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit").

Classical mechanics is the same extreme [high frequency approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency_approximation "High frequency approximation") as [geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics"). It is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with [rest mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass"). These have more momentum and therefore shorter De Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same kinetic energies.

The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"). The development of classical mechanics lead to the development of many areas of mathematics.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-20): 54

Some [Greek philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophers "Greek philosophers") of antiquity, among them [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), founder of [Aristotelian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics "Aristotelian physics"), may have been the first to maintain the idea that "everything happens for a reason" and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") and controlled [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment"), as we know it. These later became decisive factors in forming modern science, and their early application came to be known as classical mechanics. In his _Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum_, medieval mathematician [Jordanus de Nemore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanus_de_Nemore "Jordanus de Nemore") introduced the concept of "positional [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity")" and the use of component [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces "Forces").

[![Image 38: a diagram of Theory of impetus of Albert of Saxony with a b c d](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Theory_of_impetus.svg/250px-Theory_of_impetus.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Theory_of_impetus.svg)

Three stage [Theory of impetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_impetus "Theory of impetus") according to [Albert of Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_of_Saxony_(philosopher) "Albert of Saxony (philosopher)")

The first published [causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal "Causal") explanation of the motions of [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets "Planets") was Johannes Kepler's _[Astronomia nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia\_nova "Astronomia nova"),_ published in 1609. He concluded, based on [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe")'s observations on the orbit of [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), that the planet's orbits were [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"). This break with [ancient thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_philosophy "Ancient philosophy") was happening around the same time that [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the [tower of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa "Leaning Tower of Pisa"), showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of that particular experiment is disputed, but he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an [inclined plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane "Inclined plane"). His theory of accelerated motion was derived from the results of such experiments and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics. In 1673 [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") described in his _[Horologium Oscillatorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horologium\_Oscillatorium "Horologium Oscillatorium")_ the first two [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-21) The work is also the first modern treatise in which a physical problem (the [accelerated motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") of a falling body) is [idealized by a set of parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") then analyzed mathematically and constitutes one of the seminal works of [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#cite_note-:0-22)

[![Image 39: portrait of Isaac Newton with long hair looking left](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Portrait_of_Sir_Isaac_Newton%2C_1689.jpg/250px-Portrait_of_Sir_Isaac_Newton%2C_1689.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_Sir_Isaac_Newton,_1689.jpg)

Sir [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") (1643–1727), an influential figure in the history of physics and whose [three laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") form the basis of classical mechanics

Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"): the [law of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_inertia "Law of inertia"), his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of [action and reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_and_reaction "Action and reaction"); and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_. Here they are distinguished from earlier attempts at explaining similar phenomena, which were either incomplete, incorrect, or given little accurate mathematical expression. Newton also enunciated the principles of [conservation of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_momentum "Conservation of momentum") and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"). In mechanics, Newton was also the first to provide the first correct scientific and mathematical formulation of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") in [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"). The combination of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provides the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics. He demonstrated that these laws apply to everyday objects as well as to celestial objects. In particular, he obtained a theoretical explanation of [Kepler's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws "Kepler's laws") of motion of the planets.

Newton had previously invented the [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"); however, the _Principia_ was formulated entirely in terms of long-established geometric methods in emulation of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"). Newton, and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of [Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens"), worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena, including [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light"), in the form of [geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics"). Even when discovering the so-called [Newton's rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings "Newton's rings") (a [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference "Wave interference") phenomenon) he maintained his own [corpuscular theory of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light "Corpuscular theory of light").

[![Image 40: Painting of Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange2.jpg/250px-Joseph_Louis_Lagrange2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Joseph_Louis_Lagrange2.jpg)

[Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange")'s contribution was realising Newton's ideas in the language of modern mathematics, now called [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics").

After Newton, classical mechanics became a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics. Mathematical formulations progressively allowed finding solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first notable mathematical treatment was in 1788 by [Joseph Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange "Joseph Louis Lagrange"). Lagrangian mechanics was in turn re-formulated in 1833 by [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton").

[![Image 41: photograph of William Rowan Hamilton in looking left](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg/250px-WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg)

[Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") developed an alternative to [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") now called [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics").

Some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to compatibility with [electromagnetic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_theory "Electromagnetic theory"), and the famous [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment"). The resolution of these problems led to the [special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity"), often still considered a part of classical mechanics.

A second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics. When combined with [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), classical mechanics leads to the [Gibbs paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox "Gibbs paradox") of classical [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"), in which [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") is not a well-defined quantity. [Black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law "Planck's law") was not explained without the introduction of [quanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum"). As experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain, even approximately, such basic things as the [energy levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_levels "Energy levels") and sizes of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms") and the [photo-electric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo-electric_effect "Photo-electric effect"). The effort at resolving these problems led to the development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").

Since the end of the 20th century, classical mechanics in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") has no longer been an independent theory. Instead, classical mechanics is now considered an approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics. Emphasis has shifted to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") and its more modern extensions into a unified [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything"). Classical mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum mechanical, low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields.
