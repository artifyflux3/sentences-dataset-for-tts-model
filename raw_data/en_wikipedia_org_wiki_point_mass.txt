Examples of point particles: _(counterclockwise from top left)_ point mass for [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), point particles to measure distance between two charged particles, [simple pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum "Pendulum") (point mass attached to the end of a massless string), [ideal gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas "Ideal gas") particles devoid of interactions (no collisions, gravitational force, or [Coulomb's force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") between particles)

A **point particle**, **ideal particle**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-1) or **point-like particle** (often spelled **pointlike particle**) is an [idealization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization_(science_philosophy) "Idealization (science philosophy)") of [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") heavily used in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). Its defining feature is that it lacks spatial [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics) "Extension (metaphysics)"); being dimensionless, it does not take up [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-2) A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whenever its size, shape, and structure are irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite-size object will look and behave as a point-like object. Point masses and point charges, discussed below, are two common cases. When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, it is often represented mathematically by a [Dirac delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function "Dirac delta function"). In classical mechanics there is usually no concept of rotation of point particles about their "center".

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), the concept of a point particle is complicated by the [Heisenberg uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"), because even an [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"), with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the [atomic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") of an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") in the [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") occupies a volume of ~10−30 m 3. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") or [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), which have no known internal structure, and [composite particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_particle "Composite particle") such as [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and neutrons, whose internal structures are made up of quarks. Elementary particles are sometimes called "point particles" in reference to their lack of internal structure, but this is in a different sense than that discussed herein.

**Point mass** (**pointlike mass**) is the concept, for example in [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"), of a physical object (typically [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter")) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") (infinitely small) in its volume or [linear dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"). In the theory of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), extended objects can behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity. For example, spherical objects interacting in [3-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-dimensional_space "3-dimensional space") whose interactions are described by the [Newtonian gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation "Law of universal gravitation") behave, as long as they do not touch each other, in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their [centers of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-3) In fact, this is true for all fields described by an [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law "Inverse square law").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-NewtonMotteMachin1-5)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Scalar_potential_of_a_point_charge.jpg/250px-Scalar_potential_of_a_point_charge.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scalar_potential_of_a_point_charge.jpg)

Scalar potential of a point charge shortly after exiting a dipole magnet, moving left to right.

Similar to point masses, in [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") physicists discuss a **point charge**, a point particle with a nonzero [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-6) The fundamental [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") of [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics") is [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law"), which describes the electric force between two point charges. Another result, [Earnshaw's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem "Earnshaw's theorem"), states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in a static [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges. The [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards zero, which suggests that the model is no longer accurate in this limit.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Quark_structure_proton.svg/250px-Quark_structure_proton.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quark_structure_proton.svg)

A proton is a combination of two [up quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark") and one [down quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark"), held together by [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon").

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), there is a distinction between an [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") (also called "point particle") and a [composite particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_particle "Composite particle"). An elementary particle, such as an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), [quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), or [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), is a particle with no known internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") or [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), has an internal structure. However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the [Heisenberg uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle "Uncertainty principle"). The particle [wavepacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavepacket "Wavepacket") always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see [atomic orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital"): The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns.

Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition "Quantum superposition") of [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the _interactions_ of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized. This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic "size" of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The "size" of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero.

For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than 10−18 m.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass#cite_note-7) This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the [classical electron radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electron_radius "Classical electron radius"), which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)
