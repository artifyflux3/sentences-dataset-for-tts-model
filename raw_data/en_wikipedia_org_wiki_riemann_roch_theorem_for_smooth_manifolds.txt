Results of this kind were obtained by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch in 1959, reducing the requirements to something like a spin structure .

Formulation [ edit ] Let X and Y be oriented smooth closed manifolds ,
and f : X → Y a continuous map.
Let v f = f * ( TY ) − TX in the K-group K(X).
If dim(X) ≡ dim(Y) mod 2, then c h ( f K ∗ ∗ ( x ) ) = f H ∗ ∗ ( c h ( x ) e d ( v f ) / 2 A ^ ^ ( v f ) ) , {\displaystyle \mathrm {ch} (f_{K*}(x))=f_{H*}(\mathrm {ch} (x)e^{d(v_{f})/2}{\hat {A}}(v_{f})),} where ch is the Chern character , d(v f ) an element of 
the integral cohomology group H 2 ( Y , Z ) satisfying d ( v f ) ≡ f * w 2 (T Y )- w 2 (T X ) mod 2,
f K* the Gysin homomorphism for K-theory,
and f H* the Gysin homomorphism for cohomology
.

[ 1 ] This theorem was first proven by Atiyah and Hirzebruch.

[ 2 ] The theorem is proven by considering several special cases.

[ 3 ] If Y is the Thom space of a vector bundle V over X ,
then the Gysin maps are just the Thom isomorphism.
Then, using the splitting principle , it suffices to check the theorem via explicit computation for line
bundles.

If f : X → Y is an embedding, then the 
Thom space of the normal bundle of X in Y can be viewed as a tubular neighborhood of X in Y , and excision gives a map u : H ∗ ∗ ( B ( N ) , S ( N ) ) → → H ∗ ∗ ( Y , Y − − B ( N ) ) → → H ∗ ∗ ( Y ) {\displaystyle u:H^{*}(B(N),S(N))\to H^{*}(Y,Y-B(N))\to H^{*}(Y)} and v : K ( B ( N ) , S ( N ) ) → → K ( Y , Y − − B ( N ) ) → → K ( Y ) {\displaystyle v:K(B(N),S(N))\to K(Y,Y-B(N))\to K(Y)} .

The Gysin map for K-theory/cohomology is defined to be the composition of the Thom isomorphism with these maps.
Since the theorem holds for the map from X to the Thom space of N ,
and since the Chern character commutes with u and v , the theorem is also true for embeddings.

f : X → Y .

Finally, we can factor a general map f : X → Y into an embedding i : X → → Y × × S 2 n {\displaystyle i:X\to Y\times S^{2n}} and the projection p : Y × × S 2 n → → Y .

{\displaystyle p:Y\times S^{2n}\to Y.} The theorem is true for the embedding.
The Gysin map for the projection is the Bott-periodicity isomorphism, which commutes with the Chern character,
so the theorem holds in this general case also.

Corollaries [ edit ] Atiyah and Hirzebruch then specialised and refined in the case X = a point, where the condition becomes the existence of a spin structure on Y . Corollaries are on Pontryagin classes and the J-homomorphism .
