It was discovered by Augustin Louis Cauchy and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius , and became well known after William Burnside quoted it.

[ 1 ] The result enumerates orbits of a symmetry group acting on some objects: that is, it counts distinct objects, considering objects symmetric to each other as the same; or counting distinct objects up to a symmetry equivalence relation ; or counting only objects in canonical form . For example, in describing possible organic compounds of certain type, one considers them up to spatial rotation symmetry: different rotated drawings of a given molecule are chemically identical. (However a mirror reflection might give a different compound .) Formally, let G {\displaystyle G} be a finite group that acts on a set X {\displaystyle X} . For each g {\displaystyle g} in G {\displaystyle G} , let X g {\displaystyle X^{g}} denote the set of elements in X {\displaystyle X} that are fixed by g {\displaystyle g} (left invariant by g {\displaystyle g} ): that is, X g = { x ∈ ∈ X : g ⋅ ⋅ x = x } .

{\displaystyle X^{g}=\{x\in X:g\cdot x=x\}.} Burnside's lemma asserts the following formula for the number of orbits , denoted | X / G | {\displaystyle |X/G|} : [ 2 ] | X / G | = 1 | G | ∑ ∑ g ∈ ∈ G | X g | .

{\displaystyle |X/G|={\frac {1}{|G|}}\sum _{g\in G}|X^{g}|.} Thus the number of orbits (a natural number or +∞ ) is equal to the average number of points fixed by an element of G . For an infinite group G {\displaystyle G} , there is still a bijection : G × × X / G ⟷ ⟷ ∐ ∐ g ∈ ∈ G X g .

{\displaystyle G\times X/G\ \longleftrightarrow \ \coprod _{g\in G}X^{g}.} Examples of applications to enumeration [ edit ] Necklaces [ edit ] There are 8 possible bit strings of length 3, but tying together the string ends gives only four distinct 2-colored necklaces of length 3, given by the canonical forms 000, 001, 011, 111: the other strings 100 and 010 are equivalent to 001 by rotation, while 110 and 101 are equivalent to 011.  That is, rotation equivalence splits the set X {\displaystyle X} of strings into four orbits: X = { 000 } ∪ ∪ { 001 , 010 , 100 } ∪ ∪ { 011 , 101 , 110 } ∪ ∪ { 111 } .

{\displaystyle X=\{{000}\}\cup \{{001},{010},{100}\}\cup \{{011},{101},{110}\}\cup \{{111}\}.} The Burnside formula uses the number of rotations, which is 3 including the null rotation, and the number of bit strings left unchanged by each rotation. All 8 bit vectors are unchanged by the null rotation, and two (000 and 111) are unchanged by the other two rotations. Thus the number of orbits is: 4 = 1 3 ( 8 + 2 + 2 ) .

{\displaystyle 4={\frac {1}{3}}(8+2+2).} For length 4, there are 16 possible bit strings; 4 rotations; the null rotation leaves all 16 strings unchanged; the 1-rotation and 3-rotation each leave two strings unchanged (0000 and 1111); the 2-rotation leaves 4 bit strings unchanged (0000, 0101, 1010, 1111). The number of distinct necklaces is thus: 6 = 1 4 ( 16 + 2 + 4 + 2 ) {\displaystyle 6={\tfrac {1}{4}}(16+2+4+2)} , represented by the canonical forms 0000, 0001, 0011, 0101, 0111, 1111.

The general case of n bits and k colors is given by a necklace polynomial .

Colorings of a cube [ edit ] Burnside's lemma can compute the number of rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube using three colours.

Let X {\displaystyle X} be the set of 3 6 possible face color combinations that can be applied to a fixed cube, and let the rotation group G of the cube act on X {\displaystyle X} by moving the colored faces: two colorings in X {\displaystyle X} belong to the same orbit precisely when one is a rotation of the other. Rotationally distinct colorings correspond to group orbits, and can be found by counting the sizes of the fixed sets for the 24 elements of G , the colorings left unchanged by each rotation: Cube with coloured faces the identity element fixes all 3 6 colorings six 90-degree face rotations each fix 3 3 colorings three 180-degree face rotations each fix 3 4 colorings eight 120-degree vertex rotations each fix 3 2 colorings six 180-degree edge rotations each fix 3 3 colorings.

A detailed examination may be found here .

The average fixed-set size is thus: | X / G | = 1 24 ( 3 6 + 6 ⋅ ⋅ 3 3 + 3 ⋅ ⋅ 3 4 + 8 ⋅ ⋅ 3 2 + 6 ⋅ ⋅ 3 3 ) = 57.

{\displaystyle |X/G|={\frac {1}{24}}\left(3^{6}+6\cdot 3^{3}+3\cdot 3^{4}+8\cdot 3^{2}+6\cdot 3^{3}\right)=57.} There are 57 rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube in three colours. In general, the number of rotationally distinct colorings of the faces of a cube in n colors is: 1 24 ( n 6 + 3 n 4 + 12 n 3 + 8 n 2 ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{24}}\left(n^{6}+3n^{4}+12n^{3}+8n^{2}\right).} Proof [ edit ] In the proof of Burnside's lemma, the first step is to re-express the sum over the group elements g ∈ G as an equivalent sum over the set of elements x ∈ X : ∑ ∑ g ∈ ∈ G | X g | = # # { ( g , x ) ∈ ∈ G × × X ∣ ∣ g ⋅ ⋅ x = x } = ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ X | G x | .

{\displaystyle \sum _{g\in G}|X^{g}|=\#\{(g,x)\in G\times X\mid g\cdot x=x\}=\sum _{x\in X}|G_{x}|.} Here X g = { x ∈ ∈ X : g ⋅ ⋅ x = x } {\displaystyle X^{g}=\{x\in X:g\cdot x=x\}} is the set of points of X {\displaystyle X} fixed by the element g {\displaystyle g} of G {\displaystyle G} , whereas G x = { g ∈ ∈ G : g ⋅ ⋅ x = x } {\displaystyle G_{x}=\{g\in G:g\cdot x=x\}} is the stabilizer subgroup of G {\displaystyle G} , consisting of those symmetries that fix the point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} .) The orbit-stabilizer theorem says that for each x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} there is a natural bijection between the orbit G ⋅ ⋅ x = { g ⋅ ⋅ x : g ∈ ∈ G } {\displaystyle G\cdot x=\{g\cdot x:g\in G\}} and the set of left cosets G / G x {\displaystyle G/G_{x}} .

Lagrange's theorem implies that | G ⋅ ⋅ x | = [ G : G x ] = | G | / | G x | .

{\displaystyle |G\cdot x|=[G:G_{x}]=|G|/|G_{x}|.} The sum may therefore be rewritten as ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ X | G x | = ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ X | G | | G ⋅ ⋅ x | = | G | ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ X 1 | G ⋅ ⋅ x | .

{\displaystyle \sum _{x\in X}|G_{x}|=\sum _{x\in X}{\frac {|G|}{|G\cdot x|}}=|G|\sum _{x\in X}{\frac {1}{|G\cdot x|}}.} Writing X {\displaystyle X} as the disjoint union of its orbits in X / G {\displaystyle X/G} gives | G | ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ X 1 | G ⋅ ⋅ x | = | G | ∑ ∑ A ∈ ∈ X / G ∑ ∑ x ∈ ∈ A 1 | A | = | G | ∑ ∑ A ∈ ∈ X / G 1 = | G | ⋅ ⋅ | X / G | .

{\displaystyle |G|\sum _{x\in X}{\frac {1}{|G\cdot x|}}=|G|\sum _{A\in X/G}\sum _{x\in A}{\frac {1}{|A|}}=|G|\sum _{A\in X/G}1=|G|\cdot |X/G|.} Putting everything together gives the desired result: ∑ ∑ g ∈ ∈ G | X g | = | G | ⋅ ⋅ | X / G | .

{\displaystyle \sum _{g\in G}|X^{g}|=|G|\cdot |X/G|.} This is similar to the proof of the conjugacy class equation , which considers the conjugation action of G {\displaystyle G} on itself, that is, it is the case X = G {\displaystyle X=G} and g ⋅ ⋅ x = g x g − − 1 {\displaystyle g\cdot x=gxg^{-1}} , so that the stabilizer of x {\displaystyle x} is the centralizer G x = Z G ( x ) {\displaystyle G_{x}=Z_{G}(x)} .

Enumeration vs. generation [ edit ] Burnside's lemma counts distinct objects, but it does not construct them. In general, combinatorial generation with isomorph rejection considers the symmetries of g {\displaystyle g} on objects x {\displaystyle x} . But instead of checking that g ⋅ ⋅ x = x {\displaystyle g\cdot x=x} , it checks that g ⋅ ⋅ x {\displaystyle g\cdot x} has not already been generated.  One way to accomplish this is by checking that g ⋅ ⋅ x {\displaystyle g\cdot x} is not lexicographically less than x {\displaystyle x} , using the lexicographically least member of each equivalence class as the canonical form of the class.

[ 3 ] Counting the objects generated with such a technique can verify that Burnside's lemma was correctly applied.

History: the lemma that is not Burnside's [ edit ] William Burnside stated and proved this lemma in his 1897 book on finite groups, attributing it to Frobenius 1887 . But even prior to Frobenius, the formula was known to Cauchy in 1845. Consequently, this lemma is sometimes referred to as the lemma that is not Burnside's .
