A crow flying across the terrain The expression as the crow flies (or alternatively as the bird flies ) is an idiom for the most direct path between two points.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Etymology [ edit ] The meaning of the expression is attested from the early 19th century, and appeared in the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist (1838): [ 1 ] [ 2 ] "We cut over the fields at the back with him between us – straight as the crow flies – through hedge and ditch." [ 1 ] While crows do conspicuously fly alone across open country, they do not fly in especially straight lines.

[ 3 ] While crows do not swoop in the air like swallows or starlings , they often circle above their nests.

[ 3 ] One suggested origin of the term is that before modern navigational methods were introduced, cages of crows were kept upon ships and a bird would be released from the crow's nest when required to assist navigation, in the hope that it would fly directly towards land.

[ 1 ] However, the earliest recorded uses of the term are not nautical in nature, and the crow's nest of a ship is thought to derive from its shape and position rather than its use as a platform for releasing crows.

[ 1 ] It has also been suggested that crows would not travel well in cages, as they fight if confined.
