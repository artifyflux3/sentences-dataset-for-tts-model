In physics and chemistry : Molecular Hamiltonian In chemistry : Dyall Hamiltonian More specifically, as an adjective it is used in the phrases: In mathematical physics : Hamiltonian flow Hamiltonian function Hamiltonian mechanics in classical mechanics Hamiltonian optics Hamiltonian principle , see Hamilton's principle Hamiltonian system Hamiltonian vector field In mathematics : Hamiltonian path , in graph theory Hamiltonian cycle, a special case of a Hamiltonian path Hamiltonian group , in group theory Hamiltonian matrix Hamiltonian numbers (or quaternions) In physics : Hamiltonian constraint Hamiltonian fluid mechanics Hamiltonian operator, see Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory By field [ edit ] In both mathematics and physics (specifically mathematical physics ): the term Hamiltonian refers to any energy function defined by a Hamiltonian vector field , a particular vector field on a symplectic manifold , i.e.,  a Hamiltonian function ; Hamiltonian field theory Hamiltonian flow Hamiltonian function , see above Hamiltonian system Hamiltonian vector field Hamiltonian mechanics in classical mechanics Hamilton's principle Hamilton–Jacobi equation In mathematics : Hamiltonian path , in graph theory Hamiltonian cycle, a special case of a Hamiltonian path Hamiltonian group , in group theory Hamiltonian matrix Hamiltonian numbers (or quaternions) In physics and chemistry : Hamiltonian operator, see Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) Molecular Hamiltonian In physics : Hamiltonian constraint Hamiltonian fluid mechanics Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory In Chemistry : Dyall Hamiltonian In control theory : Hamiltonian (control theory) Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation Other [ edit ] The Hamilton Building at Trinity College Dublin See also [ edit ] Hamiltonian (disambiguation) Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_things_named_after_William_Rowan_Hamilton&oldid=1115882845 " Categories : Lists of things named after mathematicians William Rowan Hamilton Hidden categories: Articles with short description Short description is different from Wikidata This page was last edited on 13 October 2022, at 18:15 (UTC) .
