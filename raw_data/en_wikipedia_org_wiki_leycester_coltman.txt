[ 1 ] Coltman was educated at Rugby School and Magdalene College , and spent a sabbatical year at the Manchester Business School .  After joining the British Diplomatic Service , he served in Copenhagen, Cairo, Brasília , Mexico City, and Brussels, and served as the British ambassador to Cuba 1991–94 and to Colombia 1994–98.

[ 1 ] Coltman was ambassador to Cuba during the post- Cold War upheaval that saw the Soviet Union withdraw its troops and foreign aid, and he had access to Fidel Castro .  He authored a biography, The Real Fidel Castro , about his experiences, which was published shortly after his death in 2003.
