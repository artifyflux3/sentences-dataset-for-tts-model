( December 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Excessivism is an art movement. In 2015 American artist and curator Kaloust Guedel introduced it to the world [ 1 ] with an exhibition titled Excessivist Initiative .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The review of the exhibition [ 6 ] written by art critic and curator Shana Nys Dambrot, titled "Excessivism: Irony, Imbalance and a New Rococo" was published in the Huffington Post .

[ 6 ] Its early adopters go back to late 20th century.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Concept [ edit ] Kaloust Guedel, Art work representing excessivism group, 2014.

Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration of areas that have real and consequential effect on members of society.  Subject areas include, but are not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. Its economic criticism is a commentary on economic materialism , and the desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs.

[ 6 ] Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way using two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other medium. It aims to reflect, examine, or investigate the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.

[ 3 ] [ 10 ] History [ edit ] The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".

[ 3 ] And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in Downtown News weekly in September 2015.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot, the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.

[ 6 ] Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled Excess The New Norm . It was curated by art critic, publisher and curator Mat Gleason .

[ 13 ] The inaugural exhibition included works by Brett Baker, Christophe Baudson, Andrew Dadson, Ian Davenport , Jonas Etter, Kaloust Guedel , Don Harger, Zhu Jinshi, Fabian Marcacio, Roxy Paine , Scott Richter, Samvel Saghatelian, Elizabeth Sheppell, Michael Toenges, Michael Villarreal, Danh Vō, Cullen Washington, Jr.

, Brigid Watson, Leslie Wayne, Ai Weiwei and Zadik Zadikian.

[ 4 ] By 2019, Excessivism expanded beyond visual forms to include fashion and music.
