[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The HRNB was first constructed by Ward C. Halstead, [ 3 ] who was chairman of the Psychology Department at the University of Chicago , together with his doctoral student, Ralph Reitan (who later extended Halstead's Test Battery at the Indiana University Medical Center).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] A major aim of administering the HRNB to patients was if possible to lateralize a lesion to either the left or right cerebral hemisphere by comparing the functioning on both sides of the body on a variety of tests such as the Suppression or Sensory Imperception Test, the Finger Agnosia Test, Finger Tip Writing, the Finger Tapping Test, and the Tactual Performance Test.

[ 7 ] One difficulty with the HRNB was its excessive administration time (up to three hours or more in some brain-injured patients). In particular, administration of the Halstead Category Test was lengthy, [ 8 ] so subsequent attempts were made to construct reliable and valid short-forms.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Included [ edit ] The HRNB includes: Wechsler Intelligence Scale Aphasia Screening Test Trail-Making Test , parts A and B (measures time to connect a sequence of numbers (Trail-Making, Part A) or alternating numbers and letters (Trail-Making, Part B).

Halstead Category Test (a test of abstract concept learning ability—comprising seven subtests which form several factors: a Counting factor (subtests I and II), a Spatial Positional Reasoning factor (subtests III, IV, and VII), a Proportional Reasoning factor (subtests V, VI, and VII), and an Incidental Memory factor (subtest VII).
