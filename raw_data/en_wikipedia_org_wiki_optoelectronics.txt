Electronic light sensors Optoelectronics (or optronics ) is the study and application of electronic devices and systems that find, detect and control light , usually considered a sub-field of photonics .  In this context, light often includes invisible forms of radiation such as gamma rays , X-rays , ultraviolet and infrared , in addition to visible light.  Optoelectronic devices are electrical-to-optical or optical-to-electrical transducers , or instruments that use such devices in their operation.

[ 1 ] Electro-optics is often erroneously used as a synonym, but is a wider branch of physics that concerns all interactions between light and electric fields , regardless of whether they form part of an electronic device.

Optoelectronics is based on the quantum mechanical effects of light on electronic materials, especially semiconductors , sometimes in the presence of electric fields .
