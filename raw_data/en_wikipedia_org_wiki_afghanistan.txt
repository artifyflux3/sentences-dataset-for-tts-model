It is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south , [ g ] Iran to the west , Turkmenistan to the northwest , Uzbekistan to the north , Tajikistan to the northeast , and China to the northeast and east . Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest , which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range.

Kabul is the country's capital and largest city.

Afghanistan's population is estimated to be between 36 and 50 million.

[ d ] Human habitation in Afghanistan dates to the Middle Paleolithic era. Popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires , [ 34 ] the land has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by the Persians , Alexander the Great , the Maurya Empire , Arab Muslims , the Mongols , the British , the Soviet Union , and a US-led coalition . Afghanistan also served as the source from which the Greco-Bactrians and the Mughals , among others, rose to form major empires.

[ 35 ] Because of the various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres, [ 36 ] [ 37 ] the area was a center for Zoroastrianism , Buddhism , Hinduism , and later Islam.

[ 38 ] The modern state of Afghanistan began with the Durrani Afghan Empire in the 18th century, [ 39 ] although Dost Mohammad Khan is sometimes considered to be the founder of the first modern Afghan state .

[ 40 ] Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire and the Russian Empire . From India, the British attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War ; the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign political hegemony, and emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in 1926. This monarchy lasted almost half a century, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973 , following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established.

Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history has been dominated by extensive warfare, including coups, invasions, insurgencies, and civil wars . The conflict began in 1978 when a communist revolution established a socialist state (itself a response to the dictatorship established following a coup d'état in 1973 ), and subsequent infighting prompted the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan in 1979.

Mujahideen fought against the Soviets in the Soviet–Afghan War and continued fighting among themselves following the Soviets' withdrawal in 1989 . The Taliban controlled most of the country by 1996, but their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan . The Taliban returned to power in 2021 after capturing Kabul , ending the 2001–2021 war . As of July 2025 [update] , the Taliban government is widely unrecognized by the international community due to reported violations of human rights in Afghanistan , particularly regarding the rights of women in Afghanistan and the treatment of women by the Taliban .

Afghanistan is rich in natural resources, including lithium , iron, zinc , and copper. It is the second-largest producer of cannabis resin , [ 41 ] and third largest of both saffron [ 42 ] and cashmere .

[ 43 ] The country is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and a founding member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation . Due to the effects of war in recent decades, the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism, poverty , and child malnutrition. Afghanistan remains among the world's least developed countries , ranking 182nd on the Human Development Index . Afghanistan's gross domestic product (GDP) is $81 billion by purchasing power parity and $20.1 billion by nominal values. Per capita, its GDP is among the lowest of any country as of 2020 [update] .

Etymology Main article: Name of Afghanistan Some scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan , which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush .

[ 44 ] Aśvakan literally means "horsemen", "horse breeders", or " cavalrymen " (from aśva , the Sanskrit and Avestan words for "horse").

[ 45 ] Historically, the ethnonym Afghān was used to refer to ethnic Pashtuns .

[ 46 ] The Arabic and Persian form of the name, Afġān , was first attested in the 10th-century geography book Hudud al-'Alam .

[ 47 ] The last part of the name, " -stan ", is a Persian suffix meaning "place of". Therefore, "Afghanistan" translates to "land of the Afghans", or "land of the Pashtuns" in a historical sense. According to the third edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam : [ 48 ] The name Afghanistan (Afghānistān, land of the Afghans / Pashtuns, afāghina , sing.

afghān ) can be traced to the early eighth/fourteenth century, when it designated the easternmost part of the Kartid realm. This name was later used for certain regions in the Ṣafavid and Mughal empires that were inhabited by Afghans. While based on a state-supporting elite of Abdālī / Durrānī Afghans, the Sadūzāʾī Durrānī polity that came into being in 1160 / 1747 was not called Afghanistan in its own day. The name became a state designation only during the colonial intervention of the nineteenth century.

The term "Afghanistan" was officially used in 1855, when the British recognized Dost Mohammad Khan as king of Afghanistan .

[ 49 ] History Main article: History of Afghanistan Prehistory and antiquity Main article: Ancient history of Afghanistan See also: Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan Tents of Afghan nomads in the northern Badghis Province . Early peasant farming villages came into existence about 7,000 years ago.

Excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , Bronze , and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture . More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] After 2000 BCE successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many Indo-European -speaking Indo-Iranians . These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the Caspian Sea . The region at the time was referred to as Ariana .

[ 50 ] [ 55 ] By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia , Aria , and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.

[ 56 ] The region of Arachosia , around Kandahar in modern-day southern Afghanistan, used to be primarily Zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to Persia and is thus considered by some to be the "second homeland of Zoroastrianism".

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] A "Bactrian gold" Scythian belt depicting Dionysus , from Tillya Tepe in the ancient region of Bactria Alexander the Great and his Macedonian forces arrived in Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating Darius III of Persia a year earlier in the Battle of Gaugamela . Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka 's rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest by the Greco-Bactrians . Much of it soon broke away and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom . They were defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The Silk Road appeared during the first century BCE, and Afghanistan flourished with trade, with routes to China, India, Persia, and north to the cities of Bukhara , Samarkand , and Khiva in present-day Uzbekistan.

[ 62 ] Goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point, such as Chinese silk, Persian silver and Roman gold, while the region of present Afghanistan was mining and trading lapis lazuli stones [ 63 ] mainly from the Badakhshan region.

During the first century BCE, the Parthian Empire subjugated the region but lost it to their Indo-Parthian vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast Kushan Empire , centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making Buddhism flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the Sassanids in the 3rd century CE, though the Indo-Sassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the Kidarites who, in turn, was replaced by the Hephthalites . They were replaced by the Turk Shahi in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called Hindu Shahi .

[ 64 ] Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Medieval period Main articles: Muslim conquests of Afghanistan , Mongol campaigns in Central Asia , and Ghaznavid campaigns in India The Ghurids originated from Ghor Province in central Afghanistan.

Arab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. Before the arrival of Islam , the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in Syncretism between the dominant religions [ 67 ] [ 68 ] such as Zoroastrianism , [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism , Ancient Iranian religions , [ 69 ] Hinduism , Christianity, [ 70 ] [ 71 ] and Judaism.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda , Lady Nana , Anahita or Mihr (Mithra) and portrayed Greek gods as protectors of Buddha.

[ 74 ] [ 69 ] [ 75 ] The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. The Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] By the 11th century, Mahmud of Ghazni had defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively Islamized the wider region, [ 79 ] with the exception of Kafiristan .

[ 80 ] Mahmud made Ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian Al-Biruni and the poet Ferdowsi .

[ 81 ] The Ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the Ghurids in 1186 , whose architectural achievements included the remote Minaret of Jam . The Ghurids controlled Afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the Khwarazmian dynasty in 1215.

[ 82 ] Mongol invasions and conquests In 1219 CE, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army overran the region . His troops are said to have annihilated the Khwarazmian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as Bamyan .

[ 83 ] The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society.

[ 84 ] Mongol rule continued with the Ilkhanate in the northwest while the Khalji dynasty administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of Timur (aka Tamerlane), who established the Timurid Empire in 1370. Under the rule of Shah Rukh , the city of Herat [ 85 ] served as the focal point of the Timurid Renaissance , whose glory matched Florence of the Italian Renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] In the early 16th century Babur arrived from Ferghana and captured Kabul from the Arghun dynasty .

[ 88 ] Babur would go on to conquer the Afghan Lodi dynasty who had ruled the Delhi Sultanate in the First Battle of Panipat .

[ 89 ] Between the 16th and 18th century, the Uzbek Khanate of Bukhara , Iranian Safavids , and Indian Mughals ruled parts of the territory.

[ 90 ] During the medieval period, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name Khorasan , which was commonly used up to the 19th century among natives to describe their country.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Hotak dynasty Main article: Hotak dynasty Map of the Hotak Empire at its height in 1728, disputed between Hussain Hotak (centered in Kandahar) and Ashraf Hotak (centered in Isfahan) In 1709, Mirwais Hotak , a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids . He defeated Gurgin Khan , the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom.

[ 95 ] Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz , who was soon killed by Mirwais's son Mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids. Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan , and captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia.

[ 95 ] The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan .

In 1738, Nader Shah and his forces captured Kandahar in the siege of Kandahar , the last Hotak stronghold, from Shah Hussain Hotak . Soon after, the Persian and Afghan forces invaded India , Nader Shah had plundered Delhi, alongside his 16-year-old commander, Ahmad Shah Durrani who had assisted him on these campaigns. Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Durrani Empire Main articles: Durrani Empire and Ahmad Shah Durrani After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns . The Abdalis had "unanimously accepted" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal empire , Maratha empire , and then-receding Afsharid empire . Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752.

[ 98 ] Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan , 1750–1751 and 1754–1755.

[ 99 ] His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad , however, he was forced to retreat after four months. In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur , but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751.

Ahmad Shah returned in 1754 ; he captured Tun , and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again. Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but Shahrokh was reappointed in 1755. He was forced to give up Torshiz , Bakharz , Jam , Khaf , and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty. Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.

Ahmad Shah invaded India eight times during his reign, [ 100 ] beginning in 1748. Crossing the Indus River, his armies sacked and absorbed Lahore into the Durrani Realm . He met Mughal armies at the Battle of Manupur (1748) , where he was defeated and forced to retreat back to Afghanistan.

[ 101 ] He returned the next year in 1749 and captured the area around Lahore and Punjab , presenting it as an Afghan victory for this campaign.

[ 102 ] From 1749 to 1767, Ahmad Shah led six more invasions, the most important being the last; the Third Battle of Panipat created a power vacuum in northern India, halting Maratha expansion.

Portrait of Ahmad Shah Durrani c.

1757 Ahmad Shah Durrani died in October 1772, and a civil war over succession followed, with his named successor, Timur Shah Durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother, Suleiman Mirza.

[ 103 ] Timur Shah Durrani ascended to the throne in November 1772, having defeated a coalition under Shah Wali Khan and Humayun Mirza. Timur Shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him, purging Durrani Sardars and influential tribal leaders in Kabul and Kandahar . One of Timur Shah's reforms was to move the capital of the Durrani Empire from Kandahar to Kabul . Timur Shah fought multiple series of rebellions to consolidate the empire, and he also led campaigns into Punjab against the Sikhs like his father, though more successfully. The most prominent example of his battles during this campaign was when he led his forces under Zangi Khan Durrani – with over 18,000 men total of Afghan, Qizilbash, and Mongol cavalrymen – against over 60,000 Sikh men. The Sikhs lost over 30,000 in this battle and staged a Durrani resurgence in the Punjab region [ 104 ] The Durranis lost Multan in 1772 after Ahmad Shah's death. Following this victory, Timur Shah was able to lay siege to Multan and recapture it, [ 105 ] incorporating it into the Durrani Empire once again, reintegrating it as a province until the Siege of Multan (1818) . Timur Shah was succeeded by his son Zaman Shah Durrani after his death in May 1793. Timur Shah's reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire. However, Timur Shah had over 24 sons, which plunged the empire in civil war over succession crises.

[ 106 ] Zaman Shah Durrani succeeded to the Durrani Throne following the death of his father, Timur Shah Durrani. His brothers Mahmud Shah Durrani and Humayun Mirza revolted against him, with Humayun centered in Kandahar and Mahmud Shah centered in Herat .

[ 107 ] Zaman Shah would defeat Humayun and force the loyalty of Mahmud Shah Durrani.

[ 107 ] Securing his position on the throne, Zaman Shah led three campaigns into Punjab . The first two campaigns captured Lahore , but he retreated due to intel about a possible Qajar invasion. Zaman Shah embarked on his third campaign for Punjab in 1800 to deal with a rebellious Ranjit Singh.

[ 108 ] However, he was forced to withdraw, and Zaman Shah's reign was ended by Mahmud Shah Durrani.

[ 108 ] However, just under two years into his reign, Mahmud Shah Durrani was deposed by his brother Shah Shuja Durrani on 13 July 1803.

[ 109 ] Shah Shuja attempted to consolidate the Durrani Realm but was deposed by his brother at the Battle of Nimla (1809) .

[ 110 ] Mahmud Shah Durrani defeated Shah Shuja and forced him to flee, usurping the throne again. His second reign began on 3 May 1809.

[ 111 ] Barakzai dynasty and British wars Further information: Dost Mohammad Khan , Herat (1793–1863) , Maimana Khanate , Principality of Kandahar , European influence in Afghanistan , Anglo-Afghan Wars , Durand Line , and Afghan Civil War (1928–1929) Map of Afghanistan ( Emirate ) and surrounding nations in 1839, during the First Anglo-Afghan War .

Dost Mohammad Khan 's realm can be seen as the Emirate of Kabul, with the Principality of Qandahar and the Emirate of Herat seen as well.

By the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east.

Fateh Khan , leader of the Barakzai tribe , installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. Fateh Khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by Mahmud Shah . As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the Barakzai tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the Principality of Qandahar , Emirate of Herat , Khanate of Qunduz , Maimana Khanate , and numerous other warring polities. The most prominent state was the Emirate of Kabul , ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan .

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] With the collapse of the Durrani Empire, and the exile of the Sadozai Dynasty to be left to rule in Herat , Punjab and Kashmir were lost to Ranjit Singh , ruler of the Sikh Empire , who invaded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March 1823 and captured the city of Peshawar following the Battle of Nowshera . In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan led numerous campaigns, firstly campaigning to Jalalabad , and then allying with his rival brothers in Kandahar to defeat Shah Shuja Durrani and the British in the Expedition of Shuja ul-Mulk .

[ 114 ] In 1837, Dost Mohammad Khan attempted to conquer Peshawar and sent a large force under his son Wazir Akbar Khan , leading to the Battle of Jamrud .

Akbar Khan and the Afghan army failed to capture the Jamrud Fort from the Sikh Khalsa Army , but killed Sikh Commander Hari Singh Nalwa , thus ending the Afghan-Sikh Wars . By this time the British were advancing from the east, capitalizing on the decline of the Sikh Empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of Ranjit Singh , which engaged the Emirate of Kabul in the first major conflict during " The Great Game ".

[ 115 ] Afghan tribesmen in 1841, painted by British officer James Rattray In 1839 a British expeditionary force marched into Afghanistan, invading the Principality of Qandahar , and in August 1839, seized Kabul . Dost Mohammad Khan defeated the British in the Parwan campaign , but surrendered following his victory. He was replaced with the former Durrani ruler Shah Shuja Durrani as the new ruler of Kabul , a de facto puppet of the British.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Following an uprising that saw the assassination of Shah Shuja , the 1842 retreat from Kabul of British-Indian forces and the annihilation of Elphinstone 's army, and the punitive expedition of The Battle of Kabul that led to its sacking, the British gave up on their attempts to try to subjugate Afghanistan, allowing Dost Mohammad Khan to return as ruler. Following this, Dost Mohammad pursued a myriad of campaigns to unite most of Afghanistan in his reign, launching numerous incursions including against the surrounding states such as the Hazarajat campaign , conquest of Balkh , conquest of Kunduz , and the conquest of Kandahar . Dost Mohammad led his final campaign against Herat , conquering it and re-uniting Afghanistan. During his campaigns of re-unification, he held friendly relations with the British despite the First Anglo-Afghan War, and affirmed their status in the Second Anglo-Afghan treaty of 1857, while Bukhara and internal religious leaders pressured Dost Mohammad to invade India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .

[ 118 ] Dost Mohammad died in June 1863, a few weeks after his successful campaign to Herat. Following his death, a civil war ensued among his sons, prominently Mohammad Afzal Khan , Mohammad Azam Khan , and Sher Ali Khan . Sher Ali won the resulting Afghan Civil War (1863–1869) and ruled Afghanistan until his death in 1879. In his final years, the British returned to Afghanistan in the Second Anglo-Afghan War to fight perceived Russian influence in the region. Sher Ali retreated to northern Afghanistan, intending to create a resistance there similar to his predecessors, Dost Mohammad Khan, and Wazir Akbar Khan. His untimely death however, saw Yaqub Khan declared the new Amir, leading to Britain gaining control of Afghanistan's foreign relations as part of the Treaty of Gandamak of 1879, making it an official British Protected State .

[ 119 ] [ 120 ] An uprising however, re-started the conflict, and Yaqub Khan was deposed. During this tumultuous period, Abdur Rahman Khan began his rise to power, becoming an eligible candidate to become Amir after he seized much of Northern Afghanistan . Abdur Rahman marched on Kabul , and was declared Amir, being recognized by the British as well. Another uprising by Ayub Khan threatened the British, where rebels confronted and defeated British forces in the Battle of Maiwand . Following up on his victory, Ayub Khan unsuccessfully besieged Kandahar , and his decisive defeat saw the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, with Abdur Rahman secured firmly as Amir.

[ 121 ] In 1893, Abdur Rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided by the Durand Line , which forms the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Shia -dominated Hazarajat and pagan Kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by Abdur Rahman Khan in 1891–1896. He was known as the "Iron Amir" for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes.

[ 122 ] He died in 1901, succeeded by his son, Habibullah Khan .

How can a small power like Afghanistan, which is like a goat between these lions [Britain and Russia] or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill, stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?

— Abdur Rahman Khan , the "Iron Amir", in 1900 [ 123 ] [ 124 ] During the First World War , when Afghanistan was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the central powers in the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition . They called on Afghanistan to declare full independence from the United Kingdom, join them and attack British India, as part of the Hindu–German Conspiracy . The effort to bring Afghanistan into the Central Powers failed, but it sparked discontent among the population about maintaining neutrality with the British. Habibullah was assassinated in February 1919, and Amanullah Khan eventually assumed power. A staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions, Amanullah Khan invaded British India, beginning the Third Anglo-Afghan War , and entering British India via the Khyber Pass .

[ 125 ] Amanullah Khan proclaimed himself King of Afghanistan in June 1926.

After the end of the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi on 19 August 1919, Emir Amanullah Khan declared the Emirate of Afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state . He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community, particularly with the Soviet Union and the Weimar Republic .

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] He proclaimed himself King of Afghanistan on 9 June 1926, forming the Kingdom of Afghanistan . He introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was Mahmud Tarzi , an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 constitution , which made elementary education compulsory.

Slavery was abolished in 1923.

[ 128 ] King Amanullah's wife, Queen Soraya , was an important figure during this period in the fight for woman's education and against their oppression.

[ 129 ] Some of the reforms, such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of co-educational schools, alienated many tribal and religious leaders, leading to the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929) . King Amanullah abdicated in January 1929, and soon after Kabul fell to Saqqawist forces led by Habibullah Kalakani .

[ 130 ] Mohammed Nadir Shah , Amanullah's cousin, defeated and killed Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah.

[ 131 ] He abandoned the reforms of King Amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization, but was assassinated in 1933 by Abdul Khaliq .

[ 132 ] Mohammed Zahir Shah succeeded to the throne and reigned as king from 1933 to 1973. During the tribal revolts of 1944–1947 , King Zahir's reign was challenged by Zadran , Safi , Mangal , and Wazir tribesmen led by Mazrak Zadran , Salemai , and Mirzali Khan , among others – many of whom were Amanullah loyalists . Afghanistan joined the League of Nations in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a national bank , and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry.

[ 133 ] The country built close relationships with the Axis powers , with Nazi Germany having the largest share in Afghan development at the time.

[ 134 ] King Zahir , the last reigning monarch of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 until 1973 Until 1946 King Zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of prime minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another uncle, Shah Mahmud Khan , became prime minister in 1946 and experimented with allowing greater political freedom. He was replaced in 1953 by Mohammed Daoud Khan , a Pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a Pashtunistan , leading to highly tense relations with Pakistan.

[ 135 ] Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union . Afterward, the 1964 constitution was formed, and the first non-royal prime minister was sworn in.

[ 133 ] Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the United Kingdom. Afghanistan was neither a participant in World War II nor aligned with either power bloc in the Cold War . However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet development aid than any other country. In 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first president of Afghanistan , abolishing the monarchy.

Democratic Republic and Soviet war Main articles: Democratic Republic of Afghanistan , Soviet–Afghan War , and Afghan Civil War (1989–1992) Further information: History of Afghanistan (1978–1992) Soviet troops in Gardez , Afghanistan in 1987 In April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan , in what is called the Saur Revolution . The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan , with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki .

[ 136 ] This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a peaceful (albeit poor and secluded) country to a hotbed of conflict and terrorism.

[ 137 ] The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide. It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), [ 138 ] and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime.

[ 139 ] Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham .

[ 140 ] In October 1979, PDPA General Secretary Taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by then-prime minister Hafizullah Amin , who became the new general secretary of the PDPA. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin, and thousands of people went missing.

[ 141 ] Displeased with Amin's government, the Soviet Army invaded the country in December 1979, heading for Kabul and killing Amin.

[ 142 ] A Soviet-organized regime, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal, marking the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War .

[ 143 ] Lasting nine years, the war caused the deaths of between 562,000 [ 144 ] and 2 million Afghans, [ h ] and displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled Afghanistan, mainly to Pakistan and Iran .

[ 152 ] Heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages, millions of landmines were planted, [ 153 ] and some cities such as Herat and Kandahar were also damaged from bombardment. After the Soviet withdrawal , another civil war ensued until the communist regime under PDPA leader Mohammad Najibullah collapsed in 1992.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] The Soviet–Afghan War had drastic social effects on Afghanistan. The militarization of society led to heavily armed police, private bodyguards, openly armed civil defense groups and the like becoming the norm in Afghanistan for decades thereafter.

[ 157 ] The traditional power structure had shifted from clergy, community elders, intelligentsia, and military in favor of powerful warlords .

Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, [ 159 ] [ 160 ] [ 161 ] various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, [ 160 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting.

[ 163 ] Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders.

[ 164 ] The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students ( talib ) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan , [ 163 ] [ 165 ] who soon had military support from Pakistan.

[ 166 ] Taking control of Kandahar city that year, [ 163 ] they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, [ 167 ] [ 168 ] where they established an emirate .

[ 169 ] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women .

[ 170 ] [ 171 ] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.

[ i ] After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum formed the Northern Alliance , later joined by others, to resist the Taliban. Dostum's forces were defeated by the Taliban during the Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1997 and 1998; Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, Pervez Musharraf , began sending thousands of Pakistanis to help the Taliban defeat the Northern Alliance.

[ j ] By 2000, the Northern Alliance only controlled 10% of territory, cornered in the northeast. On 9 September 2001, Massoud was assassinated by two Arab suicide attackers in Panjshir Valley . Around 400,000 Afghans died in internal conflicts between 1990 and 2001.

[ 182 ] US invasion and Islamic Republic Further information: War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) , Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , Taliban insurgency , and Fall of Kabul (2021) In October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden , the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks , who was a "guest" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan.

[ 183 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end.

[ 188 ] US troops and Chinooks in Afghanistan, 2008 In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the Afghan Interim Administration under Hamid Karzai was formed. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] By this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute famine at the time, Afghanistan had one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population were hungry, [ 191 ] [ 192 ] [ 193 ] and infrastructure was in ruins.

[ 194 ] Many foreign donors started providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country.

[ 195 ] [ 196 ] As coalition troops entered Afghanistan to help the rebuilding process , [ 197 ] [ 198 ] the Taliban began an insurgency to regain control. Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in the world because of a lack of foreign investment, government corruption , and the Taliban insurgency.

[ 199 ] [ 200 ] The Afghan government was able to build some democratic structures, adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name Islamic Republic of Afghanistan . Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the Afghan National Security Forces . Following 2002, nearly five million Afghans were repatriated.

[ 201 ] The number of NATO troops present in Afghanistan peaked at 140,000 in 2011, [ 202 ] dropping to about 16,000 in 2018.

[ 203 ] In September 2014 Ashraf Ghani became president after the 2014 presidential election where for the first time in Afghanistan's history power was democratically transferred.

[ 204 ] [ 205 ] [ 206 ] On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations and transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government. The NATO-led Operation Resolute Support was formed the same day as a successor to ISAF.

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] Thousands of NATO troops remained in the country to train and advise Afghan government forces [ 209 ] and continue their fight against the Taliban.

[ 210 ] A report titled Body Count concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict.

[ 211 ] A map of Afghanistan showing the 2021 Taliban offensive On 19 February 2020, the US–Taliban deal was made in Qatar. The deal was one of the critical events that caused the collapse of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF); [ 212 ] following the signing of the deal, the US dramatically reduced the number of air attacks and deprived the ANSF of a critical edge in fighting the Taliban insurgency , leading to the Taliban takeover of Kabul.

[ 213 ] Second Taliban era Further information: Aftermath of the Afghanistan War (2001–2021) NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May.

[ 214 ] Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] The Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan.

[ 217 ] Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, [ 218 ] were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them.

[ 219 ] On 17 August, first vice president Amrullah Saleh proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops [ 220 ] [ 221 ] in the Panjshir Valley , along with Ahmad Massoud .

[ 222 ] [ 223 ] However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of Panjshir province , with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains.

[ 224 ] Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September.

[ 225 ] According to the Costs of War Project , 176,000 people were killed in the conflict, including 46,319 civilians, between 2001 and 2021.

[ 226 ] According to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program , at least 212,191 people were killed in the conflict.

[ 227 ] Though the state of war in the country ended in 2021, armed conflict persists in some regions [ 228 ] [ 229 ] [ 230 ] amid fighting between the Taliban and the local branch of the Islamic State , as well as an anti-Taliban Republican insurgency .

[ 231 ] Taliban fighters in Kabul on a captured Humvee following the 2021 fall of Kabul The Taliban government is led by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada [ 232 ] and acting prime minister Hasan Akhund , who took office on 7 September 2021.

[ 233 ] [ 234 ] Akhund is one of the four founders of the Taliban [ 235 ] and was a deputy prime minister of the previous emirate; his appointment was seen as a compromise between moderates and hardliners.

[ 236 ] A new, all-male cabinet was formed, which included Abdul Hakim Haqqani as minister of justice.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] On 20 September 2021, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres received a letter from acting minister of foreign affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi to formally claim Afghanistan's seat as a member state for their official spokesman in Doha , Suhail Shaheen . The United Nations did not recognize the previous Taliban government and chose to work with the then government-in-exile instead.

[ 239 ] Western nations suspended most of their humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban's August 2021 takeover of the country; the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted their payments.

[ 240 ] [ 241 ] More than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage in October 2021.

[ 242 ] Human Rights Watch reported on 11 November 2021 that Afghanistan was facing widespread famine due to an economic and banking crisis.

[ 243 ] The Taliban have significantly tackled corruption, improving on the corruption perceptions index from 174th to 150th best out of 180 countries from 2021 to 2022, [ 244 ] but dropping to 162nd in 2023.

[ 245 ] The Taliban have also reportedly reduced bribery and extortion in public service areas.

[ 244 ] A Taliban official with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in 2023 At the same time, the human rights situation in the country has deteriorated.

[ 246 ] Following the 2001 invasion, more than 5.7 million refugees returned to Afghanistan; [ 247 ] however, in 2021, 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees, primarily in Iran and Pakistan, and another 4 million were internally displaced.

[ 248 ] In October 2023, the Pakistani government ordered the expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan .

[ 249 ] Iran also decided to deport Afghan nationals back to Afghanistan.

[ 250 ] Taliban authorities condemned the deportations of Afghans as an "inhuman act".

[ 251 ] Afghanistan faced a humanitarian crisis in late 2023.

[ 252 ] On 10 November 2024, Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Taliban representatives would attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference , marking the first time the country participated since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. Afghanistan had been barred from previous summits due to the lack of global recognition of the Taliban regime.

[ 253 ] In May 2025, Iran ordered the mass deportation of an estimated 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees.

[ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] [ 259 ] The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the "crossroads of Asia", [ 260 ] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia.

[ 261 ] The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country: Asia is a body of water and earth, of which the Afghan nation is the heart. From its discord, the discord of Asia; and from its accord, the accord of Asia.

At over 652,864 km 2 (252,072 sq mi), [ 262 ] Afghanistan is the world's 41st largest country .

[ 263 ] It is slightly bigger than France and smaller than Myanmar, and about the size of Texas in the United States. There is no coastline, as Afghanistan is landlocked . Afghanistan shares its longest land border (the Durand Line ) with Pakistan to the east and south, followed by borders with Tajikistan to the northeast, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the north-west, Uzbekistan to the north and China to the far northeast; India recognizes a border with Afghanistan through Pakistani-administered Kashmir .

[ 264 ] Clockwise from south-west, Afghanistan shares borders with the Sistan and Baluchestan Province , South Khorasan Province and Razavi Khorasan Province of Iran; Ahal Region , Mary Region and Lebap Region of Turkmenistan; Surxondaryo Region of Uzbekistan; Khatlon Region and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan; Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China; and the Gilgit-Baltistan territory , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Balochistan province of Pakistan.

[ 265 ] Floodplain cultivation in the Wakhan Corridor , Pamir Mountains The geography in Afghanistan is varied, but is mostly mountainous and rugged, with some unusual mountain ridges accompanied by plateaus and river basins.

[ 266 ] It is dominated by the Hindu Kush range, the western extension of the Himalayas that stretches to eastern Tibet via the Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Mountains in Afghanistan's far north-east. Most of the highest points are in the east consisting of fertile mountain valleys, often considered part of the " Roof of the World ". The Hindu Kush ends at the west-central highlands, creating plains in the north and southwest, namely the Turkestan Plains and the Sistan Basin ; these two regions consist of rolling grasslands and semi-deserts, and hot windy deserts, respectively.

[ 267 ] Forests exist in the corridor between Nuristan and Paktika provinces (see East Afghan montane conifer forests ), [ 268 ] and tundra in the northeast. The country's highest point is Noshaq , at 7,492 m (24,580 ft) above sea level.

[ 269 ] The lowest point lies in Jowzjan Province along the Amu River bank, at 258 m (846 ft) above sea level.

The mountainous topography of Afghanistan Despite having numerous rivers and reservoirs , large parts of the country are dry. The endorheic Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the world.

[ 270 ] The Amu Darya rises at the north of the Hindu Kush, while the nearby Hari Rud flows west towards Herat , and the Arghandab River from the central region southwards. To the south and west of the Hindu Kush flow a number of streams that are tributaries of the Indus River , [ 266 ] such as the Helmand River . The Kabul River flows in an easterly direction to the Indus ending at the Indian Ocean.

[ 271 ] Afghanistan receives heavy snow during the winter in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains , and the melting snow in the spring season enters the rivers, lakes, and streams .

[ 272 ] [ 273 ] However, two-thirds of the country's water flows into the neighboring countries of Iran , Pakistan, and Turkmenistan . As reported in 2010, the state needs more than US$2 billion to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.

[ 274 ] In Afghanistan, forest cover is around 2% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,208,440 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, which was unchanged from 1990. Of the naturally regenerating forest, 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership .

[ 275 ] [ 276 ] The northeastern Hindu Kush mountain range , in and around the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, is in a geologically active area where earthquakes may occur almost every year.

[ 277 ] They can be deadly and destructive, causing landslides in some parts or avalanches during the winter.

[ 278 ] In June 2022, a destructive 5.9 earthquake struck near the border with Pakistan, killing at least 1,150 people and sparking fears of a major humanitarian crisis.

[ 279 ] On 7 October 2023, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck northwest of Herat, killing over 1,400 people.

[ 280 ] Climate Köppen climate map of Afghanistan [ 281 ] Afghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands , the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan ), and the Wakhan Corridor , where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), [ 266 ] and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July [ 269 ] [ 282 ] and can go over 43 °C (109 °F).

[ 266 ] The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April. The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east. Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, [ 266 ] except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain.

[ 283 ] Although Afghanistan has contributed minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions , it is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and least prepared to cope with its impacts.

[ 284 ] Climate change in Afghanistan is causing more frequent and severe droughts.

[ 285 ] [ 286 ] Severe drought conditions affect 25 of the country's 34 provinces, impacting over half the population.

[ 287 ] These droughts cause desertification , [ 287 ] [ 288 ] reduce food [ 289 ] and water security , [ 290 ] disrupt agriculture and cause internal displacement .

[ 291 ] Extreme rainfall over short periods is also more likely, increasing the risk of floods and landslides .

[ 292 ] Due to rising temperatures, almost 14% of Afghanistan's glacier coverage was lost between 1990 and 2015 [ 293 ] increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods .

[ 294 ] By 2050, climate change could displace an additional 5 million people within Afghanistan.

[ 291 ] [ 295 ] Biodiversity Main article: Wildlife of Afghanistan The snow leopard is the official national animal of Afghanistan.

Several types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan.

Snow leopards , Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions. The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan. Foxes, wolves , otters , deer , wild sheep , lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east. In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs , gophers , and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas .

[ 296 ] Gazelles , wild pigs and jackals populate the steppe plains of the south and west, while mongoose and cheetahs exist in the semi-desert south.

[ 296 ] Marmots and ibex also live in the high mountains of Afghanistan, and pheasants exist in some parts of the country.

[ 297 ] The Afghan hound is a native breed of dog known for its fast speed and its long hair; it is relatively known in the west.

[ 298 ] Endemic fauna of Afghanistan includes the Afghan flying squirrel , Afghan snowfinch , Paradactylodon (or the " Paghman mountain salamander"), Stigmella kasyi , Vulcaniella kabulensis , Afghan leopard gecko , Wheeleria parviflorellus , among others. Endemic flora include Iris afghanica . Afghanistan has a wide variety of birds despite its relatively arid climate – an estimated 460 species of which 235 breed within.

[ 298 ] The forest region of Afghanistan has vegetation such as pine trees , spruce trees , fir trees and larches , whereas the steppe grassland regions consist of broadleaf trees , short grass, perennial plants and shrublands . The colder high elevation regions are composed of hardy grasses and small flowering plants.

[ 296 ] Several regions are designated protected areas ; there are three national parks : Band-e Amir , Wakhan and Nuristan . Afghanistan had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.85/10, ranking it 15th globally out of 172 countries.

[ 299 ] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Afghanistan The Arg (the Presidential palace) in Kabul, photographed in 2020 Following the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive , the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate. A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September.

[ 300 ] As of July 2025 [update] , only the Russian Federation has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan.

[ 301 ] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Afghanistan in 2023 was the third least electoral democratic country in Asia .

[ 302 ] A traditional instrument of governance in Afghanistan is the loya jirga (grand assembly), a Pashtun consultative meeting that was mainly organized for choosing a new head of state , adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.

[ 303 ] Loya jirgas have been held since at least 1747, [ 304 ] with the most recent one occurring from June to July 2022.

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] President Ashraf Ghani , having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan , emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan.

[ 310 ] [ 311 ] Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious.

[ 312 ] Hours after the final flight of American troops left Kabul on 30 August, a Taliban official interviewed said that a new government would likely be announced as early as Friday 3 September after Jumu'ah . It was added that Hibatullah Akhundzada would be officially named Emir , with cabinet ministers being revealed at the Arg in an official ceremony. Abdul Ghani Baradar would be named head of government as Prime Minister , while other important positions would go to Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob . Beneath the supreme leader, day-to-day governance will be entrusted to the cabinet .

[ 313 ] In a report by CNN-News18, sources said the new government was going to be governed similarly to Iran with Hibatullah Akhundzada as supreme leader similar to the role of Saayid Ali Khamenei , and would be based out of Kandahar . Baradar or Yaqoob would be head of government as Prime minister . The government's ministries and agencies will be under a cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister. The Supreme Leader would preside over an executive body known as the Supreme Council with anywhere from 11 to 72 members.

Abdul Hakim Haqqani is likely to be promoted to Chief justice . According to the report, the new government will take place within the framework of an amended 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan .

[ 314 ] Government formation was delayed due to concerns about forming a broad-based government acceptable to the international community.

[ 315 ] It was later added however that the Taliban's Rahbari Shura, the group's leadership council was divided between the hardline Haqqani Network and moderate Abdul Ghani Baradar over appointments needed to form an "inclusive" government. Reports claimed that this culminated in a skirmish which led to Baradar being injured and treated in Pakistan, however this was denied by Baradar himself.

[ 316 ] [ 317 ] As of early September 2021 the Taliban were planning the cabinet to be men-only. Journalists and other human rights activists, mostly women, protested in Herat and Kabul, calling for women to be included.

[ 318 ] The acting Cabinet announced on 7 September was men-only, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs was abolished.

[ 300 ] As of July 2025, only Russia has recognized the Taliban government as the legitimate authorities of Afghanistan.

[ 301 ] The U.N has stated that recognition was impossible so long as restrictions on female education and employment remained.

[ 319 ] [ 320 ] On 16 September 2024, the Taliban suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, as reported by the United Nations, posing a significant risk to global polio eradication efforts.

[ 321 ] Administrative divisions Main articles: Provinces of Afghanistan and Districts of Afghanistan Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces ( wilayat ).

[ 322 ] Each province has a governor and a capital. The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts , each of which normally covers a city or several villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The provincial governors are now appointed by the Prime Minister of Afghanistan , and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors.

[ 323 ] The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for four years.

[ 324 ] The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. In practice however, mayors are appointed by the government.

[ 325 ] Afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces , which are further divided into a number of districts .

The 34 provinces in alphabetical order are: Badakhshan Badghis Baghlan Balkh Bamyan Daykundi Farah Faryab Ghazni Ghor Helmand Herat Jowzjan Kabul Kandahar Kapisa Khost Kunar Kunduz Laghman Logar Nangarhar Nimruz Nuristan Oruzgan Paktia Paktika Panjshir Parwan Samangan Sar-e Pol Takhar Wardak Zabul Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Afghanistan See also: Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan) Afghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946.

[ 326 ] Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India , with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950.

[ 327 ] Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.

The present Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is currently partially recognized , but has had notable unofficial ties with China , Pakistan, and Qatar.

[ 328 ] [ 329 ] Under the previous Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United States , Canada , United Kingdom , Germany , Australia, and Turkey . In 2012, the United States and the then-republic in Afghanistan signed their Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a major non-NATO ally .

[ 330 ] Such qualification was rescinded by US President Joe Biden in July 2022.

[ 331 ] Military Main article: Afghan Armed Forces The Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul . The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion.

[ 332 ] [ 333 ] Human rights See also: Human rights in Afghanistan , Women in Afghanistan , LGBT rights in Afghanistan , Treatment of women by the Taliban , and Afghan refugees Homosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; [ 334 ] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison.

[ 335 ] Under Sharia law offenders can be punished by death .

[ 336 ] [ 337 ] However, an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.

Religious minorities such as Sikhs, [ 338 ] Hindus, [ 339 ] and Christians have reportedly faced persecution.

[ 340 ] [ 341 ] Since May 2022, all women in Afghanistan have been required by law to wear full-body coverings when in public (either a burqa or an abaya paired with a niqāb , which leaves only the eyes uncovered).

[ 342 ] [ 343 ] First Deputy Leader Sirajuddin Haqqani claimed the decree is only advisory and no form of hijab is compulsory in Afghanistan, [ 344 ] though this contradicts the reality.

[ 345 ] It has been speculated that there is a genuine internal policy division over women's rights between hardliners, including leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and pragmatists, though they publicly present a united front.

[ 346 ] Another decree was issued shortly after the first, requiring female TV presenters to cover their faces during broadcasts.

[ 347 ] Since the Taliban takeover, suicides among women have become more common, and the country could now be one of the few where the rate of suicide among women surpasses that among men.

[ 348 ] [ 349 ] [ 350 ] In May 2022, the Taliban dissolved Afghanistan's Human Rights Commission along with four other government departments, citing the country's budget deficit.

[ 351 ] In January 2025, International Criminal Court issued two warrants against the Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the Chief judge , Abdul Hakim Haqqani , for committing crimes against humanity with the oppression and persecution of Afghan women and girls, and deprived of their freedom of movement, the rights to control their bodies, to education, and to a private and family life, while the alleged resistance and opposition were brutally suppressed with murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, since 2021. ICC member states are obliged to arrest wanted persons if they are on their territory.

[ 352 ] Economy Main article: Economy of Afghanistan Workers processing pomegranates ( anaar ), for which Afghanistan is famous in Asia Afghanistan's nominal GDP was $20.1 billion in 2020, or $81 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP).

[ 353 ] Its GDP per capita is $2,459 (PPP) and $611 by nominal.

[ 353 ] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, [ 354 ] it remains one of the world's least developed countries . Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability.

[ 266 ] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts . It has $2.8 billion in external debt .

[ 269 ] The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%).

[ 355 ] Da Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation [ 356 ] and the Afghani (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 75 Afghanis to 1 US dollar.

[ 357 ] A number of local and foreign banks operate in the country, including the Afghanistan International Bank , New Kabul Bank , Azizi Bank , Pashtany Bank , Standard Chartered Bank , and the First Micro Finance Bank .

Afghan rugs are one of Afghanistan's main exports.

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million expatriates , who brought with them entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. Many Afghans are now involved in construction, which is one of the largest industries in the country.

[ 358 ] Some of the major national construction projects include the $35 billion New Kabul City next to the capital, the Aino Mena project in Kandahar, and the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Town near Jalalabad.

[ 359 ] [ 360 ] [ 361 ] Similar development projects have also begun in Herat , Mazar-e-Sharif , and other cities.

[ 362 ] An estimated 400,000 people enter the labor market each year.

[ 363 ] Several small companies and factories began operating in different parts of the country, which not only provide revenues to the government but also create new jobs. Improvements to the business environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.

[ 364 ] Afghan rugs are becoming popular again, allowing many carpet dealers around the country to hire more workers; in 2016–17 it was the fourth most exported group of items.

[ 365 ] Afghanistan is a member of WTO , SAARC , ECO , and OIC . It holds an observer status in SCO . In 2018, a majority of imports come from either Iran, China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, while 84% of exports are to Pakistan and India.

[ 366 ] Since the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021, the United States has frozen about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank , [ 367 ] blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in US bank accounts.

[ 368 ] [ 369 ] The GDP of Afghanistan is estimated to have dropped by 20% following the Taliban return to power. Following this, after months of free-fall, the Afghan economy began stabilizing, as a result of the Taliban's restrictions on smuggled imports, limits on banking transactions, and UN aid. In 2023, the Afghan economy began seeing signs of revival. This has also been followed by stable exchange rates, low inflation, stable revenue collection, and the rise of trade in exports.

[ 370 ] In the third quarter of 2023, the Afghani rose to be the best performing currency in the world, climbing over 9% against the US dollar .

[ 371 ] Agriculture Afghan saffron Agricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy [ 372 ] and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018.

[ 373 ] The country is known for producing pomegranates , grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits. Afghanistan also became the world's top producer of cannabis in 2010.

[ 374 ] In March 2023, however, cannabis production was banned by a decree from Hibatullah Akhundzada.

[ 375 ] Saffron , the most expensive spice, grows in Afghanistan, particularly Herat Province . In recent years, there has been an uptick in saffron production, which authorities and farmers are using to try to replace poppy cultivation. Between 2012 and 2019, the saffron cultivated and produced in Afghanistan was consecutively ranked the world's best by the International Taste and Quality Institute.

[ 376 ] [ 377 ] Production hit record high in 2019 (19,469 kg of saffron), and one kilogram is sold domestically between $634 and $1147.

[ 378 ] The availability of cheap diesel-powered water pumps imported from China and Pakistan, and in the 2010s, of cheap solar power to pump water, resulted in expansion of agriculture and population in the southwestern deserts of Afghanistan in Kandahar , Helmand and Nimruz provinces in the 2010s. Wells have gradually been deepened, but water resources are limited. Opium is the major crop, but as of 2022, was under attack by the new Taliban government which, to suppress opium production, was systematically suppressing water pumping.

[ 379 ] [ 380 ] In a 2023 report, poppy cultivation in southern Afghanistan was reduced by over 80% as a result of Taliban campaigns to stop its use toward opium. This included a 99% reduction of opium growth in the Helmand Province .

[ 381 ] In November 2023, a U.N report showed that in the entirety of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation dropped by over 95%, removing it from its place as being the world's largest opium producer.

[ 382 ] [ 383 ] Mining Main article: Mining in Afghanistan Lapis lazuli stones The country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium , uranium , rare earth elements , chromite , gold, zinc , talc , barite , sulfur , lead, marble , precious and semi-precious stones , natural gas, and petroleum.

[ 384 ] [ 385 ] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion .

[ 386 ] Michael E. O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution estimated that if Afghanistan generates about $10 billion per year from its mineral deposits , its gross national product would double and provide long-term funding for critical needs.

[ 387 ] The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2006 that northern Afghanistan has an average 460 million m 3 (2.9 billion bbl) of crude oil , 440 billion m 3 (15.7 trillion cu ft) of natural gas, and 67 billion L (562 million US bbl) of natural gas liquids .

[ 388 ] In 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu Darya river in the north.

[ 389 ] The country has significant amounts of lithium , copper, gold, coal, iron ore, and other minerals .

[ 384 ] [ 385 ] [ 390 ] The Khanashin carbonatite in Helmand Province contains 1,000,000 tonnes (980,000 long tons ; 1,100,000 short tons ) of rare earth elements .

[ 391 ] In 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the Aynak copper mine to the China Metallurgical Group for $3 billion, [ 392 ] making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history.

[ 393 ] The state-run Steel Authority of India won the mining rights to develop the huge Hajigak iron ore deposit in central Afghanistan.

[ 394 ] Government officials estimate that 30% of the country's untapped mineral deposits are worth at least $1 trillion .

[ 386 ] One official asserted that "this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy" and a Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the "Saudi Arabia of lithium".

[ 395 ] The lithium reserves of 21 Mio. tons could amount to the ones of Bolivia , which is currently viewed as the country with the largest lithium reserves.

[ 396 ] Other larger deposits are the ones of bauxite and cobalt .

[ 396 ] Access to biocapacity in Afghanistan is lower than world average. In 2016, Afghanistan had 0.43 global hectares [ 397 ] of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.

[ 398 ] In 2016 Afghanistan used 0.73 global hectares of biocapacity per person—their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use just under double as much biocapacity as Afghanistan contains. As a result, Afghanistan is running a biocapacity deficit.

[ 397 ] In September 2023, the Taliban signed mining contracts worth $6.5 billion , with extractions based on gold, iron, lead, and zinc in the provinces of Herat, Ghor, Logar, and Takhar.

[ 399 ] Energy Main articles: Energy in Afghanistan and Renewable energy in Afghanistan Afghanistan electricity supply (1980–2019) According to the World Bank , 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008.

[ 400 ] Overall the figure stands at 98.7%.

[ 401 ] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states.

[ 402 ] The majority of electricity production is via hydropower , helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains.

[ 403 ] However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul.

[ 404 ] In recent years an increasing number of solar , biomass and wind power plants have been constructed.

[ 405 ] Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline.

[ 404 ] Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).

Important dams include the Kajaki Dam , Dahla Dam , and the Sardeh Band Dam .

[ 271 ] Tourism Main article: Tourism in Afghanistan Band-e Amir National Park Tourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues. Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016.

[ 406 ] In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity.

[ 407 ] [ 408 ] Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities.

[ 409 ] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail , attracting many Europeans and Americans. Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat , Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal .

[ 410 ] [ 411 ] Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict.

[ 412 ] The Minaret of Jam , a UNESCO World Heritage Site The city of Ghazni has significant history and historical sites, and together with Bamyan city have in recent years been voted Islamic Cultural Capital and South Asia Cultural Capital respectively.

[ 413 ] The cities of Herat , Kandahar , Balkh , and Zaranj are also very historic. The Minaret of Jam in the Hari River valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's prophet Muhammad is kept in the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar, a city founded by Alexander the Great and the first capital of Afghanistan. The citadel of Alexander in the western city of Herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction. In the north of the country is the Shrine of Ali , believed by many to be the location where Ali was buried.

[ 414 ] The National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul hosts a large number of Buddhist, Bactrian Greek and early Islamic antiquities; the museum suffered greatly by civil war but has been slowly restoring since the early 2000s.

[ 415 ] Unexpectedly, tourism has seen improvement in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover. Active efforts by the Taliban encouraged tourism to increase from 691 tourists in 2021, to 2,300 in 2022, to 5,200 in 2023, with some estimates of between 7,000 and 10,000.

[ 416 ] [ 417 ] [ 418 ] This is, however, threatened by the Islamic State – Khorasan Province , who took responsibility for attacks on tourists, such as the 2024 Bamyan shooting .

[ 419 ] Communication Main article: Communications in Afghanistan Telecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom , Afghan Wireless , Etisalat , MTN Group , and Roshan . The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1 , which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers. By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users. The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide.

[ 420 ] Transportation Main article: Transport in Afghanistan See also: List of airports in Afghanistan and Rail transport in Afghanistan The Salang Tunnel Due to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult. The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1 , often called the "Ring Road", which extends for 2,210 kilometres (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, [ 421 ] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush.

[ 422 ] The Ring Road is crucially important for domestic and international trade and the economy.

[ 423 ] A key portion of the Ring Road is the Salang Tunnel , completed in 1964, which facilitates travel through the Hindu Kush mountain range and connects northern and southern Afghanistan.

[ 424 ] It is the only land route that connects Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent .

[ 425 ] Several mountain passes allow travel between the Hindu Kush in other areas. Serious traffic accidents are common on Afghan roads and highways, particularly on the Kabul–Kandahar and the Kabul–Jalalabad Road .

[ 426 ] Traveling by bus in Afghanistan remains dangerous due to militant activities.

[ 427 ] An Ariana Afghan Airlines Airbus A310 in 2006 Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines , [ 428 ] and by the private company Kam Air . Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include Air India , Emirates , Gulf Air , Iran Aseman Airlines , Pakistan International Airlines , and Turkish Airlines . The country has four international airports: Kabul International Airport (formerly Hamid Karzai International Airport), Kandahar International Airport , Herat International Airport , and Mazar-e Sharif International Airport . Including domestic airports, there are 43.

[ 269 ] Bagram Air Base is a major military airfield.

The country has three rail links: one, a 75-kilometre (47 mi) line from Mazar-i-Sharif to the Uzbekistan border ; [ 429 ] a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long line from Toraghundi to the Turkmenistan border (where it continues as part of Turkmen Railways ); and a short link from Aqina across the Turkmen border to Kerki , which is planned to be extended further across Afghanistan.

[ 430 ] These lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service. A rail line between Khaf , Iran and Herat , western Afghanistan, intended for both freight and passengers, was under construction as of 2019.

[ 431 ] [ 432 ] About 125 kilometres (78 mi) of the line will lie on the Afghan side.

[ 433 ] [ 434 ] Private vehicle ownership has increased substantially since the early 2000s. Taxis are yellow and consist of both cars and auto rickshaws .

[ 435 ] In rural Afghanistan, villagers often use donkeys, mules or horses to transport or carry goods. Camels are primarily used by the Kochi nomads.

[ 298 ] Bicycles are popular throughout Afghanistan.

[ 436 ] Demographics Main articles: Afghans , Demographics of Afghanistan , and Afghan diaspora A Cold War-era CIA map showing traditional Afghan tribal territories.

Pashtun tribes form the world's largest tribal society.

[ 437 ] Population The population of Afghanistan was estimated at 35.7 million as of 2024 by the Afghanistan National Statistics and Information Authority , [ 26 ] whereas the UN estimates over 42.0 million.

[ 31 ] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million.

[ 438 ] About 25.3% are urbanite , 70.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.3% are nomadic.

[ 26 ] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran , most of whom were born and raised in those two countries. As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.

The current population growth rate is 2.37%, [ 269 ] one of the highest in the world outside of Africa. This population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050 if current population trends continue.

[ 439 ] The population of Afghanistan increased steadily until the 1980s, when civil war caused millions to flee to other countries such as Pakistan.

[ 440 ] Millions have since returned and the war conditions contribute to the country having the highest fertility rate outside Africa.

[ 441 ] Afghanistan's healthcare has recovered since the turn of the century, causing falls in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy, although it has the lowest life expectance of any country outside Africa. This (along with other factors such as returning refugees) caused rapid population growth in the 2000s that has only recently started to slow down.

[ citation needed ] The Gini coefficient in 2008 was 27.8.

[ 442 ] Fertility rate Afghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4.

[ 443 ] In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate.

[ 444 ] The rate has fallen since the early 1980s.

[ 445 ] Urbanization As estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020. This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia , Nepal and Sri Lanka . Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul , due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants.

[ 446 ] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities.

[ 447 ] Kabul is the largest city, with a population of 5 million.

[ 26 ] The other large cities are located generally in the "ring" around the Central Highlands, namely Kandahar in the south, Herat in the west, Mazar-i-Sharif , Kunduz in the north, and Jalalabad in the east.

According to research data by several institutions in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 42%, followed by Tajiks , comprising 27% [ 4 ] [ 449 ] [ 450 ] [ 5 ] of the country's population. The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks , each at 9%. A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem .

[ 451 ] Dari and Pashto are the official languages of Afghanistan; bilingualism is very common.

[ 452 ] Dari, which is also referred to as Eastern Persian as it is a variety of and mutually intelligible with Persian (and very often called ' Farsi ' by some Afghans like in Iran ), functions as the lingua franca in Kabul as well as in much of the northern and northwestern parts of the country.

[ 453 ] Native speakers of Dari, of any ethnicity, are sometimes called Farsiwans .

[ 454 ] Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns , although many of them are also fluent in Dari while some non-Pashtuns are fluent in Pashto. Despite the Pashtuns having been dominant in Afghan politics for centuries, Dari remained the preferred language for government and bureaucracy.

[ 455 ] According to CIA World Factbook , Dari Persian is spoken by 78% ( L1 + L2 ) and functions as the lingua franca, while Pashto is spoken by 50%, Uzbek 10%, English 5%, Turkmen 2%, Urdu 2%, Pashayi 1%, Nuristani 1%, Arabic 1%, and Balochi 1% (2021 est). Data represent the most widely spoken languages; shares sum to more than 100% because there is much bilingualism in the country and because respondents were allowed to select more than one language. There are a number of smaller regional languages, including Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi, and Nuristani.

[ 269 ] When it comes to foreign languages among the populace, many are able to speak or understand Hindustani ( Urdu - Hindi ), partly due to returning Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the popularity of Bollywood films respectively.

[ 456 ] English is also understood by some of the population, [ 457 ] and has been gaining popularity as of the 2000s.

[ 458 ] Some Afghans retain some ability in Russian, which was taught in public schools during the 1980s .

[ 456 ] Religion Main article: Religion in Afghanistan Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif is the largest mosque in Afghanistan.

The CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim [ 269 ] and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school.

[ 459 ] According to Pew Research Center , as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational .

By the end of the twentieth century, nearly the entire community had emigrated to Israel and the United States, with one known exception, Herat-born Zablon Simintov . He remained for years, being the caretaker of the only remaining Afghan synagogue. He left the country for the US after the second Taliban takeover. A woman who left shortly after him has since been identified as the likely last Jew in Afghanistan.

[ 474 ] The top universities in Afghanistan are the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) followed by Kabul University (KU), both of which are located in Kabul. The National Military Academy of Afghanistan , modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point, was a four-year military development institution dedicated to graduating officers for the Afghan Armed Forces . The Afghan Defense University was constructed near Qargha in Kabul. Major universities outside of Kabul include Kandahar University in the south, Herat University in the northwest, Balkh University and Kunduz University in the north, Nangarhar University and Khost University in the east.

[ 489 ] Culture Main article: Culture of Afghanistan An Afghan family near Kholm , 1939 – most Afghans are tribal.

Afghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country.

[ 266 ] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch .

[ 490 ] In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way).

[ 491 ] Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality , the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood.

[ 492 ] The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau . The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic . Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization , while some Pashtuns have been Persianized . Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations. The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious.

[ 459 ] Afghans, particularly Pashtuns, are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor.

[ 493 ] There are various Afghan tribes , and an estimated 2–3 million nomads .

[ 494 ] Afghan culture is deeply Islamic , [ 495 ] but pre-Islamic practices persist.

[ 496 ] Child marriage is prevalent; [ 497 ] the legal age for marriage is 16.

[ 490 ] About 15% of the population are nomadic , locally called kochis .

[ 266 ] When nomads pass villages they often buy supplies such as tea, wheat and kerosene from the villagers; villagers buy wool and milk from the nomads.

[ 490 ] Afghan clothing for both men and women typically consists of various forms of shalwar kameez , especially perahan tunban and khet partug . Women would normally wear a chador for head covering; some women, typically from highly conservative communities, wear the burqa , a full body covering. These were worn by some women of the Pashtun community well before Islam came to the region, but the Taliban enforced this dress on women when they were in power.

[ 500 ] Another popular dress is the chapan which acts as a coat. The karakul is a hat made from the fur of a specific regional breed of sheep. It was favored by former kings of Afghanistan and became known to much of the world in the 21st century when it was constantly worn by President Hamid Karzai .

[ 501 ] The pakol is another traditional hat originating from the far east of the country; it was popularly worn by the guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud .

[ 502 ] The Mazari hat originates from northern Afghanistan.

Among the most well known are the Great Mosque of Herat , the Blue Mosque , the Minaret of Jam , the Chil Zena , the Qala-i Bost in Lashkargah , the ancient Greek city of Ai-Khanoum .

[ 504 ] However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars.

[ 505 ] The two famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous . As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at Paghman and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s. Afghan architecture also ranges deep into India such as the city of Agra , [ 506 ] and the tomb of Sher Shah Suri , an Afghan Emperor of India .

^ "The name Afghan has evidently been derived from Asvakan, the Assakenoi of Arrian... " (Megasthenes and Arrian, p 180. See also: Alexander's Invasion of India, p 38; J.W. McCrindle).

"Even the name Afghan is Aryan being derived from Asvakayana, an important clan of the Asvakas or horsemen who must have derived this title from their handling of celebrated breeds of horses" (See: Imprints of Indian Thought and Culture Abroad, p 124, Vivekananda Kendra Prakashan).

Cf: "Their name (Afghan) means "cavalier" being derived from the Sanskrit , Asva , or Asvaka , a horse, and shows that their country must have been noted in ancient times, as it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. Asvaka was an important tribe settled north to Kabul river, which offered a gallant resistance but ineffectual resistance to the arms of Alexander." ( Scottish Geographical Magazine , 1999, p. 275, Royal Scottish Geographical Society) "Afghans are Assakani of the Greeks ; this word being the Sanskrit Ashvaka meaning 'horsemen'." ( Sva , 1915, p. 113, Christopher Molesworth Birdwood) Cf: "The name represents Sanskrit Asvaka in the sense of a cavalier , and this reappears scarcely modified in the Assakani or Assakeni of the historians of the expedition of Alexander " (Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological . Henry Yule, A. D. Burnell).

The Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower. Large numbers of Afghans were killed to suppress resistance to the army of the Soviet Union, which wished to vindicate its client regime and realize its goal in Afghanistan.

During the intervening fourteen years of Communist rule, an estimated 1.5 to 2 million Afghan civilians were killed by Soviet forces and their proxies- the four Communist regimes in Kabul, and the East Germans, Bulgarians, Czechs, Cubans, Palestinians, Indians and others who assisted them. These were not battle casualties or the unavoidable civilian victims of warfare. Soviet and local Communist forces seldom attacked the scattered guerilla bands of the Afghan Resistance except, in a few strategic locales like the Panjsher valley. Instead they deliberately targeted the civilian population, primarily in the rural areas.

According to widely reported accounts, substantial programmes of depopulation have been conducted in these Afghan provinces: Ghazni, Nagarhar, Lagham, Qandahar, Zabul, Badakhshan, Lowgar, Paktia, Paktika and Kunar...There is considerable evidence that genocide has been committed against the Afghan people by the combined forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.

Seventy-seven percent support the presence of U.S. forces; 67 percent say the same of NATO/ISAF forces more generally. Despite the country's travails, eight in 10 say it was a good thing for the United States to oust the Taliban in 2001. And much more blame either the Taliban or al Qaeda for the country's violence, 53 percent, than blame the United States, 12 percent. The latter is about half what it was in 2012, coinciding with a sharp reduction in the U.S. deployment.
