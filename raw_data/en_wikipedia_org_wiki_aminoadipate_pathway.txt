In the eukaryotes , this pathway is unique to several species of yeast , higher fungi (containing chitin in their cell walls), and the euglenids .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It has also been reported from bacteria of the genus Thermus [ 6 ] and also in Pyrococcus horikoshii , [ 7 ] potentially suggesting a wider distribution than previously thought. This uniqueness of the pathway makes it a potentially interesting target for antimycotics .

[ 3 ] Pathway overview [ edit ] Comparison of parts of the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway (left) and α-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway (right).

This pathway is a part of the glutamate family of amino acid biosynthetic pathways.

[ 2 ] The reaction steps in the pathway are similar to the citric acid cycle .

The first step in the pathway is condensation of acetyl-CoA with α-ketoglutarate , which gives homocitrate . This reaction is catalyzed by homocitrate synthase . Homocitrate is then converted to homoaconitate by homoaconitase and then to homoisocitrate . This is then decarboxylated by homoisocitrate dehydrogenase , which results in α-ketoadipate . A nitrogen atom is added from glutamate by aminoadipate aminotransferase to form the α-aminoadipate , from which this pathway gets its name. This is then reduced by aminoadipate reductase via an acyl-enzyme intermediate to a semialdehyde. Reaction with glutamate by one class of saccharopine dehydrogenase yields saccharopine which is then cleaved by a second saccharopine dehydrogenase to yield lysine and oxoglutarate.

[ 2 ] Conversion of lysine to α-ketoadipate during degradation of lysine proceeds via the same steps, but in reverse.
