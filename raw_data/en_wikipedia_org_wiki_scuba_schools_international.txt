SSI has over 3,500 authorized dealers, 35 regional centers, and offices all over the world.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] SSI was founded by Robert Clark in 1970.

[ 2 ] SSI headquarters was in Fort Collins, Colorado , and it is owned by Concept Systems International, Inc. In 2008, it was acquired by Doug McNeese, owner of the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (USA) until its merger with SSI in 1999, and Robert Stoss, manager of Scubapro and Seemann Sub.  On January 1, 2014, SSI was acquired by HEAD, which also includes the Mares brand of diving equipment, HEAD NV , for €4.9m.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The current SSI headquarters is located in Wendelstein, Bavaria .

Training [ edit ] SSI offers internationally recognized recreational diver training programs - starting with snorkeling and entry level scuba diving courses up to instructor certifications. The most common programs are: SSI Open Water Diver (OWD) and Advanced Open Water Diver (AOWD). There are more than 30 different specialty courses. Dive leader training programs start with the Assistant Instructor followed by Open Water Instructor and above.

[ 5 ] SSI's training program for children aged 8–12 years is called SSI Explorers.

[ 6 ] The training program for technical divers is called Extended Range and includes decompression diving , trimix and other courses that exceed the limit for recreational divers.

[ 7 ] Furthermore, SSI offers courses in Freediving, Mermaiding, Swimming & Lifegaurd.

SSI scuba certifications are recognized throughout the world (such as RSTC - Recreational Scuba Training Council , EUF - European Underwater Federation , CUA - China Underwater Association and others).

[ 1 ] The main difference to other dive training organizations is that SSI instructors are only allowed to teach at SSI Dive Centers or SSI accredited dive clubs that adopt a franchise -like concept.

[ 8 ] SSI is a member of the following councils of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council - the United States RSTC , the RSTC Europe and C-Card Council (Japan) .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It is also a member of the European Underwater Federation.
