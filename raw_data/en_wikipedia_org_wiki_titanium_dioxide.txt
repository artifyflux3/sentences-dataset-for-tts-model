Y verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Titanium dioxide , also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania / t aɪ ˈ t eɪ n i ə / , is the inorganic compound derived from titanium with the chemical formula TiO 2 . When used as a pigment , it is called titanium white , Pigment White 6 ( PW6 ), or CI 77891 .

[ 4 ] It is a white solid that is insoluble in water, although mineral forms can appear black. As a pigment, it has a wide range of applications, including paint , sunscreen , and food coloring . When used as a food coloring, it has E number E171. World production in 2014 exceeded 9 million tonnes.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It has been estimated that titanium dioxide is used in two-thirds of all pigments, and pigments based on the oxide have been valued at a price of $13.2 billion.

[ 8 ] Structure [ edit ] Structure of anatase . Together with rutile and brookite, one of the three major polymorphs of TiO 2 .

In all three of its main dioxides, titanium exhibits octahedral geometry , being bonded to six oxide anions.  The oxides in turn are bonded to three Ti centers.  The overall crystal structures of rutile and anatase are tetragonal in symmetry whereas brookite is orthorhombic. The oxygen substructures are all slight distortions of close packing : in rutile, the oxide anions are arranged in distorted hexagonal close-packing, whereas they are close to cubic close-packing in anatase and to "double hexagonal close-packing" for brookite. The rutile structure is widespread for other metal dioxides and difluorides, e.g. RuO 2 and ZnF 2 .

Molten titanium dioxide has a local structure in which each Ti is coordinated to, on average, about 5 oxygen atoms.

[ 9 ] This is distinct from the crystalline forms in which Ti coordinates to 6 oxygen atoms.

Synthetic and geologic occurrence [ edit ] Synthetic TiO 2 is mainly produced from the mineral ilmenite .

Rutile , and anatase , naturally occurring TiO 2 , occur widely also, e.g. rutile as a 'heavy mineral' in beach sand.

Leucoxene , fine-grained anatase formed by natural alteration of ilmenite, is yet another ore.

Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from oriented inclusions of rutile needles.

[ 10 ] Mineralogy and uncommon polymorphs [ edit ] Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as the minerals rutile and anatase .  Additionally two high-pressure forms are known minerals: a monoclinic baddeleyite -like form known as akaogiite , and the other has a slight monoclinic distortion of the orthorhombic α-PbO 2 structure and is known as riesite. Both of which can be found at the Ries crater in Bavaria .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] It is mainly sourced from ilmenite , which is the most widespread titanium dioxide-bearing ore around the world. Rutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98% titanium dioxide in the ore. The metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range 600–800 °C (1,110–1,470 °F).

[ 14 ] Titanium dioxide has twelve known polymorphs – in addition to rutile, anatase, brookite, akaogiite and riesite, three metastable phases can be produced synthetically ( monoclinic , tetragonal , and orthorhombic ramsdellite-like), and four high-pressure forms (α-PbO 2 -like, cotunnite -like, orthorhombic OI, and cubic phases) also exist: Form Crystal system Synthesis Rutile Tetragonal Anatase Tetragonal Brookite Orthorhombic TiO 2 (B) [ 15 ] Monoclinic Hydrolysis of K 2 Ti 4 O 9 followed by heating TiO 2 (H), hollandite -like form [ 16 ] Tetragonal Oxidation of the related potassium titanate bronze, K 0.25 TiO 2 TiO 2 (R), ramsdellite -like form [ 17 ] Orthorhombic Oxidation of the related lithium titanate bronze Li 0.5 TiO 2 TiO 2 (II)-( α-PbO 2 -like form) [ 18 ] Orthorhombic Akaogiite ( baddeleyite -like form, 7 coordinated Ti) [ 19 ] Monoclinic TiO 2 -OI [ 20 ] Orthorhombic Cubic form [ 21 ] Cubic P > 40 GPa, T > 1600 °C TiO 2 -OII, cotunnite ( PbCl 2 )-like [ 22 ] Orthorhombic P > 40 GPa, T > 700 °C The cotunnite -type phase was claimed to be the hardest known oxide with the Vickers hardness of 38 GPa and the bulk modulus of 431 GPa (i.e. close to diamond's value of 446 GPa) at atmospheric pressure.

[ 22 ] However, later studies came to different conclusions with much lower values for both the hardness (7–20 GPa, which makes it softer than common oxides like corundum Al 2 O 3 and rutile TiO 2 ) [ 23 ] and bulk modulus (~300 GPa).

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Titanium dioxide (B) is found as a mineral in magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins, as well as weathering rims on perovskite . TiO 2 also forms lamellae in other minerals.

[ 26 ] Production [ edit ] Industrial key players in the production of titanium dioxide - 2022 Evolution of the global production of titanium dioxide according to process The largest TiO 2 pigment processors are Chemours , Venator , Kronos [ de ] , and Tronox .

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Major paint and coating company end users for pigment grade titanium dioxide include Akzo Nobel , PPG Industries , Sherwin Williams , BASF , Kansai Paints and Valspar .

[ 29 ] Global TiO 2 pigment demand for 2010 was 5.3 Mt with annual growth expected to be about 3–4%.

[ 30 ] The production method depends on the feedstock.  In addition to ores, other feedstocks include upgraded slag . Both the chloride process and the sulfate process (both described below) produce titanium dioxide pigment in the rutile crystal form, but the sulfate process can be adjusted to produce the anatase form. Anatase, being softer, is used in fiber and paper applications. The sulfate process is run as a batch process ; the chloride process is run as a continuous process .

[ 31 ] Chloride process [ edit ] Main article: Chloride process In chloride process , the ore is treated with chlorine and carbon to give titanium tetrachloride , a volatile liquid that is further purified by distillation.  The TiCl4 is treated with oxygen to regenerate chlorine and produce the titanium dioxide.

Sulfate process [ edit ] In the sulfate process, ilmenite is treated with sulfuric acid to extract iron(II) sulfate pentahydrate . This process requires concentrated ilmenite (45–60% TiO 2 ) or pretreated feedstocks as a suitable source of titanium.

[ 32 ] The resulting synthetic rutile is further processed according to the specifications of the end user, i.e. pigment grade or otherwise.

[ 33 ] Examples of plants using the sulfate process are the Sorel-Tracy plant of QIT-Fer et Titane and the Eramet Titanium & Iron smelter in Tyssedal Norway.

[ 34 ] Becher process [ edit ] Main article: Becher process The Becher process is another method for the production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite. It first oxidizes the ilmenite as a means to separate the iron component.

Specialized methods [ edit ] For specialty applications, TiO 2 films are prepared by various specialized chemistries.

[ 35 ] Sol-gel routes involve the hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides such as titanium ethoxide : Ti(OEt) 4 + 2 H 2 O → TiO 2 + 4 EtOH A related approach that also relies on molecular precursors involves chemical vapor deposition . In this method, the alkoxide is volatilized and then decomposed on contact with a hot surface: Ti(OEt) 4 → TiO 2 + 2 Et 2 O Applications [ edit ] Pigment [ edit ] Main article: Titanium white First mass-produced in 1916, [ 36 ] titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index , in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials (see list of indices of refraction ). Titanium dioxide crystal size is ideally around 220 nm (measured by electron microscope) to optimize the maximum reflection of visible light. However, abnormal grain growth is often observed in titanium dioxide, particularly in its rutile phase.

[ 37 ] The occurrence of abnormal grain growth brings about a deviation of a small number of crystallites from the mean crystal size and modifies the physical behaviour of TiO 2 . The optical properties of the finished pigment are highly sensitive to purity. As little as a few parts per million (ppm) of certain metals (Cr, V, Cu, Fe, Nb) can disturb the crystal lattice so much that the effect can be detected in quality control.

[ 38 ] [ full citation needed ] Approximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO 2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as use continues to rise.

[ 39 ] TiO 2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, supplements , medicines (i.e. pills and tablets), and most toothpastes; in 2019 it was present in two-thirds of toothpastes on the French market.

[ 40 ] In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as "brilliant white", "the perfect white", "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.

Additive for food [ edit ] Often used as color in food, [ 41 ] it is commonly found in ice creams, chocolates, all types of candy, creamers, desserts, marshmallows, chewing gum, pastries, spreads, dressings, cakes, some cheeses, and many other foods.

[ 42 ] It is permitted in many countries, but was banned for use in food by the European Union in 2022. While permitted in the United States, Mars removed it from their Skittles confectionery in 2025, although a class-action lawsuit against the use of titanium dioxide in Skittles had been dismissed in 2022.

[ 43 ] Thin films [ edit ] When deposited as a thin film , its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors ; it is also used in generating decorative thin films such as found in "mystic fire topaz".

[ citation needed ] Some grades of modified titanium based pigments as used in sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and cosmetics – these are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – in order to have glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine -based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers.

[ 44 ] In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800 °C [ 45 ] One example of a pearlescent pigment is Iriodin, based on mica coated with titanium dioxide or iron (III) oxide.

[ 46 ] The iridescent effect in these titanium oxide particles is unlike the opaque effect obtained with usual ground titanium oxide pigment obtained by mining, in which case only a certain diameter of the particle is considered and the effect is due only to scattering.

Sunscreen and UV blocking pigments [ edit ] In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. As a sunscreen, ultrafine TiO 2 is used, which is notable in that combined with ultrafine zinc oxide , it is considered to be an effective sunscreen that lowers the incidence of sun burns and minimizes the premature photoaging , photocarcinogenesis and immunosuppression associated with long term excess sun exposure.

[ 47 ] Sometimes these UV blockers are combined with iron oxide pigments in sunscreen to increase visible light protection.

[ 48 ] Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are generally considered to be less harmful to coral reefs than sunscreens that include chemicals such as oxybenzone , octocrylene and octinoxate .

[ 49 ] [ better source needed ] Nanosized titanium dioxide is found in the majority of physical sunscreens because of its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 20–40 nm) [ 50 ] titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sunscreen lotion because they scatter visible light much less than titanium dioxide pigments, and can give UV protection.

[ 39 ] Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide , as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals. Nano-TiO 2 , which blocks both UV-A and UV-B radiation, is used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.

The EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety considered nano sized titanium dioxide to be safe for skin applications, in concentrations of up to 25 percent based on animal testing.

[ 51 ] The risk assessment of different titanium dioxide nanomaterials in sunscreen is currently evolving since nano-sized TiO 2 is different from the well-known micronized form.

[ 52 ] The rutile form is generally used in cosmetic and sunscreen products due to it not possessing any observed ability to damage the skin under normal conditions [ 53 ] and having a higher UV absorption .

[ 54 ] In 2016 Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) tests concluded that the use of nano titanium dioxide (95–100% rutile, ≦5% anatase) as a UV filter can be considered to not pose any risk of adverse effects in humans post-application on healthy skin, [ 55 ] except in the case the application method would lead to substantial risk of inhalation (ie; powder or spray formulations). This safety opinion applied to nano TiO 2 in concentrations of up to 25%.

[ 56 ] Initial studies indicated that nano-TiO 2 particles could penetrate the skin, causing concern over its use. These studies were later refuted, when it was discovered that the testing methodology couldn't differentiate between penetrated particles and particles simply trapped in hair follicles and that having a diseased or physically damaged dermis could be the true cause of insufficient barrier protection.

[ 52 ] SCCS research found that when nanoparticles had certain photostable coatings (e.g., alumina , silica , cetyl phosphate, triethoxycaprylylsilane , manganese dioxide ), the photocatalytic activity was attenuated and no notable skin penetration was observed; the sunscreen in this research was applied at amounts of 10 mg/cm2 for exposure periods of 24 hours.

[ 56 ] Coating TiO 2 with alumina, silica, zircon or various polymers can minimize avobenzone degradation [ 57 ] and enhance UV absorption by adding an additional light diffraction mechanism.

[ 54 ] TiO 2 is used extensively in plastics and other applications as a white pigment or an opacifier and for its UV resistant properties where the powder disperses light – unlike organic UV absorbers – and reduces UV damage, due mostly to the particle's high refractive index.

[ 58 ] Other uses of titanium dioxide [ edit ] In ceramic glazes , titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.

It is used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils . Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes which are both oil and water dispersible, and in certain grades for the cosmetic industry. It is also a common ingredient in toothpaste.

The exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was likely the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid .

[ 59 ] Titanium dioxide is an n-type semiconductor and is used in dye-sensitized solar cells .

[ 60 ] It is also used in other electronics components such as electrodes in batteries.

[ 61 ] Research [ edit ] Patenting activities [ edit ] Relevant patent families describing titanium dioxide production from ilmenite, 2002–2021.

Academic and public institutions having significant patent activity in titanium dioxide production, 2022.

Between 2002 and 2022, there were 459 patent families that describe the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite . The majority of these patents describe pre-treatment processes, such as using smelting and magnetic separation to increase titanium concentration in low-grade ores, leading to titanium concentrates or slags. Other patents describe processes to obtain titanium dioxide, either by a direct hydrometallurgical process or through the main industrial production processes, the sulfate process and the chloride process .

[ 62 ] The sulfate process represents 40% of the world’s titanium dioxide production and is protected in 23% of patent families. The chloride process is only mentioned in 8% of patent families, although it provides 60% of the worldwide industrial production of titanium dioxide.

[ 62 ] Key contributors to patents on the production of titanium dioxide are companies from China, Australia and the United States, reflecting the major contribution of these countries to industrial production. Chinese companies Pangang and Lomon Billions Groups hold major patent portfolios.

[ 62 ] Photocatalyst [ edit ] Nanosized titanium dioxide, particularly in the anatase form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of anatase, [ 63 ] [ 64 ] although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase, [ 65 ] as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit . Interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst.

[ 66 ] It has been reported that titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, exhibits excitation also under visible light.

[ 67 ] The strong oxidative potential of the positive holes oxidizes water to create hydroxyl radicals . It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing, and anti-fouling properties, and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst . It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells , which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).

The photocatalytic properties of nanosized titanium dioxide were discovered by Akira Fujishima in 1967 [ 68 ] and published in 1972.

[ 69 ] The process on the surface of the titanium dioxide was called the Honda-Fujishima effect [ ja ] .

[ 68 ] In thin film and nanoparticle form, titanium dioxide has the potential for use in energy production: As a photocatalyst, it can break water into hydrogen and oxygen. With the hydrogen collected, it could be used as a fuel. The efficiency of this process can be greatly improved by doping the oxide with carbon.

[ 70 ] Further efficiency and durability has been obtained by introducing disorder to the lattice structure of the surface layer of titanium dioxide nanocrystals, permitting infrared absorption.

[ 71 ] Visible-light-active nanosized anatase and rutile has been developed for photocatalytic applications.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] In 1995 Fujishima and his group discovered the superhydrophilicity phenomenon for titanium dioxide coated glass exposed to sun light.

[ 68 ] This resulted in the development of self-cleaning glass and anti-fogging coatings.

Nanosized TiO 2 incorporated into outdoor building materials, such as paving stones in noxer blocks [ 74 ] or paints, could reduce concentrations of airborne pollutants such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides .

[ 75 ] A TiO 2 -containing cement has been produced.

[ 76 ] Using TiO 2 as a photocatalyst, attempts have been made to mineralize pollutants (to convert into CO 2 and H 2 O) in waste water.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] The photocatalytic destruction of organic matter could also be exploited in coatings with antimicrobial applications.

[ 80 ] Hydroxyl radical formation [ edit ] Although nanosized anatase TiO 2 does not absorb visible light, it does strongly absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation ( hv ), leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals.

[ 81 ] This occurs when photo-induced valence bond holes (h + vb ) are trapped at the surface of TiO 2 leading to the formation of trapped holes (h + tr ) that cannot oxidize water.

[ 82 ] TiO 2 + hv → e − + h + vb h + vb → h + tr O 2 + e − → O 2 •− O 2 •− + O 2 •− + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 + O 2 O 2 •− + h + vb → O 2 O 2 •− + h + tr → O 2 OH − + h + vb → HO• e − + h + tr → recombination Note: Wavelength (λ)= 387 nm [ 82 ] This reaction has been found to mineralize and decompose undesirable compounds in the environment, specifically the air and in wastewater.

[ 82 ] Synthetic single crystals of TiO 2 , c. 2–3 mm in size, cut from a larger plate Nanotubes [ edit ] Anatase can be converted into non-carbon nanotubes and nanowires .

[ 83 ] Hollow TiO 2 nanofibers can be also prepared by coating carbon nanofibers by first applying titanium butoxide .

[ 84 ] SEM (top) and TEM (bottom) images of chiral TiO 2 nanofibers [ 84 ] Titanium oxide nanotubes, SEM image Nanotubes of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 -Nt) obtained by electrochemical synthesis. The SEM image shows an array of vertical self-ordered TiO 2 -Nt with closed bottom ends of tubes.

Solubility [ edit ] Titanium dioxide is insoluble in water, organic solvents, and inorganic acids. It is slightly soluble in alkali , soluble in saturated potassium acid carbonate, and can be completely dissolved in strong sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid after boiling for a long time.

[ 85 ] Health and safety [ edit ] Widely occurring minerals and even gemstones are composed of TiO 2 . All natural titanium, comprising more than 0.5% of the Earth's crust, exists as oxides.

[ 86 ] Food additive [ edit ] As of 2024, titanium dioxide is considered safe by the US FDA as a color ingredient for oral human consumption as long as it is 1% or less of the total food composition.

[ 87 ] A 2021 ban by the EU EFSA has been criticized as based on errors regarding the safety of titanium dioxide (E171) particles as a food additive, [ 88 ] and according to a 2022 review, existing evidence does not support a direct DNA damaging mechanism for titanium dioxide.

[ 89 ] Government policies [ edit ] TiO 2 whitener in food was banned in France from 2020, due to uncertainty about safe quantities for human consumption.

[ 90 ] In 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) ruled that as a consequence of new understandings of nanoparticles , titanium dioxide could "no longer be considered safe as a food additive", and the EU health commissioner announced plans to ban its use across the EU, with discussions beginning in June 2021. EFSA concluded that genotoxicity —which could lead to carcinogenic effects—could not be ruled out, and that a "safe level for daily intake of the food additive could not be established".

[ 91 ] In 2022, the UK Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland announced their disagreement with the EFSA ruling, and did not follow the EU in banning titanium dioxide as a food additive.

[ 92 ] Health Canada similarly reviewed the available evidence in 2022 and decided not to change their position on titanium dioxide as a food additive.

[ 93 ] The European Union removed the authorization to use titanium dioxide (E 171) in foods, effective 7 February 2022, with a six months grace period.

[ 94 ] As of May 2023, following the European Union 2022 ban, the U.S. states California and New York were considering banning the use of titanium dioxide in foods.

[ 95 ] As of 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States permits titanium dioxide as a food additive.

[ 87 ] It may be used to increase whiteness and opacity in dairy products (some cheeses, ice cream, and yogurt), candies, frostings, fillings, and many other foods. The FDA regulates the labeling of products containing titanium dioxide, allowing the product's ingredients list to identify titanium dioxide either as "color added" or "artificial colors" or "titanium dioxide;" it does not require that titanium dioxide be explicitly named.

[ 87 ] In 2023, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association , a manufacturer's trade group, defended the substance as safe at certain limits while allowing that additional studies could provide further insight, saying an immediate ban would be a "knee-jerk" reaction.

[ 96 ] Industry response [ edit ] Dunkin' Donuts dropped titanium dioxide from their merchandise in 2015 after public pressure.

[ 97 ] Research as an ingestible nanomaterial [ edit ] Size distribution analyses showed that batches of food-grade TiO₂, which is produced with a target particle size in the 200–300 nm range for optimal pigmentation qualities, include a nanoparticle-sized fraction as inevitable byproduct of the manufacturing processes.

[ 98 ] Inhalation [ edit ] Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen , meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans .

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends two separate exposure limits. NIOSH recommends that fine TiO 2 particles be set at an exposure limit of 2.4 mg/m 3 , while ultrafine TiO 2 be set at an exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m 3 , as time-weighted average concentrations up to 10 hours a day for a 40-hour work week.

[ 101 ] Although no evidence points to acute toxicity, recurring concerns have been expressed about nanophase forms of these materials. Studies of workers with high exposure to TiO 2 particles indicate that even at high exposure there is no adverse effect to human health.

[ 86 ] Environmental waste introduction [ edit ] Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is mostly introduced into the environment as nanoparticles via wastewater treatment plants.

[ 102 ] Cosmetic pigments including titanium dioxide enter the wastewater when the product is washed off into sinks after cosmetic use. Once in the sewage treatment plants, pigments separate into sewage sludge which can then be released into the soil when injected into the soil or distributed on its surface. 99% of these nanoparticles wind up on land rather than in aquatic environments due to their retention in sewage sludge.

[ 102 ] In the environment, titanium dioxide nanoparticles have low to negligible solubility and have been shown to be stable once particle aggregates are formed in soil and water surroundings.

[ 102 ] In the process of dissolution, water-soluble ions typically dissociate from the nanoparticle into solution when thermodynamically unstable. TiO 2 dissolution increases when there are higher levels of dissolved organic matter and clay in the soil. However, aggregation is promoted by pH at the isoelectric point of TiO 2 (pH= 5.8) which renders it neutral and solution ion concentrations above 4.5 mM.
