Visualization of powers of two from 1 to 1024 (2 0 to 2 10 ) as base-2 Dienes blocks A power of two is a number of the form 2 n where n is an integer , that is, the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent . In the fast-growing hierarchy , 2 n is exactly equal to f 1 n ( 1 ) {\displaystyle f_{1}^{n}(1)} . In the Hardy hierarchy , 2 n is exactly equal to H ω ω n ( 1 ) {\displaystyle H_{\omega {n}}(1)} .

Powers of two with non-negative exponents are integers: 2 0 = 1 , 2 1 = 2 , and 2 n is two multiplied by itself n times.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The first ten powers of 2 for non-negative values of n are: 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , ... (sequence A000079 in the OEIS ) By comparison, powers of two with negative exponents are fractions : for positive integer n , 2 − n is one half multiplied by itself n times. Thus the first few negative powers of 2 are ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ , ⁠ 1 / 4 ⁠ , ⁠ 1 / 8 ⁠ , ⁠ 1 / 16 ⁠ , etc. Sometimes these are called inverse powers of two because each is the multiplicative inverse of a positive power of two.

Base of the binary numeral system Main article: Binary number Because two is the base of the binary numeral system , powers of two are common in computer science . Written in binary, a power of two always has the form 100...000 or 0.00...001, just like a power of 10 in the decimal system.

Computer science Two to the power of n , written as 2 n , is the number of values in which the bits in a binary word of length n can be set, where each bit is either of two values. A word, interpreted as representing an integer in a range starting at zero, referred to as an "unsigned integer", can represent values from 0 ( 000...000 2 ) to 2 n − 1 ( 111...111 2 ) inclusively. An alternative representation, referred to as a signed integer, allows values that can be positive, negative and zero; see Signed number representations . Either way, one less than a power of two is often the upper bound of an integer in binary computers. As a consequence, numbers of this form show up frequently in computer software. As an example, a video game running on an 8-bit system might limit the score or the number of items the player can hold to 255—the result of using a byte , which is 8 bits long , to store the number, allowing the representation of 256 distinct values from 0 to 2 8 − 1 = 255 .  For example, in the original Legend of Zelda the main character was limited to carrying 255 rupees (the currency of the game) at any given time, and the video game Pac-Man famously has a kill screen at level 256.

Powers of two are often used to define units in which to quantify computer memory sizes.  A "byte" now typically refers to eight bits (an octet ), resulting in the possibility of 256 values (2 8 ).  (The term byte once meant (and in some cases, still means) a collection of bits that was defined by the hardware context, typically of 5 to 32 bits, rather than only an 8-bit unit.)  The prefix kilo , in conjunction with byte , has been used by computer scientists to mean 1024 (2 10 ). However, in general, the term kilo has been used in the International System of Units to mean 1000 (10 3 ). A series of binary prefixes has been standardized, including kibi (Ki) meaning 1024 . Nearly all processor registers have sizes that are a power of two bits, 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits being very common, with the last two being most common except for very small processors.

Powers of two occur in a range of other places as well. For many disk drives , at least one of the sector size, number of sectors per track, and number of tracks per surface is a power of two.

[ citation needed ] The logical block size is almost always a power of two.

Numbers that are closely related to powers of two occur in a number of computer hardware designs, such as with the number of pixels in the width and height of video screens, where the number of pixels in each direction is often the product of a power of two and a small number. For example, 640 = 128 × 5 , and 480 = 32 × 15 .

Mersenne and Fermat primes A prime number that is one less than a power of two is called a Mersenne prime . For example, the prime number 31 is a Mersenne prime because it is 1 less than 32 (2 5 ). Similarly, a prime number (like 257 ) that is one more than a positive power of two is called a Fermat prime —the exponent  itself is a power of two.  A fraction that has a power of two as its denominator is called a dyadic rational . The numbers that can be represented as sums of consecutive positive integers are called polite numbers ; they are exactly the numbers that are not powers of two.

Euclid's Elements , Book IX The geometric progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (or, in the binary numeral system , 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, ... ) is important in number theory . Book IX, Proposition 36 of Elements proves that if the sum of the first n terms of this progression is a prime number (and thus is a Mersenne prime as mentioned above), then this sum times the n th term is a perfect number . For example, the sum of the first 5 terms of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 , which is a prime number. The sum 31 multiplied by 16 (the 5th term in the series) equals 496, which is a perfect number.

Book IX, Proposition 35, proves that in a geometric series if the first term is subtracted from the second and last term in the sequence, then as the excess of the second is to the first—so is the excess of the last to all those before it. (This is a restatement of our formula for geometric series from above.) Applying this to the geometric progression 31, 62, 124, 248, 496 (which results from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 by multiplying all terms by 31), we see that 62 minus 31 is to 31 as 496 minus 31 is to the sum of 31, 62, 124, 248. Therefore, the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 and 248 add up to 496 and further these are all the numbers that divide 496. For suppose that p divides 496 and it is not amongst these numbers. Assume pq is equal to 16 × 31 , or 31 is to q as p is to 16. Now p cannot divide 16 or it would be amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.
Therefore, 31 cannot divide q . And since 31 does not divide q and q measures 496, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic implies that q must divide 16 and be among the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. Let q be 4, then p must be 124, which is impossible since by hypothesis p is not amongst the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124 or 248.

The pattern continues where each pattern has starting point 2 k , and the period is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 5 k , which is φ (5 k ) = 4 × 5 k −1 (see Multiplicative group of integers modulo n ).

Last digits for powers of two whose exponents are powers of two All of these numbers over 4 end with the digit 6. Starting with 16 the last two digits are periodic with period 4, with the cycle 16–56–36–96–, and starting with 16 the last three digits are periodic with period 20. These patterns generally occur with any power, with respect to any base . The pattern continues where each pattern has starting point 2 k , and the period is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 5 k , which is φ (5 k ) = 4 × 5 k −1 (see Multiplicative group of integers modulo n ).

The numbers 2 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{2^{n}}} form an irrationality sequence : for every sequence x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} of positive integers , the series ∑ ∑ i = 0 ∞ ∞ 1 2 2 i x i = 1 2 x 0 + 1 4 x 1 + 1 16 x 2 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{2^{2^{i}}x_{i}}}={\frac {1}{2x_{0}}}+{\frac {1}{4x_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{16x_{2}}}+\cdots } converges to an irrational number . Despite the rapid growth of this sequence, it is the slowest-growing irrationality sequence known.

[ 4 ] Powers of two whose exponents are powers of two in computer science Since it is common for computer data types to have a size which is a power of two, these numbers count the number of representable values of that type. For example, a 32-bit word consisting of 4 bytes can represent 2 32 distinct values, which can either be regarded as mere bit-patterns, or are more commonly interpreted as the unsigned numbers from 0 to 2 32 − 1 , or as the range of signed numbers between −2 31 and 2 31 − 1 .

[ 9 ] Powers of two in music theory In musical notation , all unmodified note values have a duration equal to a whole note divided by a power of two; for example a half note (1/2), a quarter note (1/4), an eighth note (1/8) and a sixteenth note (1/16).

Dotted or otherwise modified notes have other durations. In time signatures the lower numeral, the beat unit , which can be seen as the denominator of a fraction, is almost always a power of two.

If the ratio of frequencies of two pitches is a power of two, then the interval between those pitches is full octaves . In this case, the corresponding notes have the same name.

The mathematical coincidence 2 7 ≈ ≈ ( 3 2 ) 12 {\displaystyle 2^{7}\approx ({\tfrac {3}{2}})^{12}} , from log ⁡ ⁡ 3 log ⁡ ⁡ 2 = 1.5849 … … ≈ ≈ 19 12 {\displaystyle {\frac {\log 3}{\log 2}}=1.5849\ldots \approx {\frac {19}{12}}} , closely relates the interval of 7 semitones in equal temperament to a perfect fifth of just intonation : 2 7 / 12 ≈ ≈ 3 / 2 {\displaystyle 2^{7/12}\approx 3/2} , correct to about 0.1%. The just fifth is the basis of Pythagorean tuning ; the difference between twelve just fifths and seven octaves is the Pythagorean comma .

[ 10 ] Other properties As each increase in dimension doubles the number of shapes, the sum of coefficients on each row of Pascal's triangle is a power of two The sum of powers of two from zero to a given power, inclusive, is 1 less than the next power of two, whereas the sum of powers of two from negative infinity to a given power, inclusive, equals the next power of two.

The sum of all n -choose binomial coefficients is equal to 2 n . Consider the set of all n -digit binary integers. Its cardinality is 2 n . It is also the sums of the cardinalities of certain subsets: the subset of integers with no 1s (consisting of a single number, written as n 0s), the subset with a single 1, the subset with two 1s, and so on up to the subset with n 1s (consisting of the number written as n 1s). Each of these is in turn equal to the binomial coefficient indexed by n and the number of 1s being considered (for example, there are 10-choose-3 binary numbers with ten digits that include exactly three 1s).

Currently, powers of two are the only known almost perfect numbers .

The cardinality of the power set of a set a is always 2 | a | , where | a | is the cardinality of a .

The number of vertices of an n -dimensional hypercube is 2 n . Similarly, the number of ( n − 1) -faces of an n -dimensional cross-polytope is also 2 n and the formula for the number of x -faces an n -dimensional cross-polytope has is 2 x ( n x ) .

{\displaystyle 2^{x}{\tbinom {n}{x}}.} The sum of the first n {\displaystyle n} powers of two (starting from 1 = 2 0 {\displaystyle 1=2^{0}} ) is given by ∑ ∑ k = 0 n − − 1 2 k = 2 0 + 2 1 + 2 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + 2 n − − 1 = 2 n − − 1 {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{n-1}2^{k}=2^{0}+2^{1}+2^{2}+\cdots +2^{n-1}=2^{n}-1} for n {\displaystyle n} being any positive integer.

Thus, the sum of the powers 1 + 2 1 + 2 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + 2 63 {\displaystyle 1+2^{1}+2^{2}+\cdots +2^{63}} can be computed simply by evaluating: 2 64 − − 1 {\displaystyle 2^{64}-1} (which is the "chess number").

The sum of the reciprocals of the powers of two is 1 . The sum of the reciprocals of the squared powers of two (powers of four) is 1/3.

The smallest natural power of two whose decimal representation begins with 7 is [ 11 ] 2 46 = 70 368 744 177 664.

{\displaystyle 2^{46}=70\ 368\ 744\ 177\ 664.} Every power of 2 (excluding 1) can be written as the sum of four square numbers in 24 ways . The powers of 2 are the natural numbers greater than 1 that can be written as the sum of four square numbers in the fewest ways.

As a real polynomial , a n + b n is irreducible , if and only if n is a power of two. (If n is odd, then a n + b n is divisible by a + b , and if n is even but not a power of 2, then n can be written as n = mp , where m is odd, and thus a n + b n = ( a p ) m + ( b p ) m {\displaystyle a^{n}+b^{n}=(a^{p})^{m}+(b^{p})^{m}} , which is divisible by a p + b p .)
But in the domain of complex numbers , the polynomial a 2 n + b 2 n {\displaystyle a^{2n}+b^{2n}} (where n ≥ 1) can always be factorized as a 2 n + b 2 n = ( a n + b n i ) ⋅ ⋅ ( a n − − b n i ) {\displaystyle a^{2n}+b^{2n}=(a^{n}+b^{n}i)\cdot (a^{n}-b^{n}i)} , 
even if n is a power of two.

The only known powers of 2 with all digits even are 2 1 = 2, 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, 2 6 = 64 and 2 11 = 2048 .

[ 12 ] The first 3 powers of 2 with all but last digit odd is 2 4 = 16, 2 5 = 32 and 2 9 = 512. The next such power of 2 of form 2 n should have n of at least 6 digits. The only powers of 2 with all digits distinct are 2 0 = 1 to 2 15 = 32 768 , 2 20 = 1 048 576 and 2 29 = 536 870 912 .

Disk file sizes are often expressed in kilobytes and megabytes. A file may be listed as taking 32 kilobytes, or 32K bytes. This does not mean exactly 32,000 bytes. A kilobyte is defined as 2 10 , or 1024 , bytes. So 32K bytes is actually equal to 32 × 1024 , or 32 768 , bytes. A megabyte is correspondingly defined as 2 20 , or 1,048,576, bytes. Therefore, 32 megabytes (32M bytes) equals 33 554 432 bytes.

Today the byte is used as the basic measure of memory size, [...]. As computer memory and disk sizes have become very much larger, so the byte has become a comparatively small unit, and various powers of two are now used to qualify it: a kilobyte is 2 10 = 1024 bytes; a megabyte is 2 20 = 1 048 576 bytes; a gigabyte is 2 30 = 1 073 741 824 bytes; a terabyte is 2 40 = 1 099 511 627 776 bytes; and a petabyte is 2 50 = 1 125 899 906 842 624 bytes. This sequence of powers of 2 units continues further with exabyte, zettabyte and yottabyte. Traditionally, computing scientists have always based their memory units on powers of 2 rather than on powers of 10, though this is a matter of some contention within the standards community. [Footnote: The issue is whether the prefixes kilo, mega, giga etc. should be raised to powers of two as traditionally implemented by the computing fraternity or to powers of ten as decreed by the General Conference of Weights and Measures for SI units. If they were to be changed to powers of ten, kilo would become 10 3 = 1000 and mega would become 10 6 = 1 000 000 .] ^ a b c Though they vary in word size, all x86 processors use the term "word" to mean 16 bits; thus, a 32-bit x86 processor refers to its native wordsize as a dword ^ "Powers of 2 Table – Vaughn's Summaries" .
