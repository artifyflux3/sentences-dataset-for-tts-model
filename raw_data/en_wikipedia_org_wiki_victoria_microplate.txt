It is bounded on all sides by parts of the active East African Rift System . It is currently rotating anticlockwise. Its boundaries are close to those of the mainly Archaean Tanzania Craton , with the two arms of the rift system having propagated along the surrounding Proterozoic shear belts . To the northwest, west and southwest it has a boundary with the Nubian plate , to the northeast and east with the Somali plate and the southeast with the Rovuma plate .
