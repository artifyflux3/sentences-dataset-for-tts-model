[ 2 ] The causes may include predation levels rising per offspring (given the same level of overall predator pressure) and the Allee effect , particularly the reduced likelihood of finding a mate.

Critical depensation [ edit ] When the level of depensation is high enough that the population is no longer able to sustain itself, it is said to be a critical depensation . This occurs when the population size has a tendency to decline when the population drops below a certain level (known as the "Critical depensation level").

[ 2 ] Ultimately this may lead to the population or fishery's collapse ( resource depletion ), or even local extinction .

[ 3 ] The phenomenon of critical depensation may be modelled or defined by a negative second order derivative of population growth rate with respect of population biomass , which describes a situation where a decline in population biomass is not compensated by a corresponding increase in marginal growth per unit of biomass.
