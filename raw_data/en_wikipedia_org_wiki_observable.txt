( May 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In physics , an observable is a physical property or physical quantity that can be measured . In classical mechanics , an observable is a real -valued "function" on the set of all possible system states, e.g., position and momentum . In quantum mechanics , an observable is an operator , or gauge , where the property of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations . For example, these operations might involve submitting the system to various electromagnetic fields and eventually reading a value.

Physically meaningful observables must also satisfy transformation laws that relate observations performed by different observers in different frames of reference . These transformation laws are automorphisms of the state space , that is bijective transformations that preserve certain mathematical properties of the space in question.

Quantum mechanics [ edit ] In quantum mechanics , observables manifest as self-adjoint operators on a separable complex Hilbert space representing the quantum state space .

[ 1 ] Observables assign values to outcomes of particular measurements , corresponding to the eigenvalue of the operator. If these outcomes represent physically allowable states (i.e. those that belong to the Hilbert space) the eigenvalues are real ; however, the converse is not necessarily true.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] As a consequence, only certain measurements can determine the value of an observable for some state of a quantum system. In classical mechanics, any measurement can be made to determine the value of an observable.

The relation between the state of a quantum system and the value of an observable requires some linear algebra for its description.  In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , up to a phase constant , pure states are given by non-zero vectors in a Hilbert space V . Two vectors v and w are considered to specify the same state if and only if w = c v {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} =c\mathbf {v} } for some non-zero c ∈ ∈ C {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {C} } . Observables are given by self-adjoint operators on V . Not every self-adjoint operator corresponds to a physically meaningful observable.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Also, not all physical observables are associated with non-trivial self-adjoint operators. For example, in quantum theory, mass appears as a parameter in the Hamiltonian, not as a non-trivial operator.

[ 9 ] In the case of transformation laws in quantum mechanics, the requisite automorphisms are unitary (or antiunitary ) linear transformations of the Hilbert space V .  Under Galilean relativity or special relativity , the mathematics of frames of reference is particularly simple, considerably restricting the set of physically meaningful observables.

In quantum mechanics, measurement of observables exhibits some seemingly unintuitive properties.  Specifically, if a system is in a state described by a vector in a Hilbert space , the measurement process affects the state in a non-deterministic but statistically predictable way. In particular, after a measurement is applied, the state description by a single vector may be destroyed, being replaced by a statistical ensemble .  The irreversible nature of measurement operations in quantum physics is sometimes referred to as the measurement problem and is described mathematically by quantum operations . By the structure of quantum operations, this description is mathematically equivalent to that offered by the relative state interpretation where the original system is regarded as a subsystem of a larger system and the state of the original system is given by the partial trace of the state of the larger system.

In quantum mechanics, dynamical variables A {\displaystyle A} such as position, translational (linear) momentum , orbital angular momentum , spin , and total angular momentum are each associated with a self-adjoint operator A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} that acts on the state of the quantum system. The eigenvalues of operator A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} correspond to the possible values that the dynamical variable can be observed as having. For example, suppose | ψ ψ a ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi _{a}\rangle } is an eigenket ( eigenvector ) of the observable A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} , with eigenvalue a {\displaystyle a} , and exists in a Hilbert space . Then A ^ ^ | ψ ψ a ⟩ ⟩ = a | ψ ψ a ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle {\hat {A}}|\psi _{a}\rangle =a|\psi _{a}\rangle .} This eigenket equation says that if a measurement of the observable A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} is made while the system of interest is in the state | ψ ψ a ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi _{a}\rangle } , then the observed value of that particular measurement must return the eigenvalue a {\displaystyle a} with certainty. However, if the system of interest is in the general state | ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ ∈ ∈ H {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle \in {\mathcal {H}}} (and | ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle } and | ψ ψ a ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi _{a}\rangle } are unit vectors , and the eigenspace of a {\displaystyle a} is one-dimensional), then the eigenvalue a {\displaystyle a} is returned with probability | ⟨ ⟨ ψ ψ a | ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ | 2 {\displaystyle |\langle \psi _{a}|\phi \rangle |^{2}} , by the Born rule .

Compatible and incompatible observables in quantum mechanics [ edit ] A crucial difference between classical quantities and quantum mechanical observables is that some pairs of quantum observables may not be simultaneously measurable, a property referred to as complementarity . This is mathematically expressed by non- commutativity of their corresponding operators, to the effect that the commutator [ A ^ ^ , B ^ ^ ] := A ^ ^ B ^ ^ − − B ^ ^ A ^ ^ ≠ ≠ 0 ^ ^ .

{\displaystyle \left[{\hat {A}},{\hat {B}}\right]:={\hat {A}}{\hat {B}}-{\hat {B}}{\hat {A}}\neq {\hat {0}}.} This inequality expresses a dependence of measurement results on the order in which measurements of observables A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} and B ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {B}}} are performed. A measurement of A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} alters the quantum state in a way that is incompatible with the subsequent measurement of B ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {B}}} and vice versa.

Observables corresponding to commuting operators are called compatible observables . For example, momentum along say the x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} axes are compatible.  Observables corresponding to non-commuting operators are called incompatible observables or complementary variables . For example, the position and momentum along the same axis are incompatible.

[ 10 ] : 155 Incompatible observables cannot have a complete set of common eigenfunctions . Note that there can be some simultaneous eigenvectors of A ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {A}}} and B ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {B}}} , but not enough in number to constitute a complete basis .
