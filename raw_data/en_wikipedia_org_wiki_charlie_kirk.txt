With Bill Montgomery , he co-founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012, for which Kirk serves as executive director. He is the chief executive officer (CEO) of Turning Point Action , Turning Point Academy, and Turning Point Faith; president of Turning Point Endowment; and a member of the Council for National Policy .

Kirk was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, Illinois . In high school, Kirk actively engaged in politics, supporting Mark Kirk (no relation) and his U.S. Senate campaign, as well as campaigning against a price increase in his school's cafeteria. He briefly attended Harper College before dropping out to pursue political activism full-time, influenced by Tea Party member Bill Montgomery. In 2012, Kirk founded TPUSA, a conservative student organization that quickly grew with backing from donors like Foster Friess .

As TPUSA's CEO, Kirk has expanded the organization's influence through initiatives like the Professor Watchlist and School Board Watchlist, while raising millions in donations. In 2019, Kirk founded Turning Point Action, a political advocacy arm, and later formed Turning Point Faith, aimed at mobilizing religious communities on conservative issues. Kirk hosts The Charlie Kirk Show , a conservative talk radio program.

Kirk has publicly promoted conservative and Trump -aligned causes and criticized the US government's response to COVID-19 , critical race theory , and the scientific consensus on climate change .

Early life and education Charles James Kirk was born on October 14, 1993, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois , and raised in nearby Prospect Heights . His mother is a mental health counselor, and his father is an architect.

[ 4 ] Kirk was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout .

[ 5 ] In 2010, during his junior year at Wheeling High School , he volunteered for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Illinois Republican Mark Kirk (no relation).

[ 6 ] In his senior year, Kirk created a campaign to reverse a price increase for cookies at his school.

[ 4 ] He also wrote an essay for Breitbart News alleging liberal bias in high school textbooks, which led to an appearance on Fox Business .

[ 7 ] At a subsequent speaking engagement at Benedictine University 's "Youth Empowerment Day", Kirk met Bill Montgomery , a retiree more than 50 years his senior, who was then a Tea Party –backed legislative candidate.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Montgomery encouraged Kirk to engage in political activism full-time.

[ 10 ] He subsequently founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a "grass-roots organization to rival liberal groups such as MoveOn.org ." At the 2012 Republican National Convention , Kirk met Foster Friess , a prominent Republican donor, who persuaded him to finance the organization.

[ 11 ] [ 8 ] Kirk briefly attended Harper College , a community college near Chicago, but dropped out without having completed any degree or attaining a certificate.

[ 12 ] Leadership of Turning Point organizations Turning Point USA Kirk has been CEO, chief fundraiser, and the public face of Turning Point since its founding.

[ 13 ] [ 5 ] He co-founded the organization in 2012 at 18 years of age.

[ 12 ] According to The New York Times , he has turned the organization into a "well-funded media operation, backed by conservative megadonors like the Wyoming businessman Foster Friess ." [ 14 ] TPUSA's activities include publication of the Professor Watchlist and the School Board Watchlist.

[ 15 ] In 2020, ProPublica investigated the finances of TPUSA and claimed in their report that the organization made "misleading financial claims", that the audits were not done by an independent auditor, and that the leaders had enriched themselves while advocating for Trump. ProPublica also reported that Kirk's salary from TPUSA had increased from $27,000 to nearly $300,000 and that he had bought an $855,000 condo in Longboat Key, Florida .

[ 16 ] In 2020, Turning Point USA had $39.2 million in revenues.

[ 17 ] Kirk earned a salary of more than $325,000 from TPUSA and related organizations.

[ 18 ] In 2021, TPUSA announced an online academy targeted towards students in schools "poisoning our youth with anti-American ideas." Turning Point Academy was intended to cater to families seeking an "America-first education." Arizona education firm StrongMind initially partnered with TPUSA with plans to open the academy by the fall of 2022 and assessed its "potential to generate over $40 million in gross revenue at full capacity (10,000 students)." The partnership ended after StrongMind received backlash from its own employees and key subcontractor Freedom Learning Group, who prepared course content for the academy, also backed out of the academy after learning that it would be run by TPUSA.

[ 19 ] Turning Point Action In May 2019, it was reported that Kirk was preparing to launch Turning Point Action , a 501(c)(4) entity designed to target Democrats.

[ 20 ] In July 2019, Kirk announced that Turning Point Action had acquired Students for Trump along with "all associated media assets." [ 21 ] He became chairman and launched a campaign to recruit one million students for the 2020 Trump re-election campaign .

[ 22 ] The unsuccessful effort led to TPUSA and the Trump campaign blaming each other for an overall decline in youth support for Trump.

[ 23 ] Turning Point Endowment Turning Point Endowment, Inc., formed in 2017, is a self-described "supporting organization" whose "mission is to support and benefit Turning Point USA's charitable purposes and long-term vitality." [ 24 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Turning Point Faith After Liberty University did not renew Kirk's contract with the Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty in 2021, Kirk founded Turning Point Faith, an organization dedicated to "recruit pastors and other church leaders to be active in local and national political issues." [ 25 ] Its activities include faith-based voter drives "and educating members on TPUSA's core values." [ 26 ] According to TPUSA's 2021 Investor Prospectus, the program—with a budget of $6.4 million—"will 'address America's crumbling religious foundation by engaging thousands of pastors nationwide' in order to 'breathe renewed civic engagement into our churches'." [ 27 ] Council for National Policy and CNP Action Kirk is the William F. Buckley Jr. Council Member of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a group "that has served for decades as a hub for a nationwide network of conservative activists and the donors who support them", [ 28 ] according to the CNP's September 2020 membership directory leaked in February 2021.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] He is a spokesperson for CNP Action, the political arm of the CNP.

[ 30 ] [ 32 ] Mount Vernon Project According to Kirk, the Mount Vernon Project is a movement to "recruit leaders to serve on the RNC (Republican National Committee) and at the state level who wish to better represent the grassroots voice." [ 33 ] Air Force Academy Board of Visitors In March 2025, President Trump appointed Kirk to the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors. Other notable appointees made by Trump included senator Tommy Tuberville , Col. Doug Nikolai, and Dina Powell .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Talk radio host In October 2020, Kirk began hosting a daily three-hour radio talk show, called The Charlie Kirk Show , on Salem Media 's "The Answer" radio channel.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2024, NBC News reported that it was presented with internal data showing that Kirk's podcast is being downloaded between 500,000 and 750,000 times each day. It is currently ranked No. 13 on Apple Podcasts for news.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] Political positions and activities Promotion of falsehoods and conspiracy theories Kirk promotes the antisemitic Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory , and has described universities as "islands of totalitarianism ." [ 5 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] External videos Charlie Kirk ~ The Conservative Forum ~ 9-8-2015 on YouTube (Liberty Forum of Silicon Valley) (at 2:10–3:20) In a 2015 speech at the Liberty Forum of Silicon Valley, Kirk stated that he had applied to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York , and was not accepted.

[ 13 ] He said that "the slot he considered his went to 'a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion'" whose test scores he claimed he knew.

[ 5 ] He told The New Yorker in 2017 that he was being sarcastic when he said it.

[ 5 ] He told the Chicago Tribune in 2018 that "he was just repeating something he'd been told", [ 10 ] [ 42 ] while at a New Hampshire Turning Point event featuring Rand Paul in October 2019 he claimed that he never said it.

[ 42 ] On July 7, 2018, Kirk falsely claimed on social media that Justice Department statistics showed an increase in human trafficking arrests from 1,952 in the year 2016 to 6,087 in the first half of 2018. He deleted the tweet without an explanation the next day, after a fact-checker had pointed out that the false 2018 number had originated on a conspiracy site 8chan .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In December 2018, Kirk falsely claimed that protesters in the French yellow vests movement chanted, "We want Trump." These false claims were later repeated by President Trump himself.

[ 45 ] In defending the Trump administration 's response to the COVID-19 pandemic , Kirk falsely stated that, during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic , it "took President Barack Obama 'millions infected and over 1,000 deaths'" to declare a public health emergency.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Kirk has spread falsehoods about voter fraud [ 48 ] [ 49 ] and the COVID-19 pandemic.

[ 50 ] According to Forbes , Kirk is known for "his repudiation of liberal college education and embrace of pro-Trump conspiracy theories." [ 50 ] COVID-19 misinformation Kirk with Simone Gold , founder of America's Frontline Doctors , at a TPUSA forum in 2020 Kirk spread false information and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 on social media platforms, such as Twitter , in 2020. Kirk sharply criticized Democrats' criticism of Donald Trump's withdrawal of World Health Organization (WHO) funding and referred to COVID-19 as the "China virus", which was retweeted by Trump.

[ 7 ] Kirk alleged that the WHO covered up information about the COVID-19 pandemic . He was briefly banned from Twitter after falsely claiming that hydroxychloroquine had proved to be "100% effective in treating the virus"; [ 7 ] He alleged Gretchen Whitmer , the Democratic governor of Michigan, threatened doctors who tried to use the medication.

[ 7 ] These falsehoods were retweeted by Rudy Giuliani whose account was then suspended by Twitter as well.

[ 7 ] [ 51 ] Kirk also described the public health measure of social distancing prohibitions in churches as a "Democratic plot against Christianity" and made the unfounded assertion that authorities in Wuhan , China, were burning patients.

[ 7 ] In 2020, Kirk said that he refused to abide by mask requirements , stating that "the science around masks is very questionable." [ 50 ] [ 52 ] In July 2021, Kirk promoted misleading claims about the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

[ 18 ] On Fox News' Tucker Carlson show, Kirk called student mandatory requirements for taking the COVID-19 vaccine "medical apartheid ".

[ 53 ] Election fraud claims and the 2021 United States Capitol attack Immediately after Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election , Kirk promoted false and disproven claims of fraud in the election .

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] On November 5, 2020, Kirk was the leader of a Stop the Steal protest at the Maricopa Tabulation Center in Phoenix.

[ 56 ] Charlie Kirk was considered a "big name" social influencer in Rudy Giuliani 's communications plan to overturn the 2020 election .

[ 57 ] On January 5, 2021, the day before the Washington, D.C. protest that led to the storming of the United States Capitol , Kirk wrote on Twitter that Turning Point Action and Students for Trump were sending more than 80 "buses of patriots to D.C. to fight for this president".

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] A spokesman for Turning Point said that the groups ended up sending seven buses, not 80, with 350 students.

[ 58 ] [ 61 ] In the lead-up to the storming, Kirk said he was "getting 500 emails a minute calling for a civil war." [ 62 ] Publix heiress Julie Fancelli gave Charlie Kirk's organizations $1.25 million to fund the buses to the January 6 event. Kirk also paid $60,000 for Kimberly Guilfoyle to speak at the Trump rally.

[ 63 ] Afterward, Kirk said the violent acts at the Capitol were not an insurrection and did not represent mainstream Trump supporters.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Appearing before the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack , Charlie Kirk pleaded the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . His team however "provided the committee with 8,000 pages of records in response to its requests." [ 66 ] In another closed-door meeting of the House January 6 Committee, Ali Alexander blamed Kirk and Turning Point USA for financing the travel of demonstrators to the Stop the Steal rally .

[ 67 ] Climate change Kirk has consistently supported the extraction and use of fossil fuels . He is a climate change denialist , falsely claiming that humans have no significant effect on global climate change.

[ 5 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Republican and pro-Trump activism Kirk with President Donald Trump at a rally in 2021 Kirk addressed the 2016 Republican National Convention .

[ 70 ] In an interview with Wired magazine during the convention, Kirk said that while he "was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan", he would vote for him, and that Trump's candidacy made Turning Point's mission more difficult.

[ 71 ] Kirk flipped to supporting Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention and spent the remainder of the campaign assisting with travel and media arrangements for Donald Trump Jr.

[ 7 ] In October 2016, Kirk participated in a Fox News event along with Trump Jr., Eric Trump , and Lara Trump that had a pro-Donald Trump tone.

[ 72 ] In July 2019, Kirk became chairman of Students for Trump , which had been acquired by Turning Point Action, and launched a campaign to recruit one million students for the 2020 Trump reelection campaign.

[ 73 ] The unsuccessful effort led to TPUSA and the Trump campaign blaming each other for an overall decline in youth support for Trump.

[ 23 ] At an August 2020 meeting of the Council for National Policy , Kirk said: "Democrats have done a really foolish thing by shutting down all these campuses ... It's gonna remove ballot harvesting opportunities and all their voter fraud that they usually do on college campuses – so they're actually removing half a million votes off the table. So please keep the campuses closed – it's a great thing. Whatever!" [ 74 ] The New York Times argued that Kirk "[walks] the line between mainstream conservative opinion and outright disinformation " and that "with a powerful ally in the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Kirk both amplifies the president's message and helps shape it.

[ 7 ] Kirk was an early investor in 1789 Capital , which invests in conservative " MAGA " businesses. Trump Jr. joined 1789 Capital in November 2024, after Trump won the 2024 election.

[ 75 ] "You're Being Brainwashed" tour Prior to the 2024 presidential election , Charlie Kirk visited around 25 college campuses, marketed as the "You're Being Brainwashed" tour, trying to stir up more Gen-Z voter turnout by where he would engage and debate with students on many different relevant topics.  According to Turning Point Action, the tour produced around two billion viral views on social media.

[ 76 ] The tour has been praised as having a "critical role" in helping Donald Trump's election.

[ 77 ] Kirk has aided the President-elect in choosing leadership positions for his administration, including cabinet positions.

[ 78 ] Social policy Abortion In a debate hosted by Jubilee Media , Kirk argued that there may be situations wherein abortion could be medically necessary if the mother's life is at risk. However, he also argued that abortion is murder and should be illegal. He is against exceptions for rape .

[ 79 ] Views on relationships and "sexual anarchy" In October 2021, Kirk said on his podcast that Democrats wanted Americans to live where "there is no cultural identity, where you live in sexual anarchy, where private property is a thing of the past, and the ruling class controls everything." Following social media backlash, he released a statement on the website of the Claremont Institute doubling down on and expanding his remarks.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] According to Media Matters, at the TPUSA Young Women's Leadership Summit 2022 Conference, Kirk said that the "biblical model" for women to pursue in romantic relationships is a partner who is "a protector and a leader, and deep down, a vast majority of you agree" and that "if you want to go meet conservative men that have their act together, that aren't like, woke beta men, like, start a Turning Point USA chapter, you'll meet a lot of them." [ 83 ] Kirk has advocated for parents to never let their daughters receive prescriptions for birth control medication for any reason. He claimed that the medication makes women angry and bitter, which he alleged suited the political leanings of the Democratic Party.

[ 84 ] Anti-BDS laws In May 2025, Kirk voiced opposition to a bipartisan proposal that would expand anti-BDS laws punishing the boycott of Israel , saying, "We’ve allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans." [ 85 ] Racial issues and opinions on Martin Luther King Jr.

Kirk has said that the concept of white privilege is a myth and a "racist lie." [ 86 ] [ 13 ] [ 87 ] Kirk served on President Donald Trump's 1776 Commission , a response to the 1619 Project .

[ 88 ] Assuming "more hard-right positions", he said that Democratic immigration policies were aimed at "diminishing and decreasing white demographics in America." [ 31 ] [ 89 ] In October 2021, Kirk began the "Exposing Critical Racism Tour" of a number of campuses and off-campus venues to "fight racist theories on America's college campuses!!" [ 90 ] [ 91 ] On the Minnesota leg of the tour on October 5, 2021, Kirk called George Floyd a "scumbag" and appeared to refer to the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol when he said that "if you dare walk into the U.S. Capitol building and take a selfie, they'll put you in solitary confinement." [ 92 ] In a November 2021 Fox News article, Kirk wrote that state power should be used to stop teachers from indoctrinating children with critical race theory : "directly confronting the left, and promising to fight their illiberal ideology with state power when necessary, is the key to winning everyday Americans." [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Kirk praised Martin Luther King Jr.

prior to December 2023, variously calling him a "hero" and a "civil rights icon"; that December, however, he used a speech at AmericaFest to describe him as "awful … not a good person" and as someone who is admired only because he "said one thing he didn't actually believe." The speech also saw Kirk condemn the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , calling its passage a "huge mistake" and alleging that it had created a "permanent DEI -type bureaucracy".

[ 94 ] Kirk told the New York Times “I take the Caldwellian view, from his book ‘ The Age of Entitlement ,’ that we went through a new founding in the ’60s and that the Civil Rights Act has actually superseded the U.S. Constitution as its reference point.  In fact, I bet if you polled Americans, most of them would have more reverence for the Civil Rights Act than the Constitution. I could be wrong,” he added, “but I think I’m right.” [ 95 ] In January 2024, Kirk said that a "myth" had been created around King which had "grown totally out of control" and that King was currently "the most honored, worshiped, even deified person of the 20th century" despite "most people" supposedly disliking him during his life. Responding to accusations by Malcolm Kenyatta that he was working to undermine King and the Voting Rights Act , Kirk called this claim "a lie" and "fear-mongering", and added that telling the "truth" about King "should not be trampling sacred ground" since he was "just a man ... a very flawed one at that" and a "mythological anti-racist creation of the 1960s." Kirk later claimed to have "found the sacred cow of modern America" in criticizing King.

[ 96 ] Also in January 2024, Kirk blamed DEI programs for national aviation issues, saying, "If I see a Black pilot, I'm going to be like, 'Boy, I hope he's qualified.

' " [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] He had previously expressed opposition to DEI programs describing them as "anti-White".

[ 100 ] NBC News further reported that Kirk's comments about DEI programs and his comment about Black or African American airline pilots resulted in ongoing conflict with the Republican National Committee over outreach to Black voters.

[ 39 ] Charlie Kirk posted on Instagram in March 2024 that "The ‘ Great Replacement ’ is not a theory, it’s a reality." Alongside this statement, Kirk shared a screenshot from a Fox News story headline that read; "7.2M illegals entered the U.S. under Biden admin(istration), an amount greater than population of 36 states." [ 101 ] After Elon Musk was widely criticized for endorsing an antisemitic post that referenced the Great Replacement Theory and blamed "Jewish communities" for supporting mass migration, Kirk defended Musk, stating that "Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them." [ 102 ] School board activism In May 2021, Kirk tweeted for parents to protest at school board meetings urging parents to stand up and push back on mask mandates and the teaching of critical race theory.

[ 103 ] LGBTQ issues According to a 2024 NBC News report, Kirk was relatively secular regarding LGBTQ issues in 2018, but shifted towards more socially conservative stances.

[ 104 ] Kirk has argued there is an "LGBTQ agenda", [ 104 ] and opposes gay marriage .

[ 105 ] In 2024, Kirk cited Leviticus 20:13 ("If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them") as "God’s perfect law when it comes to sexual matters".

[ 106 ] Kirk has argued against gender affirming care for transgender people, saying, "We must ban trans-affirming care — the entire country. Donald Trump needs to run on this issue", according to Media Matters .

[ 107 ] Kirk also stated that "there are only two genders" and that "transgenderism and gender 'fluidity' are lies that hurt people and abuse kids".

[ 82 ] Religion In the 2010s, Kirk was described as secular and a critic of religious influence on politics and the state.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] "We do have a separation of church and state, and we should support that" Kirk told Dave Rubin in 2018.

[ 108 ] However, in 2021, Kirk partnered with California pastor Rob McCoy to launch TPUSA Faith to mobilise conservative Christians to vote Republican. Kirk's shift was influenced by events such as Trump’s move of the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and COVID-era church closures, which he and his allies portrayed as religious persecution.

[ 108 ] Christian nationalism This article is part of a series on Christian nationalism in the United States Principles Anti-abortion movement Anti-abortion violence Authoritarianism Christian fundamentalism Christian Identity Christian persecution complex Christian reconstructionism Conservatism National Social Ultra Dominionism Seven Mountain Mandate Familialism Great Replacement conspiracy theory Gun rights Heteronormativity Islamophobia Judeo-Christian ethics Natalism Nationalism Ethnic Religious Ultra White Nativism Patriarchy Supremacism Christian White Theonomy White backlash Xenophobia History Ruby Ridge standoff Waco siege Christian Patriot movement Tea Party movement American Redoubt January 6 United States Capitol attack ReAwaken America Tour Project 2025 Politicians Beckwith Boebert Click Deevers Flynn Gibbs Greene Hawley Hegseth Hoover Lewis O'Daniel Prichard Sexton Schriver Trump Utt Vought Activists Ainsworth Beale Barton Capell Capt Comparet Flynn Fuentes Haywood Kirk Laurie Moore Pelley Peters Sellner Sheets Smith Wallnau Wambsganss Wiles Witzke White-Cain Organizations America First Party Army of God Christian Liberty Party Christian Nationalist Crusade Constitution Party Georgia Republic Militia Hutaree Jericho March Liberty Lobby Moral Majority National States' Rights Party New Apostolic Reformation Project Blitz Silver Legion of America Society for American Civic Renewal Veterans on Patrol Related topics American civil religion Bible Belt The Case for Christian Nationalism Christianity in the United States God Bless America In God We Trust Ku Klux Klan Libertarianism in the United States American militia movement Christian Patriot movement Racism in the United States Arab Palestinian Hispanic Jewish Sovereign citizen movement Theocracy Trumpism Christian support Christianity portal Conservatism portal United States portal v t e Since switching from secularism to Christianity, Kirk has been described as a Christian nationalist who has advocated for the end of the separation of Church and state in the United States.

[ 106 ] [ 110 ] [ 108 ] In 2024, Kirk stated, "One of the reasons we’re living through a constitutional crisis is that we no longer have a Christian nation, but we have a Christian form of government, and they’re incompatible. You cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population".

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] Kirk promotes the Seven Mountain Mandate , a Dominion theology concept which calls for Christians to control seven spheres of society (government, education, media, arts and entertainment, business, family, and religion).

[ 108 ] Islam Following the victory of Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 New York City Democratic mayoral primary , Kirk posted that "24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City." Liberal Fox News commentator Jessica Tarlov asked Kirk to take down the "gross and islamophobic " post.

[ 113 ] In a separate post, Kirk argued that "It's not Islamophobia to notice that Muslims want to import values into the West that seek to destabilize our civilization." [ 114 ] In 2018, Kirk spoke at the annual conference of anti-Muslim group ACT for America , an organization with multiple ties to Turning Point USA.

[ 115 ] Foreign policy Iran–Israel War Main article: Iran-Israel War In June 2025, Kirk opposed the involvement of the United States in the Iran–Israel War .

[ 116 ] 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Main article: Russo-Ukrainian War After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Kirk characterized the conflict as a "border dispute" and spread false claims from Russian state media that Ukraine was firing mortar shells at a Russian separatist enclave in Ukraine.

[ 117 ] At the February 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference , Kirk said that "The southern border matters a lot more than the Ukrainian border " and that "In fact, I want every Republican leader who comes up on stage the next couple days to call what's happening on the southern border an invasion because two million people waltzed into our country last year." [ 118 ] Conflict with the Republican National Committee In December 2022, Kirk warned the Republican National Committee that they needed to listen to their grassroots voters or face the consequences of ignoring them. Kirk stated that "If ignored, we will have the most stunted and muted Republican Party in the history of the conservative movement, the likes of which we haven't seen in generations." [ 33 ] Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty In November 2019, Kirk and Jerry Falwell Jr.

co-founded the "Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty", a right-wing think-tank funded, owned and housed by Liberty University .

[ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 25 ] Fellows included Antonio Okafor, director of outreach for Gun Owners of America ; Sebastian Gorka , former deputy assistant to President Trump; and Jenna Ellis , a senior legal counselor for Trump.

[ 121 ] [ 120 ] In 2020, the Falkirk Center spent at least $50,000 on political Facebook advertisements promoting Trump and Republican candidates.

[ 122 ] Students and alumni raised objections about the organization's aggressive political tone, which they considered to be inconsistent with the university's mission.

[ 120 ] [ 25 ] Falwell resigned as president of Liberty University in August 2020, and the university did not renew Kirk's one-year contract in late 2020. In 2021, the university renamed the organization "Standing for Freedom Center".

[ 25 ] Awards, achievements and honors Kirk was listed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 in Law & Policy.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] In May 2019, Kirk was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities (D.Hum.) from Liberty University .

[ 125 ] Kirk was appointed by President Donald Trump to a commission promoting "patriotic education".

[ 126 ] Books Kirk co-wrote, with Brent Hamachek, the 2016 book Time for a Turning Point: Setting a Course Toward Free Markets and Limited Government for Future Generations ( Simon & Schuster ).

[ 127 ] Kirk wrote the 2018 book Campus Battlefield: How Conservatives Can WIN the Battle on Campus and Why It Matters . Donald Trump Jr. wrote the foreword for the book.

[ 128 ] In a review for The Weekly Standard , Adam Rubenstein described the book as a "hot mess", "nothing more than a marketing pitch for TPUSA" and said the "thin" book was "stuffed with reprintings of his tweets and quotes from others."
