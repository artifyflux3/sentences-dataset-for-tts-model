[ 1 ] The word is derived from the Greek ὀψέ ( opsé ), meaning 'late', and μανθάνω ( manthánō ), meaning 'learn'.

[ 2 ] Opsimathy was once frowned upon, used as a put-down with implications of laziness, [ 3 ] and considered less effective by educators than early learning.

[ 4 ] The emergence of "opsimath clubs" [ 5 ] has demonstrated that opsimathy has shed much of this negative connotation.

[ 6 ] Notable opsimaths include 19th-century army officer and orientalist Sir Henry Rawlinson , Vivian Stanshall 's fictitious character Sir Henry Rawlinson , Grandma Moses , Rabbi Akiva (according to the Talmud , he began studying at age 40), and Cato the Elder , who learned Greek only at the age of 80.
