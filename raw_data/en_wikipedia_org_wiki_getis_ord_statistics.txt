Developed by statisticians Arthur Getis and J. Keith Ord they are commonly used for Hot Spot Analysis [ 1 ] [ 2 ] to identify where features with high or low values are spatially clustered in a statistically significant way. Getis-Ord statistics are available in a number of software libraries such as CrimeStat , GeoDa , ArcGIS , PySAL [ 3 ] and R .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Local statistics [ edit ] Hot spot map showing hot and cold spots in the 2020 USA Contiguous Unemployment Rate, calculated using Getis Ord Gi* There are two different versions of the statistic, depending on whether the data point at the target location i {\displaystyle i} is included or not [ 6 ] G i = ∑ ∑ j ≠ ≠ i w i j x j ∑ ∑ j ≠ ≠ i x j {\displaystyle G_{i}={\frac {\sum _{j\neq i}w_{ij}x_{j}}{\sum _{j\neq i}x_{j}}}} G i ∗ ∗ = ∑ ∑ j w i j x j ∑ ∑ j x j {\displaystyle G_{i}^{*}={\frac {\sum _{j}w_{ij}x_{j}}{\sum _{j}x_{j}}}} Here x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} is the value observed at the i t h {\displaystyle i^{th}} spatial site and w i j {\displaystyle w_{ij}} is the spatial weight matrix which constrains which sites are connected to one another. For G i ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle G_{i}^{*}} the denominator is constant across all observations.

A value larger (or smaller) than the mean suggests a hot (or cold) spot corresponding to a high-high (or low-low) cluster.

Statistical significance can be estimated using analytical approximations as in the original work [ 7 ] [ 8 ] however in practice permutation testing is used to obtain more reliable estimates of significance for statistical inference .

[ 6 ] Global statistics [ edit ] The Getis-Ord statistics of overall spatial association are [ 7 ] [ 9 ] G = ∑ ∑ i j , i ≠ ≠ j w i j x i x j ∑ ∑ i j , i ≠ ≠ j x i x j {\displaystyle G={\frac {\sum _{ij,i\neq j}w_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}}{\sum _{ij,i\neq j}x_{i}x_{j}}}} G ∗ ∗ = ∑ ∑ i j w i j x i x j ∑ ∑ i j x i x j {\displaystyle G^{*}={\frac {\sum _{ij}w_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}}{\sum _{ij}x_{i}x_{j}}}} The local and global G ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle G^{*}} statistics are related through the weighted average ∑ ∑ i x i G i ∗ ∗ ∑ ∑ i x i = ∑ ∑ i j x i w i j x j ∑ ∑ i x i ∑ ∑ j x j = G ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle {\frac {\sum _{i}x_{i}G_{i}^{*}}{\sum _{i}x_{i}}}={\frac {\sum _{ij}x_{i}w_{ij}x_{j}}{\sum _{i}x_{i}\sum _{j}x_{j}}}=G^{*}} The relationship of the G {\displaystyle G} and G i {\displaystyle G_{i}} statistics is more complicated due to the dependence of the denominator of G i {\displaystyle G_{i}} on i {\displaystyle i} .

Relation to Moran's I [ edit ] Moran's I is another commonly used measure of spatial association defined by I = N W ∑ ∑ i j w i j ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) ( x j − − x ¯ ¯ ) ∑ ∑ i ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 {\displaystyle I={\frac {N}{W}}{\frac {\sum _{ij}w_{ij}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})(x_{j}-{\bar {x}})}{\sum _{i}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}}} where N {\displaystyle N} is the number of spatial sites and W = ∑ ∑ i j w i j {\displaystyle W=\sum _{ij}w_{ij}} is the sum of the entries in the spatial weight matrix. Getis and Ord show [ 7 ] that I = ( K 1 / K 2 ) G − − K 2 x ¯ ¯ ∑ ∑ i ( w i ⋅ ⋅ + w ⋅ ⋅ i ) x i + K 2 x ¯ ¯ 2 W {\displaystyle I=(K_{1}/K_{2})G-K_{2}{\bar {x}}\sum _{i}(w_{i\cdot }+w_{\cdot i})x_{i}+K_{2}{\bar {x}}^{2}W} Where w i ⋅ ⋅ = ∑ ∑ j w i j {\displaystyle w_{i\cdot }=\sum _{j}w_{ij}} , w ⋅ ⋅ i = ∑ ∑ j w j i {\displaystyle w_{\cdot i}=\sum _{j}w_{ji}} , K 1 = ( ∑ ∑ i j , i ≠ ≠ j x i x j ) − − 1 {\displaystyle K_{1}=\left(\sum _{ij,i\neq j}x_{i}x_{j}\right)^{-1}} and K 2 = W N ( ∑ ∑ i ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) 2 ) − − 1 {\displaystyle K_{2}={\frac {W}{N}}\left(\sum _{i}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}\right)^{-1}} . They are equal if w i j = w {\displaystyle w_{ij}=w} is constant, but not in general.

Ord and Getis [ 8 ] also show that Moran's I can be written in terms of G i ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle G_{i}^{*}} I = 1 W ( ∑ ∑ i z i V i G i ∗ ∗ − − N ) {\displaystyle I={\frac {1}{W}}\left(\sum _{i}z_{i}V_{i}G_{i}^{*}-N\right)} where z i = ( x i − − x ¯ ¯ ) / s {\displaystyle z_{i}=(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})/s} , s {\displaystyle s} is the standard deviation of x {\displaystyle x} and V i 2 = 1 N − − 1 ∑ ∑ j ( w i j − − 1 N ∑ ∑ k w i k ) 2 {\displaystyle V_{i}^{2}={\frac {1}{N-1}}\sum _{j}\left(w_{ij}-{\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{k}w_{ik}\right)^{2}} is an estimate of the variance of w i j {\displaystyle w_{ij}} .
