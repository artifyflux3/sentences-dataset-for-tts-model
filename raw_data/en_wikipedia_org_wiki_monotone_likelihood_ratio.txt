In statistics , the monotone likelihood ratio property is a property of the ratio of two probability density functions (PDFs). Formally, distributions f ( x ) {\displaystyle \ f(x)\ } and g ( x ) {\displaystyle \ g(x)\ } bear the property if for every x 2 > x 1 , f ( x 2 ) g ( x 2 ) ≥ ≥ f ( x 1 ) g ( x 1 ) {\displaystyle \ {\text{for every }}x_{2}>x_{1},\quad {\frac {f(x_{2})}{\ g(x_{2})\ }}\geq {\frac {f(x_{1})}{\ g(x_{1})\ }}\ } that is, if the ratio is nondecreasing in the argument x {\displaystyle x} .

If the functions are first-differentiable, the property may sometimes be stated ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x ( f ( x ) g ( x ) ) ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {\ \partial }{\ \partial x}}\left({\frac {f(x)}{\ g(x)\ }}\right)\geq 0\ } For two distributions that satisfy the definition with respect to some argument x , {\displaystyle \ x\ ,} we say they "have the MLRP in x .

{\displaystyle \ x~.} " For a family of distributions that all satisfy the definition with respect to some statistic T ( X ) , {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ ,} we say they "have the MLR in T ( X ) .

{\displaystyle \ T(X)~.} " Intuition [ edit ] The MLRP is used to represent a data-generating process that enjoys a straightforward relationship between the magnitude of some observed variable and the distribution it draws from. If f ( x ) {\displaystyle \ f(x)\ } satisfies the MLRP with respect to g ( x ) {\displaystyle \ g(x)\ } , the higher the observed value x {\displaystyle \ x\ } , the more likely it was drawn from distribution f {\displaystyle \ f\ } rather than g .

{\displaystyle \ g~.} As usual for monotonic relationships, the likelihood ratio's monotonicity comes in handy in statistics, particularly when using maximum-likelihood estimation . Also, distribution families with MLR have a number of well-behaved stochastic properties, such as first-order stochastic dominance and increasing hazard ratios . Unfortunately, as is also usual, the strength of this assumption comes at the price of realism. Many processes in the world do not exhibit a monotonic correspondence between input and output.

Example: Working hard or slacking off [ edit ] Suppose you are working on a project, and you can either work hard or slack off. Call your choice of effort e {\displaystyle \ e\ } and the quality of the resulting project q .

{\displaystyle \ q~.} If the MLRP holds for the distribution of q {\displaystyle \ q\ } conditional on your effort e {\displaystyle \ e\ } , the higher the quality the more likely you worked hard. Conversely, the lower the quality the more likely you slacked off.

1: Choose effort e ∈ ∈ { H , L } {\displaystyle \ e\in \{H,L\}\ } where H {\displaystyle \ H\ } means high effort, and L {\displaystyle \ L\ } means low effort.

2: Observe q {\displaystyle \ q\ } drawn from f ( q | e ) .

{\displaystyle \ f(q\ |\ e)~.} By Bayes' law with a uniform prior , P ⁡ ⁡ [ e = H | q ] = f ( q | H ) f ( q | H ) + f ( q | L ) {\displaystyle \ \operatorname {\mathbb {P} } {\bigl [}\ e=H\ {\big |}\ q\ {\bigr ]}={\frac {f(q\ |\ H)}{\ f(q\ |\ H)+f(q\ |\ L)\ }}\ } 3: Suppose f ( q | e ) {\displaystyle \ f(q\ |\ e)\ } satisfies the MLRP. Rearranging, the probability the worker worked hard is 1 1 + f ( q | L ) / f ( q | H ) {\displaystyle \ {\frac {1}{\ 1+f(q\ |\ L)/f(q\ |\ H)\ }}\ } which, thanks to the MLRP, is monotonically increasing in q {\displaystyle \ q\ } (because f ( q | L ) f ( q | H ) {\displaystyle \ {\frac {f(q\ |\ L)}{\ f(q\ |\ H)\ }}\ } is decreasing in q {\displaystyle \ q\ } ).

Hence if some employer is doing a "performance review" he can infer his employee's behavior from the merits of his work.

Families of distributions satisfying MLR [ edit ] Statistical models often assume that data are generated by a distribution from some family of distributions and seek to determine that distribution. This task is simplified if the family has the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP).

A family of density functions { f θ θ ( x ) | θ θ ∈ ∈ Θ Θ } {\displaystyle \ {\bigl \{}\ f_{\theta }(x)\ {\big |}\ \theta \in \Theta \ {\bigr \}}\ } indexed by a parameter θ θ {\displaystyle \ \theta \ } taking values in an ordered set Θ Θ {\displaystyle \ \Theta \ } is said to have a monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) in the statistic T ( X ) {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ } if for any θ θ 1 < θ θ 2 , {\displaystyle \ \theta _{1}<\theta _{2}\ ,} f θ θ 2 ( X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , … … ) f θ θ 1 ( X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , … … ) {\displaystyle \ {\frac {f_{\theta _{2}}(X=x_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots \ )}{\ f_{\theta _{1}}(X=x_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots \ )\ }}\ } is a non-decreasing function of T ( X ) .

{\displaystyle \ T(X)~.} Then we say the family of distributions "has MLR in T ( X ) {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ } ".

List of families [ edit ] Family T ( X ) {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ } in which f θ θ ( X ) {\displaystyle \ f_{\theta }(X)\ } has the MLR Exponential [ λ λ ] {\displaystyle [\lambda ]\ } ∑ ∑ x i {\displaystyle \ \sum x_{i}\ } observations Binomial [ n , p ] {\displaystyle [n,p]\ } ∑ ∑ x i {\displaystyle \ \sum x_{i}\ } observations Poisson [ λ λ ] {\displaystyle [\lambda ]\ } ∑ ∑ x i {\displaystyle \ \sum x_{i}\ } observations Normal [ μ μ , σ σ ] {\displaystyle [\mu ,\sigma ]\ } if σ σ {\displaystyle \ \sigma \ } known, ∑ ∑ x i {\displaystyle \ \sum x_{i}\ } observations Hypothesis testing [ edit ] If the family of random variables has the MLRP in T ( X ) , {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ ,} a uniformly most powerful test can easily be determined for the hypothesis H 0 : θ θ ≤ ≤ θ θ 0 {\displaystyle \ H_{0}\ :\ \theta \leq \theta _{0}\ } versus H 1 : θ θ > θ θ 0 .

{\displaystyle \ H_{1}\ :\ \theta >\theta _{0}~.} Example: Effort and output [ edit ] Example: Let e {\displaystyle \ e\ } be an input into a stochastic technology – worker's effort, for instance – and y {\displaystyle \ y\ } its output, the likelihood of which is described by a probability density function f ( y ; e ) .

{\displaystyle \ f(y;e)~.} Then the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) of the family f {\displaystyle \ f\ } is expressed as follows: For any e 1 , e 2 , {\displaystyle \ e_{1},e_{2}\ ,} the fact that e 2 > e 1 {\displaystyle e_{2}>e_{1}} implies that the ratio f ( y ; e 2 ) f ( y ; e 1 ) {\displaystyle \ {\frac {\ f(y;e_{2})\ }{f(y;e_{1})}}\ } is increasing in y .

{\displaystyle \ y~.} Relation to other statistical properties [ edit ] Monotone likelihoods are used in several areas of statistical theory, including point estimation and hypothesis testing , as well as in probability models .

Exponential families [ edit ] One-parameter exponential families have monotone likelihood-functions. In particular, the one-dimensional exponential family of probability density functions or probability mass functions with f θ θ ( x ) = c ( θ θ ) h ( x ) exp ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ( θ θ ) T ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \ f_{\theta }(x)=c(\theta )\ h(x)\ \exp {\Bigl (}\ \pi \left(\theta \right)\ T\left(x\right)\ {\Bigr )}\ } has a monotone non-decreasing likelihood ratio in the sufficient statistic T ( x ) , {\displaystyle \ T(x)\ ,} provided that π π ( θ θ ) {\displaystyle \ \pi (\theta )\ } is non-decreasing.

Uniformly most powerful tests: The Karlin–Rubin theorem [ edit ] Monotone likelihood functions are used to construct uniformly most powerful tests , according to the Karlin–Rubin theorem .

[ 1 ] Consider a scalar measurement having a probability density function parameterized by a scalar parameter θ θ , {\displaystyle \ \theta \ ,} and define the likelihood ratio ℓ ℓ ( x ) = f θ θ 1 ( x ) f θ θ 0 ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \ \ell (x)={\frac {f_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}~.} If ℓ ℓ ( x ) {\displaystyle \ \ell (x)\ } is monotone non-decreasing, in x , {\displaystyle \ x\ ,} for any pair θ θ 1 ≥ ≥ θ θ 0 {\displaystyle \ \theta _{1}\geq \theta _{0}\ } (meaning that the greater x {\displaystyle \ x\ } is, the more likely H 1 {\displaystyle \ H_{1}\ } is), then the threshold test: φ φ ( x ) = { 1 if x > x 0 0 if x < x 0 {\displaystyle \ \varphi (x)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}x>x_{0}\\0&{\text{if }}x<x_{0}\end{cases}}\ } where x 0 {\displaystyle \ x_{0}\ } is chosen so that E ⁡ ⁡ { φ φ ( X ) | θ θ 0 } = α α {\displaystyle \ \operatorname {\mathbb {E} } {\bigl \{}\ \varphi (X)\ {\big |}\ \theta _{0}\ {\bigr \}}=\alpha \ } is the UMP test of size α α {\displaystyle \ \alpha \ } for testing H 0 : θ θ ≤ ≤ θ θ 0 {\displaystyle \ H_{0}\ :\ \theta \leq \theta _{0}~~} vs.

H 1 : θ θ > θ θ 0 .

{\displaystyle ~~H_{1}:\theta >\theta _{0}~.} Note that exactly the same test is also UMP for testing H 0 : θ θ = θ θ 0 {\displaystyle \ H_{0}\ :\ \theta =\theta _{0}~~} vs.

H 1 : θ θ > θ θ 0 .

{\displaystyle ~~H_{1}:\theta >\theta _{0}~.} Median unbiased estimation [ edit ] Monotone likelihood-functions are used to construct median-unbiased estimators , using methods specified by Johann Pfanzagl and others.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] One such procedure is an analogue of the Rao–Blackwell procedure for mean-unbiased estimators : The procedure holds for a smaller class of probability distributions than does the Rao–Blackwell procedure for mean-unbiased estimation but for a larger class of loss functions .

[ 3 ] : 713 Lifetime analysis: Survival analysis and reliability [ edit ] If a family of distributions f θ θ ( x ) {\displaystyle \ f_{\theta }(x)\ } has the monotone likelihood ratio property in T ( X ) , {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ ,} the family has monotone decreasing hazard rates in θ θ {\displaystyle \ \theta \ } (but not necessarily in T ( X ) {\displaystyle \ T(X)\ } ) the family exhibits the first-order (and hence second-order) stochastic dominance in x , {\displaystyle \ x\ ,} and the best Bayesian update of θ θ {\displaystyle \ \theta \ } is increasing in T ( X ) {\displaystyle T(X)} .

But not conversely: neither monotone hazard rates nor stochastic dominance imply the MLRP.

Proofs [ edit ] Let distribution family f θ θ {\displaystyle \ f_{\theta }\ } satisfy MLR in x , {\displaystyle \ x\ ,} so that for θ θ 1 > θ θ 0 {\displaystyle \ \theta _{1}>\theta _{0}\ } and x 1 > x 0 : {\displaystyle \ x_{1}>x_{0}\ :} f θ θ 1 ( x 1 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 1 ) ≥ ≥ f θ θ 1 ( x 0 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 0 ) , {\displaystyle \ {\frac {f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{1})}{\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{1})\ }}\geq {\frac {\ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{0})\ }{f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{0})}}\ ,} or equivalently: f θ θ 1 ( x 1 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 0 ) ≥ ≥ f θ θ 1 ( x 0 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{1})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{0})\geq f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{0})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{1})~.} Integrating this expression twice, we obtain: 1. To x 1 {\displaystyle \ x_{1}\ } with respect to x 0 {\displaystyle \ x_{0}\ } ∫ ∫ min X x 1 f θ θ 1 ( x 1 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 0 ) d x 0 ≥ ≥ ∫ ∫ min X x 1 f θ θ 1 ( x 0 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 1 ) d x 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\int _{\min X}^{x_{1}}\ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{1})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{0})\ \mathrm {d} x_{0}\\[6pt]\geq {}&\int _{\min X}^{x_{1}}\ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{0})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{1})\ \mathrm {d} x_{0}\end{aligned}}} integrate and rearrange to obtain f θ θ 1 ( x ) f θ θ 0 ( x ) ≥ ≥ F θ θ 1 ( x ) F θ θ 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {f_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}\geq {\frac {F_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ F_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}\ } 2. From x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} with respect to x 1 {\displaystyle \ x_{1}\ } ∫ ∫ x 0 max X f θ θ 1 ( x 1 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 0 ) d x 1 ≥ ≥ ∫ ∫ x 0 max X f θ θ 1 ( x 0 ) f θ θ 0 ( x 1 ) d x 1 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\int _{x_{0}}^{\max X}\ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{1})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{0})\ \mathrm {d} x_{1}\\[6pt]\geq {}&\int _{x_{0}}^{\max X}\ f_{\theta _{1}}(x_{0})\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x_{1})\ \mathrm {d} x_{1}\end{aligned}}} integrate and rearrange to obtain 1 − − F θ θ 1 ( x ) 1 − − F θ θ 0 ( x ) ≥ ≥ f θ θ 1 ( x ) f θ θ 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1-F_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ 1-F_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}\geq {\frac {f_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ f_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}\ } First-order stochastic dominance [ edit ] Combine the two inequalities above to get first-order dominance: F θ θ 1 ( x ) ≤ ≤ F θ θ 0 ( x ) ∀ ∀ x {\displaystyle F_{\theta _{1}}(x)\leq F_{\theta _{0}}(x)~\forall x\ } Monotone hazard rate [ edit ] Use only the second inequality above to get a monotone hazard rate: f θ θ 1 ( x ) 1 − − F θ θ 1 ( x ) ≤ ≤ f θ θ 0 ( x ) 1 − − F θ θ 0 ( x ) ∀ ∀ x {\displaystyle \ {\frac {f_{\theta _{1}}(x)}{\ 1-F_{\theta _{1}}(x)\ }}\leq {\frac {f_{\theta _{0}}(x)}{\ 1-F_{\theta _{0}}(x)\ }}~\forall x\ } Uses [ edit ] Economics [ edit ] The MLR is an important condition on the type distribution of agents in mechanism design and economics of information , where Paul Milgrom defined "favorableness" of signals (in terms of stochastic dominance) as a consequence of MLR.

[ 4 ] Most solutions to mechanism design models assume type distributions that satisfy the MLR to take advantage of solution methods that may be easier to apply and interpret.
